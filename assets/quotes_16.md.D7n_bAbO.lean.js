Patrick won the 1990 Great Lakes Colleges Association Award for this moving first novel, the year after Jane Hamilton won the same award for &quot;The Book of Ruth,&quot; a previous Oprah Book Club selection.&quot;Roxa&quot; is the story of the Culver family, set in mid-19th century, upstate New York. Their powerful story is told in the intense, passionate voices of each of the seven members of the Culver family and combines monologues, newspaper excerpts, journal entries, and poetry.In the midst of their day-to-day farmlife experiences, each of the Culvers painfully grapples with their interior struggles and personal tragedies, under the shadow of the Millenialist beliefs which were dominating their remote rural town.Although all of the Culvers' stories are richly told, Amelia Culver's coming-of-age really resonated for me.James Dickey is quoted on the back of the book: &quot;Roxa is a daring, go-for-broke experiment that works.&quot; For readers who like their books to touch their hearts and spirits, &quot;Roxa&quot; is a must!"},{"Title":"Rebel Waltz","review":"Kay Hooper writes with love about her characters. When you read this love story Banner and Rory jump off the page. Does Rory really see ghosts or is there something creepier going on."},{"Title":"Rebel Waltz","review":"Another reprint from author Kay Hooper. \\"Rebel Waltz\\" was originally published as a 'Loveswept' title in 1986. These two facts (date and publisher) should give you plenty of warning as to the tone and heat index of the book. I confess that I did enjoy it, but that was mostly because I was prepared for the tenor since I knew what I was getting into...Banner has finally accepted that her beloved antebellum home, Jasmine Hall, will be sold. That doesn't mean she has to like it though! It's where she was born, grew up, learned to love the ghosts who also reside there, and had hoped to live out her life. And when she meets the man her grandfather has selected as a possible buyer...well, he may be her dream man--and he may love Jasmine Hall--but how can she ever know which of them, her or her home, he loves most?Rory is amazed when he drives up and sees the lovingly restored and maintained Jasmine Hall and he falls a little in love with the estate. Then SHE opens the door and it only takes a few days for Rory to know that THIS woman and THIS home, ghosts and all, are where he's meant to live. But he knows he's facing a tall task...he must figure out a way to prove his love to Banner before he can have his dream...and even with a little ghostly assistance this may be more than is possible.Yes, it didn't take long to figure out the ending. Yes, the heat scale was fairly light. Yes, I could tell from attitudes and actions that this book was originally written over twenty years ago. But you know what? I still read it cover-to-cover without stopping. I still wanted to know exactly what the ghosts were going to do to help. And I was a little bummed that the ghosts didn't have a bigger part in the story. This is likely one of the 'lightest' paranormal elements book that Kay Hooper wrote. And it was just right for a sunny afternoon."},{"Title":"Rebel Waltz","review":"I've enjoyed Hooper's Bishop Triologies, but was disappointed in Rebel Waltz. It was all too predictable.

For example, there is a fold out section showing the route Jesus followed carrying his cross. It notes all of the details including where he fell, where certain icons are -- everything you could want to know. The Knopf Guide also will make a great souvenir of your trip.Contrary to what another writer has said here, this book certainly recognizes Israel. As the Lonely Planet guide points out, there is much in dispute about this area, and it's easy to offend one group or the other. Any attempt to present a balanced view of history and of the three religions which center their faith here must tread carefully with names and facts. The Knopf Guide excels in this area.I'd recommend picking up the Lonely Planet guide for details of accomodation and travel facts, but for the history, architecture, birds, animals, fish, sacredness, and gradeur of the area, this is definitely the book to get!"},{"Title":"Knopf Guide to The Holy Land","review":"My family and I recently returned from a trip to Israel. We found the Knopf guide an extremely valuable resource. The historical perspectives, maps, illustrations, photographs, and drawings enhanced our enjoyment of our trip by enabling us to focus and anticipate the key aspects of our travels. This guide shines above all the other guides by providing all the necessary practical travel information that you would expect from even the most basic of guides, but where it really excels is by presenting all this in a comprehensive and yet visually stimulating format. By seperating itineraries of The Holy Land into regions you are able to prepare for your trip well in advance and then enjoy the whole region, even if you didn't get to see all of the stops along the way. This is the only guide you need to take, save your money for souveniors"},{"Title":"Knopf Guide to The Holy Land","review":"This book is so good that when it was taken away from me at the Syrian border (for having Hebrew in it) I ordered another copy. The Holy Land is a wonderfully literate and detailed little book that could form the basis of a course at Oxford.You might also want to bring another guide that deals more with pedestrian, but very important, things like where to eat, shop and stay.

This book makes almost no mention of the country of Israel except in the fine print where the information is essential such as arrival information at Ben Gurion Airport in the back of the book. None of the maps mention Israel although Epypt, Jordan and Saudi Arabia are labeled. I could never trust such a biased book. Admittedly the book is very well illustrated like all the Knopf travel books. I found Frommer's &quot;Israel 2nd Edition&quot; to be more informative, trustworthy, objective and helpful. It is the Frommer's book that I am purchasing from Amazon and taking on my upcoming trip to Israel. The Knopf book I am returning to the library."},{"Title":"Charts of Christian Ethics (ZondervanCharts)","review":"The title of this book is \\"Charts of Christian Ethics\\". However, that is not really what this book is about. It is about the foundations of Ethics, philosophical, biblical, and theological. In addition, it is about Ethics proper & its History. To give you a feel of what you may find in the book, I will list out some items that you may find in its 5 different parts.In the Philosophical Foundations part, you will find in charts with items such as Modal Logic, A & B theories of time, causation, Linguistic Essentialism, Heidegger's Phenomenology, Realism, Antirealism and so on.In the Approaches to Ethics part, you will see items such as Graded Absolutism, Marxism, Internalist Moral Development, Deontology and so on.In the Biblical Foundations part, you will see such items as the Hermeneutic of Doubt, Structuralism, Creation Ethics and Cosmic Order, The Sermon on the Mount and so on.In the section on Theological Foundations, you will find such items as Creation, Augustine's Hierarchy of Thought, Marriage and Family and the Doctrine of Man.In the History of Ethics section you will find overviews of Philosophical Worldviews, Philosophers (Plato, W. Ockham, Rawls), Ethicists (e.g. Oliver O'Donovan, S. Hauerwas), and so on. In addition, you will find tables providing their basic though.My problems with the book:1. Not enough coverage of the ethical issues themselves: You may get the book thinking that you will find charts on say Abortion, Euthanasia, Divorce & Remarriage, Polygamy, Same-Sex marriage, etc., but you will find very very little on these. For example, in Chart 85, you will find two table items, one for Divorce and one for Remarriage and... and.. thats it. What about a chart on the Hillel and Shammai groups and their views? How about a chart covering the various passages related to this issue? Chart 78 contains a table for Abortion, a smaller one for Euthanasia, and 4 sentences under the section Life and Death Issues. ??? I guess that is it.2. Not enough coverage of Natural Law. (I think there should be at least 3 pages for this.)3. Not enough discussion of Bioethics and Sexual Ethics.4. Some mention of Business Ethics and what within the Bible shapes our understanding of it.4. It would also have been nice to see theological systems such as Arminianism, Moderate Calvinism, and Hypercalvinism discussed and how they result in different ethical views and practices. For example, did you know that, that Fred Phelps(godhatesfags) and his ilk are 5 point Calvinists? Why? How do they account for (IMO seriously erroneous) their ethical views? Likewise how do systems such as Covenant Theology, Dispensationalism, and New Covenant Theology affect ones understanding of certain ethical views? Does one system condone incest and the others not? How do continuity and discontinuity issues between the OT and NT affect Ethics?5. Other things that would have been good would have been the justice of Hell or perhaps Ex Opere Operati(/antis) - How does this issue affect ordination practices? Is it wrong for me to sit under a woman pastor? a heretic? Why? Why not? And what of issues that seem moral (and righteous) to some, amoral to others and immoral to yet others - perhaps say alcohol consumption or say exclusive psalmody?The book does not discuss such items. This book offers much more foundational material and much more philosophy than theology."},{"Title":"Charts of Christian Ethics (ZondervanCharts)","review":"When W. V. O. Quine (or van Quine as Hilary Putnam calls him) wrote a letter recommending Saul Kripke for an academic position, Quine referred to Kripke as a 'philosophical genius'. Well, Craig V. is a philosophical genius also.I highly recommend this book for Bible College students and seminary students. This book will help those who are illiterate with respect to Christian ethics understand the context in which Christian ethics function. All too often in Christian works a philosophical background is assumed by the authors and the reader is often befuddled. However, if one has Craig V's book by one's side, one can combat the befuddlement and hopefully understand what one reads.I'm sure if van Quine were alive he would enjoy this book as much as he enjoyed Hilary Putnam's martinis."},{"Title":"Charts of Christian Ethics (ZondervanCharts)","review":"This book is an excellent resource especially for those that are aspiring students of apologetics.This book helps teach the differences between a lot of the common apologetic terms."},{"Title":"Charts of Christian Ethics (ZondervanCharts)","review":"I bought this book for a class.

This one stood out. The authors have clearly walked the paths, stayed in the lodgings and eaten at many of the resturants they write about. Since they were bound to cover the entire area, it seemed I could tell when they had not actually been there, but these parts were few. Their style gives a really good feeling about a place, and the practical matters of sight seeing, hiking, biking, sleeping, eating and especially resting are well done. Not every place gets a good review; I especially liked the comments on what to miss. I found this all too often lacking in competing guides, that read more like they were edited by the local Chamber of Commerce. Another plus - Cagodan Provence was published this year, making it one of the most current available. My recommendation: If you're going, buy it.Disclosure: I've never met or heard of the authors or their book before finding it on Amazon."},{"Title":"Provence","review":"Having been to Provence about ten times in the last twenty years, I've read plenty of guides, and none have gone as directly to the heart of the matter as this one. There are plenty of posey guides out there, but if you want to know what makes the region tick, warts and all, I recommend Facaros and Pauls. The others seem shallow in comparison. And these guys make me laugh, an added bonus!"},{"Title":"Provence","review":"I've spent a lot of time with many Provence guidebooks and I recommend this one as one of the best. If you use Rick Steves or Lonely Planet, this is a good counterpoint. I wouldn't use just this guide for lodging or restaurants because the listings aren't extensive enough and the book isn't updated annually but the book has inspirational descriptions of the varied pleasures of Provence. The book does not cover the Cte d'Azur; another Cadogan guide by the same authors does. If I had to use just one book while traveling in Provence I would certainly consider this one."},{"Title":"Provence","review":"We loved Lazy Days in Provence, a guidebook to some great, largley off the beaten track, restaurants in Provence.

We left it at home and took Marc Fincham's Insight Guide to Provence instead.

The Miramar at La Ciotat (three stars, &quot;a classy, updated old hotel amid pine groves, by the beach&quot;) turned out to be a nicotine-saturated, dimly lit dive that charged our credit card before we arrived (we didn't stay). Pine groves? The hotel sits shadeless on an ugly stretch of tarmac. The &quot;pine groves&quot; were a few trees in the parking lot behind the hotel. There are many good guides to Provence; choose another."},{"Title":"Unpopular Culture","review":"As a student, the author was assigned to study a British retail bank on the understanding that when he was finished he would help the bank understand why morale there was so low. He was afraid it was going to be a boring assignment. Not a bit of it.Hoping to get an in-depth understanding of the source of the problem, he asked to be sent to the worst department, a back-office Securities Centre where people complained non-stop. They complained about the bureaucracy, the procedures, the head office, the branches, the IT department, the staff shortages, the computer system, the pay, the bonuses, and the furniture. They complained about the way people always complained. They rolled their eyes at the union representative and at the \\"Rah Rah\\" videos sent from head office.They sat gloomily while management explained why that quarter's huge profit was actually bad news that would mean that the hiring freeze would continue, if it didn't actually lead to layoffs. The bank's officers couldn't understand why the staff were always so negative.The employees seemed to have taken a shine to the amiable young American and freely confided their opinions about everybody and everything. In fact, they seem to have been a rather jolly group. They understood exactly how far they could go and what the rules and rituals of complaint were. They managed to complain ceaselessly, while ensuring that nobody ever felt complained about. They were kind and self-deprecating and often quite content with their jobs.In \\"Unpopular Culture\\", John Weeks examines the role of culture in an organization: how local cultures (such as that at the Securities Centre) relate to corporate culture. In particular, he observes how deliberate attempts to change the culture usually fail, while actual changes to the environment can have a profound effect.Despite the slightly frivolous art work on the cover of the book, this is a thoughtful ethnography. I first heard of it when Dr Weeks was interviewed on the BBC Radio \\"Thinking Aloud\\" program that is, as of this review, still available on the web and well worth listening to."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Westerns - A Heart For Any Fate: A Western Story","review":"With A Heart for Any Fate, Suzanne Lyon has drawn on the history, family stories and myths surrounding her fourth-great grandmother, Hannah Allison Cole, to tell a story of epic proportions...and to tell it with compassion, honesty of emotions and historic truths. The story opens with Hannah's marriage to William Temple Cole when she meets two people who are to have a strong impact on her life: his brother Stephen and their cousin Dolley Todd. Stephen is a frontiersman, constantly seeking game, adventure and the far vista; his returns to family are marked by his increasing attachment to his brother's wife. Dolley presents the young bride with a blank journal in what is to be their only meeting. Hannah uses the journal over the years to express her most secret desires and conflicts; through her entries, Dolley's life is also reflected as she becomes the First Lady of the Nation after her marriage to James Madison.The Coles start out married life in Virginia only to have the land on their homeplace go sour and productivity drop. With three children in tow, Temple responds to his brother's tales of the great Kentucky dream of sweet grass, fertile land, and good water. Hannah is saddened to leave her home and family but must go, in the fashion of the period, where her husband leads. Her slave girl Lucy, sullen and difficult on a good day, begs her to buy the father of her child but Hannah refuses. As the story develops, Lucy evolves as a companion and friend and Hannah, too.When Temple loses the claim in Kentucky after years of hard work and an ever-increasing family, there is no choice but to follow Stephen once again into the wilderness. This time it is Missouri that calls to the brothers. Long ennamored of Stephen, Hannah's younger sister Phoebe has finagled marriage to him, only to disrupt ties to their parents for both sisters. It is a miserable marriage that ends eventually in tragedy.The story is told against the wonderful expanse of western movement, the effects of the Lewis and Clark expedition, the War of 1812, the actions of the Indian leader Tecumseh and the uncanny prophecies of his brother,Indian unrest and violence, slavery and the advances into the far west.Lyon relates it all with fine attention to detail, the nuances of period language and custom and a deep understanding of her characters motivations, strengths and weaknesses. These are people whose struggles make for a tender and strong read; people with whom we can identify and come to care for deeply."},{"Title":"Five Star First Edition Westerns - A Heart For Any Fate: A Western Story","review":"Suzanne Lyon's A Heart for Any Fate paints a vivid picture of the life of Hannah Allison Cole, an ancestor of the author. Though a work of fiction, Lyon draws on her impressive frontier lore expertise to fill in missing pieces of this extraordinary woman's life. The story portrays the life of a young woman from her 1790 wedding day in Southwest Virginia to her 1843 death in Western Missouri.Although many facts are known of this remarkable woman, Lyon has given Hannah dimension through speculation based on research and woman's intuition. The author shows meticulous attention to the period's customs and attitudes.Sections of the story unfold in the journal Hannah keeps, written in the form of letters to her husband's cousin, Dolley, who later becomes the nation's first lady, Dolley Madison. Although the letters were never mailed, the journal brings to life woman-to-woman details of a strong marriage, but a marriage of challenge, heartbreak and fear.True to the time, Hannah follows her husband to migrate west, leaving her comfortable home and family to uncertainty and disasters, yet with hopes and joys. Hannah's brother-in-law marries her sister, and strained relationships fuel a turbulent attraction of forbidden love.Wonderfully vibrant, A Heart for Any Fate weaves our nation's early history into a story filled with emotion, hardship, and most of all, enduring love."},{"Title":"Swords And Hilt Weapons","review":"This is the most complete reference I have seen on the subject, rife with good photographs and superb research. Each chapter is written by a different person (experts I assume) and provides exceptional detail. It has sections on Bronze and Iron Age weapons; western weapons from Rome through WWII; Japanese swords; Indian weapons; and Chinese and Southeast Asian weapons; it even covers African weapons quite well. If you are starting a library of edged weapons, or already have one, this book must be in it!"},{"Title":"Swords And Hilt Weapons","review":"As a child I took weapons, swords, daggers, Sgian dubhs, dirks hanging on the wall as the norm for decor. My Grandfather's home was covered with this items that looked wonderful. As I grew I came to appreciate the beautiful and craftsmanship in weapons that dominated warfare for millenniums, until the coming of the more clumsy equaliser guns. Anyone can pick up a gun and fire it, but to use a sword with proficiency was something akinned to a ballet. Thrust, parry, block, defence and offence, from claymore to &eacute;p&eacute;es were breathtaking to watch, even more so was the feeling of hold these metal wonders in your hands. So it was not surprising I went on to collect swords. And this book satisfies that love of the weapon. With various contributors, they trace the earliest origins from stone area, bronze age and bronze age to the swords of World Wars I and II. It covers swords from the Middle East, the unsurpassed Japanese Samurai blades, Swords used in China and Central Asia, even into India, Africa and Pre-Conquest America.It is LOADED with colour pictures of the weapons, historical paintings showing them in use, even details spectrograms on the composition of the swords, how they were made, used from the most basic to the most ornamental dress swords. Every page just is simply amazing.Highly recommended any any sword collection, anyone interested in knowing more about these weapons that forged our history and especially of interest to historical writer and historical romance writers. An Absolute MUST for them."},{"Title":"Swords And Hilt Weapons","review":"This is one of the first books I bought when I started collecting arms and armour. The color photographs are detailed and of good quality, and there is a fairly good range of swords from European to Indian/oriental. I have found myself reaching for this book as a resource many times. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Swords And Hilt Weapons","review":"I own the 2000 reprint of the book. The text copyright is by Coe et.al 1989; compilation copyright is by Prion books 1996. Apparently it is a compilation, and it shows, which is why I call the book schizofrenic. It is very well illustrated, but in the text there are no references at all to the illustrations. Generally you'll find an illustration of the type of weapon discussed in the text nearby, but sometimes you'll have to page back or forth or it cannot be found. So text and images are really separate.I call the book myopic because of its focus on description of the appearance of the objects. There is almost nothing on metallurgy or materials science, forging, technical advances throughout history, fencing or tactical use, or the military or cultural circumstances why certain types have been preferred in a culture at some period of time (shape, length, straight or curved, one- or two-edged, piercing or cutting, etc.); only the chapter on Japanes swords touches upon some of these topics.Overall I found the book disappointing."},{"Title":"Swords And Hilt Weapons","review":"I'm an artist working with edged weapons to create welded steel sculptures. I found this book to be a great source of illustrations and background on the history of the sword. Getting a feel for the use of each sword as well as the period in time that it was created has inspired me to develop new forms and combinations of individual elements. This book can be enjoyed as a coffee table experience or on a deeper level as a valuable resource for historical reference.Jim[...]"},{"Title":"Zagat Survey 2002 Miami So. Florida Restaurants (Zagatsurvey : Miami, South Florida Restaurants, 2002)","review":"On my two week journey to Miami I used this guide as a supplemental fill-in guide to Frommer's South Florida. Broken into four regions: Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and the Keys, this Zagat Survey will save you time (and disappointment) by helping you select the best place to feast.I have used other Zagat Surveys for years and have found them to be up-to-date and reliable in their critical evaluation of a restaurant's food, ambiance and service. Scoring 1-30 in each category (food, decor, service), a restaurant's top score in each category can be 30. The \\"Chef Allen's\\" Restaurant (Miami) scored 27, 23, 25 . . . the highest score in Miami. The remaining restaurants in Miami have a flagship to follow. One of the most useful features is the guide's &quot;Top Rating&quot; sections: Top Food by Cuisine, Best Buys, Most Popular, Top Outdoor, Top Romantic, Top Views, etc.This is a very good pocket guide and, if there is a downside, it is the lack of maps. Of the four profiled areas, only Miami and Ft. Lauderdale get two small maps each, showing on the map the 40 most popular restaurants in each area. Another area that may disappoint some is the terse 50 word description for each restaurant, a brief narrative that fails to mention any outstanding restaurant dishes. If you are looking for a fuller restaurant description, for a few select South Florida restaurants, I commend to you \\"Frommer's South Florida\\" travel guide. This guide is best for those that live in Miami. That said, Zagat has been, and is, a great dining guide for these areas. Recommended!"},{"Title":"Impaired Judgement","review":"I'm a federal prosecutor with some knowledge of the book's topic. Either Compton was a lawyer or knows a lot of people in law enforcement, although the dust jacket doesn't say. I read the book on a vacation to the Carribean and really enjoyed it. I hope he comes up with another one this good the next time. Great courtroom scenes. The characters are a lot of fun, too."},{"Title":"Impaired Judgement","review":"The recently elected President of the United States Jim Candler knows he has big problems with the usual suspects, Congress, the Court, his party, and the media. However, all that is nothing compared to the problems caused by the First Lady in nearby Alexandria.President Candler's wife Paula is a Federal Judge whose current case involves gangster Tony Remalli, bagged by the FBI in a sure shot win for the prosecution. Tony's defense team, led by attorney Don Russ and abetted by investigator Julia Menendez finds a skeleton in the judge's past that could easily topple the presidency. Paula was apparently once at fault in a vehicular homicide in which she allegedly left the scene of the crime. The president's chief of dirty tricks Del Owens covered up the incident. Unless Tony is acquitted, the Candlers will hang alongside the mobster.IMPAIRED JUDGMENT is a fast-paced political thriller that at times seems more satirical than suspenseful due to the extreme behavior of the key charcaters. Jim is so politically naive one must wonder if he obtained the office through succession reaching a lower cabinet post. Del and Don are so sleazy that they turn into Claymation caricatures that leave the reader expecting their appearances on Deathmatch. Julia is so obsessed with finding dirt that readers will wonder if she was a gravedigger in a previous life. The First Lady is the most complete character due to her feistiness. However, her job leads to a constitutional question of whether her sitting on the bench violates the separation of powers. David Compton has written an exciting tale, but seems as if he could not decide between a thriller and a parody.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Impaired Judgement","review":"Excellent faced paced mystery/thriller.

(The cover says &quot;best-selling author&quot; so his previous book must have done pretty well.)Again, there are great female as well as male characters. The setting is primarily Washington, DC (my adopted home town), and I can tell Compton has really done his homework, or else lives somewhere nearby, because of the DC and courtroom scenes. I usually wait until the paperback comes out, but I'd highly recommend this legal/Mafia/political thriller to anyone able to appreciate the intricacies of a well-turned plot and memorable characters. I stayed up all night finishing it! Can't wait for more."},{"Title":"Impaired Judgement","review":"This is a great book, well-written, with a well-developed plot, and compelling characters.Just two minor bloopers -- the bed in the White House Lincoln Bedroom does not date back to Lincoln's presidency, and it's unlikely that a federal trial judge would rotate courtroom observers every 15 or 30 minutes during a trial. Courtroom attendance is usually first-come, first-served, with space reserved for press (which would probably be on a pool basis)."},{"Title":"Impaired Judgement","review":"What a treat! Usually I like to savor a book and take my time, but with this one, I just couldn't lay it down. Just when you think you have things figured out, the author gives the story a new twist.

I tried, I tried, I really tried. I even skipped around to various passages, hoping to find something that would convince me to read this book. I couldn't. There was ONE lovely snippet early on about camping with the dog that ignited a flicker of hope but that was it. His language is rambling and did not engage me. I can't ascribe this to the date of the novel, as much, much older books have held me captive despite difficult language and phraseology. Honestly, it was boring. The plot? Well, it started out with a man's journey back to the river of his childhood that was about to be dammed out of existence. I think although that was all I read, that's all you need to know.I can't ascribe my dislike of this book to my gender as I read more novels by males and abhor &quot;chick books&quot;. I suppose if you are local to that area, it holds some interest if you can work your way through the rambling language.

And although I've never been to that part of Texas, I feel as if I know Mr. Graves' stretch of the Brazos as well as the back of my hand. I have always felt guilty for never writing him a fan letter. He deserves as much credit as Wallace Stegner, Edward Abbey, John McPhee and all the rest or our naturalist philosophers for his beautiful prose and endlessly ruminative mind. I know that at least one reviewer found the book dull, and I have no capacity for empathy. In fact, I recently purchased, through Amazon, an autographed copy of the book with Mr. Graves' own photographs, for [$$]. If my son loves this book someday as much as I have, I'll consider my life a success. It is that good."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I first met John Graves in 1981 at a Texas Writers' Convention in Ft. Worth. I told him that I'd bought at least 30 copies of Goodbye (which was true), having lent or given outright some 29 previous copies. He autographed it, and wrote a prelogue thanking me for my good opinion of the book. Read it for yourself, and enjoy Texas history and the mind of a man who is attached to every feeder creek, low water crossing, or sweeping bend. This book is what the best and worst of Texas is all about. Read it, then come on down to the River, and catch some fish. I'll set you up with a canoe rental ..."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"With all the previous and excellent reviews for this wonderful book, I will only add brief personal comments:This was recommended to me for a Texas history course, but this is not merely the best history book I have come across, but this is the best book I have read bar none. If you read for self-discovery, history or for appreciation of good writing, then you will not leave this book on your shelf disappointed when you are done. You will, if you are like me, go and find your parents or your grandparents or both, hug them and say, \\"I never appreciated what you did and what you left behind for my generation. Thank you\\".And thank you, John Graves."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I carried a copy of this book with me while away from Texas, while in the US Army back in '71. Every time I would get terribly lonely for home and Texas, I would read this book. I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves history, Texas, nature, or rivers. I own several copies (five last count, as have given away half a dozen to good friends), and continue to re-read the book, as I always enjoy Mr. Graves' words, his history lessons, and his use of the English language. His imparting of the north Texas dialect is wonderful, as that dialect is the one in which I also was and am immersed. I have many other of Mr. Graves books, but GTAR is the first you should read! By the way, I also went to Boy Scout Camp at Worth Ranch on the Brazos as many boys did during the mid 50s, boated and canoed and fished on the Brazos, or the Brazos de Dios, the Arms of God. The sweet smell of oak and cedar, of campfires on river islands, the sounds of water rushing down river, the taste of fresh catfish fried up in a campfire...the bald eagles and deer, the ghosts of \\"The People\\" and early settlers....the best times.."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I was very impressed with this book. Graves does so much in this enjoyable volume. As he takes a canoe trip down the Brazos near where he grew up, he shares the history of the land--both recent and not-so-recent. Through him, we learn the reality of life for the average settler on the edge of the frontier. He also seems to be detailing a life that in his time was declining and in our age is nearly completely gone. His writing is difficult to describe and unlike anything I have ever read. It flows smoothly with a combination of regional speech and erudition. As you read you feel like you are in the canoe with an incomparable guide to this region of our state. A great book that deserves to be read much more widely than it is."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I live 25 miles from the spot on the Brazos river where John Graves begins his tale. I have floated this section of the river many times. Reading this book before making the trip makes the float immeasurably more interesting. Each time you come to a certain spot or bend in the river, you recall the tale the author related about the history surrounding that particular spot. This is a great book for anyone who has ever floated or would like to float this section of the Brazos river."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"A great story that incorporates history, the outdoors, and philosophy. With the rugged country of the upper Brazos river as his backdrop, Graves takes you on an enjoyable journey that you hope will never end. You hear tales of the &quot;Old West&quot; and modern Texas as well. Graves' thoughts as he travels alone on the Brazos are classic for their insight and humor. I highly reccomend this book to all Texans, or anyone who wants to feel like a Texan for a while. I'm buying another Graves book soon."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I was only a few pages into this book when I realized that I was reading a person who was the real thing. John Graves is a master wordsmith, a thinker, and a person who has the background and experiences to address the subject. As a former Marine and a native Texan, I admit that I might have identified with him a bit more strongly than some, but there is no question that his prose is from a gifted and talented pen. I have experienced part of the trip he described (the first couple of days...spectacular sandstone bluffs and all...)so it made the read more enjoyable and absorbing for me. The book I read was borrowed, so naturally, I have to have my own copy as well as other of his efforts."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I went to YMCA and Scout camp in the Palo Pinto country. Back then, the divide that exists today between the so-called \\"cultural elite\\" and rural Texas didn't exist (or at least both sides respected each other enough to be civil, as a funny episode from the book relates), and Graves lived in both worlds. His is a lost generation, and although only one or two of the dams along his route got built, the country is now part of the vast exurb of Dallas-Fort Worth, filled with rural retreats for the city folk, 5 acre ranchettes, and driveways lined with 40-thousand-dollar pickup trucks. Graves doesn't mourn its loss, but commemorates what seemed like \\"progress\\" in the 60s and has only accelerated thousandfold since. If you pass through that country, or want to know what rural Texas used to be like, read this book. It's a bit long in the telling, but if you trace the journey on a map, it was no small trip."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"As a Texan, I found this book to be a wonderful heartfelt tribute to Mr. Graves love of the Brazos River which included a lot of local history. I formerly lived in that area and have also canoed on the river and so I enjoyed his thoughts very much. I now live in the Hill Country and he wrote a book called &quot;From A Limestone Ledge&quot; that deals with his ruminations on life in our area! It is a pretty good one too! I agree that sometimes he gets a little &quot;wordy&quot; but I think it is still worth reading!"},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"Vivid history & beautifully written reminiscences--Graves' love for the river is evident in every passage."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"Unitl recently, Texas was a state that drew its strength from the land, whether from the East Texas cotton and oil or the West Texas cattle and oil. John Graves recognizes this by skillfully weaving this story of the land through the people who conquered it. On his canoe trip down the Brazos, he looks at the land with a fond lonelieness for what it once was, stirring emotions in all Texans who have left the rural ways of our predecessors. Noone can speak of knowing Texas without reading this book."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"For those of you who love the Brazos river this is a must have book.

Exellent story line of a river being dammed up but a dissjointed narative that doesn't peak my interest. Many people liked this book but I didn't care for it. I live in the area where this story takes place so it did have some interesting stories of the Indians in the area."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"One footnote for the lovers of this book: Some of the proposed dams were never built. I canoed a couple of the sections of the river in 1982 or so, and just recently re-read the book, so I was curious and did a quick check on Google Earth. It is clear on Google Earth that only one dam was built on the entire length described by Graves and shown on his map -- the one just below Granbury, creating Lake Granbury. So most of the river described is still there, waiting for you to enjoy."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I really can't say enough good things about what John Graves has done with this book, \\"Goodbye to a River.\\" Published in 1960 it still lives and breathes in relevance today and Graves' observations about city life compared to country life, the rich interwoven anachronistic stories of a river, and conservationsism versus capitalism's use on the environment still resonate in 2011. I suspect this issues and the river Brazos will live into this century. Much as Graves' book will still gain and hold readership. It's timeless and poetic.I came to this book as part of a book club, the DFW Literary Society. It was a pick by my Mother who grew up in Ranger, Texas not too far from the origins of John Graves journey on the Brazos river. Graves felt the need to embark on a 4 week adventure float to say goodbye to the condition of the Brazos pre- plans to dam up several sections as it meanders its way from the headwaters in New Mexico through Lubbock and on to the Gulf of Mexico. After Graves wrote this, some of those dams have gone in...Lake Grandbury and some of them have not. What we are left with is a truly unique work of fiction as Graves blends poetry with a wilderness of sorts adventure with regional history with a philosopical view of the people that inhabit and are drawn to the river. Quite simply put, the book is fascinating.Graves goes out with a canoe, a weiner dog only referred to as 'the passenger', some supplies, fishing rods, a gun or two...and lives off the river and small convenience stores he finds along the way. His semi-stream of consciousness style may take some intial getting used to but the poetry of the language he uses draws you in. He stays with locals along the way seeking out those in the know about the river's history and weaves those tales in with historical events between the Comanches and the settlers in the exact places he visits. I'm not sure there's another book like it.If you are a Texan, 'Goodbye to a River\\" is a must read. If you have ties to West Texas...even more so. If you love nature and are halfway concerned that it is preserved in a responsible way, also, you must read this. If you don't fall in those categories, I'd recommend you too read it as there is so much richness in language and place in this book. There are so many good quotes to choose from that I'll try to pick out a representative few, \\"If a man couldn't escape what he came from, we would most of us still be peasants in Old World hovels. But, if, having escaped or not, he wants in some way to know himself, define himself, and tries to do it without taking into account the thing he came from, he is writing without any ink in his pen. The provincial who cultivates only his roots is in peril, potato-like, of becoming more root than plant. The man who cuts his roots away and denies that they were ever connected with him withers into half a man.\\"And another, \\"Neither a land nor a people ever starts over clean. Country is compact of all its past disasters and strokes of luck-of flood and drouth, of the caprices of glaciers and sea winds, of misuse and disuse and greed and ignorance and wisdom-and though you may doze away the cedar and coax back the bluestem and mesquite grass and side-oats grama, you're not going to manhandle it into anything entirely new. It's limited by what it has been, by what's happened to it. And a people, until that time when it's uprooted and scattered and so mixed with other peoples that it has in fact perished, is much the same in this as land. It inherits.\\"What are you waiting for? Get this book and read it and find somebody to talk to about it. You'll want to do something equally crazy like floating down the slow almost dead water stretches of the Brazos in November or just to get out among the great outdoors and see what thoughts float up. Maybe you'll even want to write about it. The power of a book, \\"Goodbye to a River,\\" has it. Read it. --mmw"},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"This is one of the most beautifully written books I've ever read. It is funny, provocative, and sad.

This book should be required reading in schools, not only in Texas, but though out the U.S."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"An astonishing book, by an extraordinary writer, and more importantly, an extraordinary human being. The book assumes the form of a narrative of the author's three week solo canoe trip down the Brazos, a river about one hour by speeding car west of Ft. Worth, Texas; the journey was taken \\"way down in the fall,\\" in late November, 1959, when the northerners begin to howl, and bring snow. By most estimations, it is not much of a river, and even the author says: \\"...on a salty river unloved, unlovable except by a few loners and ranchers and cedar-hill misanthropes.\\" Graves gives only glimpses into his background, and if you blink, you might miss them. But consider, here is a man who has read Joyce's \\"Ulysses,\\" and recalls that Leopold Bloom's father had slept with his dog, Athos, in order to cure the father's aches and pains, just as Graves was carrying a six-month-old dachshund he routinely refers to as \\"the passenger,\\" for his own comfort. But Graves is equally well-grounded in the natural world, knows all the various types of trees, how they burn, and the appearance of the wood's grain, and that: \\"the white oaks are prime...one of the finest of aromatic fuels is a twisted, wave-grained branch of live oak...\\" Graves was a Marine Captain during World War II, wounded on Saipan, but again the reader only gets the slightest glimpse of that in one passage in which that perspective is used to reflect on the casualties of this countryside during the frontier days: \\"I once saw 4,000 Japanese stacked like cordwood, the harvest of two days' fighting, on one single islet on one single atoll awaiting bulldozer burial, more dead that the Brazos could show for its whole two or three decades of travail...\\" Graves has traveled as well, slight glimpses of which are permitted in \\"I'm familiar with the washed silent streets of Manhattan at five o'clock in the morning...\\" and \\"...did see dawn wash the top of the old wall at Avila...\\" and it was almost certainly there that he watched a man carve out a pair of wooden clogs with an ax, in fifteen minutes; a skill now permanently lost. An aspect of his life we are not afforded even the slightest glimpse are those that might be characterized, with a bit of leniency, as his \\"women problems,\\" and thus why he might be alone. In anticipation of that conversational gamut, he rebukes us all: \\"Few people are willing to believe that a piece of country, hunted and fished and roamed over, felt and remembered, can be company enough.\\"Graves wrings so much meaning, and numerous stories, just like Faulkner has done before him, about a similarly \\"postage-stamp size\\" part of America; in the formers' case it is the upper-middle Brazos river, maybe only a twentieth of its total length. He knows the history of the area well, particularly as it was settled during the frontier days, and one tectonic plate overwhelmed the one that had been there the longer, represented by \\"The People,\\" the Comanche's, the \\"Lords of the Plain,\\" and the Kiowas. He weaves some beautiful vignettes from that period into his journey, with my favorite being the hanging of Cooney Mitchell; but there are numerous other memorable ones, including the smoking out of the recluse, Sam Sowell, from his shack. Graves teases the reader at the end, indicating that there is \\"No room...\\" for so many other tales that he has left untold.The central theme is the river itself, and his farewell to it. At the beginning he describes his \\"enraged awe\\" when learning that it would shortly not exist, at least as he knew it, since it was being damned at several locations. Graves is one of the best naturalist writers extant, describing with love how the land lays \\"this way and that,\\" and the wildlife along the way, some of which he kills for his food. He is inspired by Thoreau, whom he repeatedly calls \\"St. Henry.\\" At the end, he questions whether it is all \\"a lament,\\" but overall, you get the sense of acceptance; that things change, and this is one more, as so many residents flee to the factories of Fort Worth, Dallas, and Detroit. And how many nature writers, traveling down a river, sleeping in skewed tents, and eating squirrels, could wryly reflect on his existence through the prism of Veblen's \\"The Theory of the Leisure Class\\"?Grave's book is chock full of philosophical takeaways, that should last me a long time, if not forever. I've traveled over the Brazos, about eight times in my life, each time I was going between 70, and hopefully 80 mph, trying to get out of Texas before nightfall. Thus, Graves rebuke stung: \\"The hard thing is to get slowed down.\\" A more ironic thought recently resonated, when I was traveling with my wife to Death Valley. She said, of a road 30 miles to the east of DV: \\"We've been on this road before.\\" And she was right: it was so like some other road we had previously traveled down in a desert landscape. I had to chuckle, because I assured her that it was quite impossible, but I shared with her one of Graves' insights: \\"On the fringes of the middle age and after, the d&eacute;ja-vu is likely not to be illusory.\\" Even less so, considerably beyond such a fringe!Graves is one of the wonderful members of the exclusive 6-star read club."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"As a native Texan, I grew up with the stories of the wild frontier and I'm sure that Graves did too. But he takes those stories and, with beautiful prose, shows the really hardscrabble life that folks overcame on the edge of the frontier. Not the stories of Texas Rangers, but of ordinary pioneers who made a life for themselves despite drought, snowstorms and other natural disasters. But the book is also a wonderful \\"painting\\" of a part of Texas that is rich in history and natural beauty. A must-read for anyone who wants to know what Texas was like before the arrival of air conditioning and the discovery of oil."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I lived in Texas for 8 years and have seen the Brazos and the alligators and armadillos on its banks (although the Brazos that I saw was the section close to its mouth to the gulf and not the part that's described in this book). I have left Texas for a while now. On a recent trip back to Austin, I picked up this book in a local bookstore and I am glad I did.In this book Graves blends travelogue, history, folklore and personal reflections in a highly readable account. It is personal, anecdotal, sentimental, but not overly melancholy. The language is relaxed, yet well crafted, it gives you the feel of an intimate dialog, but the author also has tight control over what he chooses to say instead of rambling to endless tedium. The conversations, though few, carry the authentic flavor of western Texas, and as other reviewers alluded to, remind one of Steinbeck's writing. In a sense Graves was the last link to that frontier era -- although he was too late himself for the bygone days, he looked backward into those days, and personally talked to people who were its last ruminants. Even this book was written nearly 50 years ago now. Today we can get some glimpses of replicas and trinkets from museums, souvenir shops and Hollywood movies, but to get a real feel, one has to resort to books like this one.

Contrary to what Mark@zombie.com wrote in a review I otherwise second, the book does not take Graves all the way to the Gulf but stops well short of there, at Lake Whitney. (It begins at the foot of the Possum Kingdom Lake dam in Palo Pinto county.) Along his canoe trip, accompanied by his nameless &quot;companion,&quot; a dog, Graves relates anecdotes he heard as a Fort Worth boy who grew up along the river, including much Indian and pioneer lore; he also imparts much knowledge of native flora and fauna and geology. His philosophical musings are compelling if sometimes longwinded. Some may find the prose stilted at times, but the overall feel of the book's prose is elegiac, nostaligiac, and autumnal"},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"I've read the hard-cover version of this book four times, and each reading makes me appreciate the fascinating, well-written narrative even more. As a young man in the early 1970s, I often canoed a section of the Brazos River, creating cherished memories of fishing, hunting and camping -- memories enhanced by John Graves' account of his similar adventures. Would love to have the Kindle edition, but at $12 it is overpriced -- like so many other titles that are part of the ebook price-fixing scheme involving Random House and other greedy publishers."},{"Title":"Goodbye to a River: a Narrative","review":"A slow, meandering story about a slow, meandering journey--a trip a man makes in a canoe down the river of his childhood (The Brazos in Texas) before it was dammed up and was no more.It is--or can be--a slow, meandering read, but the joy of this book--and there is a lot to enjoy--comes from the meandering---as the man, author John Graves, recounts the history, legend and lore that took place along the banks of his beloved river,at places and sites he is seeing for the last time--Indian stories and pioneer stories, some shocking in their horror, some inspiring, some humorous, and always, always, interesting.Join him on his trip.

On the title of the book, Kael says she it on an Italian poster and is perhaps the briefest statement imaginable of the basic appeal of movies. &quot;This appeal is what attracts us, and ultimately what makes us despair when we begin to understand how seldom movies are more than this&quot;. In this volume her raves include a 17 page study of Bonnie and Clyde, Persona, Falstaff, Band of Outsiders, Masculine Feminine, Laurence Olivier as Othello, and Boudou Saved from Drowning though made in France in 1931 was only released in the United States in 1967. Her pans Blow-Up, Madame X, Hawaii, Darling, Ship of Fools, and her infamous review of The Sound of Music which lost her a job. She also includes essays on The Creative Business, Godard and the Movie Brutalists, an exhaustive The Making of The Group covering 33 pages, suggested movies for children, and studies of the careers of Brando, Orson Welles and Stanley Kramer. A few amusing quotes. After the first few minutes of Grand Prix, my companion said Now you know what it's like to be run over. You don't go to this movie, it comes after you. Pasolini's The Gospel According to st Matthew was so static that I could hardly wait for that loathsome prissy young man to get crucified. In The Bible God couldn't have had much much of a sense of humour if he went to the trouble of destroying the posing prancing faggots of Sodom. And, the process shots in Fantastic Voyage are so clumsliy mated with the figures that the actors look as if a child has cut them out with blunt scissors."},{"Title":"New China","review":"Although China's vast population makes it almost impossible to encapsulate their experiences within one tome, Massonnet makes a brave attempt. He uses the fate of four Chinese citizens and their friends and families to infuse the vibrancy of modern China, warts and all, into his pages. In modern China, money is king, lord and master of all and the author, through his four John Does, paints an image of a nation obsessed with it. In modern China, economic progress and human misery are being achieved on scales unprecedented in human history.Scale is usually what defeats most books on modern China. And Massonnet captures that scale - and the human poignancy beneath it. Tens of millions of peasants are deserting the villages and trekking to Beijing, Shanghai and the other modern Klondykes of the People's Republic. The trains, buses and roads teem with these ordinary Chinese people flocking into the cities in search of money, China's new god. Instead of the crock of gold, most of them are finding misery on scales they could never have imagined possible.The author deftly paints in the human misery of these unsung masses. He tells of peasant girls forced into prostitution almost as a matter of course, of unskilled laborers defrauded of their wages, of the petty corruption practices of the police and party officials, of the sheer struggle of most Chinese people just to eke out a subsistence living. He tells of hospitals where infant mortality rates exceed 70%, and, bizarre as it seems, where the only piece of modern equipment is a karaoke machine. He tells us that China has 180 million illiterates, that its educational system totters on the verge of collapse and that elite private schools are growing to cater to those who have struck it rich. It is a country in flux.And the poor are being overwhelmed by the swell. Because they are poor, they are forced to drown their sorrows in fake whiskies and seek solace for their ailments in fake medicines. In a land where even the most primitive health care is a luxury, they pay a terrible price for this. Just as the alcohol often makes them go blind, so also do the quack medicines destroy their health in the new, uncaring China. These tens of millions of ordinary victims are the pebble stones along the road to making China a world economic power.Times are changing. The few barefoot movie projectionists of Mao's cultural revolution, who remain loyal to the Party, are churning out politically correct cartoons, which explain the Party's glorious past to China's children. The kids despise these shows and watch imported apolitical Japanese cartoons instead. These children, even more so than their elders, are caught up in the consumption craze sweeping the country. They are, in fact, often conspicuous consumption personified. Because their cash rich parents and grandparents pamper them, they are often obese to a worrying degree.Not that their Communist Party leaders worry about such minor things. Their chief concern is to protect their political turf - and the kudos it brings. To protect their ideological monopoly, they harass those who seek an opiate from life's daily grind in religion. The Party's harassment of all forms of ideological dissent is the main cancer that gnaws at modern Chinese society. The masses have now thrown off the shackles of Marxism and want to have a bit of fun. The upwardly mobile want to drink cold beers, use clean toilets, and get invited to white weddings. In short, they want to have a life and, though many of their goals might seem venal, crass and petty to us, they are very understandable in a country, where the Communist Party repressed all forms of individualism since 1949.The Chinese, Massonnet points out, are just like the rest of us. They want to enjoy life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. The people want freedom, the Party wants power. The people, whenever possible, vote with their feet. Some 75% of Chinese students, who get to study overseas, never return to the Middle Kingdom when they graduate. Instead, they pursue the capitalist dream abroad - in America, Japan or Australia. Those who remain at home also have a dream, a dream that, one day, they too will live in freedom, free at last from the shackles of the Communist Party. Although that dream is still some way off, Massonnet, who was Agence France-Presse's Beijing correspondent for many years, is to be congratulated for bringing it to our attention."},{"Title":"New China","review":"I have read this book on my way back from China. This book explores the changes affecting China and the Chinese people as a whole. Cleverly written, it describes the period that encompassed the change in political structure of China from a communist country to a market-economy country. The stories of the Chinese people included serves well in explaining the Chinese mentality as the quest for the new Chinese dream , money ( getting rich ) began. Interesting read for all those who plan to travel to China or deal with Chinese people."},{"Title":"Lyme Disease and the SS Elbrus","review":"When I read the Amazon \\"Product Description\\" of Rachel Verdon's book, I almost fell out of my chair laughing. However, I realized that most people do not do what I do, that is, take even things I agree with \\"with a grain of salt,\\" and do some further research, e.g. check out some of the references. In other words, I never accept one or two sources, whether books and/or articles, as gospel until doing further investigation of my own, unless, of course, in an area wherein I enjoy some expertise. As a retired epidemiologist reading about the history of various infectious diseases is second nature to me.From \\"Click to Look Inside\\" I could read what appears to be the first 4 pages of the book. On the first page Verdon writes: \\"One of the most intense biographies on Georg Friedrich Nicolai was written by a serologist and pediatrician, Wolf Suelzer; \`The Nicolai Case,' Wayne State University Press, 1982. It speaks for itself.\\" Verdon goes on to write: \\"Nicolai and Einstein co-authored \`The Biology of War,' in 1918. Einstein contributed the introductory \`Manifesto,' which had been signed by a score of German scientist, excusing Germany for starting World War 1.\\"I found a copy on the web of \\"The Biology of War\\" by Dr. G.F. Nicolai (New York: The Century Company, 1918), free for downloading (http://www.archive.org/details/biologyofwar00nicouoft) and as it was not available at any local library, I purchase through Amazon a copy of Suelzer's biography of Nicolai. It may be available at libraries in other communities.Verdon writes that Suelzer's biography of Nicolai \\"speaks for herself.\\" She writes: \\"The history of the Communist-Fascist alliance in biological warfare begins with Albert Einstein and his BEST BUDDY [my emphasis] Dr. Georg Friedrich Nicolai.\\" So what does Suelzer write? \\"The relationship between Einstein and Nicolai was the comradeship of two men fighting for the same cause [which was Pacifism], RATHER THAN A PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP [my emphasis]. [Einstein] took a tolerant, slightly amused, but always sympathetic view of Nicolai's quixotic character.\\" (pp 197 - 198). In a biography of 443 pages, this is all that Suelzer writes about the relationship between these BEST BUDDIES (according to Vernon). In a biography of Einstein, Nicolai, his BEST BUDDY (according to Vernon) is mentioned once in conjunction with the Manifesto to Europeans (Michael White and John Gribbin. \\"Einstein: A Life in Science,\\" Penguin Books, 1993, page. 119). One might consider the exaggeration of their relationship as poetic license except that she claims it to be the starting point for the \\"Communist-Fascist alliance in biological warfare.\\"Verdon states that \\"Nicolai and Einstein co-authored \`The Biology of War,' in 1918. Einstein contributed the introductory \`Manifesto,' which had been signed by a score of German scientist, excusing Germany for starting World War 1.\\" [I encourage the reader to actually download the Biology of War. There is a box where one can type in any page number and it goes directly to the page except for the Introductory pages that use Roman Numerals. In this case, to the left of the box are two blue arrows for rapidly getting to any of these pages] First, the \\"Biology of War\\" was written solely by Nicolai (not just from the title page; but from Suelzer's biography). As for the \\"\`Manifesto,' which had been signed by a score of German scientist, excusing Germany for starting World War 1,\\" the Manifesto was actually signed by 93 of Germany's leading intellectuals, including scientists, artists, theologians, etc; but NOT by either Einstein or Nicolai. In fact Nicolai begins his book \\"The Biology of War\\" with \\"the outward and visible cause why this book was written was the manifesto to the civilized world published in the early days of October, 1914, by ninety-three representatives of German science and art (page IX).\\"Nicolai then goes on to reproduce the Manifesto in its entirety, adding footnotes where appropriate. For instance, section 2 reads: \\"IT IS NOT TRUE THAT WE CRIMINALLY VIOLATED BELGIAN NEUTRALITY. It can be proved that France and England had resolved to violate it, and it can be proved that Belgium had agreed to this. It would have been suicidal not to have anticipated them.i\\"Nicolai's footnote actually shows the above to be a lie:i On August 14, 1914, Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, then GermanChancellor, said in the Reichstag: \\"Gentlemen, we stand now perforceon guard. Necessity knows no law. Our troops have occupied Luxemburg,possibly trodden Belgian soil. Gentlemen, this is contrary to international law. ... In this way we have been forced to override the justifiable protests of the Belgian and Luxemburg governments. We shall repair the injustice which we are committing as soon as our military object is attained/' (page XI)Nicolai and Einstein did co-author the \\"Manifesto to Europeans,\\" which was meant as a response/critique of the original Manifesto. Unfortunately, with only three signatures and war fervor at its height, it met with deaf ears.From the publisher's description, it is obvious that Vernon believes Lyme disease an outbreak of something new, especially in North America. Thus she weaves a convoluted, complex, incredible conspiracy theory. From the publisher \\"How do we solve this Communist plot to destroy America from within, using diseases of the nervous system?\\" Of course there is a simpler explanation for Lyme Disease.Lyme Disease has been around for a long time; but due to a more sporadic appearance, was not thought to be an infectious disease; but instead was given various labels such as \\"juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.\\" As we moved out to the suburbs, living ever closer to nature, more and more Americans came in contact with the tick-borne disease until when a cluster was noticed, an investigation began, looking into the possibility of an infectious disease and so Lyme Disease was \\"discovered,\\" more accurately relabeled. From Wikipedia's article on Lyme Disease:\\"Before 1976, elements of B. burgdorferi sensu lato infection were called or known as tickborne meningopolyneuritis, Garin-Bujadoux syndrome, Bannworth syndrome, Afzelius syndrome, Montauk Knee or sheep tick fever. Since 1976 the disease is most often referred to as Lyme disease, Lyme borreliosis or simply borreliosis.The full syndrome now known as Lyme disease was not recognized until a cluster of cases originally thought to be juvenile rheumatoid arthritis was identified in three towns in southeastern Connecticut in 1975, including the towns Lyme and Old Lyme, which gave the disease its popular name. This was investigated by physicians David Snydman and Allen Steere of the Epidemic Intelligence Service, and by others from Yale University.Urbanization and other anthropogenic factors can be implicated in the spread of Lyme disease to humans. In many areas, expansion of suburban neighborhoods has led to the gradual deforestation of surrounding wooded areas and increasing border contact between humans and tick-dense areas. Human expansion has also resulted in a gradual reduction of the predators that normally hunt deer as well as mice, chipmunks and other small rodents - the primary reservoirs for Lyme disease. As a consequence of increased human contact with host and vector, the likelihood of transmission to Lyme residents has greatly increased.\\"Vernon has taken umbrage with my referring to an article in Wikipedia which she does not consider a reliable source for knowledge. What she failed to notice is the long list of references following the article, many of which could be accessed on the web, and many from well-respected peer-reviewed journals. In any case, as I revise this review I will give direct quotes from books and peer-reviewed journal articles, complete with detailed references, and, when available on the web, the URLs.It is also a bit of a stretch to claim her book as published by the usual meaning of the word. The author, Rachel Verdon, paid to have it published. From Elderberry Press: \\"How much does your service cost? Our fees haven't increased in more than five years and are about what you would pay for printing 1000 books at a local print shop. Adult books: $3900 plus 2 per word all inclusive. Payable in three convenient, safe installments.\\" I checked our public libraries and local university libraries; but not a single copy was available. And none of our local bookstores have a copy on their shelves.So why, though retired with time to spare, would I spend so much time reviewing a book whose author paid to have it published and will probably sell few copies? The old saying is \\"A Lie Travels Around the World Before the Truth Gets Its Boots On!\\" I have noticed on the web people citing talk shows, books and articles, not just a few, but dozens even hundreds of blogs, without checking whether they are disseminating the truth or someone else's lies or misinterpretations. Unfortunately, once people have done this, their self-esteem seldom allows them to accept they have been duped. And lies and misinterpretations have consequences. In a democracy people vote and votes depend on peoples' knowledge and opinions. To read more on how people often form opinions that they believe were arrived at from careful deliberation; but weren't see Thomas Gilovich's fascinating book \\"How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life,\\" Free Press, 1991, and Michael Shermer's book, \\"Why People Believe Weird Things,\\" (especially Chapter 3 \\"How Thinking Goes Wrong\\"), MJF Books, 1997 [note there is a second edition out]. See also Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson. \\"Mistakes Were Made (but not by me),\\" Harcourt, 2007.From Vernon's comments on health care blogs and just the first few pages of her book, it is obvious that her goal is to infect others with her rigid ideological paranoid delusions, something I find alarming. Below I give just one comment Vernon placed on an Amazon blog which clearly demonstrates her mindset. The quote is from the Amazon blog entitled \\"Should we have free healthcare in the U.S. (and is it possible?) [Please note that the blog's title was a poor choice as there is and never will be free healthcare; but many nations in the world provide some form of universal non-profit health care for all their residents, providing good quality at far less cost than we do. The health care is free at the point of delivery, see Joel A. Harrison. \\"Response to DON\\"T FIX WHAT ISN'T BROKEN,\\" East County Magazine, June 21, 2009, http://www.eastcountymagazine.org/?q=node/1429]In any case, I asked her if she had ever actually studied any of the health care systems of such Western Industrialized Democracies as France, Germany, Sweden, or Canada. Below is her reply:In reply to your post on Jul 12, 2009 3:37 PM PDTRachel Verdon says:Harrison, You write: \\"a sane person would logically.. study healthcare systems work around the world\\" Good point. Have you reviewed Solzhenitsyn's \\"Cancer Ward\\" or \\"The U.S. Government vs. Karl Kratch\\" in the Nuremberg Trails recently?In other words, Verdon somehow believes that the modern Western Industrialized Democracies of France, Germany, Sweden, and Canada resemble the Soviet Union under Stalin during the 1930s and Nazi Germany. Need I say more?I will be revising this review after reading additional books and articles related to it, including a couple of biographies of Einstein, and books and articles on Lyme Disease."},{"Title":"Lyme Disease and the SS Elbrus","review":"...Anyway...There's a number of strange diseases, like lyme disease, SARs, AIDS, and many others.... that seemingly mutate out of nowhere. Many vaccine programs are also suspected to have caused epidemics, especially in third world countries where the immune system is already degraded from poor diet and poor drinking water. The truth of the matter is, nazi Germany, the Soviet Union, and America, designed thousands of war machine microbes. It would be naive to NOT suspect that some of these microbes escaped into the population. Verden offers an interesting theory considering we will never know the truth about the secret programs of the 3 most hideous war machines in history."},{"Title":"Lyme Disease and the SS Elbrus","review":"For people like me who lived a few months as a translator for Prensa Latina in Cuba the second half of the year 1960 under Castro, this book is a loud reminder of the necessity of constant \\"vigilance\\" in countries where governments grow too powerful and out of control as it happened in Germany under Hitler as well as in the Soviet Union and has been progressively happening in this country and, I fear, will reach full fruition if Obamacare is allowed to be installed.It is indeed refreshing that an author like Rachel Verdon dedicated so much time to research, investigate and then write this well documented work which sheds such defined light into the nefarious doings of those repressive regimes which she so well understands.I only hope that her book will be widely read and that our legislators will be very \\"vigilant\\", and fully protect the freedoms that we still enjoy, including our right to choose our healthcare."},{"Title":"Lyme Disease and the SS Elbrus","review":"The author of this book claims just about everything in the world is related to drug smuggling and CIA conspiracies.One of the oddest assertions is that the Nazi Klaus Barbi was a triple agent for the US and USSR, and had a team of commandos that trained the Contras.

The author has appeared on Coast to Coast and spent her life researching and suffering from Lyme. Like anything in life, one must be selective about what one believes. This book is no different. There are some original ideas here and some that aren't so... shall we say... logical. It's a fun read and presents some viewpoints I bet you haven't heard before. The fur connection itself is enough to justify the book."},{"Title":"Lyme Disease and the SS Elbrus","review":"It is obvious that a great deal of research went into writing this book. I found her ideas interesting. Anyone who believes that we have a country of totally honest FBI agents, CIA, and government officials is clueless.Could the author have made a few mistakes when writing the book? Of course. Does that make the whole book wrong? No.I found the part about Stalin using biological weapons against his own people quite plausible. It was done in this country numerous times. We are \\"told\\" that it doesn't happen any more. Maybe the Swine flu vaccine is one of those biological weapons but we are so brainwashed that we buy the lie that it is to protect us from a pandemic....We are also told that Lyme disease is spread by deer ticks. And it is strictly one variety of spirochete that causes the illness. If you should be bitten by a tick and you got sick but it is a different spirochete, then you don't have Lyme... Doctors are being told that they are not allowed to think for themselves when they have a sick patient who doesn't respond to the \\"generally accepted\\" treatment for Lyme. Her premise that Lyme is a biological weapon being used to make a very sick population is plausible especially since we have a mainstream medical community that seems to want to keep us sick.I enjoyed reading about the graft and corruption. It explains our current situation pretty well."},{"Title":"Human Relations: Strategies for Success, Student Text","review":"I took this class as part of my undergrad work for a business administration degree and was greatly disappointed.

This book does not, however, go into the mental aspects of the stallion in much depth, as I was hoping it would. Also, the book fails to take into account the fact that every stallion has his own personality, and that they each require a different approach, whether this is in the breeding shed or in the stable.This book cannot be flawed for its scientific and technical statements. The descriptions of the stallion's anatomy are very detailed, as are the diagrams, and the text is phrased carefully so that the author can be understood, even to the least scientifically inclined person.This book is a worthwhile purchase for the first time stallion owner, or to anyone that is considering buying a stallion for the first time, either for competition or breeding. More experienced horse people may find the book a little light on practical information, but nonetheless useful.

I do recommend that you start with Death and the Chapman. (Death is not the best book in the series but it is very good.) After reading this book, Holly Innocents, I found myself addicted to Roger and his world. These aren't difficult mysteries to solve on your own; with the exception of Wicked Winter, I figured out what was going on long before Roger did. Their appeal instead is a very appealing character and the amazing and realistic Old English world Sedley creates."},{"Title":"The Holy Innocents","review":"Kate Sedley has created an incredible character with Roger Chapman.

But when he arrives there, he is intrigued by a tragic event: the mysterious disappearance and subsequent murder of two small children, Andrew and Mary Skelton.Previous readers of the stories in this series will remember that Roger was once studying to be a Benedictine monk. Although Roger decided that the monastic life was not for him, he still feels that he is serving God by using his natural talents to solve mysteries.This was an excellent story, with a touch of the supernatural in it. The setting of late-15th century rural England is very well-done. Roger is such a great character. And this mystery had a great twist at the end. \\"The Holy Innocents\\" is a strong entry in this enjoyable medieval mystery series."},{"Title":"The Holy Innocents","review":"The Author Kate Sedley was born in Bristol and it is probably no coincidence that the majority of the Roger Chapman books take place in and around the Bristol area. Kate was educated at the Red Maid's School in Westbury-on-Trym. She is married and has a son and a daughter.Kate Sedley's books about Roger Chapman, the pedlar come murder mystery sleuth are becoming more and more popular and rightly so. They are good entertaining reading with plots and backgrounds that have been well thought out and well researched. They are what I would call light reading (very much like the writing style of Paul Doherty or Bernard Knight, two other well known authors of medieval mysteries). This book is the fourth in the series.When the Skelton children were deprived of their wealthy mother, they were left in the care of their much disliked stepfather. Then the children mysteriously disappear without a trace. England still has the festering war between the Yorkists and the Lancastrians and the lanes and by ways are plagued with wolf heads and common thieves. How did the children get out of the house, or were they abducted.? Why did they leave if they went of their own free will? These are questions that Roger the Chapman needs to find the answers to and quickly."},{"Title":"The Holy Innocents","review":"Roger the Chapman is an intriguing character, as are several others in this book. The only real fault I find is that Roger has a few too many &quot;modern&quot; habits and sensibilities.

If you like this variety of mystery though, I would recommend it, as well as Ellis Peter's Cadfael series."},{"Title":"WESTERN MYSTICISM","review":"Extremely expensive - ($190.00 is what I payed.

Tender, painful and moving yet utterly free from sentiment, this book should be on everyone's shelves. It is the story of a woman who finds herself homeless, ends up in a shelter, and finally gets her GED; yet it is enormously more than this. It is a story about Quaker process. It is a story about pain, and healing, and survival. The author is clearly well-informed about all of these things and it is impossible to read the book without experiencing them for yourself.

The material in the book is poorly organized, full of errors in content, grammer usage, and spelling. It is a comfort to know that he WAS the only Medic/Firefighter in the city who cared about patient care and the lives of the citizens of Hampton, Virginia; all sarcasm intended. I feel his God complex and the bitterness that must eat at the very core of his stomach with the turning of every page......may you get an ulcer, Mr. Jop. I work with the finest men and women in the Hampton Division of Fire/Rescue; to the man I assure you, they are mission oriented. Be it a commercial structure fire or an auto accident with injuries, OUR Medic firefighters attack the calls with equal enthusiasm and proffessionalism. Mr. Jop has attacked one of the nations 200 busiest EMS departments because he had personality conflicts with some of the personnel he worked with...I borrowed the book, would not give John the chance to get at any of my hard earned money,and hope you would do the same. It is a work of fiction, loosely based on the goings on of an American firehouse. DO NOT BUY THIS WORK OF TRASH....I assume Jop works the drive thru window now, I like mine without mayo John and salt the fries please. You had the opportunity to help people everyday,and actually earn a living doing something you really loved, there are many of us who volunteer to help people solely for the satisfaction of knowing we CAN and DO make a difference....every time the bells ring. I have no interest in Fire/EMS as a career, but admire the many men and women who put it ALL on the line every shift. America, this work is not everyones cup of tea; the death, blood, and trauma that firemen see routinely cannot be fathomed by the average person.......and sometimes it is hard to keep the nightmares away. The only &quot;code&quot; that ever existed in the division is the &quot;flatline&quot; that is Jops' brainwave."},{"Title":"Before the Bell","review":"Horrible book, full of lies by a obviously unbalanced individual.

How can lies be published. I've been a Hampton Firefighter for 12 years. The only racial slurs I've ever heard were made in private, and meant to be private only. I'm one of the people accused of making racial slurs, and I can tell you that they were all done in the privacy of the fire house. When the bell rings, my racist beliefs stay at the fire house. I treat blacks as good as I treat whites."},{"Title":"Before the Bell","review":"It &quot;simply amazes&quot; me that one person could trash a department such as that found in the City of Hampton for something that, if these accustaions were true, played an equally obtrusive part. I know these people Mr. Jop speaks of so hatefully, and to be honest, have never witnessed examples of these tall tales. Now, I'm sure there were problems and quirks in the department much like departments around the world. But, these people you have disgraced and defaced have lives, families and perform exceptionally well on the job. In fact, Mr. Joe Stevens has taught me an awful lot about proper patient care and respect of others. I haven't found a better paramedic in my travels. Nay, not just a great medic, but rather a great people-person. Now, please understand, I am not defending said actions, rather defending the structure and potence of their affable personalities and demeanor. An angel Mr. Jop was not...but neither are the rest of us. I lok up to some of these guys and in my own opinion consider myself respectable. For a moment, my usual modesty aside, I believe others would agree. People, please understand and know that Hampton is in no way, shape or form like described by the careless author. I promise you that. I take pride in what I do, just as my compadres do. People, you should feel fortunate if the need should arise that you need medical attention on the street. You should take a little more pride in yourself and feather your own faults as we all do at times. Facts, my friend...facts...or lack there of.

Mr. Jop's portrayed concern for minorities is nothing more than a vehicle to launch his attacks. I worked with Mr. Jop in the Hampton Fire Division and it is not the same place described by Mr. Jop. He tarnishes many fine people with the same tar brush which should have been reserved for the guilty. In reality Mr. Jop is guilty of taring and &quot;feathering&quot; himself with a higher degree of guilt than will ever be acknowledged by the people he hopes to hurt.

I found the contents to be fairly objective, although the final section on Christianity was somewhat favored by the author as it is admittedly her own faith. However, I felt she created a good exterior view of these religions as well as provided some wonderful insight into their customs and dogma. I found it very interesting to study, and by comparison with other texts on the various religions, to be fairly accurate."},{"Title":"Religion (Eyewitness Books)","review":"This book is divided into 28 chapters addressing religious and spiritual beliefs and practices from the ancient Egyptians, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Shintoism, Sikhism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Each chapter offers one brief paragraph introducing the religion and includes beautiful full-color photographs of paintings and objects related to each religion, each with detailed captions. Without a true narrative, the text is difficult to read.Although the book is broad in coverage, the treatment is uneven and biased toward major religions. For instance, Islam, Christianity, Judaism, Hinduism, and Buddhism are each addressed in three chapters, whereas other belief systems are addressed in a single chapter. These religions are indeed among the top six most practiced religions in the world, but Sikhism (number five ahead of Judaism, according to the Information Please almanac) only receives one chapter; Baha'ism (number seven, according to Information Please) is not mentioned at all in the book. The beliefs and practices of people in Africa, North and South America, and Oceania are collapsed into two chapters on \\"The primal vision\\" and \\"Rituals of life.\\" While smaller or ancient religions, such as the belief systems of the ancient Egyptians and Greeks, perhaps deserve less coverage than major, modern religions, the book does not sufficiently explain the depth of treatment given to some religions.In all, this book does not do a very good job putting the religions of the world in perspective and does not sufficiently put the large amount of information covered in context. Maps and a timeline would go a long way in explaining where and when these religions were and are practiced. Charts or graphs showing the most practiced religions of the world would also be helpful. Additional charts representing the monotheistic and polytheistic religions could also be useful in seeing how different religions of the world are interrelated. Children and adults may enjoy leafing through the book to examine the exquisite art objects, but any knowledge gained will only be superficial and spotty. The book does include a brief and not very helpful index."},{"Title":"Corporate Failure by Design: Why Organizations Are Built to Fail","review":"What is the sound of one organization failing? It may be the very &quot;vibrations&quot; that have become familiar to you every day at work. In his probing analysis, Jonathan Klein has, in essence, produced a mirror in which corporations can see reflected their own hidden shortcomings, pitfalls, and disastrous trends toward demise. It is the very humanness of each organization that predisposes it to failure. And it is this same humanity, made conscious, that can bring about a life-saving organizational conversion."},{"Title":"Corporate Failure by Design: Why Organizations Are Built to Fail","review":"This book is a MUST READ for anyone that entertains the idea of being part of the &quot;Business World&quot;.

From the self-destructive design of tasks to the death knoll of \\"performance evaluations\\", Dr. Klein eruditely states the reasons and methodology that organizations use to design failure into their very desire to exist. Reading Dr. Klein's masterful indictment of today's organization will prepare you to understand what is really happening in your department, division, SBU, or entire organization when you punch that time clock in the morning. You will be better prepared than your peers to meet the challenges to organizational longevity that are designed into company structure and culture.

The quality of research in this one is at a (Sitchin) level, but it's a much better read in my opinion. And the range of source material is of course far greater (the only source Sitchin used was Sumerian text). Tsarian uses many ancient native sources from all over the world, several I have never read of, or heard of before. As well as Celtic, Teutonic, Sanskrit, Norse, Hermetic,.... you name it. Also, his use of many archaic western scholars going back centuries is impressive and very interesting.

And now there is only one copy of this book in the entire database.Definitely well worth reading!"},{"Title":"Atlantis Alien Visitation & Genetic Manipulation","review":"[2012 note: all Tsarion's books are now available via kindle, including his latest books, \\"The Trees of Life\\" vols I and II. They all offer wonderful information; if even some of this stuff is true (and he backs up a great deal of what he writes), our true history is very different from what we are taughtTsarion describes himself as a student of true history. The author has collected and put together an amazing story going back at least 15,000 years, apparently mainly by the use of etymology, which is the study of the history of words, their origins, and how their form and meaning have changed over time. He repeatedly points out that our real history has been deliberately manipulated and hidden by the vicious use of lies of many different kinds, like:* Geographical - the deliberate positioning of events in locations far from the real ones* Caricature - outlandish habits and fantastic activities claimed in the Bible, for example, that are patently improbable* Etymological - words, terms, phrases and place-names underwent either subtle or drastic editing and transposition* Renaming - the deliberate alteration of personal names. This device was used widely. Names of characters were simply changed so that their existence and activities would be impossible to confirm. Titles reported to be personal names - like David (means superior priest), Solomon, Joshua, Jesus, Aaron, etc - were actually titles, and vice versa.* Invention - the introduction of peoples, tribes and events that never existed or happened* Chronology - timelines are muddled on purpose, kinglists rearranged, the lifespan of individuals modified. Dates for key operations, such as building projects, battles, traversals, famines, coronations, marriages, births, and so on, are tampered with.* Interpretation - wild, unrealistic interpretations are given to events and ideologies to flagrantly confound understanding* Crypticism - the introduction of a welter of code words, terms and phrases that signify little to the layperson but that communicate secret meanings and intentions to the initiated reader.Whilst I cannot accept everything he writes, for the most part Tsarion has done a superb job and his information is far more feasible than the incredible lies we have all been fed down the centuries. My deepest concern is that, although he is interested in the psychology of humankind, he does not seem to have thought much about how lucifer took the place of god, namely how it could have happened.Tsarion believably explains that after the global catastrophe suffered by everyone on this world - a catastrophe that has been hidden because of the resulting psychic wounds that the rulers of this world have cruelly used against all of us - it would be quite reasonable for people to start to worship a sun that they had good reason to fear could suddenly just disappear. This doesn't adequately explain how sun worship could lead to global psychopathic control. I believe he would benefit from the study of Ceanne DeRohan's unique \\"Right Use of Will\\" series of books, addressing the places where we are not free, not only outwardly, but also where we have imprisoned ourselves inwardly. This profound series is about bringing true Heart balance between the polarities and inevitably goes into very dark, old places that most of us would do anything to avoid.To get a taste before you buy, there are hours and hours of Tsarion available to listen to - free - by searching under his name within youtube. As to man's genetic origins, there is also fascinating information in Shannon Doley's three books, starting with \\"The Master of Speech\\"."},{"Title":"Atlantis Alien Visitation & Genetic Manipulation","review":"Michael's work is controversial, lets not ignore the fact. Some people who hold the idea that they know history from the mainstream educational system, will try and concoct false impressions of Michael's excellent work. Michael doesn't just make this stuff up, he has meticulously referenced all his works (4 books) with countless scholars, historians, and truth seekers of all ages, to give the seeker a true idea of what has transpired in our past. We must ask ourselves why some of the authors Michael has used; why is there work very hard to find and not talked about? Why don't we look at the issues from many angles? Do we like our servitude? Why do we accept mainstream history from the people who wrote it? Open minded people who will take a look at the information, digest it, then make an intelligent decision on whether the information seems credit worthy, is a must for any reseacher. The truth has nothing to hide. So if we understand that the truth does not lie, or dupe us, why are some works suppressed? Why must we ignore or suppress some of these works say of Gerald Massey, or Kersey Graves? This books allows us to discover for ourselves what probably happened in our ancient past to some degree. And that is the beauty of Michaels work, it opens you up to other works, in order to find what it is truly our history of Earth. Also, recently in Yahoo news, CNN, King Tut from Ancient Eygpt was found to have 95% dna from western europe. Maybe Michael is right! Trust but verify."},{"Title":"Atlantis Alien Visitation & Genetic Manipulation","review":"This book is written in the style of a research project. Instead of a fluid story to read, the flow of literature is constantly interrupted with quotations from other sources to back up the information being presented. The quotations are sometimes interesting but can become tedious and distracting from the story. This book is also divided into two sections. Half of the book is the \\"story\\" and the other half of the book is \\"just a list of dates of world events in chronological order.\\" Overall, the idea of the book's topic is an interesting one but again, half of the book is dedicated to quotations and a chronological date order of facts which means the actual story being told is not that long. Considering this book can sell for over $100.00 at many bookstores, I would recommend buying it from the Michael Tsarion website (if he has any in stock) which is cheaper, buying it used, or borrowing it free from a friend.

However, I want to point out that Catseye was published for the Young Adult market and so can be read by both children, young adults and adults. I originally read this novel as a child and it still remains one of my favourite Andre Norton books.Far, far into mankind's future, when humankind has spread out into the stars from the original planet of Terra and encountered other races...Young Troy Horan is a refugee/displaced person due to war, living the shadow life of an unwanted, non-citizen in the Dipple camp. His world and past life has gone forever and he has no future. The elite and powerbrokers of the galaxy, gathered on the pleasure planet of Korwar, prefer to ignore the unpleasant truth of the Dipple under their noses.One day, Troy has the unbelievable luck to secure some temporary day work in a luxury pet shop. While there, he stumbles on a mystery that could cost him his life, and he goes on the run with the special sentient luxury pets he has discovered he can communicate with in the petshop.Who can Troy trust? He and his Terran animal friends hold a dangerous secret, and various interested and powerful parties now set off in pursuit of Troy and his friends as they escape into the highly protected nature wilderness that comprises most of Korwar, and finally into the mysterious, forbidden and sealed ruins of a previous race which existed on Korwar. The ruins are officially sealed for a reason - can the escapees survive their pursuers and what lurks within?Language and content are appropriate for children/young adults. In addition, the writing and plot is at an extremely high level, appealing to adult readers as well. Some themes are environmentalism, power, war, refugees and animal rights. One of my favourite SF books still, as an adult reader. Also one for cat lovers."},{"Title":"Catseye","review":"The action of several of Norton's science fiction novels have begun on Korwar, whose people deliberately chose to make the planet a playground for the rich and powerful of the galaxy. Ironically, this is the best possible protection for Korwar from the interstellar corporations represented by those same people - while they often plunder worlds for natural resources, they won't foul their own nest.Despite their protection, however, Korwar isn't untouched. During the great war between the Council and Confederation governments (its aftermath appears in several books, such as DARK PIPER), the capital city of Tikil became the site of a refugee camp. After the war, those whose worlds were gone, whether destroyed or traded away at the peace table, had nowhere else to go, so the refugee camp became the Dipple, an unofficial 3rd face of Tikil making an ugly contrast to the expensive haunts of tourists or even the working city of the spaceport and warehouse district. The Dipple is a perennial problem, and CATSEYE follows Troy Horan, brought to this sterile warren as a youngster from the plains of Norden. There are only three options open to a Dipple-dweller: attempting to join the Thieves' Guild (as Ziantha of FORERUNNER FORAY escaped), signing on as indentured labor for a frontier world (as Niall of JUDGEMENT ON JANUS did), or scraping by without sub-citizenship by competing in the very tight casual labor market, as Horan does. Consequently, while the protagonists of FORERUNNER FORAY and JUDGEMENT ON JANUS also came from the Dipple, Troy Horan's story is the first to concentrate on Tikil and Korwar - the other tales leave the planet early in the story.On the morning the story opens, Troy has incredible luck - the assigner has a job for someone with \\"knowledge of animals\\", and Troy's reply that he has that of a Norden herd rider lands him indefinite employment at Kyger's pet shop, which provides exotic pets as status symbols for the rich. Troy's initial worries about the decade separating him from any contact with animals aren't a problem - his initial work assignment to help retrieve some new acquisitions from the port lengthens when an attempted hijack en route puts a full-time Kyger employee temporarily out of action.But why would anyone try to hijack a shipment of exotic animals bound for a life as pets - even as pets of the Gentle Fem San duk Var, rich and influential though she is? Delivering a fussel hawk and accompanying its first hunting expedition with a Ranger of Korwar (and giving us our first glimpse not only of Korwar's huge unspoiled nature preserves, but of the mysterious Forerunner ruins of Ruhkarv) leaves him with an impression that Korwar's guardians are taking an unusual interest in what is, after all, only a pet shop. After all, it's not *illegal* to convince credulous rich people that their little darlings can't survive without special diets, available from Kyger's. :)Then the routine of delivering special pet food to a Sattor Commander's beloved kinkajou is disrupted by murder - and Troy covers the kinkajou's odd behavior with a plausible story for the police. He finds himself wondering just how intelligent these animals are - and whether he should ally himself with Kyger, who may provide a permanent escape from the Dipple, or with a certain cats-eye view of the world.(Ruhkarv, and the disastrous fate of the last archeological team ever allowed in the place, are mentioned in some of Norton's other works - DREAD COMPANION mentions it in passing, while a Zacathan scholar in BROTHER TO SHADOWS attempts an experiment with a revised version of the device that brought final disaster to the Ruhkarv team - but CATSEYE provides more information about Ruhkarv than any other story to date.)"},{"Title":"Catseye","review":"Catseye (1961) is a standalone SF novel in the Dipple universe. When the War of Two Sectors broke out, the Council had evacuated the Horans from Norden to the Displaced Persons center on Korwar. Range Master Lang had volunteered for military service and did not return. Then his wife died of the Cough, a passing illness that was particularly hard on those from Norden. Their son was the sole survivor of the Horan family.In this novel, ten year later, Troy Horan has only his wide Range Master belt and a few memories to remind him of Norden. Now he is working as a casual laborer in Tikil. One morning, he is offered a job by the mechanical assigner and accepts it. Today he will escape the Dipple for a few hours.Troy reports for work at Kyger's, a purveyor of extraordinary pets. On his first day, he frustrates an attempt to steal a pair of Terran cats. Supervisor Zul -- a full-blooded Bushman -- is wounded in the attempt and Kyger offers Troy a seven day contract to fill in for the injured man.During the incident, Troy receives a warning in mindspeech from the cats. Later, he approaches their cage and exchanges a few thoughts. He conceals these communications from his employer and co-workers since he is not really sure what has happened.Troy has an affinity for animals and does especially well with the fussel hawk, a hunting bird from Norden. He is asked to accompany a customer into the wild to prove the bird's qualities. He will spend three days in the company of Rerne, a high ranking member of the Hunter Clans.Before this excursion, Troy is sent to a hillside villa to deliver special food for a pet kinkajou owned by Commander Varan Di. Since the Commander had just been murdered, the patrollers warn off his flitter, but allow him to continue after he explains his errand. As he is approaching the villa, the pet runs away from a patroller carrying it out of the building and leaps into Troy's arms.The patrollers are upset at finding the pet rummaging through the Commander's papers. Troy points out that the kinkajou is a very imitative animal and his probably copying his master's habitual routine. While he is talking to the patrollers, the kinkajoy is pleading with him in mindspeech to take it away from the estate. Eventually, the patrollers tell him to return the pet to Kyger's shop and they fly away.In this story, Troy finds that a pair of Terran foxes can also talk to him in mindspeech. He even overhears a conversation between the animals and their master. He begins to suspect Kyger of some form of espionage. Then Kyger is murdered and Zul tries to kill these animals. Troy steals a flitter and flees into the wilderness with the five Terran animals.Troy and the animals are followed by Kyger's associates and the flitter is forced down in the 'accursed place' of Ruhkarv. Now they are hunted not only by Zul and his men, but also by the rangers of the Hunter Clans. They travel deep within the alien ruins and find much to fear therein.This story is a precursor to theBeast Masterseries. Although Fors has mental communications with the great hunting cat Lura inStar Man's Son, this tale depicts a team of human and animals. Unlike Storm Hosteen's beastmaster team, however, Troy's group is more accidental than intentional. But it is still a combined force against their enemies.Highly recommended for Norton fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of human-beast teamwork, future cultures, and high adventure.-Arthur W.

The rest of the book is evenly divided to the two landings and the establishment of beachheads on Italy's west coast. Salerno was first, followed 2 months later at Anzio, north of Salerno.The author does a nice job of describing the preparations for and the actual landings by the Allies. He also does a creditable job of describing the northward assault of Montgomery's 8th along the eastern coastline and subsequent inland move as well as Patton's drive to capture the western half of the island. Mr Morison also describes the troubles between the two generals as well as the two Allies but does so in a more diplomatic way than other authors have done.For Operations Avalanche and Shingle, the author does a good job of describing the landing process and the establishment and keeping of the beachheads from counterattacks but doesn't really go beyond that. The breakouts are mention as well as 5th and 8th Armies but only in a incidental way.In all three operations, Mr Morison writes an honest and accurate appraisal of the Allies' performance. Its understandable that his criticism is not too harsh while he explains the reasons why the Allies did what they did.The author has provided a few good maps and photos of the officiers involved, the coastlines and the terrain.Even though this is an excellent summary, I couldn't rate it 5 stars for its not on the same level of detail as Carlo D'este's books. Rick Atkinson's books are good as well or the critical book by Eric Morris.Mr Morison has an straight forward, engaging style that most people will like. While this book is targeted to any interested person, I would suggest its especially appropriate for newcomers for its ease of understanding and style.

Rhys's first four novels - Voyage in the Dark, Quartet, After Leaving Mr. Mackensie, and Good Morning Midnight - are all essentially chapters in her self-excoriating semi-autobiography, the agonizing tale of her life-spiral into degradation and suicidal depression. As a pretty-but-not-beautiful young white girl from the Afro-Caribbean island of Dominica, our heroine takes one step toward shaping her life by de-exiling herself to England. From that step on, it's all adrift, from sexual exploitation (two-way) to exploitation, grimmer and grimier with each episode. She's a sad, sick kitty, this self-hating waif. She also writes with a poignant, painful realism that was way ahead of her time (the 1920s in London and Paris) in terms of confessional literature. There's something in almost every chapter of Rhy's fictionalized desolation that makes me want to run a few miles in the hills, take a cold shower, and listen to a Bach cantata to revitalize myself. There's also something so honest in her that I come back for more desperation on the page.The persona Rhys assigned herself in Voyage was more attractive, or at least more sympathetic, than the 'heroine' of Quartet. In fact, Rhy's fictional life becomes so tangibly unbearable by the end of Quartet that most readers will need a year or two before confronting the next episode, titled After Leaving Mr. Mackenzie. Unfortunately, for this reader, the intense sincerity of despair that fills up the first two books of Rhy's confession gets formulaic and dispersed in the latter two, and I have little to say about themThat's not what I expected when I bought the complete novels. I'd just spent two weeks in Dominica, hiking, snorkling, bird-watching on that beautiful volcanic cone of an island, where equal parts are blended of pitiful colonial detritus and indomitable Black joyousness. I'd never read a word of Rhys, but I noticed a shabby house with her name on a plaque in Roseau, the mildewed rubble-heap that passes for a port city. I expected something on the order of Jamaica Kincaid, or even better, the early hilarious novels of VS Naipaul. Ooo-wee, was I on the wrong track!I seldom urge people to read depressing novels or down-hearted poems. The world has a way of supplying each of us as much despair as we need. Rhys is an exception. Her sorrow is so pure than it exonerates her degraded life. I haven't read her last novel yet - Wide Sargasso Sea, written 30 years later and considered her masterpiece - but I will. If ever a life required a redemption, it was Jean Rhys's, and it would seem she achieved at least some redemption in writing.."},{"Title":"Jean Rhys: The Complete Novels (Voyage in the Dark, Quartet, After Leaving Mr Mackenzie, Good Morning, Midnight, Wide Sargasso Sea)","review":"Jean Rhys' novels (based on her life and including the classic 'Wide Sargasso Sea') are superbly written with an intense pathos, revealing the hardships single women experienced in Europe in the early 20th Century; loneliness, reliance on brief sexual relationships with various men for their living, difficult landladies, illegal abortions.

Her works should be required reading in any modern literature course. I am shocked that I made it to grad school before hearing about her. Her style is very readable and her tales engrossing."},{"Title":"Jean Rhys: The Complete Novels (Voyage in the Dark, Quartet, After Leaving Mr Mackenzie, Good Morning, Midnight, Wide Sargasso Sea)","review":"Wide Sargasso Sea fails to hit the mark. The writing is nice, the scenes near the waterfall, and at first there appears to be much promise. However, the message is more literary and lacks - in my opinion - an engrossing storyline. I say this in case someone expects a great read with a \\"current\\" feel. That is not what this book is about. Nevertheless, it is an interesting look on how many ways a person might become isolated, and sometimes the isolation manifests itself in the places one least expects. I have enclosed an essay I wrote on Wide Sargasso Sea for an Eng 226 Brit Lit class.Islands Within; Grace WithoutRhys' protagonist Antoinette is beset by many outside forces. The unique racial, financial, and geographical identity of Antoinette assures that her voice will most often be lost and isolated. She is neither black nor white, not quite always rich but neither destined to be poor. As a result, Antoinette's isolation is complex and extensive. It is exists on many levels. She is both the victim and cause; a cruel and self-perpetuating cycle. It is possible that Antoinette has the will to change things, but that possibility is most likely intertwined with an inability to be humble; to forgive. In this aspect, Antoinette's greatest obstacle is Antoinette solely.These characteristics find a fertile breeding ground in the isolation experienced by Antoinette. The blacks do not accept her as an equal, nor do the whites. At times she is poorer than one of her class should be, and at other times she has no access to the money which is rightfully hers. She is trapped in a limbo; not quite this, and never that. Rhys' development of Antoinette's isolation is crucial to establishing one of Antoinette's most negative characteristics; a bitter heart.Yet the isolation is not Antoinette's fault. Neither is her color, financial status nor place of birth. It just is, and that is crucial to understanding that while people might have some extent of control over their own lives, there will always be outside factors to account for; the will of others, mother-nature, and chance. These factors speak to the human faculties of pity and forgiveness. In Antoinette's case the reader is torn between pity and contempt. A highly conflicting emotion gets to the root of Rhys' intent. On one hand, mankind has a difficult time pitying those without pity for others. Yet on the other hand it is easy to empathize with those poor souls so isolated from simple fraternization; those eternal outsiders of foul circumstance.Such is the lot of Antoinette. She will never find a home and will always be a lost soul; an isolated exile on a wide sea or a confined island. She will be ruled by her fears, afraid to be amongst those lesser than her but even more afraid to be lesser in the eyes of those higher than her. From this perspective, despite the fortunes which seem to have blessed her life, Antoinette is truly the poorest person of all on the island of Jamaica.Rhys is describing a world in which natural and societal forces are collectively more powerful than mankind. She is describing islands within islands, compounding isolation and hatred into a self-effacing crucible of despair. And yet even though mankind may feel forsaken by a world that cares not for the plight of man and offers little in the way of hope, there still exists the most sacred of choices to man; whether or not he can act with tolerance and forgiveness to his brother. This choice alone is owned by both the highest and lowest; it is uniquely human. And although the actions of forgiveness and tolerance may seem petty, they may be enough to ensure that God's grace bridges the gap of isolation on a Wide Sargasso Sea."},{"Title":"Knopf Guide: St. Petersburg","review":"This guide was invaluable to us on our regretfully short tour of St.Petersburg.

It's that use of the pronoun \\"we\\" that signals something different about Culley's approach and style: in most similar books the author places himself somewhat at a distance from his reader as he relates his experiences on the range. Culley invites us in and there's an intimacy about his narrative missing in most other memoirs about early ranch life in the West. It at once puts the book on a higher pedestal than most other books on the same subject.Culley came to America as a young man after growing up on a stock farm in England. Oxford educated, he was as familiar with classic literature as he was with horse breeding; his learning (of both) shows in his writing style. For five years he was range manager at the Bell Ranch in NE New Mexico, and most of this book deals with those days. He relates the hard work of the cowboy - the long hours in the saddle, the harsh weather, breaking horses, life on a cattle drive - but he also has chapters on the history of the Bell Ranch area, on outlaws (he's fascinated by them in a Sir Walter Scott sort of way), what constitutes a good horse, fellow cowboys, and town life in nearby Clayton. It's a full picture of things, multi-dimensional and interesting. Always, though, it's his warm, personal style that wins the reader over and keeps him won: \\"And here I'm going to relate to you a little personal happening,\\" he writes at one point, and then goes on to explain \\"the value of good hands\\" in riding a horse. The book has great appeal, even for those who might not be overly fascinated with the subject. Of all the books about life on the range prior to the coming of the automobile, this book is among the very best."},{"Title":"Cattle, Horses and Men","review":"I was delighted to find this book because it contains references to my grandfather, who was noted in Texas and New Mexico for his skills in breaking horses.

It is packed with information of all kinds and written gracefully and intelligently by its author, John (Jack) Culley, who came out West from a wealthy family in northern England and was educated at Oxford. The word \\"cattle\\" comes first in the title because he is first and last a cattleman. At the age of 30 he was already range manager at the massive Bell Ranch in northeast New Mexico, with its herds of Hereford stock.The book was first published in 1940, so Culley is looking back over a half century of Western history, observing sometimes tongue in cheek how times have changed. Mostly, he is a rich source of detailed information about ranching life when the ranch where he worked in the 1890s was the only fenced-in rangeland between Canada and Mexico. His recollections include character sketches of the men who worked with him as well as a number of bandits who robbed trains and were eventually captured. There's also a chapter devoted to a curiously likable local gunman who killed many men in self defense but was never taken to trial.There are chapters devoted to horses, good and bad, and styles of riding and training horses. He describes a day on a roundup from dawn to dark. He challenges the romantic notions about the West perpetrated by Hollywood. And he has an encyclopedic knowledge of ranches in the region (including southern Colorado), brands, and cattle breeding. As someone who likes to consider himself well read in frontier ranching culture, I found myself learning much that I didn't already know. It's a treasure of information and anecdotes for anyone interested in the Old West as it really was."},{"Title":"Horse fever: A guide for horse lovers and riders","review":"This is a book from my childhood that I just loved.

Her older brother Brian is just as eagerly anticipating starting his senior year as Gina starts 6th grade.Middle child Elaine is going through a terrible adolescence. She is rude and hostile; attacks Gina and on one occasion leaves her in the mall so she could shop and ogle boys with her friends. Gina has the presence of mind to ask for help and finds Elaine and her friends. I like the way she confronted Elaine and Elaine was rightfully punished for that one. I didn't like the power struggles or spitting matches Elaine and her mother had.Elaine is like a toxic cloud. Her venomous hatred infects the well being of the family. Elaine steals money from Gina; she is defiant to the point of being out of control. Finally, the girl's father tells her he will find help for her even if it means sending her to a hospital.Sadly, Elaine never receives this help because she is killed in an autombile accident shortly before the school year ends. Gina is left with a lot of residual anger at her older sister and Brian offers the voice of reason. Gina acts out much more subtly, including stealing a toy dragon from a store. She returns the dragon and Brian helps her see why doing this could only lead to future problems.Sixth grade is not the cakewalk she envisioned.

Feeling guilty over not supporting a relatively unknown author (by not contributing to the copies sold total), I promised myself to come here and write a review if I liked the book. Well, I'm here, although just barely. I enjoyed BOOK's farraginity of forms, its humor, and its plot (at least until its weak build to a weaker climax); but, in all honesty, I have to say that I wish Grudin had done more with structure than simply play around. Overall, I'd say it wasn't what I was hoping for based upon my first glance, but I did enjoy the read -- enough to have written this, at least."},{"Title":"Book","review":"I came across a hardcover copy at the campus book store, it was only $2 (brand new) so I got it but didn't get around to reading it for another year.

I'm online now to order a paperback copy--I've always intended to own it but never got around to it. One measure of how good this is is that a great friend of mine hates it. He's bright enough, but often a bit thick-headed if he feels out of his depth contextually (as a teenager in the early eighties, he didn't laugh at Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy because he felt its humor presupposed a familiarity with science fiction which he lacked). So rather than enjoy Book as the glorious lampoon that it is, he preferred to see it as a frivolous 5-finger exercise with too many in jokes.The mark of a good funny book: over-literal types shouldn't like it! But it's the best medicine for the rest of us!!"},{"Title":"Book","review":"After 20 years in academia, BOOK exloded the political nuances of my experience into raucous humor. I laughed til I couldn't laugh any more and I have given away multiple copies, including one to a University president."},{"Title":"Book","review":"I read the reviews for the book and decided that it looked interesting and decided to read it. After reading the book in a day, the least that can be said is that it is an amusing book. Even if you are not yet an official member of academia and are just a lowly student, it is very easy to see how some of what is going on in the book also happens in real life. I daresay it also happens in other professions, but I don't have the experience to back that statement up.Though the book is very fun to read, some of the themes could have been better developed. For example, the idea that by destroying all of Adam Snell's work would eliminate him from history could have been taken a lot further. PFITZ by Andrew Crumey plays with many similar ideas concerning the creation of a character and the possibility of being forgotten with the elimination of one's work, and PFITZ is better in that respect. Also, the reasoning behind the attacks by Underwood is fairly lame.Even though the book is not perfect it still has many good qualities and if you're looking for a book to enjoy during the beautiful spring weather, you won't be disappointed with this one."},{"Title":"Book","review":"Presents on the surface as a murder mystery/thriller, but that is so not the point. The point is the most wonderful satire of literary theory since ThePooh Perplex, and of academic politics since, well, forever. Grudin has great fun playing around with language, couching different chapters in different voices (first, second, third), genres (narrative, nonfiction, drama, Q & A, etc.), marginal notes and footnotes (the footnotes attempt a takeover in Chapter 9, but are brutally suppressed--the marginalia tried to give warning!). I was going to ding Grudin a point for giving the novel Sovrana Sostrata a PR classification instead of a PS, but I take it back for the all-too-plausible postal abbrev for his fictional state of Washagon."},{"Title":"Book","review":"I was given this by my old English teacher and had to search for years to find it again to gift to others.

A line here or there worth remembering, one that gives the reader pause. But as a whole, Love Medicine is difficult to follow, more of an impressionist picture of the lives of individuals in several generations of two Indian families, than of snapshots of realities. Covering three generations, Erdrich jumps around, going over the same time and events from different character's eyes. I found it hard to follow. Remember Faulkner's Unvanquished? There are a few moments when this approach works, but on the whole, it is redundant. Her characters talk in sensual ways--they seem to go through life cooking, cleaning, smelling, drinking and smoking. Deep thoughts about fate and society are stated with the same simpleness as the color and design of a dress; sexual scenes are told with dispassionate summary. I don't get to read for long stretches, so I found I did not want to try to think back the previous chapters to remember, &quot;Oh, yeah, she is so-and-so's grandmother.&quot; What I did enjoy is the subtle way she shows how our government's Indian policies have played out in the generations of Indians on reservations. But this is not really an &quot;Indian&quot; book. It is a family's histroy. Fuzzy Snapshots of lives told in simple detail-- a little TOO simple?"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I thought this book was a really good book. It had a few crazy scenes and ideas in it, but that is what kept my interest. It explained family situations, some of which a lot of people could probably relate to in a smaller degree. I believe this novel deserves four stars for creativity in expressing its theme and main ideas. The book may have seemed a little extreme but that is how the main idea of it was expressed and it definitely kept the reader's attention on the novel. All the different characters and the jumping around style of writing was a little diffucult to follow and keep track of, but overall it was a really good book."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"If anyone has a family tree for the characters in this book, please let me know ASAP!

The family structure is confusing at first, but stick with it and you will be rewarded. Just hang on... This is a darn good book, and there is more if you want it."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I was forced to read it for a class and the characters absolutely captivated me! The complex issues of Native American life interwoven with family issues and life issues. This book is very profound and not for the simple minded."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Sometimes I will find that I live my life expecting everyone elses to be comparable to mine. Love Medicine proves that the way I live my life is not the only way to live, even in the U.S.. The book deals with the a community of Native Americans and their culture, and hardships dealing with the American government and each other. They live the life they have been handed living on reservations and doing what they can. They seem to find the reservation, or should I say the people on it, as family even though many of the characters are not blood, and that is where they draw their strength pulling back from the world around them."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"\\"Love Medicine\\" is a lyrical, unique novel of American Indians living, for the most part, on a reservation. Community life is not important to the novel, whereas individuals and family and the experience of nature and spirit are. While not long, \\"Love Medicine\\" follows many characters over many years, doing so by moving between time and character in each chapter, in a non-linear fashion. I understand the new edition of \\"Love Medicine\\" has 5 additional chapters, and a genealogy in the beginning. If you have the old version, make sure you construct your own genealogy as you work through the novel, in order to keep everyone straight. Love Medicine is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" novel, but I really wish Erdrich had not introduced King in the second chapter. He made that chapter on the family reunion more disheartening than it should have been, given the future development of the novel, as well as the reader's enjoyment."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine, deals with the struggles of a Native American community in America. This book shows us how challenging a community can really be. It deals with love, hate, jealousy, compassion, sex, and discrimination. I enjoyed reading this book. Marcus Beard-Cal Poly Pomona"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I thought the novel Love Medicine wa difficult to understand. It had a lot in the bood that did not need to be included in the book. It does show a good example of family bonding and the way other's make use of their time. But i feel that you have to be open- minded to understand and enjoy the novel. It explains a lot about another culture and their beliefs. It was an underlining theme in my opinion. The author describes their relationships and makes them seem like they are very disfunctional, but when you analize the book , you see that the family is doing good. Due to the circumstances they live under, they struggle and still stay together as a family."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Published in 1984, this stunning collection of interrelated short stories won the National Book Critics Circle Award and the Los Angeles Times Book Prize for Fiction. Focusing on the lives of several Chippewa Indian families, and the white families with whom they interact and/or marry, author Louise Erdrich depicts their traditional culture through some of the early characters, and, through later characters, the way the old ways change or become compromised through education, the introduction of religion by missionaries, and contact with modern society. The stories are set in North Dakota on or near a remote reservation, not far from the Canadian border, similar to the place where Erdrich grew up and where her parents worked as teachers for the Bureau of Indian AffairsThe stories reveal fifty years in the lives of the Kashpaw and Lamartine families from the 1930s to the 1980s, as they interact, intermarry, and ultimately try to figure out who they have become. Through her selection of details and her often lyrical descriptions, Erdrich creates vibrant local settings within which her characters tell their stories in lively, colloquial voices. Emotional, matter-of-fact, tormented, and sometimes angry, the characters are equally well drawn for both men and women.The separate stories of Marie and Nector Kashpaw, which come together when they marry, occupy much of the very early years covered by the collection, but their stories also involve Lulu Lamartine, with whom Nector has a long affair. In the 1980s, Marie and Nector's grandson, Lipsha Morrissey, tries to create a \\"love medicine\\" for his elderly grandparents in an old age home, a story filled with ironies and, ultimately, dark humor. Between these stories time flashes forward and back as other generations, other children and parents from the same families, try to deal with the immediate aftermath of war, the harshness of the prison system, unemployment, and poverty.As the characters overlap and interact throughout the stories, the author conveys Chippewa culture, the families' resistance to and acceptance of change, the roles of strong women in holding families together, the hostility towards the federal government, and the sometimes overwhelming despair of those who live on the reservation. The characters' sense of pride and endurance elevate even the saddest and most wrenching stories, however, while the bleak humor keeps them from becoming morbid or sentimental. Dramatic, thoughtful, and powerful, Erdrich's collection creates an unforgettable portrait of two families who represent a changing Chippewa nation. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Colorful characters, vivid detail, and a whole range of emotion await the reader that embarks on a journey through Louise Erdrichs' 1985 book Love Medicine. Those who have no prior knowledge of life on an Indian Reservation will come away with a better understanding of Native American life in the twentieth century, while those who are familiar with life on \\"the res\\" will certainly find many things to relate to. Erdrich has managed to weave what may at first seem to be unrelated chapters into a colorful history of the lives of the Kashpaw and Nanapush families spanning five decades. Intertwined in the story are many other reservation residents all of whom add their unique contribution to this literary tapestry.Each chapter is written in the style of its' primary character and reflects the individuals' point of view. Family alliances and feuds are played out, relationships become evident, and secrets are uncovered with each turn of a page. Events are often retold elsewhere in the book from another persons' perspective and the plots continue to thicken. Hopes and dreams often give way to stark reality. Some characters remain on the reservation accepting their lots in life and triumph despite personal tragedies, dysfunctional families, and adversity. Other characters don't cope as well and attempt to escape to the city only to find out that no matter where they go they cannot escape themselves or their destinies. Then, there are those that are so tortured by their life experiences that they see no other way out but the ultimate escape from life itself. Yet, despite tragedy and hardship, life endures. Each character has unique coping mechanisms and skills, and philosophy about life. As the book progresses the reader gets to know all the key characters very well.Remarkable throughout the book is the connection and sense of extended family that exists in this community. Especially poignant is the way the matriarchs hold all aspects of reservation life together through good times and bad. Children are fostered as needed without question and raised alongside natural children, frailties accepted, those in need are cared for, eccentricities are tolerated, and indiscretions either forgiven or ignored. Doors are always open to friends and relatives, commodities shared, and family loyalty is a way of life. The community is interdependent on all its' members, as is clearly demonstrated when all the families in the community are included as employees of the short-lived Tomahawk Factory, and reap from both the success and failure of this trailblazing endeavor. The ways and superstitions of the Old World weave their way throughout the book adding interest, and sometimes mystery.Using the personal experiences as a German-Native American and her keen insight into all aspects of life Erdrich brings to light the challenges of everyday life for this marginal population; those that live both in the old world and the new, and sometimes don't fit into either. With her skill at presenting a total picture of modern Native American lifestyle on the reservation the author brings to the readers' consciousness various socio-political messages. The presence of alcohol abuse and its' consequences resurfaces throughout the book both from the abusers' point of view and that of the victims. After an intimate look inside the lives of these fictional characters the root causes of what are often looked upon as hereditary traits become apparent. People need to feel valued, productive, and that there is hope for something better in their lives. Historically, reservation life has encouraged dependency on the government rather than self-sufficiency and entrepreneurship. The effects of parental alcoholism on children in the form of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome also cannot be ignored as a cause of this unfortunate cycle that clearly needs to be broken.Come, spend some time at the \\"res\\", and if you aren't ready to leave when you turn the last page don't despair - this need not be the end. Step into the books' sequel The Bingo Palace. One can only wonder and imagine what further adventures and mysteries await within the walls what used to be the infamous Tomahawk Factory!"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Native Americans have not been treated well in fiction. Too often, authors merely fall back on old stereotypes (such as Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales), but authors also risk the danger of reverse racism, in which a minority group is portrayed as so noble and godlike that they insult the human traits of the group (Dances With Wolves, for example). A realistic portrait of Native Americans is desperately needed, and Louise Erdrich fills this void impressively.This is a deep, complicated book, encompassing many years and characters, jumping back and forth through time, alternating viewpoints with every chapter. Faulknerian in scope, the book is also blessed with a rich sense of humor, which lightens the mood and rounds out the characters. Yes, these people suffer in the book, and the plight of reservation life is presented without romance or any softening of the blow. Yet we laugh as much as we cry throughout &quot;Love Medicine,&quot; because Erdrich is a gifted enough author to replace pathos with witty perserverence. This book requires patience and time, but has rich rewards. For an uplifting look at Native American life, and an insightful view on human nature in general, try Louise Erdrich."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"First off, this is not an easy read, so if that is your favorite fare, look elsewhere. This is the first Louise Erdrich book I read, and it hooked me so that I've read every one since this. Having originally read the book about 10 years ago--I think when I was a senior in college--I have just finished re-reading it. If you follow through the rest of the books, you'll probably want to do that, too, because all the stories turn back in on themselves, and someone who's a minor character in one book shows up as a major character in another book. I see a lot of negative reviews from students who have read the book, and honestly, if I had read this book when I was in high school or early college, I probably wouldn't have gotten it. So I hope those who got frustrated with this book while young will give it another chance later. This book will resound with people who have had sufficient life experience to appreciate the darkness and suffering that goes on throughout the stories. Although there is a lot of darkness, I found Love Medicine to be overwhelmingly uplifting. Louise Erdrich finds the light, humor, and irony in situations so that in spite of all the suffering, we are left with an air of possibility that transcends the grim resignation that would be plausible. While some characters do succumb to that resignation, they are definitely a slim few. Most of the characters triumphantly ply their fates despite the sometimes onerous obstacles before them. This book is woven with such rich threads of such universal themes - love, lust, loss, unfairness, redemption, revenge, second chances, family, arrogance, regret - there's too much to go on about each one. You just have to read it yourself."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I am but only a 14 year old girl and currently read the whole &quot;Tracks&quot; series. I read before this a review that criticized the whole series; it was written by a 16 year old girl who was forced to read it. In my class, we were asked to find a book that has a Native American theme to it, and after carefull consideration, I chose to read this peice after hearing great praise of the author, Louise Erdrich, from my literature teacher. It is indeed a challenging peice of literature, but I found it unique. Its constant changing of narrators leaves you wanting to read and find out what happens to all of the charaters in the end. I first read &quot;Tracks,&quot; and I was fascinated with the character Fleur Pillager, she is the type of person that I see in myself, the kind that I would like to play in a movie. She is seen in two narrative forms throughout the book. The first, Nanapush, is a spirtual man whom has a wild heart, and a love for woman. The second is the ignored Pauline, whom is jealous and sick. Fluer is described by Nanapush as a wild-hearted woman who does what she can to survive. Pauline sees her with eyes of jealousy, and sees her as compition for men, and attention period. This novel is the tragic tale of these characters and there life on the Chippewa reservation. Having Chippewa blood myself, I believe that this novel is an accurate account of what happened long ago to the Native Americans, and if all eles, it is a good read. But I must warn you, you must have some intelegence to read this book, for to say the truth, it is one of the harder peices of literature that I read."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"LOVE MEDICINE is a book about forgiveness and grace. Erdrich creates stunningly real characters who struggle, lie, cheat, fight, love, and forgive. There are triumphs and tragedies aplenty. The underlying themes of stubbornness and survival are beautifully portrayed in the title story in which the human condition is compared to the vulnerability and toughness of dandelions: \\"The spiked leaves full of bitter mother's milk. A buried root. A nuisance people dig up and throw in the sun to wither. A globe of frail seeds that's indestructible.\\" Haunting the minds of the characters in this book is June, who dies in the first story on Easter, a day typically associated with renewal. Driven by physical and psychological hunger, June, a Native American, gives herself to a stranger, a white man she meets in the Rigger Bar. The cause of her death is left to the reader to decide--accident or suicide? This is a question that drives the other stories, as well as the reader's heart. Indeed, these stories are about learning to think with the heart. I've read these stories many times and gain new appreciation for them and new clarity with each reading. \\"The Red Convertible,\\" a much-anthologized piece, is truly a gem--heartbreaking and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Louise Erdrich's Love Medicine is a powerful book about two Native American families the Kashpaws and the Lamartines and their need for spiritual healing. Erdrich's has an uncanny ability to poetically illustrate emotions like: \\"Her clothes were full of safety pins hidden in tears\\", or \\"Punished and alone I slept in a room of echoing creeks.\\" Her clear fluid writing style enables her stories to be very powerful and moving. In the first chapter Erdrich illustrates the story of June Kashpaw's death. The book then consists of the different perspectives within the families and their response to June's death. Erdrich allows June to be the main character which is removed from the story. June floats in an out of the story while the different characters deal with tribal issues. Love Medicine refers to the healing process which the characters are working toward. The characters Erdrich develops are so easy to relate to that you may end up reflecting on your own family and friends and all their drama. Erdrich's book speaks trans-culturally. It does not feel as if you need to be Native American in order to relate with the stories. Love Medicine is an issue relevant to many painful topics across the globe. This book can be a good route which relates with a lot of different issues, such as death, divorce, love, and spirituality. Many of the Native American characters are dealing with identity crises and feel disenfranchised. I would recommend this book to be read along with books like the Poisonwood Bible by Barbra Kingsolver. There are a few subject matters that may prohibit this book from being read by high school classes but I feel any mature audients would benefit greatly from Erdrich. Over all I find this book provocative and heart wrenching at the same time."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"As the Kirkus review suggests, Love Medicine is best taken as a series of stories--it is not exactly in chronological order, and the stories are related only in that they all deal with characters from two sides of a large and complex family. In fact, the family relations are so complex that at times they're downright confusing, and you might want to make a family tree--in pencil. Nonetheless, it is a powerful and compelling book with a sly wit about it; and sometimes it's so beautiful it's painful, as in &quot;Scales,&quot; &quot;The Red Convertible,&quot; and &quot;Wild Geese.&quot; In all honesty the book is probably a masterpiece, as--in the best of van Gogh--it leaves you pondering nuances of what you've witnessed for days afterwards"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine chronicals the relationships between two Chippewa tribe families in North Dakota. Over a 50 year period the lives of the members of these families are intertwined through love, hate, lust, greed, honor and tradition. Love Medicine is much more than a historic chronical of two families.In reading Love Medicine the reader is drawn into the lives of the families. There is much rich symbolism in the book, which seems even more fitting in the traditional Indian setting. Many questions are left unanswered in Love Medicine, questions that may or may not be answered in subsequent books.Love Medicine also had four additional chapters inserted ten years after it was first released. The additional chapters were strategically placed within the book. To understand their significance, one needs to read both editions of Love Medicine."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"In my English class, we were required to read a book written by great women authors. Because I am very indecisive, I did not know which one to choose. I picked &quot;Love Medicine&quot; because I am of a Native American heritage, and I wanted to see if this was just another stereotypical book devoid of any real truths whatsoever. I must admit I was taken aback by the quality of this book. &quot;Love Medicine&quot; is a story of two Chippewa families, the Kashpaws and the Lamartines, whose lives interlace throughout the entireity of the story. The three main characters find themselves caught in a love triangle that lasts through most of their adult lives, and it has a major influence on the lives of their family members. In trying to heal this plight with a love medicine, a plan which goes sour in the end, Lipsha realizes that true love cannot be forced upon another; it is felt deep within the soul. Erdrich's style of writing is what makes this novel interesting. Her attention to detail brings her characters to life, and each story gives the reader insight into the individual's life and feelings. This is truly a great work and a pleasure to read. After really getting into it, I found myself not able to put it down. I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine was one of the books I had to read in my American Novel class in college. I only got through Chapter 1: not because the book was bad, but because I couldn't keep up.I'm an earnest reader, but a slow one. I can average two books a month, but back then, reading 8 or 9 books in one semester while taking 4 other classes with reading assignments, homework, papers, etc, it was simply an unreasonable number of books to read.So, 10 months after becoming a college graduate, I decided to revisit Ms. Louise Erdrich's tale of Native Americans in North Dakota. To put it simply, the book is pretty good, and it held my interest 95% of the time. My favorite episode is probably \\"The Red Convertible.\\"Two things we discussed in my American Novel class were why is this a novel rather than a collection of short stories, and who is the protagonist. Love Medicine is a novel because the short stories, which were separately published in different magazines, come together to form a cohesive tale. And the individual stories become chapters. Secondly, I believe Lipsha is the protagonist. Back in school I said June was. Of course, since I only made it through one chapter, who else was I going to say? However, I wasn't far off. After reading the entire story, I found June to be the character that hovers over all of the other characters. She is the ever-present presence that influences even though she is only seen in the first chapter. But Lipsha has the \\"Love Medicine\\" chapter, plus the final chapter.None of the people in the book are really likeable. Even Lipsha is annoying. He's a grown man who sounds like a 10-year old when narrating and talking about his \\"powers.\\" Lulu is a tramp who has 9 kids from 8 different men whether they be single, married, etc. Nector is a selfish cheat who survives on the strength of his wife; and his wife, Marie is a slightly scary character who as a young girl tried to kill a nun. This is just the tip of the iceberg. A very interesting story."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I thought Love Medicine was a very interesting book. The saying &quot;don't judge a book by its cover&quot; comes into play here. When I first looked at the book I thought it was going to be boring, but I was wrong. It is nothing like you think it is going to be by looking at it. There is a lot of deception and corruption going on with the families in this book, but the story does have a happy ending. I gave this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine by Louise Erdrich is part of a tetraology. These four books focus on four different charaters. This particular book focuses on a character named June who is absent throughout the book. \\"Homing In\\" is a huge theme that a lot of Native American authors write about and it is evident throught this book. Love Medicine also shows the struggles of anger, desire, and the healing power of two families. Love Medicine is an excellent way to find out how Native Americans live on the reservation."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This book was not a book that I would normally want to read, but because of the emphasis our Englush class had on families,it became somewhat interesting. It was interesting to learn about another culture (Native American) and how their different values and beliefs effected their family lifestyle. Overall, the book was somewhat informative and unique in style and organization."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine is the kind of book you read very slowly and very often to comprehend. It was one of the most confusing books I have read. It never really caught my interest. There were too many characters to deal with that water downed the story to the point where I did not really care about any of them. Maybe if I pick up the book again, I'd appreciate it more. In the meantime, two stars."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"After reading Love Medicine the first thing that comes to my mind is totally confused. I honestly lost track of all the children and their parents. The reason I give this book a three however, is because I thought it gave good examples of the realistic hardships encountered by the Native Americans. Espcially the fact that most books tend to give us plots based on just the general societal condition. This story gave us an inside look into the effect of the reservation life on the families. I think I may want to try to read this again just to try and figure out the family tree."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I feel that this was a good book in general, but I was kind of offended by the way she protrayed the Indian culture. Maybe she had to do it this way in order to get her point across, but there could have been a better way. I mean she used alcoholism and sex as a main theme is the book, before she got to the real heart of the people. I did like the end of the book when everyone realizes that they do need one another. The book was very nice though and I appreciate the learning experience."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Louise Erdrich makes a poignant point in her novel, Love Medicine. Each of the disjointed vignettes serves to further separate the family into individuals connected only by nature. Allthough this may be disheartening to us, it rings true with a majority of families. However bitter her message be, it is delivered in a prose reminisent of poetry. A delight to read, your heart will twist right along with it."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Beloved is quite a story. First of all the whole issue with the ghostly daughter was really different and something one needs to adjust to. I think this book was a good read and I would recommend it. But there were some points in the book that confused me a little bit. I really think that the way this family was is displayed well. I don't think this was my favorite book though. I actually thought this was going to be the best book to read this quarter, but after reading it I would say that Joy Luck Club was my most favorite out of the three assigned novels of this quarter."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I gave Love Medicine 3 stars because, although it was an interesting book at some points, many parts of the book were not too appealing to me. At times, reading it made me a bit uncomfortable just because it had quite a few sexual parts in it. Also, the language was vulgar.However, i think that the novel itself was well written. It was iteresting in the sense that it gave me a background about the indians and it also provided a different perspective for me to look at it.As for recommending this book... i dont think that i would recommend it. Also, the many characters are confusing especially because they seem like they are all related somehow."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I loved this book. The whole time I was reading it I knew I was in the hands of a professional. Erdrich's style was tight, sharp, witty, challenging. Her story was rich and interesting, and her characters were full and nuanced. We covered family, war, racism, power, addiction, religion, infidelity, love, parenting, fear, sadness, and death - all without losing hope or the storyline. Very impressive. I can't wait to read &quot;The Beet Queen.&quot;"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"What i liked best about _Love Medicine_ was the way the characters were portrayed: so very real. Other authors, when dealing with Native American culture, fall short on their attempts to integrate their characters' spirituality with daily life in a believable manner.Some advice: I read _The Beet Queen_ first, and i liked it better that way."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"What i liked best about Love Medicine was the way the characters were portrayed: so very real. Other authors, when dealing with Native American culture, fall short on their attempts to integrate their characters' spirituality with daily life in a believable manner. Some advice: I read The Beet Queen first, and i liked it better that way. I also love the fact that Erdrich uses pretty much the same cast of characters time and time again. After you have read two or three of her books, you get a huge panoramic picture of their world."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"In Erdrich's companion novel to Love Medicine, The Beet Queen, a character notices a spider's web in a baby's hair. For that novel and for this beautiful work, the metaphor is duly noted. The characters are involved with each other and in each other's lives through an elaborate, complicated and emotional web that exists among them connecting them and making the episodic storytelling and shifting narrative voices appropriate and enriching.The pay-off in the book comes about half to three-quarters through it, when the reader realizes that the sections are joined loosely and not by any kind of chronology or specific plot line. Read them for the separate jewels they are. (Erdrich is particularly lovely read aloud, but to read this book aloud, all participants must embrace the feelings of chaos that come early on from the narrative method she employs.) In the end, the deeper connections will astonish and amaze."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This was a novel that I entered into unsure of whether it could transcend what I assumed was its genre, and it turned out to be one of the most profound explorations of American culture I've ever been exposed to. A truly complete exhibition of the similarities in all of us that go way beyond the passage of time or the perceived differences of culture and community."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"\\"Love Medicine\\" is the lyrical tale of the Nanapush, Kashpaw and Lamartine families of Native Americans living on a reservation in the Dakotas. Each chapter peels at the layered relationships among the families and reveals how their lives intersect and extend to encompass all that is traditional and new in the Native Americans experience. Told from multiple points of view, the narrative is capable of transporting one to a place where truth, like fruit from the tree of life, hangs low for the picking. I saw myself and my culture represented in the stories of the Chippewa. \\"Love Medicine\\" is tragic and triumphant, magical and inspiring. The novel's exquisite symbolism is drawn in succinct prose that pulsates with the vibrancy of the characters and culture. This was a great read recommended by a cousin in high school who didn't quite like the story. After reading the novel I can understand my cousin's lukewarm response to the text, for our family's - the African American family's - experience seems inextricably tied to that of the Native Americans depicted in the novel. I found it particularly interesting how the effects of oppression are the same regardless of the group of people being oppressed. Having that experience rendered with such clarity and unflinching honesty can be a lot to take in when you're at the height of discovering who you are, why you are and where you belong. I'm looking forward to a lengthy discussion with my little cousin and recommend that all high schools add this to their required reading list."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Native American author, Louise Erdrich, creates a beautiful web of love and life in her fictitious book Love Medicine. Different Native American characters narrate each chapter of this novel as they seek to find \\"home,\\" when all they have is a reservation. This powerful piece of work had a personal impact on me as I read it. I better understand now, the internal struggle American Indians go through regularly because of the displacement and injustice they have suffered in their own homeland. I highly recommend this book not only because if its content, but also because of its unique and intelligent writing style. Matthew 11:28"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I first came upon this author at the thrift store, and read The Last Report on the Miracles at Little No Horse book through without stopping, I loved it that much. I now have every one of Erdrich's other books, and have loved them all. The people here who rate this one or two stars have NOT read this carefully or thoughfully, or maybe shouldn't be reading anything more difficult than a Danielle Steele novel. These are so lyrical and full of heart and meaning, so deep. I am in heaven reading these, all of them!"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine is an eloquently written story which helps us understand life on a reservation and, more importantly, that it is love that keeps the family together. It is very helpful that the novel is written in a way as to let the reader examine and relate to each character on a individual basis. Although the characters are presented individually, all of the stories intertwine allowing the audience to experience the families on a personal level. Although the book moves slowly in certain areas, overall it is an emotionally interesting book."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This is a brilliantly written story by an equally brilliant writer. Her novel, which is in fact a multitude of stories, spans generations, cultures, and boundaries. It is an epic tale of love, loss, and the constant opportunity that we may succeed and be made stronger by life's mysteries. It will touch any reader, regardless of race, age, and gender. It is, in fact, a book for everyone--a book about everyone."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This is required reading for class and I am so confused. If anyone has anything that may help me, i.e. a family tree, suggestions, explanations etc. Please send them to me. Thanks."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I was required to read this book for 11th grade honors english. I didn't really enjoy it very much, it was not a book i would choose to read myself. Yes, the style of writing was very well done, but the book itself was drawn out and uninteresting. There are so many differnt characters that you never get a chance to get emotionaly involed with any of them. You should have seen the family tree our class made, it was twice as big as my own. If you do happen to read this book i would recomend to take notes. But on the other hand i would never recomend this book to anyone. It didn't give me the feeling of what it was like to live as an native american. They might as well have been living in LA. Personaly, I am upset that i had to read this for school because i got nothing out of it except for a few good inside jokes i have with my friends. But this review is comming from the view point of a 16- year old high school student, and my 20-something teacher seemed to enjoy this book so, thats all i have to say."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Well this book was just terrible. I found myself skipping over entire chapter (it was required reading for school). How complicated and uninteresting can these peoples lives possiblely be. Sorry, but i do not care the entircate details of their pathetic boring lives. I'd rather walk on glass than read the second half of the book."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read in my life. Not only because of the stories told in it, but also because of its unusual format. Erdrich follows the history of two Chippewa families that live in the West--general vacinity is Minnesota. In it, every character tells his/her own story but the time periods of the stories do not follow chronological order, for example you may have one story being told in the 1950's, the next in the 80's, and the following in the 70's. It is written from an current American Indian point of view meaning that the time sequence does not follow the same that our society follows, and that Erdrich has characters that face the problems that many American Indian tribes face today. It IS about the Indians... just not the buckskin-wearing, wild horseback-riding people in the history books. It is humerous at times, but very sad. This should open up all reader's eyes as to what it's like to be an American Indian today, and shame us."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books, the characters are all so strange, and yet they feel like family. There is this wonderful web of chance, love and magic that flows through the whole book. Each time I read Love Medicine I find myself longing for some of Erdrich's magic in my life. Her characters suffer and love and hate with all the feeling they have, they do not have an easy road, but some how it all feels true."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"In the beginning, I had to discipline myself to read this book because the subject and the landscape was so foreign to my own experience. But soon after, I was swept by the drama, the characters and the beautiful writing of this novel. The author masterfully and imaginatively transports the reader to the scenes so that you feel that you are there. As there are multiple characters in this multi-generational story, the reader sees the same stories and incidents, but interpreted from different points of view. It is especially a great eye-opener for anyone interested in the Native American community."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine is a wonderful novel shown to the reader by the individual perspectives of the characters. The trials and tribulations of the characters are unique to them in the materialistic sense, but they experience the emotional turmoil that everyone can relate to. This novel carries us through the never ending cycle of love, hatred, and lust. By opening the door for her reader Erdrich succesfully opens the door to our own souls in which we find the same basic human traist she portrays in each of her characters. I highly reccomend this book for anyone who would enjoy a refreshingly honest author."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"&quot;Love Medicine&quot; was my &quot;first&quot; Erdrich book; I hold it in my heart the way one might hold a first crush. Her language is amazing; few other authors hve such a natural and innate ability to commmune with the soul- my soul, anyway.I was shocked by the reviews written here; this is what prompted me to write this review. Why are instructors teaching this book in intro classes? That's like teaching Faulkner in high schools; the point and beauty of the book is guaranteed to be missed. If you're looking for food for your spirit, look to Erdrich. If you're looking for a way to introduce Native American ethnicity into a survey class, please chose another book!!"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Louise Erdrich's novel, Love Medicine covers a fifty year time span through the lives of several generations of North Dakota Indians. Many of the chapters appeared as short stories in publications such as The Best American Short Stories of 1993, New England Quarterly/Bread Loaf, and The O. Henry Collection. Louise Erdrich weaves the novel together in a masterful and intricately-beaded collage. Love Medicine is a vivid and sensually evocative account of communal Indian life, culture, and landscape. Characters in this novel experience glory, shame, romance, and tragedy. In traditional fashion, women bear and raise the young, bake the bread, gather and preserve the food, while the men hunt for game, hunt for women, and drink too much. For the most part, male-female stereotypes apply to Erdrich's characters, but there are some exceptions--June Kashpaw and Lulu Nanapush, to name a few. Louise Erdrich takes the reader into different characters's viewpoints within each chapter. As the novel unfolds, one sees the intertwinning, convoluted, and potentially dangerous relationships among the characters, families, and tribes. Some of their obstacles could be encountered by any character, but a lot of their problems stem from being Indians in white man's society. Erdrich, herself a North Dakota Chippewa descendant, does and outstanding job depicting Indian culture in untamed landscape. An authentic intimacy with the Indians permeates throughout the book. The reader feels the experience of gathering Juneberries alongside Grandma Kashpaw, feels the passion between Lulu Nanapush and Nector Kashpaw, and feels the heartaches and sturdy endurance of Marie Lazaar Kashpaw. The overall tone of this book in proportionate to the real-life predicament of the American Indian. While Erdrich captures the wholesome and honorable spirit of her people, the anger, sense of injustice, and the Indians's struggling attempts to cope with their plight, comes hurling across the page like a tomahawk in motion.s. Love Medicine offe"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine defines a hard period in life for Native American Indians living on reservations located in North Dakota. The book expresses how outside environment variables such as alcohol and segregation from the U.S Goverment play a big role in the character's lives. Louise Erdrich writes a novel about multiple individuals in a family throughout the 1930's to the 1980's struggling to accept and understand each other. No matter how many problems they are confronted with, they have a strong bond allowing them to stay unified. The characters are able to have this link because they only have themselves to depend on."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I can understand the reviews written by people who feel that this book can be spread out and difficult in terms of the number of characters and their complex interactions. I feel that this book is best taken as a sum of its parts, however, and I believe that Erdrich's subtle play of characters and emotions is revealing of what a remarkable talent she possesses. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, and I am extremely impressed by her successful use of poetic prose, which can be difficult to carry off without seeming maudlin."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"Love Medicine is an eloquently written story which helps us understand life on a reservation and, more importantly, that it is love that keeps the family together.

The story The Red Convertible in this collection is quite possibly the best piece of literature I have read in a while. A must read!"},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"It's best to maintain a list of characters when reading to keep from flipping back through the pages to determine who beget whom. The ironic humor kept me interested in the book. Unfortunately, there were a number of potentially great themes that were never developed. I recommend the much more imaginative and shorter (about 65 pages) teenage book, &quot;Weetzie Bat&quot;,for those interested in the power of love and seeemingly disfunctional families."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I thought that this book was confusing. There were too many characters and too much going on. I found it to be interesting at some parts but VERY hard to follow.

Each chapter pretty much deals with a story for every family member, and thus gives a more personal understanding to the reader for each character's point of view. The book itself wasn't all that bad, some stories went by a lot quicker than others."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I thought this book was a list of examples on how Native American lived during that period of time. I like to keep things clear in my mind as I read on in a novel, I find it VERY confusing to keep the family members &quot;cleared&quot; as I read. Struggles between friends, family, and lovers makes this book a 3 star in my view. I find it hard to believe that some can actually live like the way she described in her book. Overall if you like to read about complicated family, friend, and love &quot;relationships&quot; I would recommand this book to you, I didn't however, find it too amusing to read this book."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"liked the book a lot, found it very helpful to make a family tree in order to keep relations straight. perfect book for anyone who likes daytime drama. it starts off weird but gets interesting later on. it puts a different perspective on views of indians who live during the same time we do. it is not about indians running around in moccasins, hollering, and waving around their hatchets. they are just normal people who happen to be of native american descent. you will enjoy."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"While this novel engrosses you in the life of a somewhat disfunctional indian family, I never really got into the novel. The one positive side is the characters are fairly deep and their are quite a couple intelligent revalations about family. Besides that, the book is a snooze. The stories the author tells are way to drawn out. I never got into the novel, I always felt like I was just reading it. The author never really got me into the indian atmosphere either. The relationships in the book are also not very interesting. If you are looking for a book with family and interesting characters, read The Joy Luck Club, it's better."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"I absolutely hated this book. There were too many flashbacks. I had to read it for school, and I hated it."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"The Love Medicine is set on the American Indian lifestyle. It makes you wonder why these characters in the book had to live their life like that. I love almost every story about Native Americans but this novel showed the &quot;real&quot; side of their life and how they must cope with their problems. The novel was sometimes confusing, especially with all the characters and the many relationships going on. You must be very openminded to read this book and must appreciate the Navite American culture. This novel was good but not the best that I have read."},{"Title":"Love Medicine","review":"This was not that good of a story cause at times it sounded crazy and confusing. But one good thing about it was that the Indian family was very close to one another. The individuals in it cared alot for one another and during rough times they all came together.

Billy Jo narrates her story in a series of free-verse poems dated as journal entries. Hers is a hard life even before a pail of kerosene ignites setting the homestead on fire, killing Billy Jo's mother, and maiming the narrator.This is a challenging book to read, but worth repeated reads as Hesse's poetry shares insight into the everyday dramas of everyday people during an epic era of American history."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought that this book was an excellent piece of literature. This book was a touching story about a girl named Billy Jo. Her story is like many other children's that lived during the dust bowl. THe book was not only historical, it was very interestig too. It is an increadeble piece of work and it is sure to keep your eyes glued to every page."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a very emotional book that is both very touching and despairing. Written in free-verse style Karen Hesse's poetic tale sweeps you away into the past where hope blossoms like apple buds in the rain and then withers, dies, and blows away with the dust.Fourteen-year-old Billie Jo Kelby's whole life has been about the music that flows from her fingers when she sits down and plays the piano and her endless struggle to survive the harsh life of a farmer's daughter in the Dust Bowl in the Oklahoma Panhandle. With her mother pregnant and the dust storms savaging her father's hard work, all she can do is hope that her father would get the son he always wanted, and the harvest will be enough to get them through the hard times.A tragic accident scars Billie Joe's already brutal life forever leaving her with the feeling of the most overwhelming isolation she has ever known. As her only passion is ruthlessly torn away from her, all she wants is to go away forever; out of the dust. This series of poems carefully depicts Billie Joe's life as told from her point of view as she ultimately learns an important lesson that can heal the damage inflicted onto her life and soul."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought the book was very interesting. I liked how Karen Hesse wrote the book in a free poem way of Billy-Joe's survival through the Dust Bowl. The poem of stories were a great way to tell kids and adults how the Dust Bowl effected people in a fun and emotional way. I would give this book five stars for sure!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked out of the dust, and recommend it, but it was depressing. People kept dying, and everything fell apart. It was about a young girl named Billie Jo, whose life, after her mother and brother die, drastically changes. It was very informative about the dust bowl, and it is a good story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was very well written. I liked how it made me thirsty every time i was done reading it. To me that meant that the book really explained the dryness of the dust bowl. Also i liked how the drama was always going up and down.

This dissapointed me because i was hoping for a good (but not extrodinarily happy) ending."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I give Karen Hesse two thumbs up for her novel!I love how she takes you by storm back to the great depression and shows us the awful dust bowl.I loved how she told the story through the young Billie Joe who was living in oklahoma with her family.she did a fantastic job with her free verse poetry and heart wrenching story.Out of the Dust is a great novel for adults and children and it definanetly deserved the Newberry medal award!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is a very good book. I've honestly never seen a book so descriptive. It's unique because they wrote it in poetry form, but it didn't rhyme. But it was still correct! I never saw anything like it. I never thought you could do that.I have to say this is one of my favorite books. Not only does it tell you a story about a girl in the depression and the dust bowl, it also kind of teaches you about what people went through in the depression and the dust bowl. I'd never even heard of this book before I read it.I must warn you, if you're interested in reading this book, it's a possibility you may cry. I didn't, but it was really sad.I've already said so much, so I hope you go to the library or a book store soon because it is a must read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse is an extraordinary, fast paced novel written in poem form. Karen Hesse takes the topic of the Dust Bowl in the 1930's and focuses in on a family and their struggles. The novel is in a diary format through the eyes of a girl named Billie Jo. Billie Jo's life is not easy. She is fourteen years old and lives in Oklahoma where it hasn't rained and all of the crops are dying. They have little money and food, barley enough to support their family of three. Billie Jo's mom is also expecting a baby boy which adds to their stress. Billie Jo is able to relieve some of her stress by playing the piano which she loves to do. But will an accident tear their family apart? \\"I don't know my father anymore. He sits across from me, he looks like my father, he chews his food like my father, he brushes his dusty hair back like my father, but he is a stranger.\\" Read the novel Out of the Dust to find out!Overall I really enjoyed Out of the Dust. It is an inspiring novel that shows how lucky we truly are. Billie Jo did not complain about the hardships in her life. She helped hold her family together (what was left of it) and her heart, courage and strength was spectacular. Billie Jo makes you think long and hard about not taking things for granted. Billie Jo is my favorite character in this novel because of those reasons. Out of the Dust is filled with descriptive language, which makes you feel like you're there! I can definitely tell that this is a winner of the Newbery Medal given for outstanding literature for children. However I would not say that this is suited best for children. I would recommend this book for young adults (about middle school age). Karen Hesse wrote this book to give people an idea of what the Dust Bowl was like and what the people went through during those times. I think that Karen Hesse succeed in making sure that those goals were met!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This was a great book. I liked it alot. It was....... good. Awesome. Touching. Sad.

I just finished reading it and I feel in love with this book again."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This was such an interesting novel written in free verse allowing the author, Karen Hesse, artistic licence. My students enjoyed learning about the dust bowl in such a dramatic way as well. The characters are so memorable."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This award winning book, published in 1999, tells a fascinating story in an amazing way. When my friend Margie called and said I am bringing you a book you absolutely must read, and told me the title, I said, \\"Isn't that a Scholastic book for students?\\"\\"Yes,\\" she replied \\"and you are going to love it.\\"She was right.I read the book through in a couple of hours that night, then went back and read it again, slowly.The book is written in free verse, which is so appropriate as 14-year-old Billie Jo talks about the free-floating sand and dust on her family's dirt-scratching Oklahoma wheat farm during the 1930s dust bowl.The youngster stoically copes with one loss after another and finds no one to confide in. Billie Jo's mother is absorbed in her long-desired pregnancy, and Billie Jo's silent father seems to think only of the soil, growing plants and digging a hole to retain water.The piano in the living room of their tiny house becomes a focal point, demonstrating that some beauty was able to peek through those dismal dust-filled days. Billie Jo learns to play the musical instrument from her talented mother, and makes a name for herself at school. The three are looking forward to the baby's arrival, when another disaster strikes.While many of their neighbors begin heading west as the fierce dust storms force them out, Billie Jo's father says they have lived through hard times before and they are staying put no matter what. Her mother accidentally splashes a pail of kerosene while making tea and runs screaming out the door from the resulting flames. Billie Jo grabs the pail and throws it out the door --- just as her mother rushes back inside. Altho Billie Jo tries to beat out the flames with her hands, it is a futile effort. Her mother is fatally wounded and a few days later the long awaited baby is stillborn, adding to Billie Jo's grief. Also Billie Jo's hands are so burned and scarred she can no longer play the piano.Billie Jo is so overcome with guilt, shame, and grief she finally runs away only to discover how much she needs her father and the farm. The book ends on a happy note with her father able to tell her that he loves her, a friendly neighbor begins bringing them food and makes her father smile again.-----------------------------The big surprise for me was learning the author was not writing her own biography, because she made it so believable. Karen Hesse lived in Baltimore and only drove through the Great Plains area. Then she began researching the dust bowl years and many of the stories in this book are taken directly from newspaper items of the day. I have recommended this book to everyone I know."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Fourteen-year-old Billie Jo Kelby lives with her Pa, Bayard Kelby, and her Ma Polly, who is going to have a baby, near Joyce City in the Oklahoma panhandle during the dust bowl days of the Great Depression. Born in August of 1920, she begins her diary, written in free verse, in January of 1934 and covers the next two years of her life with a chronicle of her family's dreary existence including both her tragedies and triumphs. Her best friend Livie Killian moves with her family to California. The Kelby farm is failing, and all Billie Jo wants to do is to escape the dust that envelopes her. However, her Pa is determined to stick it out. Then a terrible accident transforms both her family and her life. But the one thing that might make things more bearable, playing the piano, seems impossible with her now scarred hands. How will she cope with all her difficulties?Author Karen Hesse bases the picture drawn in this book, which won the 1998 Newbery Medal, on true stories which she read in an Oklahoma newspaper, the 1934 Boise City News. In her Newbery Acceptance Speech, Hesse said that the story \\"was about forgiveness.\\" I found it interesting and informative, but the two biggest complaints which I have heard about the book are that it is boring and that it is depressing. I can understand how children who want only bang-bang, shoot-\`em-up action books would find a simple account like this to be \\"boring,\\" but then \\"boring,\\" like beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. And yes, it is a bit \\"depressing,\\" but then it is set in the \\"Depression,\\" and there is a reason why this era was given that name. Out of the Dust does an excellent job of helping the reader to gain insight into the absolute poverty which many people of that day experienced. At the same time, I would not recommend it to a child who is actually dealing with the problem of depression.Other than a couple of common euphemisms (i.e., \\"darn\\" and \\"heck\\"), there is no cursing or profanity. After the accident, Pa did take Ma's money to go out and get drunk, although he did not continue doing that, and one scene about making moonshine occurs, along with some references to dancing. Some sensitive youngsters may shrink from the description of \\"Grown men clubbing bunnies to death.\\" And one day when it does rain, Billie Jo sees her pregnant mom out behind the barn \\"bare as a pear.\\" Before anyone writes in to complain about my mentioning these things, I'm not saying that they make the book bad or that people shouldn't read it because of them. It's just that some parents want to know about such things ahead of time so that they can be prepared to discuss them with their children. The free verse used in the book is certainly different, but the sparseness of language emphasizes the sense of despair, yet with an underlying feeling of hope. My suggestion, especially for those who don't care for poetry, is to forget about trying to follow the free verse and just read the story as prose. That worked for me!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is very good but so sad in more than one way I think you should read this book"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Great book, great story.

The dust storms darken the days, and sadness comes with that horrid dust. With an love for piano playing, Billie Jo is a kind all-around girl just trying to deal with the dust.

She does not have any siblings and so she loves both her mother and father very much. There is a terrible accident and after giving birth to her brother who was still born her mother dies. Her life is very complicated because of the dust she deals with and this makes the story compelling. I like the fact that the book is written in a unique way that makes it easy to read. I also liked the fact that , for the most part the author used many details. Even though this book is set in a different time period teens can really relate to BillieJo's story. She is a young girl feeling out of place so she goes and tries to find somewhere better but relizes that her home is where she belongs. It was boring for my personal taste because she lived in a little country town with not much going on. I felt that the ending did not really come to a conclusion it did a little bit but it was vague. I read it with my class in History and I think it was a good book to read with alot of people say , in a class setting because of the format."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is good from start to finish. You learn about a young girl who lives on a farm in Oklahoma in an area called the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression.

One day her mother goes to throw some water on the stove and it turns out, that water was gasoline. The gasoline causes a huge fire and her mother is badly wounded and dies. Her father is withering away to nothing and she has trouble communicating with him. She feels like she has nowhere to go and no one to talk to about her problems that she is being faced with.

Soon after being gone she realizes that running away was not the answer and that home really is where the heart is. She returns back home and learns to make the best of the situations she is faced with. Find out the ending yourself by reading the book. I think this book was a decent book.

Billie Jo's mother dies from just a big accident. Billie places the blame squarely upon her own shoulders. Billie Jo was also in the accident and has become scarred for life. She is unable to do the only thing she truly loved doing, playing the piano. Even after she has healed from the accident she just is hurt too much my the memory of her mother to even try to start over. Billie also feels as if she has been left alone by her father because she doesn't think he cares for her.

Most of the time I like reading about a historical books an event that happened. I gave a ten because I really got into the book. I felt sad when Billie Jo's Ma and little brother died. That was the worst part ever. I wonder what my life would have been like if I lived when that happened. I wonder what Billie Jo felt like when the dust stopped.

It kept me interested while I was reading. I liked how realistic this book was. I learned a lot about Oklahoma and what it is like to live in a Dust Bowl. I know that I wouldn't want to live there. It was such a sad book, however. It made me really feel bad when Billy Jo lost her mom and her little brother and was so very lonely. I wished it could have been a little more happier than it was. It did have a very good ending though with her father coming around and showing her how much he loved her and him getting remarried.

It makes me feel like I am part of her life and living right there in Oklahoma."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust had a great story line that always kept you coming back to the book. I didn't like however, that the author put in these characters and told you some of what happened to them but not the whole thing.For example when Mad dog sang on the radio they never said if he became famous or if he just ended up livin there.I did though really like the way she put in so much detail without making it stand out.

Overall this was a great book and i would definately read it again."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I honestly thought that Out of The Dust was an o.k. book.

I could almost feel the dust clogging my nose and mouth. Karen Hesse's exceptional adjective choices drew me into the story quickly making me want to read more and more.

This book explains what it was like to live in the Dust Bowl. The author Karen Hesse uses a form of writing called free- verse that I have never seen nor read before. Free- verse is a form of writing where the author uses several small paragraphs or poems to make each chapter. When Billie Jo burns her hands in the accident she is unable to do the one of the things she loves t do, play the piano. When Billie Jo's dad gets skin cancer and doesn't even think to go to the doctor about it Billie Jo decides to run away and go towards the west to California, but once she gets there she realizes that running away from her problems is not going to solve them. What made the book very interesting is that the author (Karen Hesse) wrote the book in Billie Jo's point of view. On a scale from one to ten, one being the worst and ten being the best, I would rate this book as an eight. So, I really enjoyed reading this book and I would recommend this book to anyone age10-13."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"When i started reading Out of the Dust I thought it was kind of boring.Once you start to get in the book it gets really good. Karen Hesse the author did really good on showing symbolizem. I liked how they showed the apples meaning life and death. Also how the dad haveing skin cancer thet showed the he was routing away and was getting towards death. I will probley read this book a second time. If i were to rate this book it would be a 6. If you are over 11 years old and you like peotry and some action you should read this book. I think you would like it. Most of my classmates who i read this book with liked it too. I would recomend it to you. So go to the bookstore and but it now."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is an enthralling story that holds you in suspense at all times. Its unique free-verse poem style allows the book to show feelings that words cannot explain. Each poem is written with hidden feelings. This book was brilliantly written by Karen Hesse about a girl's trial of life during the dust bowl. It was a tough trial in which she loses her mother, her brother, and her love, the piano. She has to fight through this devastating trial, and try to move on with her father.This is the most brilliant work of writing you can find about the tough times of the dust bowl. It tells the truth of life out in Oklahoma during the dust bowl, dust and death. It was hard to find something to live for in Oklahoma in the 1940's, but this girl finds a way to make it through the dust bowl. This book is a mix of hope, death, guilt, and truth. This book was written with great compassion."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book led you in and out of the dark and light corners of BJ's mind. Out of the Dust showed me the intense times of the Great Depression. The author painted a vivid picture of BJ's emotions in my mind. I was very interested in the range of BJ's emotions. Her feelings ranged from emptiness to wanting and then to trust. This one of the few books I have read that is based on one characters point of view. This left you to wonder what the others views were, which made it more exciting and fun to read. With free-verse the author is able to speak more freely and powerful. This is something I don't see in many books. I enjoy this method. The authors precise descriptions of the Great Depression are presented in a harsh way that shows reality. She also found a way to do this poetically which made it all the more interesting. Her ability to do this was remarkable. While doing this format the author was still able to let her talent shine through the story. The story was gloomy but the author turns the gloom around to represent a girl with enormous power, spunk, and delight. This made me feel like the book was controversial in a good way. She was given a chance to show the distress and admiration in this character. I thought BJ was a wonderful and \\"constantly fighting with life\\" sort of person. BJ is a determined hero in my mind. She is brave and strong for confronting misery and hardships. To me it seemed her actions slightly rubbed off on others.... BJ, to me, is a brave soul. She seemed to shine in the hardest of times. She was the best character I have ever read about. She is also determined to win the fight within her soul. She is exactly like the girl I want to be when I grow up. She is living proof to me that you can do anything if you set your mind to it. I would rate this book a 10. I hope this book will teach other kids the same lession I have learned. I hope others will enjoy this wonderful masterpiece by Karen Hesse."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thoutht this book was great. It captured the imaganation with descriptive description.

The rest of the book is much better. On a scale of 1-10 I would give it a 9 only because it does not have as much action as other books do. There were both depressing parts and enlightening parts. Karen Hesse, the author, wrote Out of the Dust in a new way to me. She wrote it as a poem. The book took place during the Dust Bowl of the 1930's. It is a touching book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is a emotional story about a girl that has a dead mother,a guilty life,and people to forgive.This book is held in the dust bowl.A hot,dry,and a tough place to live in.After she sets fire to her mother with a pail of kerosene,she feels guilty, and her father ignores her.After some other emotional events,she learns that she has to forgive her dad for putting the bucket there,but more importantly, she needs to forgive herself.This book is an inspiring story of different emotions and tough times.It is all written in patterens and free verse,which show the current emotions.The book has a lot of real-life things,such as skin cancer from the hot whether and death.

This Book is about a little girl who owns a farm, but still very poor. This is a very sad story and I reviewed this book because I felt the way she did while reading this book,this made me want to read it. This girl had a normal life,but then her mother dies and her little baby brother dies too! This makes the whole family not even like a whole family. Jo's(the little girl's name)most favorite thing to do while she is depressed or sad is to play the paino, but she can't because of her wounded hand. There is a BIG dust storm and I mean real BIG!, this makes her dad's farming worse and there would be no food growing out of the fields. Now everything is ruined their crops and family. What would happen next? I would recommend this book to a friend who likes to read diaries written by historic people like this one!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a novel by Karen Hesse. The book is about a young girl named Billie Jo who lives in the \\"dust bowl\\" during the Great Depression. This particular book has many themes in it. The main theme is forgiveness. Forgiveness is the act of letting go of the past and to live in the present. Billie Jo has to learn this lesson and use this many times through out the book. She has to forgive her father for quite a few things in the novel. She has to forgive him for leaving the pail of kerosene by the stove, and for drinking up all the money when the mother wasn't well. Another person she has to forgive is herself. She has to forgive herself for throwing the pail of kerosene on her mother. She has to let go of the guilt and move on.I think this is a great book for ages eight to fifteen. The book is to easy for ages over fifteen. Older kids might not enjoy the book as much as the younger group of kids. I thought this book interesting but it could have been better. The author could have put more detail into some specific parts, such as the accident, the death, and all the piano recitals. One thing I didn't like was how it went from one subject to another, and that it just left you hanging. Other then that it was a pretty good book. I think it deserves at least three stars"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a book written in a form of poetry called blank verse about the childhood of a girl named Billie Jo living in the Panhandle of Oklahoma. The year is 1934 and things are getting bad. The Dustbowl is becoming more violent than ever and the Great Depression is just starting to take effect. The people have little or no food because the crops cannot grow and the animals are dying. It becomes even worse when her father finds the emergency money and goes drinking. What he does tears the family apart until it cannot be called a family anymore. Because of the petrifying things going on, along with others that come deeper into the story, this book should be read in 7th, 8th, or 9th grade. Most will appreciate the dedicated work that Karen Hesse put into making this book a poem. Just about anyone could have written the book in paragraph form, but it must have been quite difficult to create a blank verse poem out of it. This a great book because of the poems like \\"September, 1934.\\" There is so much description, tone, and mood about the sadness and agony, that it makes you feel like you are experiencing it for yourself. Just hope that you will never have to."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the DustOut of the dust was a very good and informative book. There is one theme in this book that is portrayed many times through out the novel. The theme is Death and Rebirth and it's shown through out the book in a number of ways. One way it's shown is when Billie Jo's mom and brother died from the fire (death) and Billie Jo's father meets another woman who he really likes and completes their family again (rebirth). In addition to the death of her mother and brother, death also signifies: Billie Jo's hands, the dustbowl, and the depression very well. Death is Billie Jo's hands because they die when she burned them and she can't play piano anymore, but she's working at the rebirth part by trying to play and using her hands more so she can use them normally again. Death is the dustbowl because the people had killed the land by grazing too much and farming it too much but they are working on rebirth by trying to grow some more wheat and other crops there. Death is the depression because the economy had died and the people were trying to bring it back up (rebirth).This book tells a sad tale, but it is very useful to learn these thing so they don't happen again."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"I am filled with bitterness, it comes from the dust, it comes from the silence of my father, it comes from the absence of Ma.\\" (Hesse, 195) That is in my opinion one of the most moving sentences in Out of the Dust it comes from the poem \\"Midnight Truth\\" right before she decides to run away from her father, and out of the dust bowl. Out of the Dust is a novel about a girl named Billie Jo in the Oklahoma panhandle, part of the Dust bowl during the great depression. The novel is of the many hardships of Billie Joe, her family, and her town. Good aspects about this book are all the vivid similes and metaphors that Hesse uses in this novel. This novel is not a must read, because although interesting at points it can be very depressing, and doesn't have enough detail. Its depressing because it seems anything bad will happen to Billie Jo, and because it is a long poem it never goes into enough detail. This novel is depressing at points so I feel that this book is only appropriate for thirteen and up."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though the subject matter of this book might seem a bit old for a Newbury, my older children (9 and up) and I have all loved this amazing story of strength and perseverance.

Because the novel is written using poetry, it allows the reader to move quickly through the story. This does not however, compromise the figurative language, symbolism, and themes present throughout. Details of the story appear to be authentic, but no author's note or afterword is provided to describe what has been fictionalized. Character and setting are well developed and facilitate the movement of the story. The story is strong and inspiring. It could be used in many facets within the classroom including research of the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, exploring the relationships within families, and defining the meaning of \\"home.\\""},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I THOUGHT THIS WAS JUST AN ALL OUT GOOD BOOK.

I remember when Billie Joe was crawling on the ground during a dust storm trying to make it though, and whenever she or someone would bearly open their mouth a dark thick line of dust or mud would string across their teeth.

It was one of the harshest events in history. This book explains how a little girl suvives through the Dust Bowl. Out of the Dust isn't written like regular books. It is written in free verse poetry. At one part in the book, the writing is representing the main character, Billie Jo, playing the piano. This is what we liked because you can see whats going on by how the words are positioned on the page.

This is what I think of when the book Out of the Dust comes to mind. A great novel indeed, placed in the nineteen thirties,in the dust bowl of the United States. The air is clogged, the sky is a dismal,gray and everything from miles hundreds around is covered with a impure,gravelly substance...DUST! Not just part of the land was covered but every single thing there was covered with dust. Billie Jo, when setting the table would have to set the plates, bowls and glasses upside down as not to conceal them with dust. No wonder she wanted to get out, it was a repulsive place, the dust bowl. No trees, no grass, no water and worst of all, there was no where to plant their wheat, which was their only way to survive with the great depression going on. This book was very strong especially since the environment around them was one of the worst of all time."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The story includes many suspenseful and surprising events. One is when a girl named Billie Jo threw a bucket of kerosene at her mother. The story includes some predictable events. The climax changes the story in an unbelievable way because the Ma died with the baby, Franklin. There are a number of interesting and important events which lead to the ending. The ending was &quot;a happily ever after,&quot; which was very unusual."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I am a middle school student and I must admit that I loved this book. I loved it a lot because it was in a kid's perspective, not an adult's. I never actually heard of \\"The Dust Bowl\\" until this book. Every other book on the Dust Bowl that I came across was in an ADULTS point of view. I had to read \\"Out of the Dust\\" for school and I won't lie, i thought that would be just another boring/bad book like always. But it wasn't, i really liked it.. It seemed so real, and I could actually understand what Billie Jo was going through even thought i've never been in something so tragic. I had to give this book the review it disurved. The form it was in was so unique, nothing like any other. It was in a poem form but at the same time like a diary entry. I thought it was really stupied and pointless, but it actually helped me get what was going on in some strange way. I honesty do give this book 5 stars, mayjor thumbs up :)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;Out of the Dust,&quot; written as a series of spare free-verse poems from the viewpoint of a Texas teenager during the 1930s, won the Newbery Award for 1998. My own reading of the book convinced me that the award was well-deserved.Billie Jo's poems span a period of years filled with difficult experiences: poverty, unemployment, her mother's death in an accident, her own maiming in the same accident, her trouble communicating with her father. Her life is certainly not easy, her path almost never smooth. Yet, the poems radiate such a hope, even a joy at times, that the book never becomes depressing.I think some of the images of this book will stick with me for a long time -- the family chewing their dust-laden milk, her mother's tent of pain, her father's smile at the dance, Billie Jo's first concert after recovering from her burns. Billie Jo is a survivor whose story is both thought-provoking and uplifting."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Reading an award-winner is tricky business. This book won the Newbery Medal in 1998. I have read nearly all of the Newbery winners and my rule of thumb for these (unlike some other, less worthy prizes) is that you can expect to read a very good book. This one is no exception. Of course, not even Newbery winners are all created equal. Some are truly great and some are kind of average. This one falls in the middle of this range--let's call it the &quot;not quite truly great&quot; category.Let me say first off that I personally found this to be a wonderful book. I think it is interesting and moving. Though not generally a fan of the free verse/prose poem style Hesse uses in this &quot;novel,&quot; I found that her words generated an emotional response that straight prose might have lessened. I was also surprised by how detailed this world became for me while reading what is a very sparse book. This shows real talent and stylistic strength.On the other hand, though I believe strongly that the best books for children and young adults are equally readable by adults, sometimes an author shoots a little high for the primary readership. Hesse's book is wonderful for adults but a little difficult for younger readers. I was able to let myself be carried away by the beauty of this book because I already have a strong sense about the Depression, life on a farm, the Dust Bowl. A child, however, will struggle with this book because, though strong on feeling, it's short on background.This is not to say that this book is without merit even for younger readers. Its style and emotion are worth a read for anyone, particularly since it is short enough to be read in very little time. In combination with a more historically oriented book or other background on the Depression, a young reader could get even more from this book. Without this, though, many younger readers will struggle with this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a wonderful book and I would encourage anyone of any age to read it. It's about a girl named Billy Joe who plays piano and lives with her family during the \\"Dust Bowl\\". The dust is flying everywhere, the wheat won't grow, and they are living in a run down farm house. The only nice thing Billy Joe and her mom have is the piano. When Billy Joe is at the piano there is no dust, it's just her and the keys. The only problem is that she plays a very different tune then her mom. Her mom does not like that style of music and sometimes doesn't let her perform. That's okay to Billy Joe though, because she loves her mom more than anything else.Billy Joe's dad is a quiet guy that is just trying to grow some wheat. But, because of the dust no wheat will grow. Then, to make matters worse, a horrible accident happens. Her dad had left a bucket of kerosene on the stove, which her mom mistook for water. When she begins making coffee with it the pot bursts into flames. Billy Joe's mom quickly runs out of the house screaming for help. Billy Joe throws the kerosene out of the back door and it lands directly onto her mom. This was a complete accident which results in both Billy Joe and her mom being badly burnt. It is a very sad story, but a really good book. I also like how the words are written like a poem. Every one should read this book!I am an 11 year old boy that plays the guitar, piano and baseball, and I love to draw. I would also recommend The Giver, Number the Stars, and The Hatchet."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Dust storms predominate in the life of Billy Jo, the fourteen-year-old narrator of Out of the Dust. The economic hardship that Billy Jo's family faces in Oklahoma during the Depression comes out in the beautiful free verse that Billy Jo writes in her journal. As her father stubbornly clings to his belief that \\"it's sure to rain soon/wheat's sure to grow\\", her mother grows heavier with child, and their economic woes grow more dismal. Billy Jo's consolation in the face of the desolation is the wonderful dexterity of her fingers on her mother's piano. Then, a horrible accident destroys her family, estranges Billy Jo from her father, and robs her of her piano playing skills. Life becomes unbearable and Billy Jo runs away from home, but a chance meeting makes her realize where her heart lies. The story is bleak as the forces of nature are powerful and the freak accident is terrible but Billy Jo's courageous spirit and the humor in her observations, \\"I hope we get bonus points/ for testing in a dust storm\\" prevent it from degenerating into pessimism. The author's technique of using short, economical lines of poetry reflects the frugal times and also creates the historical background to the story in a simple and uncomplicated manner. Out of the Dust is harsh in its realism, but it leaves the reader with a feeling of hope."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My daughter was allowed to borrow this book from her school library when she was 7 because she tested high on her SRI. She was sitting on the couch reading it with tears welling up in her eyes. I read the book, and it is a beautifully-written, powerful piece, BUT be careful. If your child is not ready for this emotionally, DO NOT allow her/him to read it. The baby and mom die horribly, the father withers away and the girl is racked with guilt and blame. It's not something you give lightly to a child of any age."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"And I know now that all the timeI was trying to getout of the dust,the fact is,what I am,I am because of the dust.And what I am is good enough.Even for me.\\"Billie Jo is a 14-year-old girl who lives in dry Oklahoma filled with constant dust storms.

Karen Hesse has taken the Dust Bowl and narrowed her focus to a single family living in Oklahoma in 1934. Through the eyes of fourteen-year-old Billie Jo, the reader is treated to a series of poems describing the catastrophic events that come from living in a world of dust. Each poem is a small masterpiece, slowly expanding to give the inhabitants of Billie Jo's small Okalahoma town depth and purpose. You meet families migrating west to California, bums on railroad tracks. There are abandoned babies and musicians with names like Mad Dog Craddock and the Black Mesa Boys. To read this book is to find yourself completely immersed in the Depression with Hesse's voice ringing true on every page. The form of this book is perhaps the most impressive. Pulling off a successful book with a plot made entirely in verse is incredibly difficult. Imagine trying to write convincing character development through poetry alone. Fortunately, Hesse is up to the challenge and goes above and beyond the call of duty. You're in safe hands with this adept author. Just don't feel surprised if you suddenly find yourself fighting urges to shower after every dust-thickened line."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Out of the Dust\\" is wonderful, sad, and comedic all at the same time. Karen Hesse is an remarkable writer, especially in free verse poem style. To me, \\"Out of the Dust\\" sounded like it was written during the Great Depression, when I was reading the book I felt I was there; sharing the agony, sorrow, joy, bliss, everything there is to feel in this incredible novel.Billie Jo Kelby, a long-legged, big cheek-boned, girl who loves apples and playing the piano faces an appalling accident in her family. Her life chages in the blink of an eye, making life seem unbearable and almost impossible to go on. On top of it all, Billie Jo has to face a horrible enemy; the dust that consumes her family and the whole towns lives. People never feel clean, wheat is impossible to grow (not to mention any other crop), cattle and livestock starve, and food is covered in dust.After the accident people don't look at billie Jo the same, some hardly recoinize her after what happened. To make it worse her only passion, playing the piano ( which she got from her mother), is lost because she can no longer play. All that is left is to hope for rain in the long, dry drought.Just like today, teenagers back in the 1930's faced almost the same problems. They dealt with blame, \\"\`An accident,' they said. Under there words a finger pointed.\\" They dealt with drunken fathers, \\"They didn't say a word about my father drinking himself into a stupor...\\" and for all those lonely girls out there, \\"Darn that blue-eyed boy with his fine face and his smooth voice....\\" Even though people back in the 1930's talked differently and lived in a whole lot of dust, they still had some of the problems to face as we do now.I think the lesson in hiding for \\"Out of the Dust\\" was to appreciate life (and everything good in it) and keep a hold of the things you keep dear. Most people know the saying \\"you don't know what you got \`till it's gone,\\" and I think that applies for this particular story. Hey, but what do I know? I guess you'll just have to read the book to find out."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo is a twelve-year-old girl living in the Oklahoma dust. She records her life in poem form, and she really lets you get a feel for what life must have been like. The dust brings sadness her poor family. If you lived on a farm, like Billie Jo, you would suffer also from the lack of wheat, since water is so scarce due to dust. Author Karen Hesse enforces the hardness of life in Oklahoma during the dust period.I really enjoyed this book because it puts you in the shoes of someone whose life is VERY different and MUCH harder. It makes you feel like Billie Jo, you have to make decisions that are so much harder than nomral decisions, and each one could change your life.Out of the DUST is a MUST! Even though it is incredibly sad, it is so wonderful that you cannot stop reading! Definitly a five-star read!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I just finised reading it! That book was great! I liked a lot about this book. One thing that made me cry is when Ma got burned, and when Ma and Baby Franklin died. I feel proud and sorry for Billie Jo. I felt proud of Billie Jo when she played the piano at Palace Theatre. I felt sorry for her when Livie Killian moved away and when Ma and Franklin died. The characters I liked were: Mad Dog Craddock, Billie Jo, Ma, Daddy, Miss Freeland and Arley Wanderdale. I think Mad Dog liked Billie Jo is because she had a good talent playing the piano as it says in the chapter &quot;Me and Mad Dog.&quot; I also felt sorry for Billie Jo when she couldn't play the piano anymore because her hands were in a lot of pain."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo's courage is her most endearing quality. Hesse's first person narrator lets us into her mind to see her fears, doubts and guilts. By overcoming these, Billie Jo proves not only that she has &quot;sauce&quot; but heart as well.

This book intimately reflects this devestating and important period of American history."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Heese's Out of the Dust was excellent.

That is a myth that was dispelled for me upon completion of the very first poem. Here is a book with enormous power, where the language conveys not only the essential elements of a compelling story, but also the rhythm of the landscape and the emotions of 13 year old girl at the heart of the story. The verse allowed the reader to appreciate the beauty and power of the language used, it encouraged you to slow down, to pause in the middle of a sentence to appreciate the beauty of the language and the images it conveyed. It also enabled constant change of pace, one minute active and quick, the next quiet and contemplative. But above all, I am grateful to this book for opening up a chapter of history, of which, as a non-American, I was unaware. The hardships of the &quot;dust bowl&quot; were vividly brought to life and explained in a way that I could appreciate not only the tragedy but the lesson that sounds throughout the book about working with, rather than against the land, and of the dangers of over-exploitation. I am currently reading the &quot;Grapes of Wrath&quot;, which I am also really enjoying. However I credit &quot;Out of the Dust&quot; for the effect the latter novel is having on me, for it is &quot;Out of the Dust&quot; which gave me the background to appreciate what life must have been like in the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is beautiful because of its simplicity. It is my first experience reading a book written in free verse and I have to say that it was much more effective than I could have ever imagined it to be. I could have never guessed that so few words could move me in the way that Out of the Dust did. Karen Hesse leaves a lot of room for interpretation and for the individual reader to experience the words in their own way. I found the verse titled \\"Boxes\\" to be particularly moving - \\"In my closet are two boxes, the gatherings of my life, papers, school drawings, a broken hairpin, a dress from my baby days, my first lock of hair, a tiny basket woven from prairie grass, a doll with a china head, a pink ball, three dozen marbles, a fan from Baxter's Funeral Home, my baby teeth in a glass jar, a torn map of the work, two candy wrappers, a thousand things I haven't looked at in years. I kept promising to go through the boxes with Ma and get rid of what I didn't need, but I never got to it and now my hands hurt. And I haven't got the heart\\".This is one that I would definitely recommend to adults. It is deeply moving.

As the novel moves forward, Billie Jo learns about love and loss through her relationships with her mother, her father, her music, and the land. Her voice is as real as the Oklahoma dust.For young readers, the book provides a great introduction into the contemporary world of free verse.

Hesse includes an appendix she calls \\"after words\\" which has some useful information concerning the historical setting of the novel and how she came to write the book.

You live in dusty Oklahoma, where rain is a rare sight and dust storms are frequent. Suddenly, a horrible accident occurs which causes your mother and her expecting baby to die, and leaving your hands crippled. The only thing that could have helped you get through this disaster would be playing the piano, but with your crippled hands it is nearly impossible.This is the situation of 14 year old Billie Jo Kelby, who is forced to live on a farm with her father, but with all the dust storms and little rain they get growing wheat is impossible. Her father refuses to talk about the accident, leaving Billie Jo scared and confused about what to do.Out of the Dust is written in free-verse poetry from Billie Jo's viewpoint, making it an interesting read. I'd reccommend this book to people over the age of ten, because the author gave a very detailed explination of the accident that killed Billie Jo's mother and baby brother and may give younger children nightmares. Although it is an easy read, it teaches a very important life lesson and should be read by all."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My 4th-grade son came home really upset about a book that his teacher was reading aloud to them in class called \\"Out of Dust\\". He had nightmares that night and has refused to go to bed alone since then.

I can't believe that the teacher is reading this to 9 and 10-year-olds or that the author wrote it for that age group. Here is just a portion of the gory stuff:\\"I got burned bad. Daddy put a pail of kerosene next to the stove and Ma, fixing breakfast, thinking the pail was filled with water, lifted it, to make Daddy's coffee, poured it, but instead of making coffee, Ma made a rope of fire. It rose up from the stove to the pail and the kerosene burst into flames. ... I flew back and grabbed it, throwing it out the door. I didn't know. I didn't know Ma was coming back.\\"The flaming oil splashed onto her apron, and Ma, suddenly Ma, was a column of fire. ...\\"At first I felt no pain, only heat.

It doesn't even have a face. Daddy brings her water, and drips it inside the slit of her mouth by squeezing a cloth.\\"\\"I couldn't aim the dripping cloth into her mouth. I couldn't squeeze. It hurt the blisters on my hands to try. I only made it worse for Ma. She cried for the pain of the water running into her sores, she cried for the water that would not soothe her throat and quench her thirst, and the whole time my father was in Guymon, drinking.\\"After a little more gore, the mother and the baby that she gave birth to right after the fire both die. It talks about people blaming the girl even though it was the father who put the pail of kerosene by the fire.My son keeps talking about how horrible the girl must have felt and that she probably could never forgive herself. He said that if he accidentally killed me like that, he wouldn't be able to go on and he'd just kill himself. This is obviously not a healthy book for him, and I doubt it is good for other children either.Please don't buy this book for elementary school children, and if you're a teacher, for goodness sake don't make the children read it, and especially don't read it to them out loud!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I'm 11 years old and I absolutely LOVE this book.I know a lot of people don't like it because of all the deaths,but that's life.You live,you die.I like this book book for countless reasons,three of which I will share.One,it has wonderful poems.I love poems.They take a lot of effort to write.Two,it's a great example of a poem format.Teachers can use examples from this book when they teach free-verse poetry.Three,it was very touching to me.I have to admit,the most touching poem was \\"hard times.\\" That was the best poem I've read.Beautiful.Overall,this is a wonderful book & I encouge anyone who is interested to read it.Everyone needs a good book in their lives."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time.

I really like how the author puts her descriptions in free write. It really makes the book very easy to get the hang of. When I read the first page , it was very catchy because of the wording and describing she does. The book gave me pretty deep thoughts like,&quot; What if I was Billie Jo?&quot; and,&quot; What would I do in this situation?&quot;. At the end of the book I really wanted to know more on Billie Jo after the dust storm , if her hands healed , if Daddy's pond was finished , or how Louise was and if she joined the family. It was so good that I read it again , and again , then again. Now, I just want Karen Hesse to make a sequel of the book cause I want to know what happened to Billie Jo. Also , it would be nice to make a movie of it , that would be cool. Honestly , this book was awesome!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought this book was really interesting because, it showed me what life was like in the Dust Bowl. I couldn't imagine how my family and I would ever surivive back then.

The main character of the book is Billie Jo, a 12-year-old girl with great ambition for the piano.

For example, her hands had many blisters on them and when ma died and here brother died I felt sad like Bille Jo. My favorite poem is the &quot;Burns&quot;. The reason I like it is because it describes how she is feeling. An example of this is first I felt no pain, only heat, and I thought I might be swallowed by the heat, like &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; nothing would be left of me .

It never seemed to go right, except with me.&quot;(Hesse,4). Billie Jo, a thirteen year old girl living in the &quot;pan handle state&quot;, feels like a complete disappointment to her father. All of her life she knew she would never be accepted by her father because she was a girl and he wanted a boy, but a tragic accident with kerosene leaves her pregnant mother dead and Billy Jo severely burned. This would change their relationship forever. Alone with her depressed father and the dangerous dust storms, she comes to realize the hardships of life in the Great Depression. On a desperate search to find herself, she realizes that she needs her father as much as he needs her to survive and family is the most important key to survival. Reading this book was like riding a roller coaster; it had its high and exciting points, but dropped you to a low depressing point. It was very creatively written and different to see a point of view from the eyes of a child surviving the Great Depression and trying to get Out of the Dust."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;After seventy days of wind and sun, of wind and clouds, of wind and sand, after seventy days, of wind and dust, a little rain came.&quot; (Hesse, 23)Karen Hesse's Newbery Award winning novel Out of the Dust tells the story of thirteen-year-old Billie Jo and life in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl. Hesse deftly uses long, narrative verse and creates a vivid image of Billie Jo's close-knit community and of their long endurance of the hostile natural environment they live in. Each event is told in the form of a poem. My personal favorite was &quot;Fields of Flashing Light&quot;. It isn't a happy poem; on the contrary, it's about a dust storm and what dust storms did to the farms, and to families. But I think that makes it all the more meaningful.&quot;I sensed it before I knew it was coming. I heard it, Smelled it, Tasted it. Dust.&quot; (Hesse, 31)One of the many strong metaphors Hesse uses is&quot;The wind snatched the snow right off the fields, leaving behind a sea of dust, waves and waves and waves of dust, rippling across our yard.&quot; (Hesse, 33)Out of the Dust opened my eyes to things I could never imagine about life in extreme natural conditions and also reinforced that the human spirit can endure just about anything."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;I am awkward with him, and irritated, and I want to be alone but I am terrified of being alone&quot;. This is a quote that I feel I can relate to in a way. My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is &quot;The Empty Spaces&quot;. This book is appropriate for 13-15 year olds. Any younger than 13 won't understand most of these poems. I disliked this book, even though I have not read the whole thing. I thought it was too boring and I would not want to say &quot;Oh that was a good book&quot; when there was a discussion going on about it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem in the story is \\"Motherless\\". The poem describes how sad and dreadful the main character,Billy Joe, feel after her mother's death. \\"If Ma could put her arm across my shoulder sometime, or stroke back my hair, or sing me to sleep, making the soft sounds, the reassuring noises, that no matter how brittle and sharp life seemed, no matter how brittle and sharp she seemed, she was still my ma who loved me, then I think I wouldn't be so eager to go.\\" (Hesse, 148)The poem made me feel dredful. This one quote was enough to show Billy Joe's sadness. I think this book is enough to warm all ages of people's heart. Each words and each phrase are heart warming. This book has similes like \\"Legs running like fence rails down to a giant foot.\\"(Hesse, 187)I liked this book because it was very interesting to use a poem to tell a story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;On Sunday, winds came, bringing a red dust like prairie fire, hot and peppery, searing the inside of my nose, the whites of my eyes.&quot; This quote is a perfect example of the events that take place in Out of the Dust. It is from the poem &quot;Dust and Rain,&quot; which is about how dust comes sweeping over the prairie very often, but how rain rarely comes. This poem could almost be used as a summary of the entire book because of how it talks about dust. Dust and dust storms are the main threat of life to Billie Jo living in the Oklahoma dust bowl. Even if the dust doesn't kill her, in her opinion it is ruining her life. It comes and covers everything, even her beloved piano. Besides the dust, a series of bad events happen which causes Billie Jo to burn herself and leave her without her mother. As Billie Jo grows older, missing her mother and not being able to play the piano because of her disfigured hands, she has to learn to live with the dust and all the other &quot;bad&quot; things in her life. This book is written entirely in the form of free verse poetry. Although it is poetry, sometimes it seems more like a diary or journal entry. The poetry in this book is filled with metaphors and similes, among other types of figurative language. One example of a metaphor is when Billie Jo's dad is talking about how dust is everywhere, including in their food. &quot;Chocolate milk for dinner, aren't we in clover!&quot; This is just one example of many metaphors throughout the book. I thought that this book was very well written, but I still didn't like it very much. It was horribly depressing along with being very slow moving and a little bit confusing. The poems would just skip around on different subject matters and would seem to go on forever. One depressing event would happen after the other. If you don't mind being a little depressed, then this would be a good book for you to read. I would recommend this book for anybody from 5th grade to adult."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;I couldn't tell her, Couldn't bring myself to say, Her apples were gone. I never had a chance. Ma died that day Giving birth to my brother.&quot;(Hesse, 69) Out of the Dust is a sad, depressing, and disturbing novel. The whole book is written in poems that describe how Billie Jo learns the hardships of life through death, depression, and dust. This book is about the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Billie Jo and her family work day by day just to survive. This book is appropriate for teens. I found this book depressing because Karen Hesse describes death and suffering through poems in the book. Out of the Dust is a book that made me think about suffering, and how life in the Dust Bowl felt. I recommend this book only if you like sad books."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think this is a very thought provoking book.

Three Cheers to Billy Jo!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, a book by Karen Hesse, is one of the best books I have ever read. To begin with, this book gives off a certain mood, sad and dreary. It makes you feel sorry for the narrator because she has to wipe the dust off of everything before using it. Next, in parts it could make you cry. As her mother is carrying a child soon to be born, Billy Joe, the narrator, accidentally sets her mother afire. Having done this, the mother and baby die. Last, it makes you think of how lucky you are to live in the twenty-first century. In the book's time period, the Great Depression, dust is everywhere, on food, in clothing, on her piano, in her hair, mouth, eyes, ears, and covers the ground. I believe that after reading Out of the Dust, I became a changed person."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse is too dramatic. It had no happy ending, which most readers love.Karen Hesse wrote details and descriptions very well. I find this very hard to do. However, I personally thought it was too descriptive by using words and phrases like, \\"a rope of fire bursts into flames, column of fire, beating, and burning pail\\".Out Of The Dust is definitely not a children's book and it should only be read by young adults. I read this book with fifteen other young adults and I could tell most of them though some parts were just a little too gory.I could not give it an exact star because it's slow start gave it a \\"5\\" the middle was the best with a \\"10\\" and at the end it went down to a \\"6\\".Overall, I think the book was fair in a sense that it took Hesse probably a long time to write the book and put a piece of herself in the book, she must feel pain if she gets a bad review. I will do her a favor and give her book 10 stars. I enjoyed the book. Thank you Karen Hesse for writing such a moving book.ATK"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is about a girl named Billie Jo and her family. Billie Jo and her family live in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl. Thousands of people are suffering and dying while Billie Jo and her family try to survive. Billie Jo is put into tough positions and is forced to overcome them. Like when she accidentally pours a burning pail of kerosene on her mom which burns her. The mother eventually dies of dehydration because of the burn. Billie Jo overcomes the accidents in good ways. Like when Billie Jo and her dad wouldn't speak much Billie Jo started talking to him about how she felt, and that patched up the relationship. Out of the Dust is written in free verse. In some poems the style of writing is like how Billie Jo feels. Billie Jo narrates the whole story. The book is very descriptive which makes you feel like you are there. The author does a great job of describing the hard times. One bad part of the book is that the ending is not complete like a happily ever after story, but it pretty much tells what happens. Overall the author did a great job with this story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"the book Out of the Dust was great! it was about a little girl who's mother dies because of a bad burn. It was during the great depression when dust storms came around. It also talks about what happens in her town. After her mother dies her dad acts weird. He starts digging a big hole in his backyard. She is also a great piano player but she can't play because of a bad burn accident.

Out of The Dust is about a girl who is living in the Dust Bowl. She is about ready to give up because she throws hot kerosene on her mother is burned very badly. I like this book and I don't like some of the sad parts. I rate this book 9."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"There are many poems in the novel Out of the Dust that vary in many ways, such as length, disposition, and events. Some of my favorite poems in the novel are &quot;The Piano Player&quot;, or &quot;Kilauea&quot;, but my preferred poem is definitely &quot;The Accident&quot;, for the reason that it is the climax of the story, though not for good. This took place in &quot;Summer 1934&quot;, and changed everyone's lives, including the reader. This was the most tragic of all, out of all the horrible and tragic events that happened to the abysmal family. It depressed the lives of Billie Joe, and was quite a shock. She first lost her mother, and then learned that she was not going to have a little brother. It also meant that she was going to live with her father, which was not quite favorable in her point of view. This was a shock to her, and could've lived a much happier life without it. In addition, her self-esteem sharply decreased, because she accidentally threw the kerosene lamp at her, which contributed to her mother's death. She felt like it was her who killed her mother. This was the biggest change in her depressing life.I believe that this novel would be fitting for readers aged eleven and up. I have this theory based on several facts. First of all, the important facts &quot;Jump&quot; out at the reader. Instead of the novel saying &quot;My mother faced a fierce hardship today and feels that her live will cease to exist&quot;, it says &quot;And she was suddenly a column of fire&quot; (Hesse, 61) Besides the facts appealing to the reader, Out of the Dust is a &quot;quick read&quot;, it does not take long to read. It is a short book that is filled with wonderful poems that each take up half of the page, at most. It does not contain much violence, therefore could be suitable for any reader aged eleven or up, because anybody younger would be mentally affected by this, and could perhaps influence their developing brain. Based on these three facts, I conclude that Out of the Dust is a novel that all readers of all ages will appreciate.My favorite poetic device that I enjoyed reading in this novel is definitely the large amount of figurative language. Figurative language was very ubiquitous in the novel, anywhere you look, and it will appear. For example, in &quot;Dust Storm&quot;, &quot;Their voices rose like ghosts on the howling wind&quot; (Hesse, 143). In &quot;Migrants&quot;, there is another case of figurative language usage. &quot;And sparse as the hair on a dog's belly&quot; (Hesse, 160). Additionally, in &quot;Let Down&quot;, there is a metaphor. &quot;I think we're both turning to dust&quot; (Hesse, 175). The way that these examples of figurative language were found was by opening the book to a random page, and looking for either a simile or metaphor. There was at least one on every page. Figurative language is a large piece of the novel, and the novel would shatter like a baseball hitting a glass window, without it.I enjoyed this book more than I normally enjoy most. It is a wonderful book that is full of the elements that a book needs in order to satisfy the reader's &quot;Hunger&quot;. This is a great book for many more reasons than the ones stated above, and definitely deserved the Newberry Medal."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"A heart breaking story.Billie Jo is a poor girl with a great love of piano .

This book is about a girl that lives in the dust bowl and what she goes through. In the book there is very little writing about the actual dust storms and how they were. I thought that when I was going to read this book that there would be more descriptive events and how the dust bowl came about and it would be more historical and I would learn more than I already knew. I thought that the reading went very slowly and there was not enough action in this book. I give this book 3 out of 5 star because I think that people with a historical background of this event would take it more personally and possibly enjoy it. I also give this book 3 out of 5 stars because I liked that the stories was written in pomes and how all the pomes come together to form one big story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I can't comment on the portion beyond the very disturbing/violent incident...I'm an adult and was upset for months after reading it. This book is NOT APPROPRIATE FOR KIDS."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust was a disappointment. I was disturbed by how poorly written it was. The plot is hard to follow, as this book is written from the perspective of a teenage girl. She can go on and on about nothing of any significance, distracting readers from the actual storyline.If this were a movie, I'd call it a 'chick flick'. It is all about a girl and her feelings. Of course, it's possible that people will read it for it's historical, rather than literary, significance. As for that, I'd stick with Steinbeck. His works are full of history, and they don't look like a 14-year-old wrote them.Out of the Dust has little or no historical teachings. It's all about the girl-I pity those who are forced to read this for it's history lessons. The book doesn't talk about why-it talks about what. This is what happened. This is what I thought about it. I'm going to paint my nails bright red. That's basically what the book sounds like. No explanations, just blah.Don't get me wrong. As badly written as this book is, is has a moral. It has a plot, no matter how hard it is to follow. The girl must have had incredible courage do what she did in the circumstances that she did it in took incredible courage, drive and stamina.But then again, that's been done to death. Most books with underlying morals like that have something along those lines. Some of them are written like a teen would; others seem more professional. This book is, at best, middle of the run. How it won a Newberry, I don't know. If Hesse can do it, then I guess that literally anyone can.I read the reviews, then read the book. ....Better to spend the money on true Great Depression historical literature-I highly recommend any one of Steinbeck's works for that purpose."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This must be one of the worst pieces of literature I have ever read in my 16 years. Thank you, Waldron Mercy Academy, for providing me with such lovely book suggestions to brighten my spirit and enrich my mind. Despite my obviously intense loathing of this book, notice I did not use the word \\"trash\\" to describe it and that's because it isn't. In fact, it's a very well-written book, done in free verse style. While the author posesses skill, I could not bring myself to enjoy this book. Why?It chronicles a piece of history, the Oklahoma Dust Bowl, to be exact. We watch as Billie Jo, a helpless little girl, loses everyone and everything she cares for. Her mother and unborn brother? Dead. Burned to death. Her father? Alive but seemingly dead, in a trance-like state as if he is amidst a literal out-of-body experience. The man's got to grieve.Billy Jo talks, in her free-verse diary, about her family's (or what's left of it) crops being destroyed by the storms. THERE IS NO HOPE FOR ANYONE! EVERYONE DIES! I usually detest bubblegum-happy endings that I sometimes find in YA fluff I'm often drawn to at Borders and Barnes, but I was almost wishing for a happy ending in poor little Billie Jo's case.Hesse seems drawn to depressing topics - maybe everyone around her croaked, who knows? She is talented, I'll give her that - and I do rather like LETTERS TO RIFKA, which I would recommend instead of this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"A grat book with alot of sad parts and a grat ending"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"this book is my favret it was sad and happy it's the best book ever ma and franklen die but billie jo dills with it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was the dumbest book I have ever read.

I am surprised that so many people said that it was depressing and &quot;compelling&quot;. I had to read this for school, and that was the only reason I finished at all. This book uses the same classic milksop storyline as do many. &quot;Oh Daddy, we're going to lose the farm. But I still love you.&quot; I do give the author credit for her innovative way of writing the book, but at the same time it also made it worse. The way it was written lacked details in the more important things, like the whole scene where she runs away. I saw no real reason for her to leave, or return, except the author thought it would be interesting. Also at one part, she introduces a character by saying they died.

The Newbery Award winning book Out Of the Dust is a wonderful historical fiction novel. The author, Karen Hesse has also written some other fantastic novels such as, The Music of Dolphins, A time Of Angels, and Phoenix Rising. Out Of the Dust has 227 pages but it is more interesting when it is long that's why I liked it. The book was great because it was sad and exiting.Billie Jo, the main character, is a great pianist. She watches her mom all the time. Billie Jo goes to a talent show and does awesome. Billie Jo had a pretty normal life. Then the accident began one summer when Billie Jo's dad left kerosene next to the stove her ma thought it was water so she had poured the kerosene into a coffee mug, but instead a ring of fire sprung up. What will happen next?The author Karen Hesse did a great job at describing things in the story. It helped me understand the book better and easier. This also helped me visualize and make a picture in my head. It was so descriptive I felt like I was in the book. For example when Billie Jo played the piano at the theatre Karen Hesse totally described her feelings.I loved how Karen Hesse wrote in poem form. It made the book stand out and easy to read. I could definitely understand it better. One of the reasons why it was a good book was because Karen Hesse has a very unique style. Karen Hesse explains everything perfectly. I was amazed. I didn't expect the book to be this good. I thought it was a great book even though it was sad. This book had a lot of informational and detailed, parts in it. It was very inspiring.I am tempted to read it again. Out Of the Dust has become one of my favorite books. I recommend this book to children and adults because they could have some connections to the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I really liked this book because it has alot of feelings that I can relate to. Shock and denial, acceptance, anger, etc.Billie Jo has her hard times but she handles it with help and on her own.Sadly I have to disagree with people who turn this book down. Yeah, sure, it has some depressing things but they all relate to real life. (Maybe not the kerosene thing but people DO get burned.)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read Out of The Dust when i was probably 11, and i LOVED it!

I had no idea how difficult it was to live in the Dust Bowl during the Great Deppression. The way the book was written in free verse poetry helped convey the book's powerful message.

It won the 1998 John Newbery Award. The book is tied on some ways to the Depression Years because it took place then. Depression is a period of low general economic activity marked especially by rising levels of unemployment.In the years of 1934 and 1935 in the state of Oklahoma, the dust bowl is raging. Bobby Jo, the main character of this book is given this name by her father, because he wanted a boy. Bobby Jo keeps a journel, and writes down the events that happen in a poem form.Bobby Jo talks about how the Depression and the dust bowl seems to be getting worse. Bobby Jo seems to understand what is going on. A large number of people are losing their jobs, the dust bowl is destroying crops, and there isn't really a lot of money. It is making her family and friends miserable because you have to work really hard just to survive. Bobby Jo lives on a farm covered by dust. Dust storms occur very often in the mid-west. The dust storms are destroying farmer's crops and animals, so people are losing their jobs. There are shortages of food and water causing people to go hungry.Bobby Jo talks about how she is saddend by people moving away from where she lives. One person was her friend Livie Killian. Bobby Jo's mother is supposed to have a baby, but an accident caused by her father changes all of that. The accident leaves Bobby Jo's hands crippled, and her mother's whole body burned. The mother and the baby die, leaving just Bobby Jo and her father. For the rest of the book, Bobby Jo and her father try to bond with each other and get along, but her father seems to have gone slightly crazy. Bobby Jo starts to worry. Her dad is starting to get spots on his skin. Weird spots. Bobby jo gets so fustrated that she runs away out of the dust.After meeting a man who also ran away, she decides that she needs to go back to see her father. When she comes home, her dad finds out the spots on his skin were cancer, and so he gets them removed. Bobby Jo meets his dad's new girlfriend , Louise. Louise helps Bobby Jo and her dad solve their problems, and as she does, Bobby Jo relizes that she likes Louise. And in the end, Bobby Jo discovers that something good can come out of something bad."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse's \\"Out of the Dust\\" was very interesting. Hesse's use of vivid language, her style of writing, and the interesting plot that she created can not be matched.\\"Out of the Dust\\" was written in a style different than most Newbery Medal winners. This story was written in free verse poetry, instead of the usual paragraph form. This was a very smart choice, though. Her free verse poetry described the characters and the events much better than other stories. It easily created a clear, descriptive picture in my mind.The author of \\"Out of the Dust\\" made her writing explanatory and colorful, too. She used similes and metaphors to catch the reader's attention and create a work of art. For example, Karen Hesse described the main character as a \\"long-legged girl\\" with \\"cheekbones like bicycle handles\\". It was not hard to follow the text in this book.The plot in this book is one of a kind. Taken place in the 1930's, during a time when dust storms and the Great Depression rocked the American well-being, a young, red-headed girl tries to survive this terrible time that she lives in. This girl faces all kinds of conflicts, including human vs. nature, human vs. self, and even human vs. society. Throughout her journey in life, she realizes many things about her family that takes great effect on her. As a daughter and a friend, she becomes a better person.\\"Out of the Dust\\", by Karen Hesse, was beautifully written. The story was well-thought out, with many twists and turns along the way. It was a brilliant piece of writing, and certainly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is one of the most memorable books that I have read in a long time. Karen Hesse, the author, captured the despair and tragedy of the time period in a remarkable way. The story takes place during the mid 1930's in the heart of the Dust Bowl and is told in poem form through the eyes of a young girl named Billie Jo. She tells us that her name was the result of her father's desire to have a son. Billie Jo's life unfolds in a series of poetic journal entries that disclose the events she is forced to endure. Some events are good; however, most are tragic and life changing for our young narrator. The events force us to feel the pain of this likable young girl as if we were personally experencing them with her. I highly recommend this book to all who enjoy reading books that evoke powerful emotions."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo, the 13 year old narrator of the story, tells of her life in the Oklahoma panhandle during the mid 1930's. She lives with her mother and father, has a hunger for playing fierce piano and a fondness for apples. Billie Jo has to face all the problems that came with living in the Dust Bowl, but to make things worse, a terrible accident has changed her life forever. Her mother has passed away and Billie Jo and her father are going through tough times. I gave Out of the Dust 4 out of 5 stars. I thought that is was very interesting that Karen Hesse could tell the entire story in free verse poems. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about historical events or wants to learn more about the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It is in the 1930's and ferocious dust storms sweep away all topsoil leaving southeastern Colorado, southwestern Kansas, eastern New Mexico and the panhandles of Texas and Oklahoma soil less. The Dust Bowl forced an exhausting drought onto the land, making farmers desperate for rain through out the harsh ten years it dragged on. Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust describes the brutal dust storms and the life of thirteen-year-old Billie Jo Kelby, a girl from the Oklahoma panhandle, in an exciting; captivating book that helps you learn about the Dust Bowl while still enjoying the excitement of a fictional storyline. In rating the book on a scale of one to ten, I would rate the book an eight because of the poetic form the book was written in and because of the interesting story line behind it all. Out of the Dust was an exciting book to read and an interesting link to the historical facts of the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, a heartfelt tale that vividly describes the tragic life of living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Knowing that on any one day you could come home and your house could be covered in a drift of dust. Choking down food while you feel the sandy, grit slide down your throat. Billie Jo Kelby was comfortable living her life with her Mother and Father in the dust bowl until a horrible accident left her mother with mortal burns and her hands just stumps of what used to be able play a beautiful piano. With very little to live for, a distant relationship with her father and eventually the death of her mother while giving birth to her baby brother. Billie Jo had to get out. Leaving what was left of her life behind, searching to find out what really matters the most to her. Just to come home to find the faintest glimmer of hope in what used to be a plain of despair. This book really keeps the reader in suspense. All the hidden feelings of Billie Jo, can be seen through Karen Hesse's wonderful work of weaving an intricate personality for Billie Jo and still teaching the reader a great deal of the things endured by the people living in the Dust Bowl at this time."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Overall, I thought &quot;Out Of The Dust&quot; was an outstanding, intriguing novel. Karen Hesse was excellent with the way she wrote the book. I think this was the thing I enjoyed most about it-the way it was written in poems. It was unique to me, because most other poems I have read were usually in rhyme. Hesse used such descriptive writing when she wrote this book. For example, in the entry called &quot;Dust Storm&quot; she uses metaphors and similies to describe the occurence. It reads, &quot;Brown earth rained down from sky. I could not catch my breath the way the dust pressed on my chest and wouldn't stop...the dust made muddy tracks across my tongue.&quot; Her eloquent writing makes you feel like you are in the novel. That is one more thing I enjoyed about &quot;Out Of The Dust&quot; was how the reader felt apart of the story the entire time. Hesse used such expressive text in her literature, hence it made you picture yourself in the situations that were occuring. One situation was in the entry &quot;Almost Rain&quot; when Billie Jo says &quot;The clouds hung low over the farm.The air felt thick. It smelled like rain.&quot; I can imagine myself in a situation like this, and I know how the characters in the novel are feeling. The only fault I found in &quot;Out Of the Dust&quot; by Karen Hesse was how there wasn't much dialogue in the text. Most of the novels I enjoy have conversations going on, and dialogue is in the text. In this book, there isn't much conversing happening. That is why I rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars. I enjoyed Hesse's literature and her expressive writing, but I wish there was more dialogue to read throughout the novel."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is the story of a 14-year-old girl named Bille Jo and all the hardships she faces while living on the Oklahoma Panhandle during the Great Depression. The most terrible of all the hardships that Bille Jo faces in the novel is her mother dying in a tragic accident. Billie Jo feels that she is partially to blame for the accident which makes it all the more depressing. I love the way Karen Hesse writes this novel in free verse poem. I feel it gave me a better perspective of Billie Jo and that it was much more emotional then it would have been if it had just been written like a regular novel. I also feel that due to the fact that the novel was written in free verse poetry, it was much more descriptive than a regular novel. Sometimes it got so so descriptive I actually felt like I was right there next to Billie Jo. It completly blew me away. This book reminded me not to take things for granted and also to be thankful for what I have. I really enjoyed this book. I felt it was extremly well written and that it definently deserved the Newbery Award. However, due to the fact that this book is extremly depressing I would only recommend it to people 10+. If you enjoyed reading this book, I would also recommend that you read Letters from Rifka and The Music of The Dolphins, two other books written by Karen Hesse."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Hello, I just finished reading Out of the dust I gave it 4 stars because I didn't like how it was in poem form. I prefer a book that is written like a regular chapter book. I think the book is good over all because I liked how Karen Hesse gave a great description of the history of the Dust Bowl. I think if someone that lives in Texas or Oklahoma they would remember the dust storm and how horrible it was."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;On Sunday, winds came, bringing a red dust like prairie fire, hot peppery, searing the inside of my nose, the whites of my eyes. Roaring dust, Turning the day from sunlight to midnight.&quot; (Hesse, 46) Billie Jo, a thirteen-year-old girl, had to face this horror day after day. Out of the Dust is a compelling tale of Billie Jo's hardship of living in the Dust Bowl and Great Depression. Every time a dust storm hits, her family is in danger of losing their farm. After the stove fire crisis, which leaves her mother and Billie Jo terribly burned, eventually kills her mother as well as her newborn baby brother. When the tragedy strikes, Billie Jo's love grows stronger for her father, and for the piano. This is a very interesting and compelling story of this young girls courage, and I enjoyed it very much. I recommend this novel to eight years olds or older. I think once you have read this book, you will be captured by the courage and strife that comes with the dust storms. EW"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse introduces young adults to a time in history that is often overshadowed by policis and economic failure: The Great Depression. Very few books, especially in the catagory of young adults, deals directly with the emotions, fears, and tragedies of a young girl living in Oklahoma during the era of the Dust Bowl. Hesse's character, Billie Jo, represents one child's life and although her tragedies and heartbereak are unique, she grants children a place in history. The poetic style, on the other hand, enables young adult readers to read and interpet each experience independently or to reflect upon them as a whole. While Billie Jo allows the reader to experience a part of history through the eyes of a child, Hesse's writing ability allows us to experience the dust bowl. Through her words we can invision the dust as its rolls across the land or feel the physical and emotion pain of a young girl whose life has been forever changed by death. As a student of history and english, I found the book, Out of the Dust, to be educational as well as enjoyable and stongly recommend it for students at the levels of young adults and beyond. I would hesitate introducing it to a younger audience because of the detail surrounding the mother's death and Billie Jo's injuries."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I personally think this is a great book and you should read it.

This is even harder for Billie Jo because he father won't talk about her mother's death. There is one thing that makes Billie Jo feel better and that is playing the Piano. Even though the devistating dust storms are making families flee away from Oklahoma, Billie Jo finds peace in her own heart by staying and working through her feelings.There are a lot of great poems in the book, Out of the Dust, but the one thing that I find most interesting is \\"Finding a Way\\". This poem talkes about how two people are able to forgive one another for their wrong doings after several months and move on, even if it's a struggle to keep up with one another. I also like this poem because it gives me hope that familes can work out their differences.The stoy is bleak but age approprite for kids in their teens mostly because younger kids woulden't get an actual feel for the story. Teens will be more aware of the diffuculties in life.One literary devise that I have noticed that really enrichens tjis novel is the poetry is used to tie everything together and make it flow in such a way that the reader actually feels like he/she is in the story.I enjoyed this book because it was very interesting to read about a poor family struggling through hard times such as death and teribble dust storms.

Her life changes dramatically when her Mother and brother die during childbirth. Her relationship with her Father was not that good because they did not have much in common. Billie Jo ran away on the train to the West to get away from the Dust Bowl. She met a man in a boxcar and decided to go back home to make the best of things with her father.My favorite Poem was \\"Homeward BoundEbecause it shows how lonely Billie Jo was when she ran away .I think it is mean to show that it is better to forgive and work things out than to run away.The book is good for 6-9th graders because Billie Jo is about that same age. It has some gross things in it like describing the burns from the accident that would not be good for younger readers.The literary device that the author uses is writing in poems. This makes the book seem much more personal and makes you feel close to Billie Jo.I liked the book because it taught me about what life was like during the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I absolutely loved this book!

Written in free verse poetry, the story has a unique sense of rhythm coupled with vivid imagery and poignant emotions. The format of the book makes the reader feel as though you are being allowed to read Billy Jo's private journal entries. Because the book is such a quick read, the dated entries, along with the seasonal imagery, help remind the reader of the time frame of events. While this book is about forgiveness, I also think of it as a coming of age story, with our main character maturing in many ways throughout the book. Out of the Dust would make a wonderful addition to a classroom environment especially when discussing the Great Depression because of the vivid imagery and realistic trials experienced. I found Billy Jo easy to relate to. This book is also historically accurate as Karen Hesse did a great amount of research on the Dust Bowl during the Depression."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"For Billie Jo a fourteen-year-old living in the Oklahoma panhandle playing the piano is the only thing that comforts her.

But when she gets the chance to escape she learns about companionship, forgiveness and most of all family. Throughout this novel you feel Billie's emotions and thoughts.

She wrestles with her mother's discipline and her father's silence. She has friends and homework and she feels awkward with boys. What makes Billie Jo's struggles so hard is the dust. Everything, her whole life, is covered in a sea of dust. Still, in the midst of it all Billie Jo dreams.She dreams of the baby growing inside her mother and she ponders what it would be like to have a sibling. She has been alone for14 years. She dreams of playing piano in the Palace and she dreams of a life free of dust. She watches as the dust drives people away. They leave their homes and their families to find a life away from the dust. They blow away with the wheat fields. Billie Jo fights the desperation of the choking dust and she learns that the only force of nature worse that dust is fire.As she sits in the kitchen watching her mother make breakfast, Billie Jo's dreams are consumed in fire. Her mother is badly burned in a horrible accident and Billie Jo in an attempt to save her mother and brother beats out the flames with her bare hands.Billie Jo's disfiguring accident scars her hands and her heart. She tries to play the piano for comfort, but the pain is too much.

As the town struggles together to eke out an existence, she finds hope and she begins to heal. She learns to bear the emptiness of her loss and she learns how to \\"make things last through winters and drought.\\"Using the strong, simple voice of Billie Jo, Karen Hesse describes how the Dust Bowl tested the land and character of the Oklahoma farmers. This story is not sentimental. Its sparse, matter-of-fact style of free verse captures the battle of those whose lives were withered by drought and yet they managed to stay rooted and survive."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, was in my opinion, was a great book that teaches kids about live in the Great Depression. It makes me feel lucky to not have been born in the 1930's back then.This story takes place in Oklahoma and is about a girl named Billie Jo and her life in the depression with out her died mother that died giving birth to her son. Billie Jo loves apples and playing the piano. She says it helps her calm down when any thing bad happens, but after a terrible accident it's impossible with her wounds. In the dpression there were many dust storms that drove many farms and houses away exept Billie Jo and her family. They were stuck there with the terrible life style. Her father is a drinker and never wants to talk about the accident that caused he's wife to die. Out Of The Dust, I think, tells a very sad story.This book helps readers to understand the challeges that the people had to go through. Dust storms. Many deaths. Stuff that people this days never really have to worry about. It helps you to think 'What if i was born during the depression?' That what i was thinking throughout the book. I had no idea that the world was like this once. I'm glad that I read the book to know.Billie Jo tells her story by writing poems. Every page is a poem! Thats why i think i liked the book so much. I love poerty. Reading Out Of The Dust not only helped me learn about the 1930's but it also helped me with my poerty skills. The way the auther, Karen Hesse, writes the book in poetry makes it come alive. Like Billie Jo did write all the poems. Karen Hesse did a wonderful job on Out Of The Dust. The why she writes makes me feel like I'm living in the 1930's.In Out Of The Dust there are surprices that surprise you. Never think that everything is going to get all better again because changes are that it's going to become worse. maybe by a dust storm. Or another death. Things that again people these days never really ever worry about.That's why I like this book so much."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I gave \\"out of the dust\\" 2 stars because the book was not what I prefer to read. I don't like books where after you read, you come out really depressed. I like books that are exciting and make you feel good after you close it. When I read this book it makes me feel so depressed hearing about how bad times were. The book was very well written but i really don't want to hear about day after day of dust storms and disasters. I liked some of the poems in the book but sometimes it just seemed like the author was writing a normal book but just breaking up all the writitng and saying they are poems.I have just read a book ont he great depression called \\"no promises in the Wind\\" and I enjoyed it unlike \\"Out of the Dust\\" because the book was about an adventure and courage of two boys. But \\"out ff the Dust\\" is just a depressing book about a girls life being destroyed and all the horrible things that went on in the 20's. Sometimes when I was reading this book I had to put it down because I couldn't take some of the material and the graphic scenes with the burns. A good book to me is one that makes you smile when you put it down, not something that disturbs you and gives you nightmares after reading it. This book has soem good points as well beacuase it really gives you an idea of how times wwere in the dust bowl back then. If you are learning about the great depression it is a good book to read. It was very descriptive but sometimes too graphic. This book was assigned to me by the school but I don't think i would have read it by myslef, because reading sometihng that makes me depressed is not my idea of entertainment. I still think this is an excelent book even know it is not to my liking, because it puts you back in time and really paints a picture in your head."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a relatively good book but it lacks substance. In the format Karen Hess has chosen to write this novel details become over shadowed by emotion, this in some cases is a good thing and in others a bad thing. Sometimes the occurrence of events are much too blended together because of the lack of details. But this format does allow the reader to become fully immersed in Billie jo's feelings. The other problem with this format is that the book becomes extremely short. Although it spans over two hundred and twenty seven pages most of the book is simply blank space. The story itself Is quite good, it describes the emotional experience of the dust bowl and the great depression. But I feel that any metaphors and emotions in this book is forced on to the reader too strongly. This leaves an impression of a simpleton's emotions by just yelling out what the characters are feeling. I personally would prefer that the book be written in a normal format. This is book is for those who find a certain ecstasy in emotions whether they be good or bad. I for one am not one of those people. So this is either a book you love or hate. And one of the characters I hate most is Billie Jo's dad (I don't even remember his name). Not just because he is somewhat demonized but because his mind and motives are much too simple. ... All and all you either hate it or love it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The Dust Bowl is raging on and Billie Jo is in the middle of it. Her family is struggling to keep their farm in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Billie Jo's mother wants to move but her father is convinced that he can make something grow. Then,when the family finds out that Billie Jo's mother is going to have a baby boy, everyone was overjoyed. Everything seemed perfect. But, one day a tragic accident occures. When the baby comes, Billie Jo's little brother and her mother both die. Billie Jo is lost and confused without her mother. Nothing is right anymore.This was a GREAT, GREAT book! Karen Hesse captures you with free verse poems that make up the whole book. Your heart will be taken along in the journey with all the characters in this book. People of all ages will love this book no matter what."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I couldn't put this down (not as impressive as it sounds, though--it's a very quick read). A young girl's struggle with her circumstances, her life and the people in it is voiced eloquently and with great insight and sensitivity. Incredibly well-done."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, there is only one way to describe the book: Awesome! My teacher assigned this book as a read-in-class-book. As we read it we learned about how one family was heartbroken by death, starvation, and the dust. Generosity was also a big part of this book and how they had so little they still gave some to people and thier town. Billie Jo was the character that was caught in the middle of this horrible death of her mom. She was left there alone, not even her love of piano could help save her. Her father was a quiet man with nothing to do but drink himself into oblivion. Out of the Dust is the only way out of this terror."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think the book OUT OF THE DUST was a good but sad book. It really shows people how bad it was in the dust bowl. Also what problems the people who lived there had to go through. I recommend this book for any age. It is really sad to hear some of the real problems someone might have gone through and it makes you think too. The book is written in Free style poetry. In some poems/chapters the way it is written really sometimes corresponds with what is happening in the book. In a chapter called DREAMS the words are pretty spaced out and it gives it a little bit of a peaceful kind of look and the chapter is a quiet and peaceful. So, again I think the free style poetry really makes you think more about the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I like how the author puts the book in the daughter's perspective instead of the father's. In the mind of a child are the thoughts of happiness. When something bad happens a child flips out and when it happens to the adult mind it doesn't impact as much. This had to be a very depressing time for the daughter due to her mother's death, WWII, and the decline of the economy. I would rate this book four stars because it was very descriptive and had good content."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust is a great, thought provoking book. It shows a lot of emotion. It is a sad book. It takes place in the dust bowl during the great depression. Billie Jo, the main character goes through many changes during the book. Billie Jo's family was never perfect, but when her mother dies in an accident Billie Jo and her father are forced to turn to each other for support. Before the accident Billie Jo loved to play the piano. After the accident she couldn't play anymore because she burned her hands. She didn't appreciate her mother much when she was alive but she missed her when she was gone and relized she loved her. I this is one of the best historical fiction books I have ever read. I think this is a really good book for twelve to fifteen year olds and I would recomend it to anyone I know."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Getting out of the dust is what Billy Jo wants to do. Billy Jo is the main character in the book. The books scenereo is in the dust during the depression. There is a terrible accident that kills Billy Jo's mother and her unborn baby brother that dies at about 1 day old. Billy Jo gets her hands burnt and cannot play the piano, the most precious thing to her, and she used to be able to play the piano awesome. If you like a book that is emotional and is full of forgiving and getting over obstacles, this is the book for you. If you do read this book, get ready for a surprise. You can just start looking at the pages and find the surprise in the writing. I am glad I read Out of the Dust and I hope you read the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I was fascinated by the well written free-verse poetry in the book Out of the Dust. I loved how Billie Jo Kelby held on against what happened in the accident, all the dust, and her hunger. She survived all the chllenges without giving up. This is the first free verse poetry book I've read and I love it. After the death of her mother, the only thing that remained from her mother was a piano. She loves playing the piano, but she can't with her burned hands. She must survive with her past. Her father won't talk to her and barely looks at her. She feels she must leave and get out of the dust and try a new life. She is on the train west when she realizes that her father is still back in Oklahoma in the dust. She gets on nother train and goes back. When she gets off the train she sees her father. This I liked because her father starts to be there for her, starts talking to her, but most importantly its forgivness between Billie Jo and her father. Karen Hesse mad this book sad, but at the same time you realize that it's reality and to be thankful your not in it. You see what these people went through just to survive their life and this time period. I love how Karen Hesse made this such an extrodinary book! I can't wait for another."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"For my critique of the book \\"Out of the Dust\\" I will rate and tell about how I felt about the book. I enjoyed the book, because it showed just how hard life was back then. I thought that this book was a trip back in history, with all the details of how the really was back then. I enjoyed reading what the main character thought and felt through the book. This book was about a girl about 13 and living during The Great Depression, in Oklahoma with her family. It was so interesting to see her point of view on the problems her and her father must go through.I loved responding back to the book but, I think that the book would have been hard to understand without a teacher. I think it would have been hard because of the symbolism taking place in the book. If I had to rate \\"Out of the Dust\\" it would have to be a 7, because some of the parts were hard to understand and sometimes boring. This book was written in free-verse poetry sometimes making it hard to understand and comprehend. I thought it showed the class how hard the times were in the Dust Bowl. I thought that \\"Out of the Dust\\" was a good book for class material but hard for kids to understand by themselves."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Out of the Dust\\" was a book that was filled with bad times, like dust. So much truth was told by telling the story of one. By telling the story of one girl, you could see how people used to live.Billie Jo was a girl covered with bad memories, issues, and dust. The dust was the negative yet positive thing in the book. She assisted in burning herself and her mom. That is a pretty tough situation to be in. The story was told in a poem form. Depending on the mood of the person and the setting, there was a different format. Per say, the format of the poem is a way to express feelings. Some poems were scattered, and some were only a sentence. By one sentence you get another piece of the puzzle that leads you to the end. I learned about some of Americas past, as well as enjoying a great story. The message in the book \\"Out of the Dust\\" was to always try to make the best of what you got."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It talks about the dust storms and how bad they were. I found it interesting because the dust storms were terible. Though, it talked a little too much about \\"the sad part\\". But, overall it was a good book. The story is about one girl named Billy Jo. She lives in the Western part of Oklahoma. She lives with her parents in a a rural area. Since it takes place in the 1930's it is different. The book talks about her life. It is a depressing book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"the book was very interesting. karen hesse has a very beautiful way of describing Billi Jo and her love and hunger for the piano because the way she talked about the piano in her diary was the exact same way i think of it. It was also very sad,but when she ran away I didnt get that, the way she describes it. her dad never talks to her until her mom dies. that also remindes me about me and my dad. I dont think it ended well it was very boring the last page but it was still very good different amotions so I it 3 starz."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a sad but interesting book. It tells a story of a girl named Billie-Joe who's living in the dust bowl. The story is told through diary entries. The fact that it is written in diary entries makes it easy to relate to her and understand what she's thinking. You could tell how heart broken she was when her mother and baby brother died. In the begining, Billie-Joe just wants to be out of the dust. But in the end, she realizes that the dust is a part of her now, and she can't just leave her father because he was her family and she couldn't just walk out on him. It had a very poetic ending, but it could have been stronger and had a greater impact on the readers."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a book about a girl and her family in the Okalahoma Dust Bowl. First some dust storms happen and the dad is just concerned about his crops. Later Billie Jo (the girl) brunt her hands and her mom very sadly died and her little brother Franklin died. Billie Jo was a good piano player and with her hands burnt she couldn't play. Her and her dad don't talk much. Billie Jo runs away on a train and makes it to Arizona and when she is there she calls her dad. They understand each other later. At the very end of the book her dad starts to like this other girl. This is a good book but is hard to understand."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the dust was a book that i read in my language arts class. I found this book very interesting because it was writin in lots of short little free verse poems instead of being writin in prose. I would give this book 4 out of 5 stars because I thought that it was a pretty interesting book. I would recomend reading this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought that Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was OK. It had many sad parts that I disliked. For example, when Billie Jo's mother died. I would rate this book 5 out of 10 stars. I think that Karen Hesse overused details, too much information is not a good thing. Karen does put alot of work into this book and her ideas were great! I would just recamend taking out some of the unessicary details. Over all, I think the book was OK."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought Out of the Dust wasn't really well written because I don't like free verse peotry. I thought that Karen Hess fully explained all about the dust bowl and included lots of details about Billie Jo's life. I also liked the fact that the author gave details about the Dust bowl and not just Billie Jo's life. On a scale of 1-10, I would give this book a 7 because it is well written with lots of details but it is in free verse poetry and is hard to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse is a novel about the life of a 14 year old girl living in the 1930's in the state of Oklahoma. This novel tells about the hardships many people faced during the Dust Bowl, but one thing that makes this book different is the way it was written. Not only was this book written from the perspective of a adolescent it was also written in a series of free verse poems. By writting in free verse poems Hesse captured the interest of many because it gave them a new way to comprehend a book.Out of the Dust was a very good book, but can be a bit depressing at times. The protagonist Billie Jo seems to lighten things up agian with her piano playing. Billie Jo has a very distant relationship with her father after the death of her mother, but they seem to draw closer to eachother after they learn to forgive the mistakes that they had made.I would give Out of the Dust 4 out of 5 stars because the book was overall very interesting and captured my interest with Karen Hesse's vivd imagery and percise use of words. I gave the novel only 4 stars because I would find that the book would repeat itself and at other times would seem to make no sense at all."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was a very well written book. It kept me wondering throughout the entire story of Bilee jo's life and her family. I enjoyed reading her story in free verse. The author wrote in clear and understandable language. Karen Hesse also put thought and feelings into her work. There are so many emotions you will feel in this book. To me the sadest part of the book was when bilee jos mom died because she was burnt so badly and people think its Bilee Jo's fault. Another emotional part of the book was when the dust storms occured. Bilee Jo explained that many people that she knew in her town died or or got pneumonia. Although there are parts of the book that are sad the ending suprised me the most. It shocked me that Billee Jo's dad found someone new that he will spend the rest of his life with. On a rating of 1-10 I would rate this book a 9."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was a exciting book, I like it alot better than the Call of the Wildo. IF we wee to grade this book I would give it a 9 out of 10. I would give it a 9 out of 10 because I didnt find it boring. I liked this story and I like how it talks bout hte Dust storms and how you survive during a dust storm. ALso I like how the author wrote about how the Ma and Franklin died. I also like how the author explains Billie Jo's feelings towards the death of her mom and her brother."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I was assigned to read Out of the Dust as an assignment for my English class. I had tried reading it earlier, in about 5th grade, but had found it boring and hard to understand. (I am now in 7th grade.) However, recently I've started to write my own poetry, so I could relate to Billie Joe's (the main character) way of expressing herself. Also, we had just finished learning about the Dust Bowl in history class, so it was easier to understand parts that had confused me earlier.I actually enjoyed this book very much. I liked it for its genuineness, sincerity and open honesty. I liked how things were described so I could really picture everything in my head. The poetry I write is similar to hers, so I learned a little about that as well.I really admire Billie Jo's character in the book. She has courage, determination and perseverance. She pushes through certain things that handicap her and follows her dream of playing the piano. She acts strong, like everything's under control, for her father, friends and neighbors. She tries to act like the hard times aren't getting to her, but inside of her they are. Those emotions get out through her music and her writing. I think she is a very talented individual, but definitely had a hard life. I have trouble imagining what life what be like if I lived during the Great Depression/Dust Bowl. I am quite fortunate that I don't live then.I think that Billie Jo's community is really quite remarkable. Even in the most desperate times, they pull together, help each other out and manage to keep their children from starving. Local bands play music together for families, which gives everyone a chance to forget the daily trials they must go through. Another example is when the sheriff busts a group of moon shiners, and then gives the sugar that they used, to the children (who are, of course, delighted).I think that when the author wrote this story, she meant to send little messages out through her work. One of them was that even the smallest kind deed can make a difference. Also, if everyone helps everyone out, no one will really have to suffer."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book was very cool, it was informational, exciting, and a very good book to read. Although it had some sad parts in it, I enjoyed reading it because, it shows the struggles that many children living in the dust bowl went through. Billie-Jo represented those children. Like her , children's mothers, fathers, and friends and family died. She lost many brothers and sisters, because of all the birth misshapes that affected her mother, while giving birth. Billie-Jo's mother died giving birth to her brother, and the baby died before her aunt could come to pick it up.Billie-Jo's love for music kept her going through all of this, even when her father met another woman. She loved to play, she just had a passion. This was very clearly expressed in the book. The other characters were also expressed very well, like Billie-Jo's father. His role was a man with so much pride that it sometimes clouded his judgment. The characters is part of what makes this such a good book. They make it come alive, infact, so alive that it makes the book believable. Besides it being a historical fiction.A very creative feature of the book is the way it is written. It is not completely a narrative story, because it is written in poems that Billie-Jo wrote in some kind of journal, or diary. It takes place during the same time as the great depression, witch was a terrible time for all, because in the states that were not in the dust bowl area, there were very little jobs and money, because of the stock market crash in nineteen-twenty-nine.This book defiantly deserved the Newberry medal award, because it gave information, and showed passion through out the entire book. Which , I think, is very impressive. The book was creative, smart, exciting and overall, very, very, enjoyable.This book helped me to understand how people, children especially, must've felt during this time, during the dust bowl. It was very disturbing to read about the troubles that they faced, but also very touching how it all ended to be okay.I loved this book, because it was encouraging, along with everything I already mentioned."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In my opinion Out of the Dust deserves no more than four stars. I give it three because the poems weren't that interesting and I understand that it was a free verse and it had to rhyme but I didn't really enjoy it all that much. Winter, spring and fall were more interesting than summer to me because there wasn't a lot of action in the main part of the book. The Great Depression and the Dust Bowl were interesting to me but it wasn't put very well in this book. When the parts come up, some give you a sense and this kind of sadness for their family.Her dad doesn't play a big part in the book and in my life and many people, their fathers are important to them and since it was a children's novel, I personally felt it wasn't as interesting to me because it's nice to read about daughter and fathers, as well as everyone in the family, and it doesn't really get that way till the end of the beginning. The book was about our history and it plays a big part of how our society is today and we learned a lot from that. There aren't as many details and it isn't a fast read kind of book. It wasn't that long, but you have to understand the context and the importance of their suffering. I did during the first half of the book but when it came to the middle I kind of got lost and had to read it again.I think it's important for children especially, to learn in other forms besides teachers and textbooks. The free verse poem was long and it kept going on and you never knew what was going to happen next. It was inspiring to learn about their struggles and suffering and be thankful for what we have and they didn't, but the book also made you sad and depressed. It was confusing at some points and you had to read it over and it wasn't always necessary to go back and read it and get lost again because I knew that it was bad anyways. I recommend this book to everyone who wants to learn about our history and wants to read a good book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was really unique because not only did it tell a creative story, it told one in a poem form. The free verse poems were really good. They made you imagine exactly what might've been going on like how Billie Jo felt after she couldn't play, how she loved the piano and longed to play and her excitement and sadness. It used descriptive, colorful, and very imaginative words so it could create a picture in your head. Plus, it displayed a lot of emotion and reflected the hard work, dedication, and devotion of the author. And besides, if you see the Newberry Medal, you have to assume it's good so why not read it and find out? All the events seemed so real and so did the characters. While some scenes displayed a lot of emotion and miserable feeling, the others displayed happiness and laughter. The book just made you want to keep on reading-nonstop! Well, it made me. It was one of the best books I ever read. I read one Newberry Medal book and it totally bombed, so I thought that maybe all the books with the Newberry Medal sign were similar to that. So I never, ever read one after the first one. And when I found out we were required to read Out of the Dust (a Newberry book) for English class, I wasn't exactly thrilled. In fact, I put off reading it for almost a week. Then I realized I had to read it, so I started on the first page. I continued, fascinated about how the author could use such brilliant words to describe such simple things. It really made you want to have met the author and ask on-going questions about how she could've come up with such a great story. And I could really relate to some of the events. Like how when Billie Jo's hand had been wounded and she couldn't play the piano. One time, my hands just hurt a lot. I wasn't injured or anything but every time I moved even a finger, all my bones would start aching. And the pain would then travel throughout my entire body. It only lasted for a day. I couldn't write-even thought I wished and wished and wished that I could. I had so many ideas in my head...so much to write about...so much to get down on paper. But life's cruel. I also couldn't go on the computer to chat online and e-mail people. And that's my life! Computer and Writing...the two things I definitely couldn't live without. So I felt Billie Jo's pain and heartache and longing because I too had experienced something similar to what she was in the story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust was a good book because we get a feel on how people lived during the Great Depression and in the Dust Bowl. Life wasn't easy and Billie-Jo showed us in our minds how hard it was. From having to wash everything from a dust storm to having to let your cattle and chickens die because the dust has clogged up their lungs and they have no use. The author, Karen Hesse, also used descriptive and emotional scenes that really catches the readers mind exp. when Billie-Jo threw the burning pail of kerosene at her mother, who was pregnant. She described her as \\"A column of fire\\". Also when Billie-Jo had to live with her father and the memories of her mother that were eating her from the insides because of her conscience. I thought how Billie-Jo's father blamed her for her mothers death was very cruel. Especially since he was the one who left the pail of burning kerosene by the stove. I thought he was mostly responsible. Parts that I didn't like of the book, were parts when Karen Hesse got so into details that those horrible images go to your head and didn't get out. It's good that she can teach us something by a great novel, but the truth is so harsh that sometimes you wonder why anyone can write about such a sad time. But I guess we should find out how life in Oklahoma was, since it's our past, and the past of others. I liked the way Karen Hesse used a poetic format for her novel, I thought it was creative and smart. Billie-Jo found love and happiness for a while, I thought that was a good part that Karen Hesse out in, since most of Billie-Jo's life and been a tragedy, it was a good balance in the book. I would recommend the book to anyone who likes life's harsh tales of life's grief ways to make people sad, but life's way of making us find ourselves. I also think our teacher made a very good choice by selecting this book for us to read, it gave us an in depth look on what we need to know about the Great Depression and about good literature. In conclusion, Out of the Dust was a great, descriptive and astonishing book that enlightened us on good writing and our past."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust is a book about a girl that has some problems. Not meaning that is bad because it had exciting parts in all parts of the book. Some that you won't even think would happen during the time of the Depression or the Dust Bowl.This book is an inspiring book to me. That is why I gave it a 5 Stars. It shows that times were hard and that people were trying to live their way but it was difficult. And people didn't give up even though it was hard times. Billie Jo thinks like I do. She writes about her life in a big free verse poem and doesn't leave out any important things.Billie Jo was an only child and her mother was pregnant with a boy. Now you might think that what I have told you so far, you would think that life was nice for Billie Jo and her family. Well.... it wasn't. Even though life was tough everyone still enjoyed it and had their ups and downs.The author, Karen Hesse did a wonderful job through out the whole book with all of the events that happened. After you started to settle down after one surprising incident, another one would pop up. She had a very good way of describing everything so the book could be understood by younger children.Her father is someone that doesn't care about people that much. That also follows for her mother. Billie Jo on the other hand doesn't follow to that. She likes to tell everyone what is going on about her and all of the exciting things that happened to her. There are some characters that pop in and out of the book and when they do they make an appearance.In conclusion, Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse is a great book for all ages. Billie Jo tells her life in one big free verse poem and that is what is really exciting about the book that an author like Karen can come up with a poem that also at the same time can tell about the life of a girl during the Depression and the Dust Bowl. Just remember, when you are calming down after one surprise there might be one coming right around the corner!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of The Dust was a great book about the Great Depression and all the dust storms that occurred in Oklahoma. I had felt some deep connections about the book. Like how it was to have a mother die, I went through that same feeling when a close relative died. You really feel lost. When I read the part about Billie throwing the fire on her mom, It was like I could feel the fire burn in my heart. I winced in pain for Billie, her mom and Family. Doesn't that happen to you when you read a book that has pain in it? For example when I read about how hard it was for Billie when her dad didn't talk to her. I was in anguish, I felt guilty eve though I wasn't a part of the book. I still felt like I was alive and apart of the action. I hated the parts when (this doesn't mean I hate the book) Billie just looked at her dad after all the gossip that was going on in town of how her was going crazy. That reminded me of when I had a friend that everyone disliked but me, the all said that she was crazy weird and other obscene words. I really felt guilty because i didn't stand up for her. I really liked the connection with the piano, music always heels the soul. I was think about like in the book how all the dust represented guilt and that piano and other things that were being dirtied by the dust were the lost souls. I connected that thought to the part in the end where Billie wiped the Dust off the piano to start new . The piano represented her mom. Now she won't feel as guilty as she did about killing her mom. What parts of the book will I always remember and think about? Most definitely the parts with Billie plays the piano, when ever I play the piano or any type of music I always feel calm a pleasant. Maybe this sooths Billie and her mind. I noticed that when ever Billie played the BLUES she was sad, when ever Billie played Jazz or stuff like that she was happy. Et cetera. I do just the same, when ever I feel really sad or mad or guilty of something I play Slow songs or my favorite band, when ever I'm happy it's good dancing music(Rock, Rap, DreamStreet,POP,Country, all of the above) when I'm bored it's what ever. I know a lot of people that listen to music to help them think and act. Maybe that's what Billie to think and act. In conclusion, I think that the book has some real great connections about the Great Depression and what life was like in the 1930's, and how everyone coped with that. I really enjoyed reading the book, I hope that other young and old readers pick up the book and start to read it!!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Dust. You can see it, taste it, feel it.

She tells you everything, and you listen intently. You learn not only how to keep hoping, but about the dust bowl. It is a valuable history lesson. It is gripping, heart-wrenching. It will bring tears to your eyes. It was amazing.\\"All of this in a book?\\" you ask. And I tell you. YES. It is an entire world in those pages. A planet. A quilt of memories, dreams, and fears. A web of courage, hope, and perseverance. An amazing story. It changed my view of many things. And, in my opinion, that was for the better.Out of the Dust teaches so much about the dust bowl. The difficulty in living, the new deal, everything. It is a book for pleasure, a book for school, a book about life. It was worth every penny that was spent on it.This book deserves more than one Newbery award. I wish it could get more than one. It teaches so much, in so few pages. It is a great example of the great American novel.Out of the Dust was fantastic. I recommend it to anyone who likes good books. It is worth it. Out of the Dust was one of the best books that I have read. I wish that Karen Hesse would write more books. They provide good morals, and really change many ideas. In my opinion, it is even better than a Stein beck book. And that is saying quite a lot. It is definitely worth the cost. It will change your life. It changed mine."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust is not such a good read. Had I gone to a bookstore or a library, I would never have picked this book off the shelf to read voluntarily. However, since my History and English classes required it, I had no choice whether to read it or not. Having read it, I am not anxious to read it again or read any other books by Karen Hesse.I gave this book three stars because it was not torture to read, yet it was not good. It was simply something to read - something to eat up idle time. The only time I ever really cared about this book was when the accident occurred. At that point I felt sympathy for Billie Jo and her family, but almost no other feelings came to me during this book. It was not chicken-soup for the soul.I think this book was a good read for history class as it gave you a good sense of the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. I learned much from this book, yet it was definitely not a pleasure read. If I were a history teacher, I would definitely pick this book off the shelf for my students despite the fact they most likely will not enjoy reading it.The whole book was very descriptive about dust storms, rain, crops, etc. This really helped to give me a sense of what life was like during the Great Depression. Also, I liked how the historical content was embedded into the story. It was not all facts, but facts disguised within the life of Billie Jo. This book briefly covered all that is required in the Virginia State SOLs for 7th grade on the Great Depression. It covered impacts on Americans, causes of the Great Depression, and the major features of the New Deal. If you had just read this book before the SOLs, most likely you would fail, but this adds on to what you learn in class. For example, in one passage it is what Miss Freeland (Billie Jo's teacher) taught them one day. Billie Jo does not say straight out in her journal entry that what she is teaching them is the causes of the Great Depression and the dust bowl, but if the reader is aware of this, they can easily make the connection. Also, this description of the causes is clearer and better explained than anything my teachers have told me. I understood it better when I was reading it out of the book. In addition, Out of the Dust has some information about the New Deal. The first time as I was reading it, I did not catch this information but as I went back and re-read it I caught it. When you see it you kind of want to go \\"ooooooh, now I get it!\\" and you feel intelligent.One thing that confused me is how the book itself is written. It is from the point of view of Billie Jo, yet it never says it is a journal or diary. The way that the whole book is in free verse poems make me think that maybe it is Billie Jo's thoughts, scattered and almost disorganized. However, the way things are described in the book make me want to believe it is a diary. I think this because almost everything is in past tense. So, is she actually writing what you are reading, or is she just thinking back on things? When finished with the book I did not know the answer to this question, and as of now, I still don't.Overall, Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse, fell into the \\"so what?\\" category. I read it and learned, the end. It is not a book I would recommend to my friends, or anyone. Yet it is not a book I would complain about for weeks, like \\"oh this book is so horrible\\" and on and on. It was just \\"so what?\\" and nothing more."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a very well-written book and I really enjoyed it. Karen Hesse has an amazing talent and can write beautiful poetry. I loved the way some of the journal entries were formed. the words seemed to flow through the page. I especially liked the entry entitled \\"On Stage.\\" the words in my opinion are shaped in the form of a piano and certain words are left alone and really emphasize the way the poem sounds. I think the Newberry medal went to the right book. This book was a great thing to read and had wonderful descriptions. We had to read Out of the Dust for a history assignment. At first I thought that it would be dull and boring, but the more I read the more interested I became. The book is a great learning device also. I could clearly understand the Great Depression after reading this book and it is very easy to comprehend. Out of the Dust was an ALA Notable Children's Book, and it was also an ALA Best Book for Young Adults. I agree with that because the book is easy to understand, no too long, and you can relate it to your own life. The book can be read and enjoyed by both children and adults. I also really like poetry, and because this book is a book completely written in verse I enjoyed trying to absorb the writing. I also play the piano, just like Billie Jo, and after reading Karen Hesse's novel I realized that I should keep pursuing the art of piano because like Billie Jo I might not be able to play one day. This book is a great history lesson. Students can learn about the Depression and how it affected the lives of many Americans, the Dust Bowl and the way it swept dust over the ground and into the homes of the occupants. They will also understand the hardships of farming, eating, sleeping, and living in the dust. They would also be able to understand FDR's New Deal and the foundations included in it. I really enjoyed this book and it definitely should have received the Newberry Medal, I would definitely recommend this book to any audience."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;My father is amusement at the station, and I call him Daddy for the first time since Ma died, and we walk home, together, talking.&quot; (Hesse, 205) Out of the Dust, a book by Karen Hesse, is about a girl, Billie Jo, whose life is held in dust. Billie Jo doesn't have a happy, joyous life, but neither does she have a dull, boring life. She wouldn't be surprised to see layers of dust resting on her piano. She was born with dust all over. A favorite poem of mine, &quot;Met&quot;, is about Billie Jo who just came back from running away on a train. Though her father was never too close to her daughter, it seemed as though with Billie Jo running away, it brought her father and herself closer to each other than before. As they had walked home together, each of their vile memories and mistakes melted away. I recommend this book to people ten and over. It is basically for anyone who likes to read poems. I state that it is for people older than ten because there are many words that are hard to understand and for the fact that it is in poem form, it makes it a little harder to understand. I liked when simile was used because it characterized and put personality to an object that Billie Jo was describing. An example of simile from &quot;Met&quot;, is, &quot;I tell him he is like the sod, and I am like the wheat...&quot; (Hesse, 205)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I'd just remembered the cranberry sauce. My father loved Ma's special cranberry sauce. But she never showed me how to make it.&quot; (Hesse, 100 - 101)This poem set me into a depressing mood as it relates to my life. I've lost someon&quot;Being there without Ma, without the baby, wouldn't have been so bad, if e in my life and to hear this poem struck the moment when things were just not the same without that person. The cranberry sauce to me alluded to the one that I have lost. The poem began with memories of her mother and onto a dinner comparison between the Christmas dinner at her school and the dinner that Billy Joe had prepared for her father. She begins to let herself take all the blame for such a bad dinner. The cranberry sauce had a huge effect on her and led her to a state of melancholy. The content within the book is depressing and should be recommended for young adults. Kids who are considered young adults are usually in the age margin where things such as death and emotions take a greater affect on them. This may relate to someone's life and help him or her cope with their problems. The book may be fiction but it still it is very realistic. Out of the Dust contains lots of simile and metaphor, I appreciate this because it helps relate or allude to other encounters of the same scenario. I wasn't that fond of the book in the beginning but once I got to the dramatic climax it caught my attention and drew me into the book. I felt as if my emotions were actually written on the pages. I liked the book and I recommend it to young adults. Read Out of the Dust and especially read &quot;Christmas Dinner Without cranberry Sauce.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;Trees will break the wind. He says, trees will end the drought, the animals can take shelter there, children can take shelter. Trees have roots, he says. They hold on to the land.&quot; This quote is from my favorite poem in Out of the Dust. The poem is called &quot;Roots.&quot; I chose this quote because it is very meaningful, and since trees are extremely important to the world, this poem is very superior. The book Out of the Dust is a very compelling, suspenseful, and tragic book all at the same time, with a 13-year-old Billie Joe who is faced with the tragedy of her mother dying. She has to deal with being surrounded by dust all her life, living in the Dust Bowl. She also has to deal with her father, who is very ungrateful, and doesn't even talk to her. Each event in this book is a poem. I believe that Karen Hesse uses a lot of figurative speech in this novel. Important to the book is &quot;The wind roared like fire&quot;, and a simile &quot;She smelled like scorched meat.&quot;"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"She was are as a pear, raindrops sliding down her skin, leaving traces of mud on her face and her long back, slow tracks of wet dust down the bulge of her belly, My dazzling Ma, round and ripe and striped like a melon\\" (Hesse,56). This is an example of a chapter, or day, from the book Out of the Dust. This is one of the more descriptive poems in the book. I would recommend this book to children no younger than 12, because it is very depressing and sad.The main character in this book is Billie Jo, a spitfire who lived in Oklahoma at the time of the Dust Bowl. When Billie Jo's mother and little brother die from her father leaving a pale of kerosene beside the stove. Billie Jo's hands are burned badly from trying to save her mother from the fire that tore her family apart. Despite her deformed hands, she still, cooks and cleans, but has to give her obsession, playing the piano. Billie Jo's father becomes withdrawn and depressed, and he starts insanly digging a lake and building a windmill. He becomes an alcoholic, and spends the family's money on liqour. I really thought this book was well-written, but found it very dismal. The book was a narrative poem, a poem that tells a story. It used a lot of figurative language, similes, metaphors, personification, onomatopoeia and alliteration."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;I didn't intend to, but I like her&quot;(Hesse 212) This quote is from my favorite poem in Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust. The poem is called &quot;The Other Woman.&quot; It is focused on Billie Jo's daddy's new girlfriend. The book Out of the Dust is a wonderful book. It is in narrative poem form, which is an easy read. It has large quantities of figures of speech and good content. This book is about a girl named Billie Jo who lives in the middle of the Dust Bowl. She has to struggle through piano recitals and the death of two very close family members by a fatal fire. For most of the story Billie Jo tries to get through the rough times she and her father go through. Billie Jo's father is so unpleasant he doesn't even talk much to his own daughter. Through out the story, the Dust Bowl brings many blustery dust storms upon Billie Jo and her father. This makes it very hard for them to eat, sleep, and especially for Billie Jo's burns to heal. I felt sorry for Billie Jo, even if this was not a true story. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes to read historical fiction."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;It started out as snow, oh, big flakes floating softly, catching on my sweater, lacy on the edges of my sleeves.&quot; (Hesse, 176) These were the glorious words of Billie Jo as she saw what she had wanted to see for so long, snow. The poetic language goes on to explain how the joyful water fell from the sky, first as snow, then moving on to sleet, then rain. The soft language describes an oasis of dust, how it takes in the water quenching its every begging thirst. The entire book is composed of poems, free verse to be exact, but out of all of the wondrous poems &quot;Hopes&quot; true meaning appeals to me. &quot;It kept coming, thunder booming, lighting kicking, dancing from the heavens down to the prairie, and my father dancing with it, dancing outside in the drenching night, with gutters racing, with the earth puddled and pleased, with my fathers near-finished pond filling.&quot; This line depicts the hope that Bill Jo and her dad feel when the rain comes, when the rain pours, when the rain falls. One could say that this book is for only people 12+ and, but the books true meaning can be seen by any person. Anyone who can read should try to read this book, to decode its meaning. The book is written with such poetic language that it changes for each person; how you feel affects how the book sounds, how it feels. So next time you are feeling down, just remember Billie Jos words of comfort and think it will always rain."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"The rain has brought back some grass and the ranchers have put away the feed cake and sent their cattle out to graze.\\" Out of the Dust is a story about a girl named Billie Joe who was implicated by all of the neighbors and her father for the death of her pregnant mother who died of severe burns from a fire. My favorite poem in this book is called \\"The Rain's Gift\\" because it shows that after a hard few days Billie Joe was a simple girl who could always find the good in things. An appropriate age group for this book would be for ages 10 and older because younger children might not be able to elucidate the poetry or not be able to take the sorrowful death of Billie Joe's mother. \\"Louise is back at the house. She wanted to come but this is Ma's place, Ma's grave, Franklin's too, and Louise has no business here.Well, I won't let her. Not everywhere.\\" I appreciate Billie Joe's feelings in this passage because she shows a great respect and love for her mother and feels that visiting her mothers grave is something that only Billie Joe and her father should do together. I liked this book because it was written in a poetic form and it showed me how life living in dusty fields could be.

Many of the pomes are sad, some are funny and others are more on the serious side. The book makes you want to read on. It was very interestin and made you not want to put the book down.

To me the poems on each page made the book very interesting allowing the author to give more and more detail about every situation. For example when describing the dust storms throughout the book she makes you feel you are involved in the actual event. The way Karen Hesse involves a familie's point of view, makes you understand the suffering many endured. My favorite part of the book is when Billie Jo feels like she has a burden on her for her mother's death. The way she fights for people to look past her personal tradegy and to who she really is as a person, makes me say that this girl is a strong person."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought the book Out of the Dust was sad but good to read.

I would recommend this book to people who are learning about the great depression because it is easier to understand the great depression by reading this book than by reading a text book.

Because of the different kinds of storms that I've been in and the decisions I had to make like leaving that state that sec or not.

I would rate it a 9 because even though there was a lot of action, there were some bad parts to it. Like the part where Karen Hesse said that her mother &quot;erupted&quot; into flames.I think that word is a little dramatic. I think the part where Billie Jo tried to put out the flames with her hands was very brave. Even though her hands were severly burned and because of that her life had been changed forever.

As we walk together, side by side, in the sole-deep dust, I am forgiving myself for all the rest. That stanza is my favorite poem of the book. It shows how the torn relationship of Billie Jo and her father is slowly healing. And how her relationship with \\"herself\\" is healing also. Over all I think Out of the Dust is an outstanding book. The poems are excellent at times. However, Sometimes the poems interfere with the flow of the book. That is why I only gave Out of the Dust 4 out of 5 stars. The book is chiefly the story of two years during the Dust Bowl, shown through the eyes of Billie Jo, a young girl. It offers much insight on what it must it have been like to live through that terrible time. It is deeply depressing, but at times light hearted and almost fun.

Billie -Jo had to learn that the dust that she was trying to shake out was a part of who she was, it made her become that much stronger.

She commented on my name, and asked about its origin within my family. She signed my copy of Out Of The Dust with &quot;Look to your roots&quot;. It was then that it hit me as to why the book was such a spellbinding piece of descriptive poetry. There is a fourteen year old Billie Jo in every reader, male or female. Our roots groom our being; we are our experiences. As adolescents, we've all felt the shame, the pain, and the dust that has settled in our lives and challenged us to grow, forgive, and continue. For anyone in search of healing, Out Of The Dust is the book you want. The Newberry Award is given to the author who best contributes to adolescent literature. The judges were never more correct than in 1998."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was about a girl who is involved in the accident that kills her mother. I enjoyed this book because it really tells how a girl of her age would feel. It is a little depressing so I recommend it to those of you who can handle and enjoy sad stories."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a wonderful novel written to describe the Oklahoma dust bowl during the Great Depression. Billy Jo is a slightly stubborn, fourteen-year-old girl, who loves her family, her life and disposition. Until the dust comes. Karen Hesse describes how Billy Jo feels as she is crippled in the accident that kills her mother. Billy Jo tries to cope with the dust, as everyone does. She knows the blackness in the food at dinner, the &quot;chocolate milk&quot; in her glass, are &quot;nothing but dust&quot; but she, as they all do, imagines life without the dust. Billy Jo, desperate to free herself from the dust, flees from all she knows and had loved, to the west were there was supposed to peace, and most of all, no dust. I'm not going to tell you if she is successful, for that would ruin the experience of one of the trials that happens to Billy Jo. The courage, power of heart, and plain willingness to survive that Billy Jo displays is beautifully described by free-verse poems in diary style. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to watch over as a &quot;redheaded, freckle-faced, narrow-hipped girl with a fondness for apples and a love for playing fierce piano&quot; discovers what is truly important as she rebuilds her life after a immense disaster that ceases control of her life."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It was very compeling. It was sad but truthful in telling about a girls life in the dust bowl. She loves to play the piano, and when burns her hands and her mom dies the book gets sad. But she learns to play again and help her dad through hard times. It is a very good book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"THis is a great book!! It's about a girl named Billie Jo. She's living in America during the depression. It's a pretty average story, but it's written in the most beautiful way!! It's like every page is a poem that doesn't rhyme. Karen Hesse has a way with words!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought this book was very interesting becauase of the way that it was written. I never thought that a book written by free verse could create such a great story line that was so very moving and well written. It also explains the story well. Ms. Hesse has obviously worked very hard and the book deserves its Newbery Medal. I liked best how Ms. Hesse used free verse poetry to express the hardships of a young teenage girl during the Depression and Dust Bowl. I read this book on my own time and there's no doubt about it that it was worth it!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Self-imposed blame festers into guilt.Relief comes when one forgives oneself first. Then others.Karen Hesse once again lets us see into the mind of her characters so we too can dust off our hangups and play on."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It started this morning when I was looking for a book, and it just stared at me. I had to check it out. As soon as I read the first poem I was hooked. The words are simple, but sometimes can be hard to understand. I read all day, every chance I got. I finish it in the school day. Half in reading and half in homework center. Karen Hesse gives a dazzling account of the dust storms that swept through Oklahoma. It sounded terrible. I think the saddest part was when her mother and baby brother died, and Billy Jo's hands were burnt so badly. I got so mad at her father. But in the end I forgave him. I would reccomend this book to anyone. Get it, somehow or someway!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought that the greatest part about this book was the way it was written. Ms. Hess did a very good job in the way she put the words on the page. The word and phrases dance across the page as though she is playing the piano. The author also makes you feel as though you are standing side by side with Billie Jo, pinning damp clothes to the window panes to prevent dust from getting inside. Hess also uses very descriptive similes and metaphors that force a mental image into your head. I like the way this book is interesting yet the facts, dates and events are accurate. I think I learned alot from this book. Before I read it, I knew nothing about th Dust Bowl. Through the descriptions in this book, I feel as though I was there. This novel as written as though it was Billie Jo's diary. On the other hand, if you don't particularly like poetry, this book is not for you. I also think that if I wasn't the same age as Billie Jo, I might have a completely different perspective. Overall, I think this book should receive 3 stars because I personally don't like poetry and this typ of book is not my favorite. However, this book is VERY well written and is very informational. Even though I don't like this genre, the author made this book extremely enjoyable."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In the beginning, the farms were covered with golden wheat, and the farmer's pockets swelled. In the years following, disaster struck. Billie Jo had been living through the drought for some time now. She was starting to get restless. The loss of her mother and her newborn baby brother, Franklin, made that feeling even greater. Daddy, Billie Jo's father, did not talk too much to anyone anymore, especially Billie Jo. Finally, Billie Jo wanted out. He got up in the middle of the night, took some food, and ran away to the train station. A train came, and she went. 3 days later, she changed her mind, and came back home. This book had a good ending, but the rest of the book was not as good as I expected. After a while, the free verse poems of Billie Jo's &quot;diary&quot; got annoying. Although this was one of the main downpoints, Karen Hesse can capture you in the book and make you feel like you were really there. The book is very descriptive of Billie Jo's life, and tells important parts of her life through her diary. This book is good for readers who want to find out how life was in the dust bowl, but also for those who just like to read. I would encourage everyone to read this book just to find out how they feel about it and write your own reviews."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Olivia abtahi Pd. 5 1/11/01&quot;We shake our napkins, spread them on our laps, and flip over our glasses and plates, exposing neat circles, round comments on what life would be without dust. &quot; (Hesse, 21) Without the dust, the family would not have to keep their dishes overturned before every meal. This quote illustrates that even the smallest things, such as dust, can change your everyday life-style. Although the book can, at some times, be profound and emotionally complex, a fourth grader would most probably understand the novel, and hopefuly, enjoy it. Out of the Dust, contains very little figurative language, with few similes and rarely personified poetry. It makes readers realize that telling the story as simply as possible can be enjoyable as well. To fully appreciate this book, one must read in between the lines and try and understand what Karen Hesse had purposely hidden. I truly enjoyed reading this book, with its simple answers, and the not-so-simple life of a 13 year old girl, living in a land of dust."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;The flaming oil splashed onto her apron, and Ma, suddenly Ma, was a column of fire. I pushed her to the ground, desperate to save her, desperate to save the baby, I tried, beating out the flames with my hands. I did the best I could. But it was no good. Ma got burned bad.&quot; (Hesse, 61)&quot;The Accident&quot; is my favorite poem because it describes one of the most important events in the book in great detail. Although this event was awkward, the author did her best to describe the event in an attractive way. This book is best read between the ages 10-12. The book is very sad and it also describes someone being caught on fire. The best literary device used is the simile. Some examples are &quot;She smells like scorched meat&quot; (Hesse, 67) and &quot;Then he looked at me sorry as dust&quot; (Hesse, 185)I disliked this book from the very start. Although it is an easy read, the book is boring and still a bit tedious. The book never really picked up my interest and made it difficult to read. The book is very strange, especially when it describes the mother burning and the main character, Billie Jo, having her hands enlarged."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;I heard the wind rise, and stumbled from my bed, downstairs, out the front door, into the yard. The night sky kept flashing, lightning danced down on its spindly legs&quot; (Hesse, 39) I like the poem &quot; Fields of Flashing Light&quot; because it is very descriptive and uses a good metaphor. Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, is a compelling, long narrative poem,gruesome which depicts the Dust Bowl in 1934. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to feel depressed and realize what he or she is thankful for. The poetry in the book was exceptional. I enjoyed the book a great deal. Some of the events were a little depressing though. The mother gets burned in a fire and suffers for a few weeks and then finally dies .The father and Billy Jo aren't too close. Billie Jo runs away in search of something, but doesn't find what she is looking for so she returns home. Overall this novel was mediocre. Some of the poems were a little graphic but it was still entertaining"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was very educational in a historical way. The way this story was written is very interesting. It is written in a dairy form but not day by day, instead it's logs are more like whenever the main character can fill in a log. It covered the way of life people had in the mid 1800's. From school conditions to dust storms, this book covered it all.Out of the Dust's story-line is centered on a young girl named Billy Jo. Her life is going fine until the dust storms start occuring all over the country. 1st, all of the crops is slowly shivering away. Also because of the dust storms, Billy Jo who loves to play her piano's, hands are withering away, which adds to the problems which arise in this addicting, heart filled story. At times there are scenes where you can feel the dust hit you face in a dust storm.Take the time to read this book. It is very historical, and heart filled. I promise you it will provide a time well spent."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is one of those books that you really have to love and hate at the same time. I love this book because it was so interesting but I disliked this book because it was so sad. Really sad. It's one of those books you wouldn't want to read if you were already having a bad day. Anyways I think that since it is such a good story you should probably read it anyways, but be prepared to be a little depressed in some parts."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is wonderful! Everything in this book keeps you hooked and you want to read more. It is about a girl named Billie-Joe and she goes through hard times but always keeps on going in her life. She lives in Oklahoma and wants to leave, but something keeps her from not going. Read this book, and you will find out that wherever you are right now, you are pretty lucky. As with Billie-Joe, things can't get worse even though she is in worst conditions! Read this and find out what Billie-Joe has been through!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"this was a great book because it shows how life was like in theplains of the united states."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought this was a good book because it was very sad book and it really showed me how it would be without a mom a dad who was so hurt by this that he lost all intrest in his child Billy Jo. It was a good book and I would recamend it to everyone"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though this book is well written and has a creative style I absolutely despised the story. The reason I dislike this book has nothing to do with it being \\"very sad\\" as some other reviewers have commented. Instead I dislike the book because the story is lacking and I do not think the author does a good job of creating empathy towards the characters. Usually when a reading a \\"sad\\" book I have sympathy towards the characters. In this book there was none. Also I felt the character development was lacking. I don't reccomend this book if you are looking for a good story I do reccomend it though if you are interested in learning about free verse or seeing how the author shaped the story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book reminded me of Our Only May Amelia in the overwhelming tragedy, talent of the author at capturing your imagination to make you feel you are there, and an interesting style of writing to make it more entertaining. Each short chapter is like a little poem making for easy reading. This book is so tragic and sad, it's like a nightmare. It's like a horror story written for children, to make them see the ugly side of life. It's too horrible to even cry. I won't plan onreading it to the children. Surely there are other kinder ways for children to learn about the great depression and the dust bowl than immersing you in a horror of severe burning, childbirth, and alcoholism. I would certainly hope a person was allowed to learn the wonder and beauty of childbirth in their young life before ever having to read this ugly book.Yet I had to give it 5 stars, because of the talent. There wasa Little House book called The Long Winter, where the authorcould make you feel the winter. In this book, the author makesyou feel the dust. I had to dust the whole house when I wasthrough because dust just seems so disgusting now. I neverknew I took fresh, un-dusty air for granted until I read thisbook."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I really don't understand why people like this book. There is not very much plot, and as much as the great fans will hate me for saying this, the book isn't well written. Poems, okay. I get why people think the book is special, but it's not good.What's the point of the book? What is the solid underlining point? Is there any? Or is this just a book of letters, painted on in a completely random pattern?I give this book two stars because some of the poems would have been okay had they actually been that, poems. There is nothing outstanding about this book, save the fact that it is written in poems. There are several other books out there like that. I don't think a book that is special deserves to have the label, good. There is a difference."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The city of El Dorado Kansas and Butler County, KS decided it would be a neat idea for the whole city/county to read this book at once and then have discussion groups about the book, so my wife brought home a copy and read it and asked me to read it.I am an avid reader so I whipped through it in one sitting. It is written at about a 4th or 5th grade level, above it says 9 to 12 but we read The Hobbit in 6th grade when I was a kid.\\"Out of the Dust\\" was a good story and it did give the reader a sense of what it was like in Oklahoma during the dust bowl. It is written as a series of free verse poetry, that at first was a bit odd but it worked.It is a nice book but not for a serious reader, unless you have an hour or two to waste on a trip and don't want to haul around a large book.I would recommend it to Jr. High kids. It is a bit much for anyone younger than that to understand and it is not compelling enough for anyone older than that."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was about a family with two parents and two kids who lived in a town that had dust storms all the time. There was a tragic fire in the home and the pregnant mother died while giving birth. Billie Joe, the daughter, witnessed this tragedy. My favorite poem is \\"Not Too Much To Ask\\" because this family has very little of anything and they (the mom) are still willing to give to others in need. I think this book should be read by the age group of 13 year olds and older. This group would have the ability to understand what is happening and appreciate it. One literary technique that is used in this story is imagery. The descriptions of the area make the reader feel as if it is a personal experience. The reader feels the dust in their mouths. I disliked this book because it did not hold my interest and it was boring."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a graet book.It's one of those books when you reallyget to know the characters.It's about a poor family who lives in Oklahoma and it shows how life was like.It's a great book and I hope you read it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think tis book was a pretty boring book. I give it one star for historic facts.This book is a slow going book.

But I didn't like the issues that Billie Joe had to livewith. Such as her father who wanted her to be a boy, what happened to her mother and baby brother. The dust storm. So I guess I'll say that Karen Hesse really painted pictures in your head of the book and wrote it very well, but it's not my taste for book. Out of the Dust really is a good book and I see perfectly how it got that medal, but I didn't like the story that's all."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I loved this book! It is so neat that it is written in poem for"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of The Dust, by Karen Hesse is about a girl, Billie Jo, growing up during the Dust Bowl era. The book is written in free-verse poetry, which makes it interesting to read.In the story, Billie Jo faces many hardships. Which include, the dust storms, not having much money, her mother & baby brother dying, and her being left to keep the family, which consisted of her father and her, together. Bille Jo's one refuge was to play the piano. But, after the terrible accident that had killed her mother and baby brother, her hands are left terribly scarred. These scars prevent her from doing things because her hands hurt her terribly, and she is in shame, because she partly blames herself for her mother's death.Being during the Dust Bowl era, there was also a lack of money, as it were also the Great Depression. The farmers had taken advantage of the great amounts of wheat that they had produced during the '20's. Sadly, it had ended after the '30's had begun. The farmers had over-farmed the land, by planting the same crop over and over, which had sucked all the nutrients out of the soil, turning it to dust.On a 1-10 scale, ten being the highest, I would rate this book a 7."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out Of The Dust, December 9, 2002Reviewer:a 13 year old readerOut Of The Dust was a very interesting book. My favorite chapter was summer, because it was really important chapter. It the chapter where mom dies giving birth to Franklin.I think you should at least be 10 years old to read this book. There are a few big word and it sort of confusing. But it is a really god book for 10 and up.There is a lot of imagery in this book. One example of imagery is when she wake up and says there is a dust outline of her head. That gave me chills just thinking about it, ahhh.I gave it 2-5 stars because I am not a big poetry fan but it was an all right book. It had a good story line and lot of personalities."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In \\"Out of the Dust\\" my favorite poem was \`The Accident'. It was my favorite because it was a very large and important part of the book. Without this poem the book would have been less depressing. The poem marks a point in the story where something totally unexpected happens. The poem is fairly dismal because the main character nearly killed her mother, but it is still my favorite poem.I would say that this book is appropriate for age 9 and up. I would recommend this book to all readers, but it may be less interesting to readers over 14 or 15 because it is constantly repeating about the same topic of dust over and over again. The book is written fairly simply but may have some words or phrases that younger readers may not understand, such as dust bowl or depression. I also think a reader under 9 would not get to enjoy this book. This is because they may not have the patience to read all of the book, as it has little action and is a slow read.In this book I found some rhyming and metaphors. This rhyming and use of metaphors greatly enhances the books flow and appeal. There is not often rhyme but when it is used it is well used. Metaphors, such as \\"the locusts were a black cloud\\" are fairly common in the book and add some flavor to this book. Without these the book would be extremely slow and dull.Overall I did not enjoy this book. There was little action and I do not particularly enjoy the subject of the Dust bowl in the 1930's. All things considered I would rate this book a 4 out of 10, 10 being the highest 1 being the lowest. This book was not my favorite but I'm sure that the right reader would enjoy it. I would say that the right reader is someone who likes reading about the Dust bowl and likes a slow, uneventful read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of all of the poems in the book, my favorite poem is \\"Rabbit Battles.\\" I like it because I find it funny that two people are mad at each other because of rabbits. But it did make me sad when she said, \\"...clubbing bunnies to death,\\" because I like cute little bunnies. It may be strange but all I could picture was a caveman walking into the petting zoo and start clubbing all the soft, fuzzy bunnies. But I guess I can't blame them, knowing the mess they're in. I like it because I think it shows how mad you can go in such harsh times.I think this book is good for fourth and fifth graders. I read it in fourth grade and it was fairly easy to read, so I guess it could be considered an advanced third grade book. I personally think it's too easy eighth graders because the poems are pretty flat out and easy to understand. It's also easy because there aren't any hard words. It would have been a better book for eighth graders if there were more symbolism in it. If I were a teacher, I would have sixth graders read it.One literary device that I liked in the book was how it was in story form. It made it easy to follow along. I also liked how she (Hesse) always kept it in first person. That way it seemed more like a journal, since that's how it was written. In the \\"Dear America\\" books, they often go away from the main characters thoughts and make the story change to present tense, as if the writer were writing while the action takes place. That didn't happen in \\"Out of the Dust,\\" and I liked that.The first time I read this book, I loved it. I suggested it to all of my friends and couldn't stop talking about it. This time, since I already knew what was going to happen, I couldn't sit through it. I read it as fast as I could, which I normally don't do. It also seemed like she was more of my age when I was ten, but this time she seemed younger, and I like reading about people who are my age or older. It's good, but not meant for reading a second time. It's the kind of book you read over the weekend and store it away forever."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I gave Out of the Dust 3 stars because I thought it could have been better. The tale of Billie Jo, growing up in the Dust Bowl and her life was really heart breaking; but the fact that it was written in blank verse poems made it boring. The plot was excellent and I thought it would have been much more moving if it had more descriptions that couldn't be reached by putting it in poem form. Many of the poems were really well written, but it was only a few out of 100. Also, the book was recommended for children ages 9-12.It should have been recommended for ages 7-10 for the vocabulary was elementary, and the plot was vary easy to follow. I did, however, like the way the book moved quickly. So I would recommend this book if you like poetry and a new style of telling a life story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is only an okay a book. People might say it is the best book they have ever read, but I have to disagree. The book is not average in anyway; it is no better than any other book I have ever read. The style is the only thing that sticks out about it from other books, and that style is just confusing, and pointless. The book has good ideas about the difficulties of the Dust Bowl, but so do other authors. Billie-Jo is the main character in this book that is about the struggles and hard times a family goes through. The only thing this book did was depress me; it did not do much more. Through all the ups and downs, Billie-Jo's family learns to forgive and forget, and take strength in one another.This book can succeed easily in depressing someone, especially in times like:\\"Ma ran across the kitchen,Out the porch door,Screaming for Daddy.I tore after her,Then,Thinking of the burning pailLeft behind in the bone-dry kitchen,I flew back and grabbed it,Throwing it out the door.I didn't know.I didn't know Ma was coming back.\\"(Karen Hesse, 61)This poem captures the melancholy of the book. This incident affects the family through out the book. It ruins Billie-Jo's family life.The family keeps each other going in difficult times, but in other times they hinder one another. They protect one another such as the time when Billie-Jo gets caught in a dust storm. Her father risks his life to go and find her. In other situations family pushes them apart. For example, there is the time when Billie-Jo runs away. She does this because she cannot stand living with her father. As you can see, this family has its ups and downs.Every one in the family has guilt over what happened. All thought it was the others fault. Though it is sometimes hard, family has to forgive one another. Billie-Jo runs away, but eventually comes back to her father whom she ran away from. She forgives her father for leaving the kerosene by the stove, which started the fire that killed her mother. She realizes she cannot stay mad at him forever, and family means more than a grudge. Both of them end up forging each other and themselves for their mistakes.Out of the Dust is a book like many others. It is like any old book and I would not say to anyone it is a \\"must read\\". It is like many other books about the Depression. The family has its own original problems, but that is about it. Its' writing style is weird; I have never seen a book like it. So, if you want to read a peculiar book, then and only then would I recommend this novel."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"OK, so maybe my views on this book are a little bit biased. I mean, what thirteen-year-old ENJOYS vacation reading? I, for one, do not, but I have read much better books assigned for school. Out of the Dust tells the story of Billie Jo Kelby, a teenage girl who lives in the Oklahoma panhandle, otherwise known as the Dust Bowl. It is a story written in poetry, which actually made it a lot better (which is why it got 3 stars instead of 2) and easier to get through. Billie Jo's life isn't very good. Her mother dies giving birth to her baby brother, and Billie Jo's hands get badly injured in an unfortunate accident. Her scarred and sore hands make it impossible for her to do the one thing that might make her feel better, play the piano.The story tells of Billie Jo's desparate desires to please her father, while getting closer to him, and to escape the dust that is ruining her life. I like the main idea of the plot, but I think Karen Hesse took most of the story in the wrong direction. I can think of about a million different ways that I would change the plot to make it better. However, the ending mostly makes up for the incredibly poor middle of the book.Billie Jo is a strong character, full of courage and desire. This story is certainly inspirational, and it makes you see how lucky you really are. I would reccommend it to anyone ages 11 and up, even though I didn't really like it that much. It is one of those books that will teach you something, no matter how much you like it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Lots of mothers wishing these days while their sons walk to California, where rain comes, and the color green doesn't seem like such a miracle, and hope rises daily like sap in a stem.\\" (Hesse,59) Out of the Dust is a book about a 13-year-old girl named Billie Jo, kind of a strange name for a girl, living in the \\"Dust Bowl\\" during the Great Depression.\\" Jo lives with her mother and father on a wheat farm that isn't doing too well because it isn't raining. Tragic things happen and Jo runs away but realizes she is lonely without her father so she goes home and there's a chance to start anew. \\"Wild Boy of the Road,\\" is my favorite poem in this book because it seems to capture the misery of this time and place. It also shows how everything seemed hopeless. This book is appropriate for 12 year olds and up, because it's pretty depressing, but the reading level is about 5th grade. I like the similes and metaphors in this book but it seems more like a poetry collection than a story. The narrative poems inside are connected by a thin story. The story is told one narrative at a time instead of in a flowing novel. Karen Hesse was trying to be innovative instead of telling the story right. Not a good read for those who are not open-minded."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;I got burned...bad&quot; is a quote out of this book. I say this is a great book for about anyone as long as you don't like sad things such as fires and deaths."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse, is a 2 star book.Out of the Dust is about a family living in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl in the 1930s and their struggles and hardships. Their wheat is not growing and they need the money. To begin with, Out of the Dust is depressing. The largest event that happens is when Daddy puts a pail of kerosene by the stove. Ma thinks that it is a pail of water and lifts it to make coffee for Daddy. It catches on fire and Ma runs out to get Daddy. After Ma runs out, Billie Jo (the main character) picks up the pail and throws it outside. It hits Ma and she catches on fire. As the book says, \\"Ma got burned bad.\\" This sets the stage for the whole story. As you can see, Out of the Dust is depressing, but it does teach you a lot about the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression.Furthermore, Out of the Dust is boring. It goes by quick though because it is written as a lot of free verse poems that sort of act as \\"chapters.\\" I was glad when I was finished. I would recommend this book to middle schoolers, although I did not like it very much, because younger students would not have the attention span for such a boring book. It is especially boring to me because I do not like poems, especially ones that do not have a certain format or do not rhyme. If you just need something to read though, Out of the Dust is not a bad choice. For the reasons above, Out of the Dust is a 2 star book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I did not like this book because it was in poems and it dragged on and on. It was to easy like 8-10.

But the applause made me forget the pain, the audience roared when I finished, they came to their feet, and I got third place, one dollar.&quot; (Hesse, 132)My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is The Competition. It shows Billie Jo at her best. Even though her hands are sore and she is in agony, she still plays the piano. The audience also took consideration for her. They must have known what poor Billie Jo had gone through.This novel is appropriate for age 12 and up. Most children in 7th grade learn about the Dust Bowl and well probably understand the book better. I advocate this book for history and English teachers. Teachers should assign books more often. Also younger adults will see many examples of similes. Karen Hesse uses them a lot.The format of this book is bizarre! At first the poem format was confusing but when I kept going, it got more interesting. I couldn't even put the book down. Personally, I like books in diary format. Karen Hesse has done something I never saw before, writing a narrative to tell a story. The narrative was blank verse, which means the poem has no rhyme. Hopefully you will like this book as much as I did."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was required for my Children's Literature class. Just about everyone in my class liked this book, and their ages range from 18 years old to 60+.I liked all of the poems. This story would have been excellent if it wasn't in poetic prose, but the style Hess used enabled the story to be told in fewer words that had more meaning.Another reason I liked the poetic prose is because there was a definite rhythm! It made me feel that Billy Jo was telling us her story through piano playing. Some of her songs were happy, and some were sad.LUCKILY, this is one story that Disney will never try to make a movie out of.I recommend this book for older children up through adult."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I am a Junior at Brigham Young University-Idaho studying to be a High School English Teacher. In my Young Adult Literature class, We were assigned to read this great book. At first, I was not excited at all about reading it. But once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I read it from cover to cover right in the middle of the Library! This Newbery Medal book really gives true insight into what the Dust Bowl was really like as well as the economic state of the country. When I teach this book in my classes, (because I definatly will)I will have the opportunity to teach many diffrent topics and morals along with it. For instance, I can teach US History, Personal Accounts, First Person Writting, as well as counting your blessings and touching on trials in our lives and how to deal with them. I laughed, I cried, I mourned, and I rejoiced with Billie Jo as she grew up and I highly recomend and invite ALL ages to do the same!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Written in the style of a free-form poem, OUT OF THE DUST provides the heart wrenching story about a young girl who accidentally caused her mothers death, a fact that darkens her path where ever she goes."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"As one of my 5th grade students said, &quot;This book being written in blank verse gives a lot of this book's emotional impact.&quot; I'd have to agree with that statement. Besides being a sad novel with rare happy moments, this is a book with a wealth of mini-lessons for teaching writing. Throughout this book Karen Hesse uses many author's crafts such as repetition, voice, effective use of dialogue, and the overall mood of the book to name a few. This book should be a staple in every 5th and 6th grade classroom."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book has a pretty interesting storyline, but the way it is written is just downright strange. The entire thing is written in a series of poems written by a little girl, the main character in this novel.It takes place during the Dust Bowl in the Southwest, with Billie Jo, the main character, dealing with life during the hard times she has. She must deal with emotional issues throughout the novel after a tragic incident with her mother and the guilt she feels afterward.Although the novel is written very strangely, it is still a good book and something that would be a good idea to pick up on a rainy day..."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book!! Karen Hesse does a wonderful job of pulling the reader into the 1930's. Her description of life in the dust bowl during the Great Depression allow the reader to feel all of the emotions of the characters and taste the dust during the storms. I wish that she would have provided more information at the end of the book. After experiencing all of Billie's sorrows and triumphs I was disappointed to find that there was no more story to read. I would recommend this book to my friends and I'm giving my grandfather a copy to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a heart-warming book about the Okalahoma dust storms. Karen Hesse wrote an excellent book that kept me on the edge of my seat not knowing what was going to happen to Billie Jo and her family. She was always scared inside and out when the storms were going on during the dust bowl. Billie Jo's mother dies while having her baby brother after a freak accident with fire and burning her when she was coming back into the house. Billie Jo does not realize that her mom was coming into the house and it surprised me as well. As I read this book it was hard for me to keep back my emotions. Karen Hesse does and excellent job in keeping the attention of the reader and making the story feel so real as it was going on in the time period of the dust bowl. Out of the Dust is a great edition to children's literature and deserved the Newberry award for making a difference in the life of a reader. The point of view was appropriate for the story that was through the eyes of Billie Jo the main character. The point of view enlarged my viewpoint as I read the book. The information meant more to me as I read the story through the eyes of a child living through the dust bowl. The author revealed the characters in an appropriate matter by introducing the family of Billie Jo and then the neighbors. The characters add to the book and seem to be based on real people that were living during the dust bowl. The facts that were written about were all fiction and made the events in the story more understandable. I personally liked the picture on the front cover of the book it grabbed my attention and made me want to read and find out more about this little girl, which is exactly what it did. The book is well designed in that it follows the same format all the way through and gives the story a different way of reading it. Out of the Dust was well deserving of the Newberry Award of 1998. This book I feel made a lasting contribution to the history of fiction books. Karen Hesse did an excellent job in making this a fiction book by including factual information that meant a lot to me as I read it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Some time ago my eight year old granddaughter loaned me this book..Yesterday I read it.

I loved it..."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This entire book is written in poem form. Most of the book is written as if it were poems but it is not. Many of the people that I know that have read this book even say it is not much of a poem book. To us it is more of a novel. There are a couple poems but not many.This book is about a girl name Billy-joe who has to live in Oklahoma during the time after WW2 and during the Great Depression. During this time she has to go threw really hard times like dust storms, grasshoppers eating every thing there is to eat, no wheat growing in the fields because of lack of rain, and even getting blamed for killing her mother and unborn brother. Billy-joe killed her mother and unborn brother on accident. I am about to tell the part of how she killed her mother and unborn brother:\\\\b Ma ran across the kitchen,out the porch door,screaming for Daddy.I tore after her,then,thinking of the burning pailleft behind in the bone-dry kitchen,I flew back and grabbed it,throwing it out of the door.I didn't know.I didn't know Ma was coming back.The flaming oilsplashedonto her apron,and Ma,suddenly Ma,was a column of fire.Although some of the content in this book are a little graphic this is still a great book. Me and all the other people I know that read it loved it too. If you like books about the Great Depression then this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"*Out of the Dust*After reading Out of the Dust, it made me realize how hard it would be to grow up in the depression with out a mom!I think that it would be hard to even try to imagine not having a mom getting you all the things that you need. And getting you places to where you need to go! And also to make matters worse for Billie Joe she has to go through the tough depression when her mom dies so it hits her even harder. And her family is having troubles with their family farm, the rain won't come and that is some of the reason the crops won't grow and if the crops won't grow then they won't have food to sell or eat!They are also having tough times with the dust storms which make everything worse because it ruins the crops, their clothes, and house.And to loose someone that close to you, you would fall apart ! That would be heart breaking! Could you handle all the pressure that Billie Joe did to take the guilt, having it on your shoulders that you helped kill your mom even though it was an accident with the fire? And could you stand doing all the chores that was left behind? And stand the fact that you also lost a little brother? Those are all questions that came across my mind when I was reading. I think that even though we have it good now and you don't think it would happen to you, if you just think about it hard enough you will start to feel the same way she does! I hope that if you read it that you will enjoy it and think about all the things that cross your mind!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In the beginning of this book you are just getting to know the characters. Lik Billie Jo a ten year old little girl that loves apples. Or Dad a hard working farmer in a dry waste land with on rain. Ma wants to have another kid but it never happens. She also loves to play the piano with Billie Jo . There are a lot of dust storms where they live. Then her Dad stops talking. Then it is all glum. A lady comes into town and Dad likes her and every thing is good.I give this book 4 stars. It always keeps you guessing. Then out of the blue her mom dies. It is a very sad book that has a lot of action. I think middle school students will like it because, it is a good mix of emotion. I recommend this book.RyanMadison,WI"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"There are two reasons I really liked this book. One reason i liked it was because in the beginning when Billy Joe was born, her dad really wanted a boy,but got a girl instead. When she was born she was still named Billy Joe, and that is really unique. the second reason I really like this book is because they(Billy Joe, moma,and papa) really are their only family nearby.I think the best part in this book is when Billy Joe's mom tells her that she isn't going to be the only child any more, because she is expecting.The most vivid parts of the book I think are the characters, and the setting. I say that because the characters are described and detailed very well. Also the setting is extremely well detailed. To the point where you can imagine where they are."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book called out of the dust is a great book!

It was also very educational and I learned a lot about that time period and the Dust Bowl. For instance, I had no idea that the dust was in their food, and beds, and drinks, and mouths, or even in the buildings. Another thing was that this book, unlike many other historical-fiction books, was that it was not boring, it kept hold of my intrest constantly. Over all, I enjoyed this book, and I'm not just saying this, I mean it, I liked this book and would recommend it to anybody who needed a good one to read.(I only gave it 4 stars because nothing is perfect)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"we read this book in texas history.I liked it alot it had a pretty sad ending but it gave me a really good glimpes of what happend back then during the great deppresion it wasn't a easy time at all for them, and it seemed that they had alot of trouble with people dieing and them losing people that they loved very much the way that they did.When i looked at the cover i thought it was going to be the most boreing book but it wasnt thats why im glad that they have the qoute,\\"never judge a book by it's cover.\\""},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This was a book that i read in L.A. class and found it intristing.

I liked it for one because it was a very easy read. Even though it was a poem I liked it because it did not rhyme. It was a good book to tell someone like me a lot about the history of America in the 1930's other than the Great Depression. I also liked the book because there were not many characters in it but the characters that were in it were characterized greatly. The story told in the book was awesome and personally I enjoyed the part when Billie Joe ran away and then came back because she realized that her dad was really the one holding the family together after the mother died. Over all the entire book was awesome and I really liked reading it, if they had a sequel to the book I would read that book to."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a pretty good book but I don't like how it is written in free verse poetry.

The only thing is the book was very long but the pages didn't have a lot of words on them so it kind of evened out. My friend said awhile ago that this was a good book. The reason I read this book is because we were reading it in English class. But I probably would have read it anyway."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I gave the book Out of the Dust four stars because I liked the book Out of the Dust because it was written in free verse poetry and it was easier to read and understand because it was a shorter book.

In buffalo we have bad snoe we may see 2ft, or we may see3ft we dunno when its going to hit or how much snow we will expect just like how Billie jo doesnt know when, or where the dust storm is going to hit. Also in buffalo they got slammed with snow up to 7ft in 48 hours, and this is similar to the book by how the crops always blow away eventhough her father tries and tries to grow wheat."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse, a very talented author, wrote a very interesting story called Out of the Dust. It is written as a book of poetry that tells of a young girls life, and how she deals with death and relationships. Billie Jo, the main character, tells the story in her own words, how she feels and what she thinks about the problems that come up. I especially like how Billie Jo tells of her dream she has after her mother's death. The author, Karen Hesse, wrote it as though it were real. It was like nothing in the dream made any sense, yet it was like real life. Billie Jo like to play the piano but her hands had been burned form an accident that caused her mother to die. In the dream she went to play the piano and couldn't, then the piano busted into a million pieces. It was how she felt about losing her mother, because her mother loved to play the piano too. I think having Billie Jo speak for herself gave the book an edge that had me feel for her more than if someone had narrated it. Those who read this book will learn that family needs to stay together. Like Billie Jo needed her father love. I give Out of the Dust five stars for being so creative and I am so glad I had a chance to read"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I read it as a 5th grader and I enjoyed it very much! It is written in a very unique way. They almost look like poems. Even kids who don't like to read would enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"1. The book is about a girl name Billie Jo who is living on the farm where there is a lot of dust, and she is trying dealing with the mother's and her baby brother's death. She thinks about her mother a lot so she can't really forget about the death. It started when Ma was pregant, and there wasn't anything growing because there hasn't been rain coming down. All that was coming down was the dust. After a couple days in the morning when Ma was cooking, kerosene and she thought it was just water and she cooked the fire just came out and her mother ran out outside to call Daddy. Billie Jo threw the kerosene outside while her mother ran in, and it got her. She got burned, and Billie Jo tried to help her but couldn't. Billie Jo got really badly burned on her hand and couldn't play the piano was one of her favorite thing to play the piano. She had one of the best scores in the state exam. And later on she got to play the piano on the Arsley Concert. And at the end Billie Jo's father was with a woman. And Billie Jo's tell what going on with the family and what is happening. The one thing that Billie Jo doesn't want is the woman to be near Ma's or her brother Franklin's grave.2. My favorite poem is \\"Thanksgiving list\\" because it is about Billie Jo's wish and what she wants at the Thanksgiving party.3. I would say I would give around my age to read the book because it tells really how she has feels about the mother and younger kids may not get the point of really what is happening in the story.4. I kind of like it because it tells the story that there is hope for children around the world to make there life better."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book that I have recently read, Out Of The Dust, was about a struggling family, the Kelds, living in Amarillo, Oklahoma, during the years of 1920-1935. During this time the Kelds were bombarded with the stress of the dust bowl.The reason that I chose the poem \\"Wild Boy of the Road,\\" was because I think that the Kelds were very considerate and helpful to the boy they did not even know. Having the little that they had and still able to help somebody showed how caring the Kelds were even in a time such as the Dust Bowl.I think this book is able to be read by our age group (9th grade) and maybe younger because even if it is fiction, it is based on our past, and all of our past is crucial in our future.The literary device is poetry that carries on throughout the book. The whole book is written in free verse.I think the book was very interesting because it revolved around things that actually happened through the 1920&#65533;s and half of the 1930&#65533;s. This book is told through the eyes of a fourteen year old in the prime of the dust bowl, even though her father&#65533;s farm was pretty much destroyed in the dust bowl, she &#65533;kept her roots planted.&#65533;"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo is a long-legged and red haired girl. She lived an ordinary but dusty life in Oklahoma with her parents and had an incredible passion for playing the piano. Her mother was very severe. She often thought that Billie Jo's work was much more important than playing the piano. Then a disastrous accident occurred, one that sent her mother and her newborn baby brother away from them forever. Playing the piano is now out of the picture due to the injuries on her hands. This accident has created a bigger space between Billie Jo and her father. Sadly, they never had a strong father/daughter bond. They blame each other and at times, themselves. Soon, the dust storms and droughts obliterate all the crops. Billie Jo can't stand the dust bowl any longer, and decides to run away from all her dilemmas. While she runs off, she realizes that she actually loves her father and the land, and she can't leave them now. As they move on with their lives, Billie Jo finds that there is hope."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is one of the most original books I have ever read. Karen Hesse illustrates life in the Dust Bowl in the 1930s splendidly and with the knowledge of the power of words. Unfortunately for Hesse, although her writing is very good, it seems many kids won't appreciate it to its fullest.Set in the Oklahoma Panhandle, Billie Jo is a twelve-year-old girl with a passion for music and the face of her farmer father. The book is the story of Billie Jo and how the Great Depression affects her life. Written in poetic journal entries this book is very unique and a good read.Although, with reality comes depression. Billie Jo lives a very difficult life and for those who like the upbeat books of Shel Silverstein, Out of the Dust is definitely in the dust for them. With her mother dead along with her baby brother, Billie Jo must fine common ground with her distant father.Despite her living circumstances I find some kids may relate to Billie Jo and her many hardships. For those who have relationship problems with a parent, or a passion for just about anything, reading Out of the Dust, can be a reference for how to deal with your problem or persevere to do your best.Not only is the book a lesson for life but a lesson of history. Hesse subtly teaches the reader about the 1930s, the president Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal, the national problems of the Great Depression and its affect on Billie Jo's family and friends. The book is a lesson, not a lecture, and educational for any audience.Not only is Out of the Dust a look into the past, it's a more positive way to look at the present. After reading Hesse's novel one better understands the value of life in the present (in comparison to the lives of millions during that period). Whether you are a fantasy or historical book buff, I think you'll find this book an excellent read and one of the more superior historical fiction novels. This novel is for those with a certain taste for literature. For me, it deserves its Newberry Medal and a round of applause."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Set in Oklahoma, this is a story of a 14-year-old girl called Billie Jo. This novel is told in diary form as a series of free-verse poems. Her father and mother struggled through hard financial times on the farm. Nothing would grow so many people died of drought, starvation and of diseases such as dust pneumonia. Billie Jo's life is tough because of all the economical and social disasters. Her mom dies after a terrible accident and her brother Franklin also dies right after he was born. Her mother dies because one day her father put a pail of kerosene next to the stove. Her mother mistakes it for water so she put it on the stove to boil. Suddenly there is a lot of fire and Billie Jo's mom runs outside to get her husband. Billie Jo comes in and grabs the pail of kerosene. As she does this she severely burns her hands. She throws the pail outside at the same time her mother is coming back inside. Immediately the flames engulf her mother killing her and the baby. This part made me really sad because I never expected this so there is also some suspense in Out of the Dust. Billie Jo hates the dust storms but loves playing the piano. Her dream of playing the piano unfortunately doesn't come true because after all the scars she has on her hands, it is impossible to play the piano. This book is able to teach about the Dust Bowl and its impact on the every day lives of Americans. The free verse poems give sparity to the text so it is fairly quick to read. I gave this book five stars because it is a great book and the vocabulary is very simple so you can understand it easily. This book clearly states all about the Great Depression and how Americans felt about the dust storms. Overall this is an excellent book and I honestly recommend it to you, your child or if you're a teacher then read it to your class. This book is mostly intended for kids in 5th grade and up. Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This novel tells a great story of how life was during the Great Depression. It gives hope to those who have none. It shows true talent through vivid poetry and descriptions.I feel that every student should read this novel because it is an excellent source of information on life during the Great Depression. It tells how the Great Depression impacted average-day working Americans and their families.It tells a story of Billie Jo a long legged red haired girl that lived in the city of Panhandle. She is very talented with the piano but stops playing after a devastating accident when her father left kerosene next to the stove. She had lost her mother and became total strangers with her father. People tell her that it was not her fault but when she turns her back they point their fingers and blame her. She is mad because no one blames her father, who she thought was the one who really deserved the blame because he left the bucket of kerosene next to the stove.Dust storms constantly cause damage to her home and the homes of many other people. She gets tired and runs away. Out of Panhandle and out of the dust.She hitches a ride on a train where she meets a hobo. The hobo tells her about his family and how much he misses them. That makes her realize how much she misses her father. She returns to Panhandle where she finally persuades her father to cut off the cancerous spots.She later meets Louise, her fathers teacher at night school. While Billie Jo had been gone, she had kept her father company. She doesn't accept the fact that there is another woman in her father's life, but gradually she starts to like Louise.The doctor checks her scars and gives her some ointment. She uses it for a while and starts to stretch her scars. Later she remembers how to play the piano.In the end Billie Jo, her father, and Louise become sort of like a family. The New Deal helps her father to grow wheat and make money again. And she gains hope. She becomes closer to Louise and they become more like family as her skills with the piano grows too.In my opinion, this is a great novel to read and is an excellent source of information of how life was during the Great Depression. I truly believe that this is one of the most remarkable pieces of literature in the world."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is an excellent book. It describes the hardships of Billie Jo's family during the depression. This book was written in a poetic form, where every page was its own poem. It was very entertaining and interesting.This book perfectly illustrates the history within the fiction, and the causes of the great depression. The author, Karen Hesse, wrote this book in an individual way. This book took place in Oklahoma, the center of the dust storms. These storms effected the people in the town, and their personalities.Billie Jo had a somewhat unique relationship with her father. After \\"The Accident\\", there was a tension between them. When they were in the same room, they didn't speak to each other. They felt awkward when they were together.This book caught my attention right away. After the first page I was hooked. The characters in this book were very detailed and had their own personalities. All the characters are fully developed. The book has many surprises and changes in the story. This makes it even more interesting. It is almost like a magnet.When I first read this book I was surprised at how much detail it had in it. It draws a picture in your head. After Billie Jo's mother past away, she was caught up in her own emotions. She was angry with her father for leaving the kerosene on the stove, and yet still blamed herself. Since her hands were badly burned, she did not play the piano like she used to. Billie Jo could no longer play her mothers piano which was covered in dust. She was somewhat stubborn and was focusing on the pastEven though this book is fiction, it has many facts in it. If you want to read a good book and learn about the great depression I recommend Out of The Dust. It tells aobut how many people were forced to move west in pursuit of a better life. Also, it tells how many of the farmers crops would be lucky to have 1/3 of their crops harvested.This book is very emotional and quite sad. The end is touching and wonderfully written. This book is one of the best books I have ever read and recommend this to all readers."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is an excellent book.

The book gave me another prespective of the Great Depression, how it affected the west. The book starts out with a young girl named Bilie Jo. She is a read haired, freckled, tall girl. She has to over come the troubles brought by the dust storm. Bilie Jo and her family live in the Dust Bowl. The dust storms bring conflict into the book. I was never able to predict what was going to happen next, because anything could happen, and sometimes it did. In the book Bilie Jo played the piano. Her mother taught her how to play when she was young. Bilie Jo loved to play tha piano nad she played whenever she could. Arley Wanderdale, her school music teacher asked Bilie Jo to play with him and the Black Mesa Boys, along with one of her good friends, Mad Dog Craddock. She played with them, and loved every minute of it. She played and played, untill one day.......Her mom was know gone, and her dad didn't talk much. Bilie Jo and her dad became strangers. The only thing that could make Bilie Jo feel better about loosing her mother, is playing the piano, but that was know impossible with her wounded hands. Arley kept asking Bilie Jo to play with him, Mad Dog, and the Black Mesa Boys, but she kept saying it reminded her to much of ma. This book was fantasic, it taught me more about the Great Depression, that i didn't learn from my history class. The pages are all free verse poems, in diary form, making the pages shorter. Since the book was short I was able to get thorugh it fast, but the plot, and conflict were more induce."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a book that is written in stanzas. Vividly written, the story is of a girl named farm having financial troubles, it is also ruined because dust storms and grasshoppers are currently plaguing it. Billie Jo's life is interrupted with financial, social, and environmental disasters. Though very jubilant at times, it features a horrific scene featuring the death of a close family member explicitly. The book truly left me flabbergasted. Yet in the end, I was left so happy for Billie Jo. While you read this book you will be dying to know if it ends happy, and for almost the entire book you will think that it will end unhappily, but truly, it does leave you with that special satisfaction that you get when you place down your book and truly realize how spectacular it is.The book starts out with a family, though provided with little, the family makes a lot. This is mostly because of the mother's contributions to the family. An accomplished woman at the piano, a wizard in the kitchen, and a genie on the farm, her mother brings special techniques of family life to the story. Her father, almost shunning his red haired, scrawny daughter, is stubborn and foolish. You see, he always wanted a boy. And when they are forced together, their relationship really blossoms, and it is a truly amazing thing to \\"witness\\" in a book.Though author Karen Hesse didn't use intriguing or astonishing vocabulary, somehow in her poetry I was drawn into the yarn majestically, and I could see the dust storms, I could see Billie Jo's dreams. I didn't know one person that hadn't finished the book before the deadline. It's not necessarily an easy read, but it is not at all hard to read. I found that it went at just the right pace for me, and I am an advanced reader already. So I was constantly reading the book and enjoying it.I truly do recommend it to you, be it for your class, or your child, the book is a truly spectacular achievement of poetry, and history. Never before has a book combined too aspects that amazingly."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read the book Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. It really struck me deep with all of the intriguing but harsh realities of the Great Depression. It is about a girl named Billie Jo whose father is a farmer. Her mother has unremitting miscarriages, and finally dies from one. Her father's farm is failing, because of the dust storms that run amok over all the crops, all of the time. Grasshoppers come in swarms to eat what has survived the extreme weather. Everything has gone bust. The government is in trouble, and the economy is down. The stock market crashed, leaving millions of people and families homeless, jobless, and just poor. Karen Hesse explains most of this through one 12 year old girl who just wants to grow up. She loves to play piano, but was appallingly burned from Kerosene in a freak accident. Billie Jo can't play anymore, and her mother was pregnant with 3rd degree burns covered all over her body.Everything was so depressing and blunt in the voice of Billie Jo, the main character, it really made me understand about the Great Depression. Through all of this hardship and despair, Billie Jo remains stalwart and youthful. She hates the dust storms, but loves her silent father too much to leave. Every single night Billie Jo goes to bed with dust covering her hair, face, and body. Billie Jo is a thoughtful, but carefree young girl, who just want to be a kid and liver her life fully.Although this is a great story, Karen Hesse didn't talk at all about the stock market. Farmers were not oblivious to the entire outside world, and she made Billie Jo's life seem like it was in just one little box. I thought that that would have been a nice blip to inform students about other causes of the Great Depression. Farmers were not the only ones that caused the depression. Even though they bought too much land and took too many bank loans out. Many city dwellers took huge risks in the stock market. I would only give this book 4 stars because Karen Hesse left out a main historical fact in her book. The crash of '29, the crash of the stock market.Compared to many other books this was amazing writing. The naturalness of the poems flowed through my heart at such a unruffled sturdy pace I couldn't stop reading. I think that the creativity of the poems and the irregularity of the format was new and exciting. Another, somewhat irritating, part of this book was the randomness of some poems. For example: Kilauea - A volcano erupted in Hawaii. It threw huge chunks into the air, the ground shook, and smoke choked everything in its path. ...sounds a little like a dust storm. September 1934 - pg. 79. This has no evident relativeness to the story, and it has no apparent relativeness to the broad idea. I think that those kinds of poems could have definitely been left out. Personally, that is one of the main rationales why I gave this book 4 stars. Overall, this was a great book, but when I think that one of the key historical points missing, I can't believe it. I would recommend this book to any future reader interested, but I would not nominate this book for the Newberry Award. But it is true, this book was a page turner for the heart."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I recently read Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse and was astonished by the heartfelt feelings that I was left with. Out of the Dust is a book about Billie Jo; a 14 year old girl growing up in Oklahoma during the Great Depression. Her life is hard and Karen Hesse clearly states her troubles so that the reader cares and feels for the characters in the story. I rate this book 5 gleaming stars because it kept me reading and begging for more when I finished. The reason I really enjoyed Out of the Dust so much was because of how Hesse described the environment that Billie Jo grows up in, and how Hesse goes into detail about what the characters are thinking. The metaphors in this book are thought provoking and really interested me when I read the book. For example: on page 172 \\"Help from Uncle Sam\\" Billie Jo writes; So my father said ok. Anything to keep going. He put the paper work on the shelf, beside ma's book of poetry and the invitation from Aunt Ellis. He just keeps that invitation from her, glowering down at me from the top shelf above the piano. I was really interested in this qoute because Aunt Ellis' letter on her mother's piano acts as a metaphor. It means that Billile Jo's father doesn't want her to go so he places the letter on her mother's piano. To me, he did this because he knew Billie Jo would never touch anything on her mothers piano. I also really enjoyed this book because it teaches about the importance of family. Know matter what your family members do, deep down inside you love them and always will love them. This can be seen when Billie Jo gets stuck in a dust storm, so her father goes into the storom in search of her (page 142-146.) Another form of love between family members is even after Billie Jo's father murdered her mother, there is still a bond between the two of them that will never die off. This book is excellent because it describes the importance of family and clearly defines the saying 'home is where the heart is.' I think this book deserves all 5 stars and definitly deserves to have won the Newbery Medal. This is one of Karens Hesse's greatest achievments and a benefit to the literature society."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was truly amazing. Not only does the story fascinate and engage the reader, but each poem stands on its own as a beautiful and honest pice of writing. This book is fabulous as young adult literature and would be an excellent resource for all teachers, especially those finding it diffuicult to transition between prose and poetry. This is not a difficult read, but it is a fresh and worthwhile one."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust is beautifully written in free verse poetry by Karen Hesse. The book is about a young girl who has to go through family problems and her own. This book is extremely sad as she loses her mom and burns her hands. Although it is sad it is an excelent book. Before I read this book I knew nothing about The Great Depression and what the people went through. This book is the only book I have read in free verse poetry. This girl must have been very depressed because she couldn't do the one thing that made her happy and her father would never talk to her. When she runs away she figures out she belongs in The Dust Bowl. When her father starts to speak to his daughter it seems everything goes right."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought Out of the Dust was an okay book. If I had to rate it on a one to ten scale (ten being the best) I would give it a seven. I didn't like it too much because it was a tragic book and it had quite a bit of drama. I'm not too fond of books that have too much tragedy and drama. Other than those two categories, I thought it was great.It was some what of an educational book. It taught me more about the dust bowl and how it effected so much of the population's crops. Anywhere the people went, like California or to the west, things didn't get any better.I couldn't imagine what it felt like to back then to live in such misery and have everything destroyed by the dust. It was like everyone and everything was eaten by the dust. Once people started planting the crops the dust destroyed them again. If it rained the water would wash away the wheat and the soil.This was an intresting book. I thought it was okay.

Out of the Dust is written in free verse. In some poems the style of writing is like how Billie Jo feels. Billie Jo narrates the whole story. The book is very descriptive which makes you feel like you are there. The author does a great job of describing the hard times.

It showed how horrible it was in the Olkalahoma Dust Bowl. I like how the author writes in free-verse and how she makes the poems wild when Billie Jo is having a good time. Like in, \\"On Stage\\" and, \\"The Dream\\". The author puts something in the story that's bad, then when you think everything is back to normal she makes it bad. Like when Billie Jo was cleaning the dishes and then a dust storm came. I like how the author makes one thing good and then that forms another and another. Like when the father starts to forgive Billie Jo everything starts to forgive her, like the weather. Out of the Dust shows love between different characters. Like Billie Jo and her dad near the end. I would rate this four stars, because the author makes you picture what's going on. You can picture the dust storms, the cars covered in dust, and Ma's grave. I like how the author puts generousity in poems and Billie Jo doesn't get anything for it in the beginning, but at the end Billie gets a picture.

When the Great Depression rolls around, so does her town's fate. As result from WWI, a series of dust storms attack during the drought of the century. During this awful time Billy Jo was involved in a near fatal accident in which her mother got severely burned and left her hands unable to play the only source of happiness, the piano. After several days of regret her mother dies, which leaves Billy Jo and her father to find some way to communicate and forgive each other for the death of her mother.

I love how Hesse formats this book as a poem and as a journal. This work of historical fiction was told from a child's point of view, it is amazing to see Hesse's ability to transform her mind into that of a child's. Throughout her writing I was able to journey through young Billy Jo's life experiences with her. I felt hurt when she felt hurt, I felt hope when she felt hope.Billie Jo lives with her mother and father in Oklahoma. Her dad wanted a boy, but he got her. Billie Jo loves to play the piano like her mother. Times are rough in Oklahoma because of the Dust Bowl. The family's income is dependent on the crops, but they can't grow any crops because it is too dry. Billie Jo experiences a terrible accident that changes her life forever. Her father put a bucket of Kerosene next to the stove. Billie Jo's mother mistakes it for water and uses it to make coffee. When her mother does this the bucket catches on fire and Billie Jo's mother runs outside to find the dad. Billie Jo is worried about that burning bucket in the dry kitchen so she grabs it and runs outside to throw it out, little did she know her mama was headed back to the house. Billie Jo threw the pale of kerosene and set her pregnant mother on fire. She rushed to her mother and hit the flames to try and smother the fire, not worrying about her hands while she swatted at the flames. Her mother and the baby died within the month and Billy Jo was overwhelmed with guilt. Her and her father never talked anymore and she couldn't play the piano anymore because her burnt hands hurt to bad. She eventually ran away from home because she couldn't take the guilt or the dust anymore. She came back after she realized what she really needed was the only family she had left, her father. When she returns home she and her father finally begin to talk like they haven't in ages. Her father eventually met another woman and Billie Jo liked her. Billie Jo even begins to play the piano again. She has overcome a lot of grief in the past year, and for once things are starting to go right again.I definitely see why this book won the Newberry Medal. This book allows the reader to experience this tragic event in Billy Jo's life. As the reader I experienced the grief and guilt that Billy Jo had to endure. When the dust storms overwhelmed the farm she lived on I could vividly picture these events in my mind.I would definitely recommend reading this book.

It was a little boring at parts but overall it was ok."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book \\"Out of the Dust\\" is decent but leaves out important descriptions of the main characters friends or enemies that form the shape of person that the main character will become. Most of what you know about Billie Jo is that she is long-legged, has freckles, and will eventually burn her hands badly. The book describes nothing but the family and even within the family the sense of character of the others is very vague and hard to understand why they did that. This book tells almost nothing Billie Jo does all day except for school and playing piano. The important part of this book is that as you read it you begin to understand what life would be like full of dust and with very little water.

I just sort of stumbled on this book a few years back and decided to read it out loud to my daughter. What a find. How effectively these poems work together to form an absorbing and complete narrative is nothing short of remarkable. It's an award-winning book for children, but as an adult who does a considerable amount of reading, I found the book to be very fulfilling. I have read books from this time period plenty of times, but so many of them, though effective, do not capture such raw emotion, such desperate longing and ache, quite like this one. I can't say enough about this book.I have read the book to my classes over the years, too. It's a great teaching tool, spanning history, elements of poetry, and it enables kids to get a different take on what it means to tell a story. Additionally, because it is a book of poems, I have been able to read the book aloud in ten minute increments without losing the flow or thread of the story.Chris BowenAuthor of,Our Kids: Building Relationships in the Classroom"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I started out reading this because my son's 6th grade class was reading it.

After a prolonged drought Oklahoma has become a veritable dust bowl, where few crops are able to grow--certainly not her father's wheat. Financial despair is made evident by thick coatings of dust on everything in both her exterior and interior environments. There is no escape from the inexorable indifference of Nature to man's pain.The protagonist's situation becomes even more lamentableas a result of a tragic household accident which scarred four lives:kerosene mistaken for water left on a stove. Billie Jo's only solace in this dust bowl is playing the family's modest piano, but as if the needless loss of life after the fire were not enough, Billie Jo suffers the use of her hands so she can no longer escape her misery at the keyboard. Disfigured, shunned by her peers and rejected by her morose father, she yearns to get out of the Dust any way possible. Doesn't she have a right to leave the devastation behind her, to seek a new life where she can finally breathe free?The author's literary style offers teenage readers an additional challenge, for this unique book consists of a series of free verse poems--rather than traditional narrative prose. Teens typically experience difficulty redefining their relationships with their parents, but Billie Jo--who adores her mother despite their musical differences--is consumed by guilt over her inadvertent role in the family tragedy. While extremely depressing on the surface the plot (Nature's remorseless unrolling of anguish upon hapless people) hints of distant hope for the human spirit. Despite the bitter realism this book will leave most readers with a reminder that we should cherish what we most value in this life while we are privileged to have and recognize it. Serious YA fare in a spare and unique format."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Very effective. I've never liked poetry, and could never quite figure out the point of free verse, but it really works.

Its a outstanding book but at the same time its pensive. It's about Billie Jo's life she leaves in Oklahoma, she had been by herself with her dad, because her mom had died in a fire accident, she saw what happened to her mom. Her mom was nearly to have a baby when she went and put the pot on the stove, then fire started coming out of the stove and the fire had burned Billie Jo's mom, She also burned her hands, her mom was crying alot that she gave birth in the kitchen window. Billie Jo had run to go get water so the fire could stop but it was to late her hands were burned and her mom gaved birth and she died so did the little baby, but her dad came and called the doctor but the doctor said, \\"I am sorry, Its too late\\". Billie Jo and her dad were really depressing, their tears came out of their eyes and Billie Jo's dad's sister came from Lubber and she wanted to hold her nephew, but he told her what happened that he cried every time he remembered that day.Out of the dust is a good book and It's very tragical It makes you picture what is happening in the book. The part that was very mournful was that Billie Jo doesn't have a mom and a brother specially she doesn't have a family next to her to help her and everything she needs. They live In different places, she likes playing piano suchlike her mom, she showed her how to and she wants to play piano to tenacious her memories. She loves to play piano she wants to enter to a concert and play with her friends, but she doesn't know if to because she doesn't have enough money. She has to work with her dad and make money and she has to take care of the farm, Billie Jo had think alot if she should enter the concert so she can play piano and if she should help her dad with the farm and to find money well if you are curious well you should find this book and read it and find out what is she n going to do. Billie Jo is left to find peace in the bleak of Oklahoma and in the surprising landscape of her own heart. This is an amazing and a pensive book I am really sure your going to love it and picture all the things she've been through by her own. I recommend this book because It's a pensive book and it will make you picture and imagine how lonely and sad shes feeling . The author is Karen Hesse. Karen Hesse is a great author she describes whats happening and how is Oklahoma and she evens expressed how Billie Jo's life have been without her mom, Billie Jo wants her mom so she could tell her many things and how have she done at school.

This book explains through the eyes of a teenage girl the struggles and hardships of life in the Midwest during the era of the Dust Bowl.

We are studying the Great Depression in history, and my History teacher thought it would be appropriate to read this book for further knowledge, and in depth descriptions. I think that reading this book, while studying the Great Depression is a great combination, and results in a rapid increase of knowledge. One of the most unique characteristics about this book is that it is written in diary format, completely in free verse poems, by Billie Jo, a 13-year-old girl living in Okalahoma, during the dust bowl. The best thing about expressing literature in poetry is that it adds emphasis on the dramatic parts; they also add emotion to places where emotion makes history a reality. Page upon page, Billie Jo describes how the dust storms impact the crops, as well as everyday life, and also how it feels to be living in the middle of the biggest dust storm in all of America; the Dust Bowl. As Billie Jo describes life during a dust storm, you are swept from your everyday life and brought into the reality of being in a dust storm. The descriptions are great, you feel as if you are Billie Jo, venturing into the wind, not being able to see, dust filling your mouth. This book explains the causes, effects, and impacts of the Great Depression, as well as many aspects of The New Deal. The FERA (federal emergency rescue association), a program in The New Deal, helps Billie Jo and her family with the farm, the CCC is also mentioned in the book. The story is not all about the dust storms however; \\"Out of the Dust\\" has a great plot, with many different things to pull you in farther. Many events happen that will alter Billie Jo's life forever, a horrible accident scars Billie Jo both mentally and physically, after which her relationship with her father will never be the same. As Billie Jo pursues to sort out her many family problems she surprisingly digs deeper into her soul than she ever thought was possible, finding things out about herself that she had never known before. I enjoyed this book very much, and I know you will too. If you enjoy learning more, while having suspense and a great, enthralling plot, this book is definitely for you!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Good bookI enjoyed this book it is cool to read her live I would recommend it to fifth grade student that are studying the great depressionI love this a great author!!Wonderfull bookRead it and you will love it"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I use this book with my clasroom and we love it.

She left from her house and met a stranger near by. They slept together in the street. When the sun rose Billy Jo opened her eyes and she was scared. The stranger was gone and he left a picture of him and his family. If I were Billy Jo I wouldn't run away from home because you never know what will happen unless you're a fortuneteller. I think she ran way because her dad was really drunk and she couldn't stand living there with a person that is going to ignore her all her life. So kids what ever you do don't run away from home, and stay out of DANGER."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I enjoyed reading Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. I liked the unusual poem format of the book. It made it seem like you were inside Billie Jo's mind and were reading her thoughts.

The vivid and detailed language made you feel like you were there, and I could picture what the storm would have looked like in my head. The one thing I didn't like about Out of the Dust were some of the longer poems. Sometimes they got boring while you were reading and made you want to skip to the next poem.

That made it very fun and easy to read. These poems are very descriptive. Some of these poems helped me get a mental picture. The one reason I wouldn\`t rate this a 10 is because of the depression.

It was a tale of Billie Jo,a young girl living in the Oklahoma Panhandle during the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl Age. Billie jo through tramatic events and dust learns many of life's lessons. She grows from being a little girl with no past to a young woman with a sparkling future. My favorite part of the book was not just one chapter. I enjoyed how Ms. Hesse combined the terrible events and feelings of the Dust Bowl with a story of a young girl. I also enjoyed how the way the book is printed you can get second meanings out of the poems. An example of this is the poem about the piano, where Billie Joe tries explaining about all of the feeling she puts into playing. Her words are spaced portraying the different hands at the piano. One is high and playing the melody and the other is low and playing the harmony. The poem is deeper than it sounds and I understand how she feels because I attempt to play the piano also. Out of the Dust was a good book and it deserved to win the Newberry Award. The poems are deeper than the reader expects and that point alone makes the book a winner. The book also has the historic content of what life was like in the Dust Bowl Age and how people survived."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a great historical document.

Karen did a very good job in writing this novel. It shows just how hard the Dust Bowl was and how tragic it could be to a family. Though it shows a lot of hardship, it does also show some greatness. The dust separated Billie Joe's family, but brought it together in a sense. When Billie Joe ran away from home she realized how much she really missed her father. The dust separated her father and her on the outside, but on inside it just made them stronger.

I would recommend this novel to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked this book because it really tied in symbolism.

Billie Jo has to figure out on her own that she is tied to the dust and she just can't leave it. Also, Karen uses very good symbolism by characters name such as LoRaine as in low rain.

My favorite poem was Roots because my life is sort of like that poem. I think that this book is appropriate for children from the age of seven to one-hundred and seven.

This winner will appeal to all ages :)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I would give this book four stars because although I like to listen about Billie-Jo's life style and find out about the problems she had to solve, it was hard to read. It was hard because it was written like a poem. there were many commas and not a lot of periods to stop at and take a breath.Billie-Jo lived with her mother and father. Billie-Jo's mother was pregnant with a baby boy. One day their house caught on fire. Billie -Jo's mother got burned very badly. Billie -Jo\`s hands were burned too. Billie-Jo's mother died giving birth to her brother and her life change. Billie-Jo couldn't play her piano for a while because of her burned hands. Billie-jo's father wasn't the easiest guy to live with because of his grief. Billie-Jo needs to go on with her life but can she? Billie-Jo has a chance to live with her aunt but she decides to live with her with her dad.I think someone that likes to read about peoples lives and problems will in enjoy this joy this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought the book was excellent. As a historical fiction novel goes the setting and general circumstances of the dust bowl were realistic. Even the horrible accident that happens to Billy Joe's mother was based on real accounts. Strangers are treated with kindness and compassion. Reading Karen Hesse's 1998 Newberry speach, I found that she had reseached several years worth of newspaper accounts from the Boise City News. The main conficts in the book were Nature vs. Character (the land verse the people) and Character vs. Character (Billy Joe vs. Self : dealing with guilt and grief of her mother's death) Billy Joe's battle within herself was the major conflict. This a very realistic confict for any time period, and many people had to deal with loved ones dying during the dust bowl years. Many terrible accidents happened along with suicides.Billy Joe is very dynamic character in the book, and the story is told from her point of view. This is extremely important since through her eyes we witness the pain, sorrow and ultimately the growth of her spirit. She changes a great deal throughout the story. And although the father at first seems like a flat character as the story progresses we see that he too is a dynamic character. Like many men of his time he was in charge of the farm work and earning the money. He didn't display his love for his daughter in an obvious fashion, but as the story unfolds we see his love for her. Two of the strongest themes in the book were forgiveness and dealing with the pain that life will bring. Billy Joe had to learn to forgive herself and her father in order to deal with her mother's death. Like many poems this one had many examples of figurative and symbolic language. What sticks out in my mind however is how the land parrelles Billy Joe's and her father's conlficts. After her mom's death Billy Joe and her father start to withdraw and slowly die on the inside just like the land. They all want the rain to give them relief and just like rain did come during the dust bowl the relief usually didn't last long, and neither does the relief that Billy Joe and her father ocasionally come by. They never give up hope though that the some day the rain will come and the plants will grow again, just like they never give up hope, that they will get their own type of rain and will start growing inside again. What an important and worthwhile them to discuss."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think the novel \\"Out of the Dust\\" is a great, emotional story. It was very touching and I thought that it was neat that Karen Hesse wrote the story in free verse poems. The poems gave me enough information for my imagination to fill in. I could read the story at many levels.It is about a 14- year old girl, named Billie Jo. She suffered terrible dust storms in Kansas, the death of her mother, a non- communicative father, and the burning of her hands. She really liked to play the piano and was the smartest kid in the state.In the beginning of the book, her father worked on the farm, her mother did work around the house, and Billie Jo helped out, played the piano, and went to school.In the middle, a terrible accident happened. The Dad placed a pail of kerosene in the kitchen, and Ma thought it was water. She tried to make coffee using the kerosene. Then the pail caught on fire and Ma ran outside. Billie Jo picked up the bucket to keep the house from burning, and ran outside with it. As soon as she was outside, she threw the pail. Ironically, Ma was running back inside. The burning pail hit Ma and she was engulfed in flames. Billie Jo pushed her down and tried to put out the flames, burning her hands badly. A month later, Ma died, giving birth to a baby, who died shortly after. The tragedy was so horrible that I was drawn to find out how the story would end. Yet, the author didn't overwhelm me with morbid details.Billie Jo and her dad barely talked. It took time for the two to work out their problems. At the end of the book, they met a woman who acted like Ma. She was called Louise. Pa married her and Billie Jo forgave him and vice versa. They overcame the past and moved on in life.I like how Billie Jo gradually developed the problems and gradually solved them. In doing this, the author made everything believable.The whole story improved with the addition of Louise. There was always tension between Ma and Dad. Louise's influence brought calmness to Dad and Billie Jo. She also re-introduced Ma's good ideas to Pa, who finally acted on them.Louise also helped Billie Jo's confidence and sense of family increase. Through all this, these three characters grew in positive ways.In summary, the free verse poems, which encouraged my imagination and the gradual positive resolution of Billie Jo's and Dad's problems, left me feeling stronger and more positive about life. This story touches anyone who reads it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the dust is about a girl Named Billie Joe. It is based in Oklahoma during the dust bowl and the great depression.

It's about a girl, named Billie Jo that sadly lost her mother in a tragic accident. Billie Jo, having the town think it was all her doing, mostly caused the accident. After her death, the books slightly gets slower, being in the hassle of having a pretty bad relationship with her dad, and that makes the story even sadder.\\"I don't know my father anymore.He sits across from me,He looks like my father...\\" (Hesse, 76)What I really like about the novel is that it's a blank verse book that makes it look attractive, but once I saw it for the first time I had said, \\"Oh, it's just a short, boring looking book.\\" Not really, the story does emotionally touch you by the way it's written.

The details really made me feel like I was a part of the story, like I could actually taste the dust as she described it.So, in conclusion, I highly recommend this book. Sure, it's a tearjerker, but it is also an extremely inspiring novel. Happy Reading!!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The Newbery Medal award winning novel Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse was an excellent depiction of life in the Dust Bowl around the 1930's.

Now a drought has struck the plain and the soil has turned to dust. Dust storms that block out the sun kill animals, people, and crops. Dust is every where and piles up like sand dunes. Out of the Dust is a compelling story about a girl living through the depression in the dust bowl. Billie Jo, the girl in the story, has to overcome many difficulties to survive in the dust bowl. Such as a terrible accident that transformed Billie's life forever. It is amazing that the dust bowl really happened. I like how the book intertwines historical facts with a fictional story line. It is very interesting to see what really happened in the dust bowl. Before I read Out of the Dust I didn't know much about the dust bowl. I gave it 5 out of 5 stars because the book was full of historical facts but not boring. I liked how you could really understand how Billie Jo was feeling as she faced the problems that the dust bowl caused. I would highly recommend Out of the Dust to readers that want to learn about history and still enjoy the book at the same time."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust Review&quot;I don't know my father anymore. He sits across from me, He looks like my father, He chews his food like my father, He brushes his dusty hair back Like my father, But he is a stranger.&quot; (Hesse, 76)This is the first stanza to my favorite poem, &quot; The Empty Spaces.&quot; In this poem the narrator, Billie Jo, explains how she and her father are gradually separating from each other because a terrible accident happened in their family. This amazing book written by Karen Hesse is a book of poems. It is about thirteen year old Billie Jo and her life during the Dust Bowl. Billie Jo has a powerful love for pianos and leaving the dust in Oklahoma. This marvelous book includes many examples of figurative language. My favorite simile is &quot;The wind roared like fire,&quot; which refers to the blustery winds during another horrid dust storm. All of these poems have great depth and meaning. I would recommend this book to ages 10-14."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;Dust piles up like snow across the prairie, dunes leaning against fences, mountains of dust pushing over farms.&quot; (Hesse, 102) Life is hard for thirteen-year-old Billie Jo Kelby, born during the Dust Bowl and the Depression in the panhandle of Oklahoma. Her love for her mother, father and to-be born brother and the piano compels her to stay in this dangerous, life- threatening territory that could shatter her family's whole way of living with one hour of a dust storm. Tragedy occurs, though not from a dust storm, but from a crises from a stove fire that leaves Billy Jo's mother and unborn baby lifeless and her hands useless stubs which puts all of Billy Jo's dreams in peril. This is an exciting book with great descriptions and wonderful poetry. The best poem, in my point of view, is the poem &quot;The Dream&quot; (Hesse, 193) which is a simile comparing the piano to Billy Jo's dead mother. Although this book is sad, it has an excellent ending and it's a great book for ages nine to twelve. So I recommend Out of the Dust as a great novel. S.

It was about a young girl that lived on a farm, during the years of 1934-1935 who went through life changing incidents. She learns more about life than she can imagine. In the book a family member dies, which changes her whole life. She soon finds out, that change is best for her. In my opinion I found that this book was not that great. It didn't catch my interest and the book didn't give me a good or bad feeling, which made it very boring to me. Also, I couldn't connect to the characters in this book, and I feel that i enjoy the book better when I am able to connect to the characters. It had parts in it that grabbed my attention yet not enough to keep me interested. Even though I did not think the book was that well written, I did like that it was written in poetry form.

A great coming of age story, Hesse gives us the feminine perspective of what is important - what is worth living for - during a time of extreme poverty and hopelessness. The drought, the dust storms, the grasshoppers, \\"The Path of Our Sorrow\\" (p. 83-84) has taken away any hopefulness for a fruitful harvest. But Billie Jo and her family are some of the more fortunate ones. They are able to keep their farm; they have a house and some food, even if they have to \\"chew\\" the milk because of the dust. (p. 22) The piano offers some comfort, too, until the accident.In addition to the Great Depression, Billie Jo has to deal with her own depression, a result of the accidental death of her mother and the disfiguring hurt of her own injuries. Was it Billie Jo's fault? Her Father's? Will she be able to forgive him, or herself?Billie Jo is bitter. Bitter from the dust, from her father's silence, from her mother's absence. She tries to run away from her hurt, \\"Out of the Dust\\" (p. 197-8) but she finds that the hurt follows her, and it is in this realization that she is finally able to forgive her father and herself.

Hesse must of published this book to give honor to all of the people that lived in the dust storms of the depression in dead farms. She gives the reader a sense of how hard it really was and why that time in our countries history really was a difficult depression to live through.Karen Hesse burns her hands while saving her mother and the baby her mother is carrying inside of her. The mother catches fire to her apron while working in the kitchen. Before this time Karen was an incredible pianist. She played many performances and even began to make money for her music. Nevertheless, it hurt her hands to play the piano. The most exciting part of this book is when she plays a beautiful song (with burnt hands) and afterwards is in terrible agony. During the playing of the song she is floating in the sky loving every second of the experience. This part in life showed how strong of a girl she was.Karen Hesse was the main character and only character thoroughly portrayed in all aspects. Therefore, I related the most to Karen Hesse because I found many more experiences that were similar in my life. I have not had as hard of hardships and as big of downfalls. However, I do share the quality of being talented in areas and at times finding myself not able to perform those activities be effects that were not caused by me and effects that I would not have been able to prevent.If I was a critic, and I criticized this work of words, I would rate it an eight out of ten. First, I take away one point on the criteria of the introduction. I could have easily stopped reading this book during the first 20 pages and not felt any loss are wanting to continue reading. It is a good foreground to the rest of the story, but because of the nature of diary entries, it took awhile for the story to really come to a real plot. It just seems to wander during the first pages. It loses the other point because I never was really pulled into this book. One way I judge a book is how I end up reading it. I usually read later in the evening about 9-11 o'clock P.M. If a book is slightly boring or does not have enough feeling to make me feel like I am part of the story, I will fall asleep with the book on my face. If the book is a real mind catcher and the story is very meaningful I tend to be kept away in suspense or curiosity. Extra-ordinary books even keep up longer than I would like to be and I stay up reading to all hours of the night."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I THOUGHT THE BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING - BORING. I WAS IMPRESSED, CONSIDERING I HAD TO READ THIS BOOK FOR SCHOOL."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Yeah... it's mass marketed because no one buys it (except stupid people). And schools never let you read good books. I mean, I have to read the Odyssey. This is a terrible book, Homer is a terrible bard/poet/author, the guy who translated it sucks. Boo Ancient Greece (but now they have Tzatziki and Pita Bread so Modern Greece is fine with me!)"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo removes herself from all situations while she still feels for the things and people around her. She describes all with great detail but doesn't gain strength from her mistakes, faults, or the accident. This simply would not happen. Billie Jo would change in ways other than becoming quiet or losing the ability to play her piano. Her perspective does not change pre-accident to post-accident. She remains the same immature girl that feels and acts weakly. The only other change Billie Jo experiences is that she finally gains the confidence to leave but is unsuccessful. The reader will not find it pleasant to read the pain and suffering of the main character because nothing grows the slightest bit more pleasant, until we hear about Louise. Louise is Billie Jo's Father's love intrest. She comforts him until Billie Jo gets back from her attempt to pemanently leave Oklahoma. He intends to marry Louise. Louise is the only happy thing in Billie Jo's life.I can also see that Karen's target was to use poetry as a form of writing but her work was not poetic. I write poetry and put passion into it. It seems that Karen just put words together to tell the story. She may have done this to show Billie Jo's immaturity but this does not speak well for her. Also, the poems are choppy and strangely formatted. I hope this is not Karen's best work but I know for sure I will not read one of her books again until it is required."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I had a hard time reading this book becuase half of the book was hard to understand so I had to read some of the sentences again 3 or 4 times to understand what it said,pluse the way the book was written was'nt the wway Iread chapter books.This book kept going on and on like a never ending story.I'd only recommend this book to people who like the book &quot;Sarah Plain and Tall.&quot;So baciclly what I'm saying from what I just explained is I don'tlike this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think this book is for little kids like 8-10 because it is very easy to ready but it is also very very boring and sad at the same time.But i think there was no point for the writer to write this i think she wasted her time even though it was about history i think i shouldve read a different book.The weird part about this book is that is it's a poetry book.I think i could've written a better book.It was'nt very adenturess at all because its like...she got on the train her food got stolen and that dudes picture was there i mean come on it was retarded.Then she just goes back home i mean...what was the whole point of that?!?!?!?!I think she should'nt have gott'in that award at all.It was also very slow it kept freakin sayin the dust,the dust,someone dies,more dust,someone dies,more dust i mean that was pretty dull.If she made any money on this book i dont think she deserves it.I recommend this book for perople who just wanna read and like boring books and poetry like books and books that repaeat things over like...dust,someone dies,more dust,cant grow crops,dust,someone dies,cant grow crops,and so on and so on.It's also not very exciting at all!Thats why i give this very boring book a ONE STAR...hahahahahahahahahahahaha i cant believe she even wrote this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse did an excellent job of expressing the character's emotions. She portrayed the feelings of death and happiness wonderfully. With characters such as Billy Jo and Bayard this had to be one of the best books I ever read. This book was exciting and breathtaking, kept you on your toes, and made you want to listen and read more. Karen Hesse turned what looked like an ordinary poetry book into a real life story of an everyday family's life.

It is an ideal book to use in literature circles in a classroom setting. A metaphoric novel, Out of the Dust is both straight-forward and yet complex at the same time, ideal for an average classroom with varying levels of ability in understanding and interpreting literature. I recommend this book to all students and teachers, as well as any other adult...it is an honest tale of personal and interpersonal struggle told from the viewpoint of a very courageous, fourteen-year-old."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I listened to my 10-year-old daughter read this book to me.

As a fifty-four year old man, I didn't think it would &quot;speak&quot; to me. I began to read it at 5:30 one morning. Not only could I not put it down, but after only a few minutes, I was consciously willing myself to slow down and savor every extraordinary moment.

Indeed, I gave away my copy a few days after I read it and had to immediately buy another."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think the book was good.

I liked everything except for some parts that were depressing. I liked when Billie-Jo met a guy on the train. I also liked when it snowed and everyone got hopeful. This book starts out depressing but ends up hopeful."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book I read is called Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. It won the 1998 John Newbery Award. The book is tied on some ways to the Depression Years because it took place then. Depression is a period of low general economic activity marked especially by rising levels of unemployment.In the years of 1934 and 1935 in the state of Oklahoma, the dust bowl is raging. Bobby Jo, the main character of this book is given this name by her father, because he wanted a boy. Bobby Jo keeps a journel, and writes down the events that happen in a poem form.Bobby Jo talks about how the Depression and the dust bowl seems to be getting worse. Bobby Jo seems to understand what is going on. A large number of people are losing their jobs, the dust bowl is destroying crops, and there isn't really a lot of money. It is making her family and friends miserable because you have to work really hard just to survive. Bobby Jo lives on a farm covered by dust. Dust storms occur very often in the mid-west. The dust storms are destroying farmer's crops and animals, so people are losing their jobs. There are shortages of food and water causing people to go hungry.Bobby Jo talks about how she is saddend by people moving away from where she lives. One person was her friend Livie Killian. Bobby Jo's mother is supposed to have a baby, but an accident caused by her father changes all of that. The accident leaves Bobby Jo's hands crippled, and her mother's whole body burned. The mother and the baby die, leaving just Bobby Jo and her father. For the rest of the book, Bobby Jo and her father try to bond with each other and get along, but her father seems to have gone slightly crazy. Bobby Jo starts to worry. Her dad is starting to get spots on his skin. Weird spots. Bobby jo gets so fustrated that she runs away out of the dust.After meeting a man who also ran away, she decides that she needs to go back to see her father. When she comes home, her dad finds out the spots on his skin were cancer, and so he gets them removed. Bobby Jo meets his dad's new girlfriend , Louise. Louise helps Bobby Jo and her dad solve their problems, and as she does, Bobby Jo relizes that she likes Louise. And in the end, Bobby Jo discovers that something good can come out of something bad."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse did a wonderful job on Out of the Dust. This was written in poetry form in a diary. Billie-Joe is a teenage girl who loves piano. In the summer ma is going to have a baby. There is a pail of kerosene on the oven and ma thinks it is water so she puts it in coffee and catches fire. Billie-Joe thinks it is water and pours it on Ma. Ma eventually dies and so does the baby she was carrying. Billie-Joe has to live with only her dad. It is hard to play the piano for Billie-Joe because her hands were badly burnt from the fire.I reccomend this book to everybody in 5th grade and everybody above."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought Out of the dust was a very good book. It was especially good, because it is written in free verse poetry and is different from other books. I would recommend this book to anybody who wants to know the story of someone living in the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think that the novel Out of the Dust was an ok book. It is made of a series of poems writen by the main character Billy Jo. The author of this book is Karen Hesse. It takes place in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl. This novel is only 227 pages long and the peom set up makes it a very quick read. It was realy hard to distinguish between the rising action, climax, and falling action of this book though. So really you feel like something is going to happen but it never does. All the main character talks about is how dusty it is and how she wants to leave. The dust and wind is so bad that they can't grow the wheat they need to survive. The only real events that happen in the book are that the mother gets burned by Billy Jo and later dies giving birth to a baby that just dies, and Billy Jo finally runs away from her Father and the dust at the end but she just comes back."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I am student from a Fairfax County Schools and I have read the book Out Of The Dust. I would give it four stars because it wasn't the best book I have ever read and it is not my type of book. I usually don't read these kinds of books. It is not my style, well anyways it was a \\"ok\\" book.This style of writing a book was a first for me . It was a book written in poem form . Some of the poem were had for me to understand since it was written that way. Some poem were good and some weren't .There were some parts that weren't really appropriate. There is a part when people get burned and many parts when people died. Gladly there were places when things were good. Like when it had rain long and hard after months with little or no rain at all.Good things were that the author had describe every little thing. You could tell what had happen in the story like you were watching a movie, but that is not always good to it is also like watching a horror movie too. I had there were parts where people had been burned. Well the author had describes the person skin and how she/he looked like. It was very nasty and disturbing. Then the way the author had described the way Billie Jo had played the piano, you could imagine the music in your head. Then she would describe how her hands look and how the felt when she played the piano.The author would also describe how it looked when dust storms had came and how it sounded when it hit against windows and wall and how the door flew open when the wind blew harder and harder. Then she described how the people had struggled when walking through storms and how when the sand blows into there eyes and how much its hurts when Billie Jo's hand is exposed in the storm. It says that it get stuck in her scabs and how she is in pain.Even though it may sound interesting to you, it might not to others. Again it is still not my style of a book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem was \\"The Fields of Flashing Light\\". It took place in March 1934. It is about a dust storm in the Oklahoma panhandle that struck unexpectedly, suddenly, and ferociously. I liked the quick pace of the poem. I liked how Karen Hesse described the lightning on the fields.This book is appropriate for 9-12 year olds. I found this information on Amazon.com. I think the way the book is built is why it is appropriate for these ages. It uses simple words. It is organized basically with one season a chapter, and most of the poems aren't more than a page.I found personification, stanzas, and imagery in the book. An example of personification is \\"Lightening danced down on its spindly legs\\" because this phrase gives lightening human legs. All poems have to have stanzas that are basically paragraphs. An example of Imagery is \\"Lightning danced down on its spindly legs\\" because you can see lightening dancing in your mind when you read these words. These are the three poetry terms I found.I disliked this book greatly. It was boring to me for several reasons. It was historical fiction and generally I like fantasy. I don't like poems because they don't give enough information. I felt the story plot didn't have enough action."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite chapter in \\"Out of the Dust\\" is Autumn 1935. I liked it a lot because it showed bondage between Billie Jo and her dad. Before I read that part I felt bad for Billie Jo because her mom died and her dad didn't talk to her. Now her dad talks to her a lot about many different things. I think Billie Jo feels much closer to her dad now.I think the appropriate ages for this book is 11-15. Those are the ages when you learn about The Great Depression. I think you need to understand The Great Depression to be able to understand some of the things that go on in the book. Younger children could read the book but they might not understand some of the parts in the book.The book had a little bit of all the poetry terms. Some of the poems rhymed, and some didn't. I mostly found alliteration. I think some of the poetry terms in the book really enhance the reader's enjoyment. I know I enjoyed the book more because I could tell what poetry terms was what.Overall, I thought \\"Out of the Dust\\" was a good book. I liked it because it kept my interest in most parts. It also wasn't a slow moving book. One thing after another happened. I recommend this book to anyone intersted in The Great Depression."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a book about a girl named Billy Joe. It is in the dust bowl in 1934.

Let me give you a little summary on what the book was about. Billy Jo, the main character, has a really weird relationship with her mother like most teens do today. The book takes place during the great depression. Billy Jo practically doesn't even speak a word to her father. Billy Jo is an only child but then her mother gets pregnant. While her mom was making coffee her father left a bucket of kerosene right by the stove and guess what happened? Hmm well I'm not going to tell you. Billy named the baby Franklin at that time president Franklin D. Roosevelt was in office. Billy Jo lives in Oklahoma. During the Great Depression in the early 1930s there was a lot of dust bowls occurring. Billy Jo would sometimes get caught in dust storms while she was walking home. The house would sometimes be filled with dust. Just imagine walking into your house with all this dust in it can we say \\"ew\\". Billy Jo plays piano, but ever since she threw that pale of kerosene out the door she hasn't been able to play. How sad :(. Billy Jo wants to run away and get out of the dust, but does she?

She lives in the dust bowl during the Great Depression and wants to get out of the dust bowl. Her mom dies and she lives with her dad. They both miss her very much.

I give this book a one. It deserves a one because it the same thing over and over again. You know waht is going to happen next. Dust storm after dust storm came and it bored me dearly. I feel that the author went on about the same thing and made a mountain out of a molehill about dust storms and stuff like that. The one thing I did like about it was some of the poems were good and interesting. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, but if you wanted to try it I would say it's for teens and young adults.

Real snow.&quot; (Hesse, 90)In the book Out of the Dust my favorite poem is &quot;Real Snow.&quot; This poem is full of great detail and descriptions, it really pulls you into it and makes you feel like you're out there with Billie Jo This poem is well-written and has a lot of meticulous detail in it. I like how it describes the snow and compares it to a lot of different things. I would think that this book is geared toward kids in their early teens. I am 14 and I understood some poems and I found some parts depressing, but others I found joyful and uplifting. The reason that I enjoyed this book was how the author, Karen Hesse wrote the book. She broke it up into poems and then broke them up further and put them into stanzas. It's much more interesting that way, than having it all combined into one story. Here is an example of how Hesse broke up a page into stanzas. Here is an example of her detail and how she really pulls you into the poem:&quot;The women talked as they scrubbed death from our house. I stayed in my room silent on the iron bed, listening to their voices.&quot;That quote was from the poem called, &quot;Blame.&quot; Hesse writes well and puts lots of meticulous details into her poems. The quote that I chose above is a good example of the detail that she puts into her poems. She makes you feel like you are there next to Billie Jo experiencing the depression and violent dust storms. Overall, this was a very compelling, yet sometimes depressing story of a family living in the time of the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;Fifty Miles South of Here&quot;In Amarillo, wind blew plate-grass windows in, tore electric signs down, ripped wheat straight out of the ground.(Hesse,20)This book is mainly about a girl and her strife through life in the Dust Bowl. Her family had a farm, which grew crops and raised farm animals until the dust storms blew in. Now , the farm has no chance of making it because the dust kills the animals and the lack of water kills the crops. Now all they can do is hope for better weather and a chance to make it out alive from the dust storms. Out of the Dust is a book constructed of poems using different poetic devices. Most of the poems do not rhyme, but Hesse makes her own unique form of poetry. For example, she would make her poems and arrange the words all around the page. I am not the type of person that enjoys books that make you feel that the main character is going to give up, and then there is a happy ending. Personally, I believe that happy endings are boring endings and tedious endings are foreseen. I don't know how it received an award.

Billie Jo's story is written through her own eyes, in the form of freestyle poetry.This book is unique in it's own way. It somewhat reminds me of fictional books that are written in diary form, yet this book is still very different than even that.The storyline:There's one thing that Billie Jo really loves in life. It's playing the piano. Feeling the keys underneath her fingers. It seems to take her away from the grimy dirt, the dust in her eyes, and the sand dunes that daily pile up higher.Neighbors give up on their farms. Dear friends move away, in search of a better place to live. A devastating accident takes it's course in Billie Jo's own family. She blames everything on the dust storms.

Alot of people moved to California in the time period, but California got so filled up with people, that there was no more room for anyone else. Alot fo people died from, what they called, Dust Pneumonia. Dust Pneumonia went around until the Dust Bowl was over.Out of the Dust is a book that when you start it, you have to finish it.

A must read for any student 4th to 7th grade!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a very enlightening book. I really felt her pain as she lost her mother to the fire. I really think the author did well on explaining how she felt in different situations. My favorite poem was &quot;The Empty Spaces.&quot; Where it talks about her and her father gradually growing apart. I think this book is a little hard ot understand for younger kids since it is all poems. I think that Billie Jo felt secluded from her life. It was terrible how she was ripped from the family since her mom died. I felt like she wasn't in the family anymore. Her father was like a stranger he didn't talk to her or make her laugh like she used to.

This weather was based around Kansas, Colorado, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Texas. It lasted for a total of eight years and killed thousands of people. What was a prosperous land for wheat was destroyed in days. Many people began heading west, but not everyone. A young girl named Billie Jo and her family decided to remain in Oklahoma and try to survive. In my opinion, I disliked how Karen Hesse used poem form instead of the full column. I rated this book a three because i think thet it could have been better written then what it was."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust was a pretty good book. It was based on a period of time where there was a drought that lasted 8-10 years.Somethings that were good about the book were the metaphors. For example when Miss Freeland said &quot;Our future is blowing away with the dust.&quot; What she meens by that is she thinks that they have no future. One of the weaker points of the book were it wasn't very exciting and it was hard to get into. I would reccomend this book for people around the age of fourteen because it was fairly easy to read and to understand."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked this book. The way the author wrote this book was great. I enjoyed reading it like a poem. If was very educational. I learned alot about the Dust Bowl. I gave it 4 stars because it was very good.

There was dust in all the food and in the drink. They turned over the plates so that the dust wouldn't get on the plates. Overall, I enjoyed the book very much."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is very well writen and easy to read for a younger audince too.

The discriptions givin by Karren Hesse make you feel as though dust is raging around you in a a giant cinder elemental. The plot of the story is also great since it tells the reader of the many harsh times in the dust bowl in the 1930's. My only bad point about the book is that it is written entirely in poetic verse. Not being a big fan of poems myself, I often found it hard to follow the words, and ideas strewn about the pages. I would indeed recomend this book unless you detest poems."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought that Out of the Dust was a very interesting and descriptive book.

I found this book to be interesting and informative, but also kind of entertaining. Out of the Dust takes the reader through the life of a young girl , Billie Jo, growing up in the dust Bowl. Bille Jo's life is good enough, aside from the terrible dust storms ravaging the land and the peoples' health, until a terrible accident turns her life upside down. After the accident, Billie Jo's relationship with her fater is ruined, along with her ability to play her beloved piano. Also, her dreams for the future, like in a quote from the book, are &quot;drying up and blowing away with the dust.&quot; Will BIllie Jo's life ever get back to normal? Will she ever be able to get away from the dust that she despises? Read this book and find out.I enjoyed reading this book, and on a scale from 1 to 10, I would give it an 8. It was very interesting. Before reading this story, I knew nothing of the Dust Bowl Era. When I was finished, I felt like an expert! The one thing i didn't like about Out of the Dust was that it was written in verse. This, to me, was kind of annoying, although it did make the reading more meaningful. With the story being written this way, Billie Jo's feelings were easier to relate with, and, in some parts, I actually felt like I was part of the book.All in all, I think Out of the Dust was a very good, well written, and informative account of life in the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The story starts out with Billie Jo living in a little Panhackle shack with her mom and her dad her mom is pregnant with her little brother. Billie Jo is a 13 year old that has checks like bycicle handles and a hunger for playing fierce piano and a fondness for apples. When an accident happens between Billie Jo and her family her life could be changed forever. Billie Jo's hands changed when they get burned and could totally change her life with her piano."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was absolutely extraordinary. I read it from start to finish totally engrossed in the lifelike situation and plot of this book. So many events in this book were lifelike and a part of our history of the Great Depression. This was the first time I have ever read a free-verse poem though, and it changed my view on books I have never considered reading. Out of the Dust gave me a taste of what it was really like in that period of time. So many events in this book relate somehow to some families today. Sadly this is sometimes the case. With Billie Jo's adventure on the train, she realizes the true meaning of sticking close to family even in the rough times. She forms a closer relationship with her father and realizes the meaning of loving, respecting, and forgiving herself first. I think this book should be recommended for any individual that would like to experience a realistic time in history that was rough and unforgettable. I rate this book as superior."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a relatively good book about the rough times in the dust bowl. It takes place in 1934-1935 in Oklahoma, when great dust storms swept the land. A girl named Billie Jo and her family are stuck in the midst of the dust bowl and have to battle the harsh environment. Some of the events include giant dust storms, floods, drought, and even grasshoppers. The only thing she likes to do with her time is play the piano. This helps her survive the roughness.I thought it was a fine book because of the creative style of writing. It is a first person diary book. This may seem boring, but the way it is written is a treat. This is the first book I've seen that is written with all sorts of margins and formats. For example, one of the passages is about a piano and the sentences are written in the shape of piano keys. It is very much like a series of concrete poems that make up a story. I love the originality that Karen Hesse has and her creativity in writing with this style. Also, I love how she titles each passage and the extreme difference with each passage. There are some that just talk about a tiny bit of rain or snow that fell and then others are two or three pages long and include a whole series of event. That is why Karen Hesse is a very excellent and creative writer.The only thing that I really don't like is the fact that the plot can get boring at times and sometimes there's too much information. Sometimes it seems like the plot is going off track or going nowhere at all. There are useless passages that I don't really care about reading. Also, the basic plot of the entire story really isn't that intriguing. Nothing really catches me and make me want to read more. I've read books that made me mad when I finished the book because I wanted more of it and this really didn't do that for me.However, overall I thought this was a great book and I would recommend it to others just because of its pure uniqueness. I think Karen Hesse is a good writer and did a pretty nice job on this book. It is informative of what it was like in the dust bowl and it is creative, so I think this book is just good."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is actually pretty good. It shows good detail and the plot seems rather okay. It also kept me in suspense. Some parts would sometimes make keep on reading. It makes me kind of feel what it was probably like in the dust storms. Everything all covered in dust and dirt. The main character seems rather interesting and strong. She was able to still play the piano while she had crippled hands. It's actually pretty amazing. Sometimes the book would make me just feel a little uncomfortable. Like the part of where the main character's mother got hurt and the way the author described how she looked after her incident was a little disturbing. Though it would make me feel sorry for the main character Billie Jo and her mother. I feel sorry for the main character because she really wants to get away from the dust storms. The book also makes me feel like I'm Billie Jo. Great details the book gives and that's how good it is, it makes me feel like I'm the character. The story will also cause me to feel happy for Billie Jo. Like when she is reunited with her father after she left. The author also knows how to create a character. She's very life like and the character and I have some things in common, so I kind of like Billie Jo. She's a pretty brave person. The author really knows how to write a story. She tells us what it was like back then in the time of the dust storm. It truly is a great book. Trust me. It can really grab your attention sometimes. It caught my attention, and it will catch yours as well. It will make you have all sorts of feelings. Happiness, sadness you name it. Again it truly is a great book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"What I like about this book is that it is made up by poems. The book is not that long, that you can finish it in a day. To me, it is not that bad and it is a lesson history lesson for students at school. It talks about a family living on a farm and how they got though the Great Depression. It has many sad parts and more disgusting moments. I won't give away the good part but when you do, you would feel like you want to throw-up too. The family is made up of three. One mother, one father, and one daughter. The narrator of Out Of The Dust is the young daughter name Billie Josher father gave her that name. In the beginning, she talks about how she was born and talks about her family. a(the never told her really name),Daddy(that is what Billie Jo calls him),and some of her relatives. The middle part of the book is where it gets interesting. Many things happen here which I don't what to give away. All I can tell you is that Billie Jo's family gets a lot of bad luck. That also includes the strong dust storms in the Dust Bowl in which they live in. For all the people who don't know what the Dust Bowl is, let me tell you. It is the region with the most dangerous dust storms in America during the Great Depression. Maybe I can tell you a little bit. Billie Jo has a terrible accident that changes her and her family's life forever. Later on in the book, Billie Jo finally gets a brother that she and her father always wanted. Then something goes terribly wrong. They had to build a grave so early. They named him Franklin. Their farm isn't doing good and now this. The book starts getting boring after this. More like a book a sensitive girl would read. At the end it everything adds up ok. The end."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I am a student of a school. I thought Out of the Dust was an ok book. The style they wrote the book was a first for me. Some of the poems had a lot of facts about the Depression. I know that because we have learned about it in our history class. I gave it three stars is because I don&#65533;t like reading poems. I didn&#65533;t like the book that much because, I also thought some of the poems were kind of dumb. I think some of the poems were not on topic or didn&#65533;t make since. I thought some of the poems were run on and some were just way to long. I know I &#65533;m not always going to read or write short sentences but when you have to read a poem that&#65533;s dumb and it goes on forever, I get angry.I think the author did good job and spent a lot of time and effort writing this book. I hope she liked how her book turned out and she liked the poems she wrote. If she made or will make sequel I would maybe read it but I know a lot of kids who would. I&#65533;m not really good at writing these so sorry but if you don&#65533;t like it it&#65533;s ok with me. If you do like it that&#65533;s great be free to show anyone you like."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"If I were to personally review the novel out of the dust I would give it four stars. The reason that I would give it four stars is because it was a good book because it was related to history but I think it was bad because there was a lot of inappropriate material. What I mean by inappropriate material was like the part when she explains the doctor cutting off her burned skin. One of the good things about it was that it was like one long book it didn't seem over-whelmigly long. Some of the poems were really good while others were not so great.I love the part about her feeling things through the piano. It was really interesting and I could really relate, especially because by the way she described I fell the same things through my flute! When Hesse talks about all these separate feelings I can feel them flow through me. I think that this book really makes people think and fell a lot luckier that they have what they do. This books detail is amazing. Hesse can paint a picture with words! Again though this isn't always good. I think the accuracy of her setting is pretty cool too. You can feel like your there suffering the dust storms and other bad things of the dust bowl.I like it when Billie Jo describes the sound of the piano. Things like that you would have never noticed! When the dust storms came I got really scared because Karen Hesse was so descriptive! You'd feel like you were there! You'd want to jump and help clog the cracks with them! I would get really frustrated when Billie Jo's mother would seem to not really care about her state tests when she really did! When Billie Jo described her father wanting a boy I felt really bad for her! Even if my parents thought that they would never say that!When you read Out Of the Dust you find out little things like I did. I discovered that actually my life's really good! At least I don't have dust storms like every day knocking around and having to walk home through a dust storm! So if and when you read this book I hope that you find it good or even better than I did. Maybe you'll make a review and give it a five! Hopefully you'll find life even better once you read this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"If I were critiquing this book, Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse, I would give it a four out of a five ranking. I would give it a four because it has a lot of \\"beautiful language\\" in it. This is definitely a page-turner. I always want to keep going. This book is like one long poem. In a free-verse style, it has a ring to it. You can tell, by the way you read the book, that it was written with a country accent.When you read parts of the book where important things, dreadful things, beautiful things, or even confusing things, you get this feeling in side you like you feel sorry for the character, or item in the story. That's a sign that this book is painting a picture in your head, and in your heart.There is so much detail in this book, it makes you want to just keep going, and keep reading. If you read this book, then you like it, and recommend it to one or two of your friends, then the book gets read by a lot more people. If you share knowledge like this, you are sharing the joy of reading fun, yet interesting books.I love the detail in this book. I love how Billie Jo describes the sound of the piano, the ride in the car with Arley Wanderdale and his wife, Vera, the way the wind blows, the dust creeping down her throught and insides, the way the apple trees bloom. All this detail makes you want to read more and more.When the dust storms come, I got this crazy feeling around me and in my stomach, like the dust storms were coming to me, to my area. That's how descriptive Karen Hesse was when she was writing this!Out of the dust has so many crazy, confusing moments, but in the end, it all adds up. If you get frustrated or confused, don't throw the book down and say \\"I don't get it!\\", just keep going because in the end, all the crazy, confusing things will come together.So, I recommend this book to all children and adults between the ages of three and one hundred and twelve years old!

Every night, the wind would blow dust onto the their house. In the morning the house would be covered with dust. Billy's father is always hoping for water. But after many years, there was still no water. Life was hard on Billy. Billy Jo had to tend for her mom and all, because her mom was pregnant. Their wheat couldn't grow because of lack of water. It was hard to sleep on an empty stomach. They do have food, but they needed to store all the food they can. This book is all right. It is not the best book I have ever read. . I especially love Billy Jo. She is very young. I admire her because she have gone through rough times in her life. I mean having to live in the dust bowl like that. Now I have been through many rough times when I was around 2-5 years old. But it was not as bad as Billy Jo.This book is to the point. It doesn't go from one time period to the next without telling what the characters did during that time period.I don't really like the book that much. This is because some of the words are confusing and I don't get some of the sentences. I would have liked it a lot more if it was more catching. I thought Karen Hesse should have ended the sentence in each chapter with something that would make the readers want to read more. I am suggesting this, is because when I first read the book, I didn't really want to move on. But we had to finish the book. In my opinion, the book needed some adjustment.Over all, the book was good."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think that Out of the Dust is one of the most interesting books I've ever read. The words they use are so discriptive, it realy gives you an image in your mind. My favorite character is Billie Joe, she's very brave and is always accused for everything.Out of the Dust is about a girl that was expected to be a boy, at least that's what her father wanted her to be. This girl was named Billie Joe, because her dad realy wanted a boy. Although Billie Joe wasn't what they expected she still did everything on her own. Her dad made her work pretty hard. When Billie was a girl in preschool one of her best friends moved Billie was very upset, but she went on with her life. Her dad makes her do tough jobs, as if she was a boy. Billie Joe loved to play the piano, just like her mother. Her mother was once again pregnant with a baby. My favorite poem was The Accident, once you get up to there you'll see what I mean. It's the most discussing part of the book. Billie had a chane to play the piano in the palace. At first her mother didn't want to but then she gave her permission. When Billie's mother had the baby, she died afterwards, a few weeks later the baby died. After this happened Billie Joe seemed awkward with her father. As if he was a stranger to her. She new it was her father but it felt like it was someone else. This book was thought realy well, if I could talk to the auther face to face, I would tell her how talented she is and how much I loved her book. I would realy recommend this book for people,or kids, that like to realy picture things. It's the number 1 book I've read this year."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think that Out Of The Dust is an awesome book if you are into the great depression. It is a very realistic and intriguing novel. Karen Hesse describes every scene with a huge amount of detail. This book won the 1998 Newberry Medal, and I think it deserves it.This book is about a girl named Billie Jo who lives with her mom and dad in Oklahoma. It is a hard life for Billie Jo and her family. Her dad is a farmer with not very much luck, and it seems it will never rain. Things are going normal until one day when Billie Jo and her pregnant mother get severe burns from an accident. Billie Jo has to live with her hands being badly burned, and her mother is covered with burns while she is weeks away from giving birth. While giving birth her mother dies, it is a boy named Franklin, hours later he dies too. After Billie Jo's mother passed away she and her father barely talk anymore. The meals are quiet and it seems her father is a little crazy. I don't want to give any more of the book away. I think you should read it to find out the rest of this interesting story.This book is an exciting story about the Great Depression, giving readers a taste of what it was really like. It makes you glad that you didn't have to live during the depression. It also tells about the amazing dust storms in the dust bowl. These storms were farmer's nightmares. Everyday the farmers prayed for rain but for a long time they never had any. This book is creative because it is told and written completely in poem format. This makes it fun and easy to read.I really like how the author describes everything that happens. This book is a good one for kids because it draws you in, and it is not too long. But it is still a great story for adults too. After you finish this book you'll realize that back then life was hard and there was tons of work. Now we have time to relax and read great books like this."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem, in Out of the Dust, is \\"Met\\" because in this poem the daughter, Billie Jo, returns home after running away. This is when they learn how to be happy and start to become a family againsince the death of her mother.I think this book is appropriate for people in 4th grade and higher because I tried reading it in 3rd grade and couldn't understand many of the concepts and the vocabulary.I liked how in the poem, \\"The Dream\\", the placement of words on the page is set in a unique way. This is done because unlike the other poems it is happy and set in a dream.Overall, I like this book because it was interesting to learn about what it might have been like to live during the Great Depression."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is \\"Out of the Dust.\\" It starts off with her telling about how she knows that she is going to die if she stays. She decides to go and hitch a ride on a train. She goes west to get out of the dust. I like it because the book is named after it.I think that the book is appropriate for anyone who can read. People who like non-fiction books, or realistic fiction books would enjoy it. I think that older people might like it because they might be able to relate to it.The free-verse form in the book is an essential piece. It lets the author express what she wants to in a poem form. You don't see many books written this way, so that makes it unique. It also makes it easier to read, I think.Overall, I think that I would rate this book two stars. It is good, but personally I didn't like that much. It has lots of historic background, which I think is good to have in a book. If you give this book a chance, you might like it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think this book was amazing! I got all my friends to read it and they enjoyed it to. Karen Hesse is my favorite author."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out Of The Dust is about a girl named Billy Jo. This girl is living in the dust bowl. Her mother dies when giving brith to her brother. Her Aunt was going to take her brother but he died Before she got there."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought the book was excellent. As a historical fiction novel goes the setting and general circumstances of the dust bowl were realistic. Even the horrible accident that happens to Billy Joe's mother was based on real accounts. Strangers are treated with kindness and compassion. Reading Karen Hesse's 1998 Newberry speach, I found that she had reseached several years worth of newspaper accounts from the Boise City News. The main conficts in the book were Nature vs. Character (the land verse the people) and Character vs. Character (Billy Joe vs. Self : dealing with guilt and grief of her mother's death) Billy Joe's battle within herself was the major conflict. This a very realistic confict for any time period, and many people had to deal with loved ones dying during the dust bowl years. Many terrible accidents happened along with suicides.Billy Joe is very dynamic character in the book, and the story is told from her point of view. This is extremely important since through her eyes we witness the pain, sorrow and ultimately the growth of her spirit. She changes a great deal throughout the story. And although the father at first seems like a flat character as the story progresses we see that he too is a dynamic character. Like many men of his time he was in charge of the farm work and earning the money. He didn't display his love for his daughter in an obvious fashion, but as the story unfolds we see his love for her. Two of the strongest themes in the book were forgiveness and dealing with the pain that life will bring. Billy Joe had to learn to forgive herself and her father in order to deal with her mother's death. Like many poems this one had many examples of figurative and symbolic language. What sticks out in my mind however is how the land parrelles Billy Joe's and her father's conlficts. After her mom's death Billy Joe and her father start to withdraw and slowly die on the inside just like the land. They all want the rain to give them relief and just like rain did come during the dust bowl the relief usually didn't last long, and neither does the relief that Billy Joe and her father ocasionally come by. They never give up hope though that the some day the rain will come and the plants will grow again, just like they never give up hope, that they will get their own type of rain and will start growing inside again. What an important and worthwhile them to discuss."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"If I were to rate the book out of the dust from one to ten, one being the worst and ten being the best, I would give it an eight. I chose an eight because I really liked the style of the book and how it was written, in different poetry forms, but I didn't really like the subject of the book. The dust bowl was a very depressing time because so many people had to give up their homes and their land because the crops wouldn't grow. I don't like sad books as much as I like books with happy endings. I do think that this book was written very well though. The story makes sense and everything seems to flow nicely. Over all I enjoyed the book Out of the Dust and I recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think this story was one of the best written novels I have ever read. It was tough to put down the book once u started to read it. It was both interesting and exciting, as well as very informational about the dust bowl.

And to let them move on and look ahead towards, a new and better things that you mostly enjoy,just because of one incident that happened."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In my opinion \\"Out of the Dust\\" was an excellent book. I think this since it uses the facts from the Great Depression and the visual imagery of the Dust Bowl all together. As a student reading from textbooks gets boring. When I was told my assignment to read it I was curious about it. After I read it I realized it taught me a different way of looking at history since it is written in diary format. It had a great plot filled with hope, courage, and bravery. I feel that this book is a wonderful book for anyone to read no matter what their age is.The more I read the book the more catchy the book was. It had an excellent beginning that really pulled me in and made me want to read on. It started out with a 12 year old red-head, named Billie Jo Kelby, living in the Oklahoma Panhandle. Billie Jo and her ma play excellent piano and Billie Jo often plays for Arley Wanderdale (her music teacher) during concerts. At that time there was a great deal of huge dust-storms in the area and so everything was covered in dust. The family of three (ma, pa, and Billie Jo) lived on a farm trying to grow wheat. With the dust storms and the dry weather everywhere it's almost impossible to grow anything.As the family struggles through the hard times a baby is on its way. Pa hopes it's a boy but they won't know till later. Billie Jo witnesses death, fire, loss of her best friend, and the loneliness in her heart someone she loves dies. Billie Jo has to work with the rest of her family to make it through the storms, the drought, and hands that can no longer play piano. Read the book to see how everything turns out!The characters are well developed with their own unique personalities. I enjoyed how realistic the book was since it was based on history. Karen Hesse made the book come alive. She made the characters, the conflicts, the scenery all come alive.\\"Out of the Dust\\" really shows a lot of morals that kids should learn to follow. Some of those are that family is always important even if you can't relate with each other its still the reality that you tried to relate , and tried to care about each other. It also taught the reader that you need to be strong and brave even when times are really dark and don't look like they'll get better. This means that no matter what happens try to work through the bad things and remember the good things that you had and strive to have those again.Overall, I really enjoyed the book a lot since it was real history, lively, and just fun. I recommend this book to anyone that likes history and a fun-filled adventure full of love for each other, courage, bravery, and just a nice book to sit down with. It is also a fun book to read since the chapters are written as poetry. Each chapter is a little part of Billie Jo's life. \\"Out of the Dust\\" is a really good book for young and old readers and I encourage you to read it. If you've already read it read it over again and keep it's morals close to your heart."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is written in free verse poetry and it is a novel about the Dust Bowls during the Great Depression. This book is about a girl called Billie Jo who lives in Kansas during the Great Depression. Her father and mother struggled through financial problems on the farm. Nothing would grow and many people died of starvation, drought and of diseases such as dust pneumonia. Billie Jo's life is tough because of the all the economical and social disasters. Her mom dies of a terrible accident that has to do with kerosene and her brother, Franklin, died right after he was born. It was very surprisingand very depressing for me when I read about this part because I never expected this to happen. Billie Jo hates the dust storms but she loves playing the piano. Her dreams of becoming a professional piano player unfortunately doesn&#65533;t come true. The accident that causes her to give up her dream is caused by kerosene. Billie Jo's dad leaves a pail of kerosene next to the stove. Her mother mistakes it for water and puts it on the stove. Suddenly there is fire and her mother runs outside to get her father. Billie Jo comes into the kitchen, gets the stove and throws it outside. At the same she throws the pail of kerosene outside, her mother comes so her mother gets burned really bad. By the end, Billie Jo and her mother are severely burned. Her mother dies a few days later and Billie Jo is crushed. This book teaches us about the dust bowl and how it impacted the everyday lives of Americans. I truly recommend this book to kids, teenagers and adults. This book also has some suspense in it. You cant stop reading it because you really want to know what is going to happen next. The free verse poetry gives sparity to the text which makes it fairly quick to read. I finished this book in a week and it made me realize how hard it was for Americans during the Depression and how harsh the dust storms were. Karen Hesse uses simple vocabulary so it is easy to understand. Overall this is a great novel and I honestly recommend it to you, your child or if you are a teacher to your class. Never have I read a book that is so fun to read and that still teaches you about American history. I give it four stars not five because even though it teaches about the dust bowls, it still needed to include a few other causes of the Great Depression such as the stock market crash."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Out of the Dust\\" is about a long legged girl named Billie Jo Kelby. Billie Jo lives on a farm with her family and her mother is expecting a baby boy.This story takes place in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma. The Kelby family grows wheat. When the wheat doesn't grow the family had to live with what they had. This family is quite poor and the wheat isn't helping at all. No wheat, no money.In this book, I felt a true connection with the main character. I actually felt like I was on the family farm. This is the greatest historical fiction novel I have ever read. I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 11. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger because of the english that they spoke and it would be tough for them to understand it. On a scale from one to ten, I would give \\"Out of the Dust\\" a ten and a half.Please read this book, the author does a wonderful job defining what things mean. If you love sad endings to books, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem in Out of the Dust is \\"Out of the Dust.\\" It starts off with her telling about how she knows that she is going to die if she stays. She decides to go and hitch a ride on a train. She goes west to get out of the dust. I like it because the book is named after it.I think that the book is appropriate for anyone who can read. People who like non-fiction books, or realistic fiction books would enjoy it. I think that older people might like it because they might be able to relate to it.The free-verse form in the book is an essential piece. It lets the author express what she wants to in a poem form. You don't see many books written this way, so that makes it unique. It also makes it easier to read, I think.Overall, I think that I would rate this book two stars. It is good, but personally I didn't like that much. It has lots of historic background, which I think is good to have in a book. If you give this book a chance, you might like it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This tale of the Dust Bowl, told through a young girl's diary, brings to life the bleak and dusty landscape of Oklahoma during the 1930's. Billie Jo's dreary life is brightened when she plays on her mother's beloved piano until a terrible accident takes her mother's life and leaves scars on Billie Jo's hands and her heart. For those studying the Depression, this story will bring to life the hardships of life in the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This novel is simply stirring. Hesse uses rough verse to make an entire novel and to weave story of Billie Jo, though the young girl's eyes. She makes the tiny pieces of human thought into poetry to an amazing degree.Billie Jo is the only child of her Ma and Pa. Ma is uncomfortable in the Oklahoma Dustbowl, sick of dust everywhere and slowing wasting away until she dies after an accidential fire. Her father is a stubborn farmer who refuses to give up on the land he loves with pain. Billie Jo and her father are so alike; quiet and not sure what to make of the silence after Ma's and little Franklin's (the child she was carrying) death.And Billie Jo, who longs for something she can't have in the Dustbowl, who once lived to play the piano, cannot play without enduring severe pain from her burned hands; another pain stolen from her after the fire.Slowly, she learns the lesson of growing anew in place that has no suitable soil and how starting afresh can be good. A beautiful story and better crafted.Then again, sometimes it was hard to follow Billie Jo. She talks casually and sometimes we don't understand what she is doing. Sometimes the writing is boring, sometimes extremely interesting. You must be captivated by the story to read this book, otherwise I would reccommend you read something less abstract. This book is for people who are able to see art in writing.Happy Reading! -Lia"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In the book, Out of the Dust, it tells about the struggles that a fourteen-year-old goes through in life.

I read this book for school, and thought it was going to be boring since it is like a journal, but once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Like the Oklahoma dust bowl from which she came, 14-year-old narrator Billie Jo writes in sparse, free-floating verse. In this compelling, immediate journal, Billie Jo reveals the harsh domestic realities of living during the years of constant dust storms: That hopes--like the crops--blow away in the night like skittering tumbleweeds. That trucks, tractors, even Billie Jo's beloved piano, can suddenly be buried beneath drifts of dust. Perhaps swallowing all that grit is what gives Billie Jo--our strong, endearing, rough-cut heroine--the stoic courage to face the death of her mother after a hideous accident that also leaves her piano-playing hands in pain and permanently scarred. So go read this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the dust is a wondrous book that takes you into a different time and place. I think of this book as a time machine while the main charecter is your guide, and the author the maker of the time machine. This book was a teacher, a time machine, and a great learning experience all at the same time. This book shows how hard it was to live in the dust bowl at the time of the Great Deppression and how people had to work together to survive. The author of Out of the Dust makes you venture to think about the book, but completly... absorbs you into the pages so that you feel like you are watching history be made. When I read this book I smelt dust, felt dust, and saw dust. Another reason why I enjoyed this book so much is that I have the greatest literature teacher who takes us through the book step by step page by page word by word and explains every hidden and concealed secret hidden in the pages of Out of the Dust. I reccomend this book to anyone who ever has ever wanted to go back in time and explore the story behind the dust."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was great and I think its a book everyone should read.

It tells you all about the troubles that people in the Dust Bowl had to face. The year was 1936 and Billie Jo was a terrific piano player. She did a couple of gigs with Mad Dog until something happened to her and her mom. The part I hated the most was when her aunt blamed her mom's death on Billie Jo. So if you want to know what happens,read it and if you like books that get sad, happy, and funny at times then check it out. If you want to get out like Billie Jo wanted to get OUT OF THE DUST, then just read it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust is great. It was about a girl named Billie Jo who faces alot of problems. Billie Jo is enerjetic and loves to play the piano and eat apples.

That book was great! I liked a lot about this book. One thing that made me cry is when Ma got burned, and when Ma and Baby Franklin died. I feel proud and sorry for Billie Jo. I felt proud of Billie Jo when she played the piano at Palace Theatre. I felt sorry for her when Livie Killian moved away and when Ma and Franklin died. The characters I liked were: Mad Dog Craddock, Billie Jo, Ma, Daddy, Miss Freeland and Arley Wanderdale. I think Mad Dog liked Billie Jo is because she had a good talent playing the piano as it says in the chapter &quot;Me and Mad Dog.&quot; I also felt sorry for Billie Jo when she couldn't play the piano anymore because her hands were in a lot of pain."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Wow!!! I must say, I was completely BLOWN AWAY by Hesse's Newbery winning novel. It surely deserved the honor. At first glance, I thought the book would be boring and tiring to read, seeing as the whole story was written in free verse poetry. Was I EVER wrong!!! The unusual style made the book all the better. I found myself near crying throughout most of the book. The story was about Billie Jo, a girl right in the center of the Dust Bowl. Her awful misfortunes grip you and make this novel a can't-put-it-down kind of book. I was especially moved when...oh, wait, I can't tell you. You'll just have to read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I found the novel, Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse, very interesting and unique. Never before have I read and entire fictitious story, based upon a young girl's life, written in free verse poems. Out of the Dust is well written and its superb description invites the reader to make themselves comfortable (or rather uncomfortable) in the setting itself, the Oklahoma Dust Bowl. Out of the Dust's main character is Billie Jo Kelby. Billie Jo is forced to overcome many unbelievable obstacles living in the harsh, bleak landscape of Oklahoma, during the Dust Bowl. After her mother's life is taken in a terrible accident, Billie is shoved into an irreplaceable position, she is forced to take on the routines and jobs of her deceased mother. Out of the Dust describes how Billie Jo copes with the daily events of her life and how she attempts to better herself. Eventually she accepts that she is her own special person, and that this dust covered place that everyone calls home is where she does and will forever belong. My favorite passage of this fantastic novel is as follows: &quot;She wears a comical hat, with flowers, in December, and when she smiles, her face is full enough of springtime, it makes her hat seem just right. She brings apples in a sack, perfect apples she arranges in a bowl on the shelf, opposite the book of poetry. Sometimes, while I'm at the piano, I catch her reflection in the mirror, standing in the kitchen, soft-eyed, while Daddy finishes chores, and I stretch my fingers over the keys, and I play.&quot; I really like this poem in particular because of how Billie Jo is capable of accepting Louise as her new mother and also how Louise respects Billie's unconditional love for her true mother. Yet she still cares for Billie and she does simple, special actions, that Billie Jo misses, like arranging the perfect apples in the bowl on the shelf. Last, I admire how Billie Jo Kelby is able to overcome an emotional and frightening obstacle, to once again stroke the ivory, dust covered keys of her mother's piano. I give this story five stars. Out of the Dust is well written, has fantastic description, and is a roller coaster fo events. I recommend this book to anyone who loves Karen Hesse's rip-roaring story lines. Out of the Dust is easy to read and has a quick pace, like the whirlwinds of dust and tumbleweeds described in the story. It's intense and contains many valuable morals for life. Read this story and you won't regret it...I know I don't!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book is written in nice,figurative language, but it is far too sad. The book starts out like not such a bad story, but then suddenly it hits this spot with terrible sadness and frustration. Yet, it gives far too many details of how terribly some of the people in the story die. Basically what happens in this story in the sad part is when 2 people accidentally make dangerous, careless mistakes, which lead to the killing of 2 other people. When I got to that part, I felt like not reading this book anymore. I can't believe this book received about ten awards."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book has a lot of poems about the main character, Billie Jo's childhood. She has many sad stories that make me feel upset; also she has some happy stories too. Her poems are really good. I can imagine the area that she wrote about and feel the way she feels. Finally she was happy, which makes me really glad. I really love this book. I sympathize with the experience of her mother and brother dying, her friends leaving, and her hand being burned. These poems really describe Billie Jo from her outside to her inside. Her life wasn't happy most of the time, because she couldn't even play piano or forget the pain in her hands and heart. Her stories to the world make me feel very touched; when she is happy I can feel it, when she sad I share that with her. The last part is my favorite because they are finally out of the dust and they have their family back together. She described it perfectly; I can see the picture of the story. While reading the book, I looked up information on the internet and watched a movie (The Grapes Of Wrath) to learn more about the time period and understand more."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought that this book out of 10 was a 10.It was a great book and I just hope that after reading this book review that you will want to read it, too.I hope that everyone will read this book(if they like my book review about it).Well this book was my favorite book that I've read so far and i hope that you will love it, too."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out Of The Dust (Apple Signature Edition)is the 2-year diary of an adolescent Oklahoma girl, Billie Jo. Each 1-2 page entry is a prose poem that relates the dust-bowl setting to the lives of Billie Jo, her family, and community.Karen Hesse's free-verse prose is serviceable, reminiscent of Masters'Spoon River Anthology (Signet Classics). It serves simply to control the flow, tempo, and idiom of the narration.Through most of the book, I feared that the story would seep away into despair and inevitability. Instead, at the end I recognized the toughened and tangled strands of Billie Jo's life rising from the dust in a perfect metaphor of the prairie sod.For a completely different, but equally wonderful treatment of this metaphor I recommendPrairyErth (A Deep Map): An Epic History of the Tallgrass Prairie Country."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think Out of the dust is a good book because its full of sad moments and happy moments. Also it shows how tough it would really be to loose your mom, and how you should charish the talent you have and all the good things in life. This is because she has a gift of being able to play the piano and she is asked to play at many places. But once her hands get burnt she sort of gives up on the piano for a while. Then she takes the time while her hands heal to start to play again. Also it is just a really good book and I like how the whole book is made of poetry. There is nothing that I do not like about the book, except her mother and brother dying, but that is what makes the book good, is all of the sad and good parts. Also the suprises. Overall this is an amazing book"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was good in ways and bad in ways. It was good because I understood it and I read it fast. It was also realistic where you can see yourself in her shoes. It was easy to imagine the things she has been through because it was life like(I know it was a true story). It was great to read I followed it all the way through and did not get lost once. The only bad part about it was that it was sad at some points and in my opinion it was kind of boring. To me it felt like a biography of her. But really other than that I loved it. I also like that it was told from a kid when books are told from a kids point of view we see what they see and it is easier to relate and compare yourself to them."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is inspirering to me and it can be to many. It teaches you to never give up on your dreams. The young Billie Joe love piano and dispite her troubles she still finds a way to play. I would recommend this book to people of all age's. Read it I did. =]"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is unusual in that it is told entirely through poetry. Billie Jo is a fourteen-year-old with a lot weighing on her mind. First there's the fact that her father wanted a son but got her instead. Second is that she and her parents are living in Oklahoma during the Great Depression and, more important for Billie Jo, the dust bowl crisis. No rain is falling in Oklahoma, which means that no crops are growing. Farmers like Billie Jo's father are growing poorer and poorer while horrible dust storms sweep through their farms and destroy everything in their paths. Billie Jo's one escape and pleasure is playing the piano, and it seems that she might even be able to help her family out earning money by doing it.Then horrible events leave Billie Jo without a mother and without the use of her hands. She and her father must learn to live together, support each other, and survive this new tragedy on top of the old troubles.This book was a really quick read because of the format. I liked being able to get into Billie Jo's thoughts and to see how she was feeling about her situation. This was a terrible time in United States history, and this book showed how regular people were affected by the dust bowl disaster. The story was very sad, of course, but I think that's the way life was."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book!It was intersting and educational,a good mixture.I liked the free verse poems, and the words she used made you feel like you were really there!I could actually taste the dust in my mouth, and the wind hitting against my face!The only thing I would have changed about it was that, it kind of left you hanging at the end.What ever did happen to Mad dog, did her father ever get married again?Other than that it was a great book, and I recomend it!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In my opinion, this is an excellent book. It is very informational yet it keeps the reader interested. After reading this book, if you study the Dust Bowl and hear real interviews from real victims, you find that the book is so precise. There was no exageration, if anything it was lax on the trouble they went through. I think that every kid or teen old enough to understand this story should read it. It made me appreciate what I had even more. Just to think \\"she was my age\\" makes you sad. They went through so much and it played a big part in history. This book deserved the Newberry Medal!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked the book for most part. Some parts got boring, but other parts I was crying or just plain really interested in the book!!! I think Karen Hesse did a really good job at trying to make it feel like you were there when you closed your eyes!!! It seemed really real to me!!! i think that there were some things she could have added to make some of the parts more interesting, but that was her choice to make the book that way!!! you do need some down time on all of the suspense, and drama!!!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This poem is brought to life by well-developed characters and descriptive imagery.

While Billy Jo lives in the Dust Bowl, she goes on many adventures. The book takes place in Oklahoma, where she lives with her mother and father. Billy Jo, who enjoys playing the piano and loves to eat apples, goes on an unforgettable journey. Written in forms of poetry, this book will move you, make you cry, and smile. With her amazing choice of words, Karen Hesse describes Billy Jo's sad, life-changing, and emotion-tapping journey. You must read this book.This book has many ups and downs. If I had to say the best parts, I wouldn't know were to begin. The book, well written and satisfying, tells the sad story of how a young girl lives in the Dust Bowl. Also the book is called OUT of the Dust, so I will say that yes, the book has a happier ending than you may think. The author wrote the book in a series of poems, which I found very interesting. The author, Karen Hesse, has a way of describing everything so clearly and vividly, like painting a picture in your mind.The book is so sad, but it was so well written that I couldn't put it down. It made me cry but I kept reading, that's how much I loved it. It's like kids with candy, it makes them sick, but it tastes so good that they still want it.A good age to read this is in between 9 and 10. There are some things that kids may need a little background on such as the Dust Bowl and The Great Depression.\\"Out of the Dust\\" did win many awards. The biggest accomplishment was in 1998 when it won the Newberry Medal. Other achievements include: The Scott O'Dell Award, The ALA Notable Children's Book, The School Library Journal Best Book of the Year\\" and much more.Overall the book is very good, well told, and interesting. It did have some sad parts and some happier parts, but in general it was an amazing novel. Get it now you wont regret it!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was in 4th grade.

The beautiful poems give Billie Jo Kelby a unique and believable voice that has a free, unconfined feeling. Her moods are defined by the layout of the poems which say so much in so few words. The plot is absorbing and believable, portraying themes well. Billie Jo is easy to relate to as she struggles to step away from unhappiness and accept her life. Going through a tough situation yourself? Billie Jo Kelby will help you find courage. There isn't much more I can say.

The genre of OUT OF THE DUST is realistic fiction, made to sound very real by Karen Hesse. Billy Jo her mother and her father all live in a small shack on a farm. Because of the dust the crops were not growing well, they had also not had a heavy rain in over a year. Billy Jo loved the piano and she always played it but after a terrible accident that left her hands and her mother totally burned up and sore she thought that she could never play again.I think that this is a good book for young adults because they might be able to connect in some ways. I personally loved the book and had a really hard time putting it down. I think the reason I liked it so much was that it was something that could really happen. I also liked this book a lot because she made you feel like you were right there watching the story. The Plot of the book was announced really well and the characters descriptions were made very clear and easy to understand.The plot of this book is very good. Because they start out by telling us were the book takes place and who the characters in the story are. They made the book very understandable and readable. The story was telling us about what a 14-year old Girls named Billy JO's life in the years of a drought in Oklahoma. She was saying her parents did not really want her because they wanted a son. While towards the middle of the book the mother of Billy Jo gets pregnant and is going to have a baby boy. But then an accident burns her whole body while she is pregnant.The characters in the book are very descriptive. The main character in the book Billy Jo is described as a tall not so pretty girl with dirty blonde hair. Very dirty skin from the water she bathes in. The mother is tall skinny and when she is pregnant she is described as a normal women only weighing in at 110lbs. The father has some muscles but not many mostly he is skin and bones with also very dirty skin. The other people in the book don't really have descriptions except for one boy not giving a name, he is decried as a short boy with freckles and blonde hair they say he has blue eyes and kind of a pudgy face.This book is about A girl in Oklahoma that is having a hard time living. The people that live there are desperately wanting rain that they have not had for over three years. It is so hard to live because the farms will not grow and the food and water is saturated in dust.I think I personally connected with this book when Billy JO's mother passed away because just last year my father passed away. In addition, when her father got a girlfriend and how she did not like her at first, I was not comfortable with my stepfather at first either. Therefore, I kind of know what Billy JO fells like.I would recommend this book to any young adult or adult that like reading realistic fiction. If you would like to know how the dust ends up and how Billy JO's mom goes read this book and be surprised."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This an outstanding novel about a girl and her father that have to live with each other during the dangurous dust storms.. They keping each other after a sad lost in their family. This novel is mainly from Billy Jo's side of the view, starring Billy Jo as an eleven year old girl who has to make money for her and pa.Although there are many other characters in some of the chapters, Billy Jo decribes them as if they were describing themselves. For instance, Mad Dg is Billy Jo's only friend, he is always tring to help Billy and her pa to get money. She hated how he made her go into compentitions to win money, but she still loved him.Billy Jo discovers that she can't always think about that past, and focous on the future. Also She can no longer have some one else always taking care of her, so she learns to take care of herself.Billy Jo is one of the best, most outstanding character I have ever read about.I would recommend this book to any girl ages 8-12 and love historical fiction because they will love just like me. I think it should be a classic."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Before beginning this review, I read or skimmed through many of the kid reviews. The range of expressing themselves and skill of writing was amazing to this retired teacher.I can say nothing new about the story itself, just that since I call myself a poet, I admired the format of the novel. From an adult standpoint, it IS a fast read--a little over an hour--and it DOES contain lots of emotions (customarily a good thing) and yes, child, it DOES have a climax and a satisfying--both to the main character and to (at least) this reader--denouement, with a new character that none of the children's reviews mention. I will pass this book--I do not know where or when I came to own it--on to all my friends."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I have to say that this is one of the most emotionally powerful \\"children's books\\" I have ever read; more about that later. This work is a novel written completely in free verse which tells the story of a young girl, Billie Jo, growing up in the dust bowel in Oklahoma during 1934 and 1935. The story opens:\\"As summer wheat came ripe,so did I,born at home, on the kitchen floor.Ma crouched,barefoot, bare bottomedover the swept boards,because that's where Daddy said it'd be best.I came too fast for the doctor,bawling as soon as Daddy wiped his hand aroundinside my mouth.I hollered myself red the day I was born.Red's the color I've stayed ever since.\\"Billie Jo grew up in very hard times; dirt poor, farming a farm that would not produce; the elements, the times the place where overwhelming harsh. Billie Jo had her dad, her mom and her piano and that was about it. At an early age her mother is killed in a horrifying fire and Billie Jo is maimed. Things were bad, bad, bad.The author's use of the free verse form is extremely effective in delivering this tale. As far as that form of verse goes, it is almost perfectly written; catching the ebb and flow of life in a harsh, matter of fact sort of way. There are no illusions here, no beating around the bush; cold hard facts as seen through the eyes of a very young girl.I defy the reader to get through this work with a dry eye. Yet and all, there is hope; always hope. Despite her mother's death, a father with \\"problems\\" a world turned up-side-down; a grim world, Billie Jo survives and in her own way, flourishes.This work was the recipient of the 1998 Newbery Award and a large group of other awards; rightfully so! It is a powerful piece of work. I do take umbrage though and very much disagree with the fact that this work is classified as a children's or YA book. The age group targeted is between 9 and 12. Take a close look at the reviews just on this page alone of those that more or less trashed the book and take a look at the age group that did the trashing.Now I know all children are different and I know that we have plenty of very bright and very sensitive young folks among us this very day. But that being said, this book addresses issues and requires knowledge of our history that few of our younger folks have today; an understanding of writing/poetry and the general human condition as it existed then and exists now. They, for the most part, simply do not have enough life experiences under their belts to fully appreciate what the author is trying to do here. If you do not believe me, go read some of the one and two star reviews and read the comments closely...they will make my point for me.No, this is as much an adult read as anything I have read for some time now. It is a good read. I first became acquainted with it shortly after it was first published; was stunned when I read it then, and I am still stunned with each reading even to this day.Read this one; it will haunt you.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Written as a collection of free-verse poems by a teenaged girl in the Oklahoma panhandle during the Depression, Out of the Dust is a masterpiece of historical fiction. It definitely deserves the Newbery Medal that it won in 1998. The teenaged emotions are pure, and believable. The imagery was so vivid that I formed a new understanding of the Dust Bowl. I admit, I was a little skeptical about the free-verse, and only picked up the book late at night with the intention of tasting the first few pages. I read it in one sitting.Although I am artistic enough now to feel the gritty emotion and visualize the imagery which would have been impossible to communicate in mere prose, I am certain I would not have appreciated it as a child. I also abhorred depressing books when I was younger. Fifteen years later, I still shudder at memories of reading The Red Pony, The Call of the Wild, and Where the Red Fern Grows when I was a young teen. This book would have been no different. I am also concerned that many youths would not understand the historical context of the Dust Bowl Depression era. As such, I think this book would be a fantastic supplement to an American History class. Reading such a book will help students visualize the tragic past instead of merely recounting the facts."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though \\"Out of the Dust\\" is marketed at a YA selection, it is no more a children's book than \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\" or \\"To Kill a Mockingbird.\\" With a series of perfectly rhythmed prose poems that capture the sensations of the 1930s dust bowl, \\"Out of the Dust\\" tells the story of a young girl in Oklahoma who must overcome her own guilt when her mother is killed in a house fire. This is one of the most vivid, painful and, in the end, joyous stories I have ever had the great fortune to find."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Daddy named me Billie-Jo.\\"He wanted a boy but insteadhe got a long legged girlwith a wide mouthand cheek bones like bicycle handles.He got a read headed, freckle-faced, narrow-hipped girlwith a fondness for applesand a hunger for playing fierce piano.\\"Billie-Jo is a girl growing up in a small country farming town in Oklahoma during the tragic 1935 dust bowl with her mother and father. In the bleak and dusty landscape of her home, dust storms are frequent and and disastrous. Along with the dust is the drought. The combination of the two is makes them lose the one thing that lets them survive in such a the Oklahoma panhandle: growing wheat. Struggling though with the meager government money, Billie-Jo has to be determined and hard-working. The only thing that brightens her life is her talent for playing piano until a terrible accident turns her life upside-down. She then has to find peace in herself, her father, and in Oaklahoma.Written as a series of poems, this writing style perfectly captures the story. When I started Out of the Dust, I was critical at the poem form but as I read on, I really enjoyed it. This is one of the best books I have ever read. I recommend it for middle schoolers and up.

It's like a social studies book. I've tried to get through this book for I don't know how long but I still haven't finished it. I've read enough to know I don't like it and I would only recomend it to people who like the Laura Ingles Wilder books. It's very old fashioned and well, boring. The plot doesn't have a climax, a begging, or even really an end. It drags on way too long.If you wanna read a GOOD book by Karen Heese, then read \\"Music of the Dolphins\\". That is one of my absolute favorite books. That's why I can't believe she wrote \\"Out of the Dust\\". It is way different than Music of the Dolphins, and it didn't take place 100 years ago. Don't judge Music of the Dolphins from reading Out of the Dust, trust me. You wouldn't know they were by the same author if her name wasn't on the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book ends on a hopeful note. The verse is stark, unadorned, and beautiful in its simplicity. As a piece of historic fiction, it encapsulates powerfully the loss and devastation of the great depression. The strength of the main character and the eventual healing of her family is a great story. Highly recommended, but you will cry reading this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I want to teach this book so that I know that people are reading it. I've avoided Out of the Dust for awhile, mostly because of the boring cover (I'm that girl) and that it won the Newbery Medal in 1998 and I don't usually love Newbery winners (I'm that girl, too.) When I started researching novels in verse, Karen Hesse's classic kept coming up. I tried it out and am so glad I did. Out of the Dust sticks with you.Billie Jo Kelby and her family live in Oklahoma during the dust bowl years of the Great Depression. People are starving, farms are folding, and many are fleeing west to escape the poverty of the Dust Bowl. After three years without a strong crop, the Kelby's economic situation continues to deteriorate. When a horrific tragedy strikes (I gasped. Anyone who has read this book knows the scene I am talking about.), they are emotionally and physically destroyed.Grit is the word that comes to mind. Billie Jo has the grit to continue on after her world has been shattered. Her bravery and resilience are moving; I wanted to scoop her up and comfort her. Grit also has a literal meaning in the novel, with dust infiltrating every aspect of their lives. I never thought about having to keep glasses and dishes turned over while setting the table, nor what it was like for students to take a test in a dust storm. Hesse's imagery works the dust into the reader's mind until they, like Billie Jo, just want to escape to a cleaner, happier place.Out of the Dust is impossibly sad, which is why the free verse format works so well. The reader is able to move through the book at a quick enough pace that the events aren't too depressing. Plus, the spare writing is a perfect fit for the setting, flowery prose just wouldn't work on an Oklahoma farm where there are never enough hours in a day.Billie Jo's story will remain with me and has given my understanding of the Great Depression a new, more personal, dimension."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is a story written in prose poetry. For those of you who yawn at poetry, don't expect to do so with this book. It IS interesting, in fact it held the attention of my 6th graders during and reviewing a poetry unit. Understandable diction and creative, flowing structure. A good read for anyone who wants to flirt with the creative writer they've locked away in their inner cavern."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The first time I read this book was in fourth grade, and it has been a favorite ever since. Like previously stated, it is not the most uplifting of stories, but you can't expect everything to be pleasant and delightful all the time. I honestly would reccommend this to someone of any age to read atleast once."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of Dust is a book every young reader in American needs to read. Written in poetry form, Karen Hesse's book reveals the year long evolution of fourteen year old Billie Jo. Set in Oklahoma's Dust Bowl during the Great Depression, the story exposes the raw emotions of a young girl as she struggles to survive the most haunting experience of her life. This story will help experienced young readers, ages 11-13, understand the complexity of life for children their own age during a historical era of our Nation's history. Whereas most recollections of the Great Depression are depicted through adult views, Out of Dust is told through the eyes of Billie Jo which will allow children to make a connection between the issues of the time and the ones they are dealing with today. This beautifully written book is an excellent introduction to the Great Depression and offers multiple opportunities for exploration of the era."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read this book for a child lit class. Normally I am not a fan of historical American fiction, especially if it has to do with the west. This book was different. It made no mention of Native American mythology, cowboys or other common themes in books related to this genre. The characters and situations are not far fetched and any adult or child reading this can easily relate to the main characters. I think teachers should be make this required reading, rather than teaching John Steinbeck who often alienates teen readers."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This novel is about a young girl going through many struggles. First her dad left kerosense in the kitchen and then her mom and helself get burned. SHe loved to play the piano but now since the accident her hands are burnt.

I give it three stars."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is inspirering to me and it can be to many. It teaches you to never give up on your dreams.

Read it I did. =]"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is very bland. It is exactly what i expected to be, very dull and boring. Being that there is no climax, i don't find any point to the book. The only amazing thing about it is that, she can write a book in all poems and make it blend together like a real story. Although the story goes by fast, it seems like the days it takes place in are slow. I wouldn't recommend this book, if your looking for a fun thrilling story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This was a very good book, and the author did a great job in writing it. While reading the book, I could really feel the emotions being expressed. A lot of times it had me close to tears. It really makes you think about how lucky you are to not live in a place or time like that, and that you shouldn't feel sorry for yourself when little things happen, because there have been other people that have had to suffer a lot more, and that have been through a lot of tough times. Overall, I think this book was really amazing and I would definitely recommend it to someone looking for a good story to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Have you ever read a book that was depressing?

From the beginning of the book I was drawn into the story. The style of the writing is what drew me in (almost like a collection of poetry).

From the beginning of the book I was drawn into the story. The style of the writing is what drew me in (almost like a collection of poetry). To take journey into Billie Jo's life and witness her &quot;real life&quot; experiences is what makes this book so excellent. Her life events could happen to anyone. This book is so good that I plan on using it as a read aloud/literature study book with my fourth grade students during the spring semester."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book, Out of the Dust, was amazing. It was creative, imaginative and focused on so many aspects. The story of Billie Jo was well written and interesting. While reading it, you feel as if you are being pulled into this life of this fourteen year old girl. It's astounding how this author, Karen Hesse, could take a true factor in American history and weave it all together to form a character with real feelings and hardships. This book was also written very creatively. The way that the author wrote the story in the form of poems was not only different, but it made me think if Billie Jo had been colloecting those poems in a little journal, or if that was simply the was that Karen Hesse decided to write it. I would recomend this book of determination, emotion and truth to any age group. Out of the Dust was truly a terrific story."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is different from all the others. It is a story in a poem. The whole book is a poem. It is about a girl named Billie Jo and she lives on a farm with her Ma and Pa in Oklahoma in 1934. There have beena lot of dust storms and very little to no rain; so Billie Jo and her family don't have very much money and don't get many proper meals. Billie Jo loves to play the piano in concerts to earn money for her hungry family. Then there is an accident that puts Billie Jo's hand and her mother on the line;she can't play piano anymore. Read this book to see what will happen and if Billie Jo and her family can get out of the dust!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This is perhaps one of the most heartwrenching books I have read, conveyed especially well by the free verse. The ending is excellent, as Hesse manages to craft ways in which Billie Jo is able to move on and reconstruct her life and relationships.But I can't even look at the cover without getting teary! The part about the family that appeared in the classroom, Billie Jo getting her little brother's clothes for their baby, and then the way she wanted to chase after them when they left!I've found that most of the Newberry award winners tend to be very sad or troubling. My mother wanted to buy this book for my nine-year-old cousin, based on the fact that it had won the medal. I advised her to wait a few years. At 28, I had a hard time with the subject matter."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I loved it! It was sad, happy and a wonderfully written, so check it out, K?

It is about a girl named Billy Joe who overcomes a lot of obstacles like living in the Dust Bowl in the late 1920's. After a Freakish accident, left Billie Joe motherless, her baby brother dead, and not being able to play her beloved piano things went down hill.I would only recomend this book to a person who likes boring books that have no point. This book went on and on. It never went strait to the point. I don't like slow books and this book was very slow. It was quite sad and not very exciting."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I did not like this book because it was in poems and it dragged on and on. It was to easy like 8-10.

She got on a train and then her food got stolen then she got off. It was a SLOW book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read Out of the Dust. Personally I didn't like it. I thought it was boring and was uneventful. I rated the book with two stars. I would not recommend this book to anyone. It was just about the girl and her life in a dust storm. It was written in poems and I thought it was very very boring. It was a girl who's mother died after the girl burned her accidentally. She also burns her hands and isn't able to play piano anymore. She decides to run away but then comes back. The book seemed to drag on and on and on. It was slow paced and it made me want to fall asleep. Everyone I talked to hated the book such as my friends and classmates. If anybody asked me a book they should not read I would say Out of the Dust. It was awful to have to read this book. I will never read this book again. I don't recommend it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"this book was a boring book. the cover was even boring. it is all about a family that started with 3 people but ended up with 2 because billiejo's mother had a baby but died right after and the baby died too. ths book is sad and all but it keeps on repeating the same thing over and over again. i have never read a book that is all poems that tell a story that reapeats everything at least twice. there is not much to say about this book because it wasn't all that exciting. all i can say is that i wouldn't tell one of my friends about this boring book. But im not the one that is stoping you from reading this book because everyone has a different opinion about everything so you could maybe try it if you like and see what you think of it and maybe you can write a review of your own."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out Of The Dust, By Karen Hesse Do you enjoy books that can help you on your history? Well, if you do, I know it&#65533;s just the book because it&#65533;s full of things that probably could help you. The book is a very sad book with lots of lessons about life. I thought that the book was okay because I could see the simplicity in which I could read it. I liked the way the story was written for the reason that blank poetry is really easy to understand and can be read quickly. I think that the book could have been better in the method of it being longer. Other ways that the book could be improved would be if the book had included a little more excitement. Overall I thought that the book was a very good one.My favorite poem was the poem &#65533;Devoured&#65533;, {Hesse, 68,69}. This poem captivated my attention simply because I&#65533;m really a sensitive person and the poem was poignant. I could almost see myself in this situation because of the seriousness of the poem. I think that this book is for all ages 12 through adult. I perceive this for the reasons that it is an emotional story that people these ages would enjoy. These are the reasons that I enjoyed this book and believe other people will."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Bryce LoganPeriod 31/9/01Out of the Dust is a novel about a country girl and her family in the Dust Bowl. Billie-Joe (the girl) has a normal life for what it seems, but she doesn't know that in the near future, things are about to get worse. After she accidentally pours flaming kerosene on her mother, things just seems to rapidly go downhill. Her father goes out, and drinks up all the emergency money, her mother dies giving birth to the baby she was pregnant with, and just a few hours after he was born, the baby dies. Her father stops talking to her, and barely notices that she is there. Billie-Joe decides to run away, but on the train she catches, she meets a man. Can this man help her change her decision to run away? Read the enticing novel Out of the Dust to find out.The novel was an interesting novel to read, but it was very lengthy. The poem lengths are mostly short, but here and there is a longer one. In each poem there is an event that is happening, and each one is different to the other. Without the conflicts happening, I don't think that the book would be very appealing to readers.\\" My father just sits ther, across from me at the table. He doesn't speak, or look. He keeps his eyes down, and tries not to look at my hands. This book was very enjoyable to read, and I hope that every young reader has a chance to read it also."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse's novel Out of the Dust is a story of a girl living through the Great Depression in the Dust Bowl. She suffers from loss, burns and dust. Her life is controlled by dust. She has many problems in her life, including a silent father. The author uses many similies in this book, but not enough descriptions of the characters or setting.The reason that I only gave this book three stars was the way that it was written. It is written in blank verse, which is very confusing and hard to read. It seemed like the author was trying to be different to impress her publisher or the readers, but it really is hard to read. Not that the words are difficult. In fact, it's very simple language, but because of the way that it was written, you can't tell how the author wanted you to read it. For example,\\"While the dust blewDown our road,Across our fields,Up in CanadaA lady named Elzire DionneGave birth to five baby girlsAll at once.\\" (Hesse, 57) You can tell that there is no upper-level vocabulary in this book. However, this book deals with loss, death, adversity and the power of forgiving. These themes are not meant for little kids, so I would recommend it for twelve-year-olds and up.I did not enjoy this book. It was boring at the beginning and did not make me want to read on. The language did not challenge me, and I felt like I was reading something that a second grader wrote (except for the fact that it was about death and the Great Depression). I did not enjoy this book and I felt like I was forced to read it. If you like poetry that has no rhyme or reason to it, then I would recommend this book to you. Although I warn you, you may get bored and not read the end."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book, Out of the Dust, is a very emotional book with many, many types of feelings. The book is a poem type diary, of a girl in the early 1930's, Billie Jo, who struggles through life. Billie Jo has a great talent in playing \\"fierce\\" piano, and has a nice flowing life until all of a sudden, everything crashes down upon her. Billie Jo, a girl who lives in a shack in the Panhandle, experiences life without rain and happiness.. and most of all without her mother. Billie Jo, in the beginning of the story, loses her mother in \\"the accident\\". She blames her father as the dust storm gets worse around the area. Her love towards her only other family member--her father, obscures into the dust storm.\\"I don't know my father anymore. He sits across from me, he looks like my father, he chews his food like my father, he brushes his dusty hair back like my father, but he is a stranger. I am awkward with I'm, and irritated, and I want to be alone but I am terrified of being alone. we are both changing, we are shifting to fill in the empty spaces left my Ma. I keep my raw and stinging hands behind my back when he comes near because he stares when he sees them.\\" (Hesse, 76)Billie Jo, throughout the story, learns to love, forgive and deal with adversity. Even though she lives with the dust, and sleeps with the dust, she tears her way through the storm and the terrible period of her life. She was much stronger in feelings and forgiveness at the end than she was in the beginning of the story. She did run away, leaving the dust,... out of the dust, and left her father in the dust. But with her heart and courage, she headed for home, and pounced into her father's arms at the train station.\\"As we walk together, side by side, in the swell of dust, I am forgiving him, step by step, for the pail of kerosene. As we walk together, side by side, in the sole-deep dust, I am forgiving myself, for all the rest.\\" (Hesse, 206)When I first started reading this book, to tell you the truth, I hated it. It was terrible. I read till page 55 or so, and I still didn't understand the point of the story. It wasn't clear to me, what the story was about. I didn't even understand where or how this \\"girl\\" was living. But when I said, \\"Ok, I'm going to read it over,\\" I understood it all. In fact, I couldn't put the book down until I was done. It became one of my favorite books, instead of one of my least favorite. It is a great book, and trust me, you'll end up using at least a couple of tissues. You'll have a tingling feeling that will reach inside you and pull you into her world. And when reading it, read it when you have time, don't rush, and feel each word in the poem, and understand her feelings. Read it with an open heart and feeling towards her. This was a heart-shocking and warming book, I've never read anything like it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I didn't like Out of the Dust very much because it's mainly about people suffering; like when the mother got badly burned or when the father got skin cancer. Since the book takes place in The Dust Bowl, the setting is very dry and dusty, so the book makes me thirsty when I read it.Out of the Dust is written in a very strange way that I have never seen before; it is composed of many poems that tell the story, which makes it easy to read.Out of the Dust is about a teenage girl, Billy Jo, who lives in the Oklahoma panhandle in the Dust Bowl. She burns herself and her mother in a freak accident. The mother died along with Billy Jo's unborn baby brother. Billy Jo, unable to play the piano anymore because of her wounds, becomes very miserable.Want to know more?

My preferred chapter in the book is titled \\"The Accident\\" which is where Billie Jo's mother becomes burned. It's my favorite because it's where the plot takes a turn for the worst. I believe the book is suitable for kids age ten through thirteen because there are certain places in the book that anyone under ten years of age can't handle. I liked the way Karen Hesse used similes to describe Billie Jo's Great-uncle Floyd.And Ma, with only Great-uncle Floyd,old as ancient Indian bones,and as mean as a rattler, rotting away in that room down in Dallas. (Hesse, 5)I liked the book at some parts and disliked it at others. I liked it when an interesting and thrilling event was happening such as when Billie Jo was stuck in a dust storm and walking home as fast as she could. However, I disliked the parts that were a little deliberate such as where her mother helped a boy on the road who asked for some food."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billy Jo a girl from Oklahoma describes her life living in the Dust Bowl.

Billie Jo was also in the accident and has become scarred for life. She is unable to do the only thing she truly loved doing, playing the piano. Even after she has healed from the accident she just is hurt too much my the memory of her mother to even try to start over.

While at the same time she is trying to bring her and her father back to normal and to find peace again in her quiet home state.When I read the poem where the accident accrued I was heart broken and at the same time I felt so sad that her mother is badly wounded and she can't do anything about it. As she tries to get help it turns to be a disaster and is blamed for something she didn't do.I decided to read this book not only because we had to. But because it was so interesting and how it was eye opening, it was full of detailed imagery and scenes that actually created a mental picture and not just a book of words.When you read this book I promise you that I didn't want to drop this book you would stay hooked on it.

The amazing author is Karen Hesse. Most of the story takes place in a small town and on a farm with a lack of money in the beginning of the depression.Stuck in the DustLife wasn't all that great for Billie Jo who was a fiery red head who loved to play the piano. Livings in the prairie were the dust always blew and coated everything in its path, Billie Jo's father loved her but never showed it at all. When Billie Jo's future looks a bit brighter a terrible accident occurs and Billie Jo is left with no mother and a loss of her new born brother Theodore, she must learn to cope with the bad the very little good left and the dust.Felt the PainThe way Karen Hesse wrote the book was like a journal entry but had some poetic voice. That, made you feel like you were going through the depression and felt the way Billie Jo wanted to be loved by her father so much. With both similes and metaphors Karen Hesse made you feel Billie Jo's pain like when she said \\" I don't know my father any more, he looks like my father and he chews his food like my father, but he is a stranger.\\" A real tear- jerking part of the book was when Billie Jo and her mother suffered. I'm the kind of person that always has to have a happy ending in life and in books.They're be Better DaysNow I've never been in a situation as bad as Billie Jo's but I do know there have been some hard times in every ones life. The way Billie Jo copes with the bad periods of time with no mom and only a uncaring drunk father and the raging dust storms, she finds a way in where she can make a friend and share her feelings. And if Billie Jo can deal with the worst of times. I think we all can find a way out of the dust.Good or Bad.Whether or not you would like this book I loved it and you might learn a great lesson like I did."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse' book \\"Out of the Dust\\", is an increditable book.

The author does a brilliant job writing the character of an older child/young adult.This book is told in free-verse poems, which seem like choppy sentences to most people and is an easy style for any child to attempt in their own journal. It gives really good results. It also, not incidentally, moves your child through the book quickly - your reluctant reader may find herself/himself zipping through the story.Dust bowl 1930's. Deep roots.(When did every dust bowl book start including information on rabbit roundups? It is so weird, this one new historical detail in all the books.)Parent notes: the child narrator in the story causes the accidental burning and death of her mother and the unborn baby.

She is living in Oklahoma during the depression and is dealing day by day with that life. Her life is filled with dust, literally and figuritively. Removing all the sod which holds the needed moisture has brought about this great dust bowl. Billie Jo's mom is expecting a new baby, who will be 14 years younger than Billie Jo. Everyone seems excited, even Dad who is the strong silent type. Billie Jo has the gift of being able to play the piano, a talent she inherited from her mother. Unfortunately, Billie loses her mother in a tragic accident, an accident she blames her father for. In that accident, Billie Jo was maimed and feels her life is shot. Her one salvation from the never-ending dust had been the piano. Now it hurts to play. She wants to get out of the dust. Billie Jo discovers that what lies out of the dust is not for her...&quot;the dust is in her&quot;. She returns home and reestablishes a relationship with her father. Soon he has a new women in his life, who Billie Jo resents initially, but accepts very well, eventually. This book written in free verse was very easy to read. The reader gets caught up in the lives of those in the dust. The dust is incomprehensible. I believe I would not have the stamina to endure life in the dust. Billie Jo had hard issues to deal with in her young life and handled them very realisitically for a teen. It was heartening to see a bond form between father and daughter out of the tragedy. Very, very realistic."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book has life threatning events that are scary when you don't know whats going to happen next. Billie Jo has a very strong character and I think that Karen Hesse did a very good job with that. Hesse also did a good job when she stirred in the facts about the Dust Bowl.

Suddenly, she cannot communicate with her father, and due to injuries sustained in the accident, she does not think that she is capable of playing the piano, her one true passion. As the story continues, the reader sees the emotional growth in Billie Jo, and how she is eventually able to rebuild her life. This book was really wonderful as it was not difficult to read, but still, it was very though-provoking as Billie Jo often does not tell the reader exactly what she is thinking, so the reader is left to draw his or her own conclusions. This is definitely a book which will leave you contemplating it after you have put it down."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the dust is about a girl named Billy Jo.

When my daughter chose \\"Out of the Dust,\\" I decided to read italso, so I could see if the content was too adult.

The writing is so vivid that you feel the grit in Billie Jo's teeth, the pain in her hands, thesorrow in her heart. With just a few words, Karen Hesse evokes deep emotion and stark images. My daughter loved it too. She couldn't have chosen a better book for her transition from chapter books to longer novels. I highly recommend it for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It seems the author did a great deal of research on the life of the dust bowl to create the authentic setting, events, and characters presented in this novel. The story is an excellent way of teaching middle school children the importance of family and embracing how precious life is. The story accurately reflects the jobs of people during the 1930's in which men were farmers and women worked hard to tend to the house and children. The story does a great job of interpreting how important it was for everyone to do certain tasks in the family even the children. Karen Hesse does a great job of expressing how different people react to the devestation of the dust storms. It seems that the author chose every word with care when writing this novel, so the readers could go beyond just what was written, but also think if particular phrases like \\"out of the dust\\" have more than one meaning. The theme of the novel provides insight and understanding for today's problems as well as those of the past. Overall, this was a great book with original blank verse formatting to interest readers."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the DustOut of the Dust by Karen Hesse is an amazing book. In this book the main character Billie Jo lives in Oklahoma, where the dust storms hit hard. Billie Jo's family is poor because her Dad is a farmer but, nothing grows because of the droughts and the dust storms. Billie Jo has a hard life, Billie Jo is a very good piano player and playing the piano always makes her feel better.

There stove caught on fire and Billie Jo threw the pail that was on the stove and it hit her Mom. Both Billie Jo and her Mom were badly injured. When Billie Jo's Mom needed help her Dad decided to take the little money that they had and go for drinks. Billie Jo tried to do the best she could to help her Mom but it wasn't enough. Her Mom got sicker and Billie Jo couldn't play the piano as well as she used to because of the burns and scars from the pail. Not being able to play the piano as well as she used to Billie Jo had a hard time getting through the dust storms. Also it was hard to make money for her family by entering competitions. Billie Jo's mom got so sick that she died and so did the baby. In the end things did get better and Billie Jo's Dad got remarried and some rain finally came.I really liked this book because it was very exciting to read. It was exciting because there was always something going on and the book didn't get boring. I was able to feel like I was in the book because of the way the author used description to describe what the characters were going through. I think that the main conflict was very interesting because I always wanted to know if things would get better for her family. I think that the characters in this book could be real because people live through dust storms and also could have a very hard life. I think that the ending of the book was good because it didn't leave you hanging and wrapped everything up.This book was written in a very unique way it was written as Billie Jo's diary. The author's voice went with the mood of the book. The author didn't use a very challenging vocabulary. One of the author's unique characteristics was that the book was written as it was Billie Jo's diary. I liked this because you could understand what Billie Jo was going through and feeling. The author used dialogue well because you could always tell when someone was talking. Also the author was very descriptive and had a neutral tone.

Bill Jo, a 12-year-old girl, loves to play the piano. But, after a fire burned her hands severely so, she couldn't play the piano any more. She was left with a father, who rarely ever talks. Her father must work as hard as ever to keep the farm up and running. In the end, she was able to talk to her father more easily. Then her father decided to get remarried. This book is great for good writing seekers.One reason why I recommended this book was because the writing was so good the book was hard to put down. One example was when Billy was offered to play for the president's birthday. This part of the book was suspenseful because you didn't know if her mom would allow her to play. Another part was when the fire broke out. This part was really emotional and sad, you wanted to now what happened next that you couldn't but it down. The last example was when Billy Jo got caught in a huge dust storm. This part was really suspenseful because you didn't know if she would make it home or get buried in dust.My second reason why this book was good is because the author used excellent, vivid vocabulary and descriptions. One example was when the dust storms come. She describes what they looked and felt like. She was great at using the five senses to describe things. Another example was when the fire breaks out. The author used great vivid words. She was good at drawing pictures in your mind. The final example was the way she described how the characters looked acted and felt. You could feel yourself how they felt.The last reason why this book was excellent was the author could create an atmosphere and emotion. An example would be when her mother died. The atmosphere and emotion are sad and full or sorrow. It was also full of regret. Another example would be when Billy Jo burned he hands and was not able to play the piano. The atmosphere was agony, and emotion was hurtful. The last example was when her dad decided to get remarried. Billy's emotion was hurt because she really couldn't get over the fact that her dad wanted to start over.For excellent writing seekers, Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, is the perfect book. The author is good at painting pictures in your mind. She can, also, create an atmosphere and emotion. This book was so good I couldn't put it down. I think you will have trouble putting it down too.H. Wissmann"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is wonderfully amazing!

It almost made us cry and sometimes it made us laugh, but we learned a lot about what people had to live through during that decade of dust storms."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of The DustOut of The Dust has some very interesting aspects. One of them is the poetry and diary form of the writing. Another example and what I am going to talk about is the character Billy Joe. You may think the character is a boy, but it's a girl. She loves music and has some real tragic things happen to her. I am going to tell you about her.Her music really helps everyone in her life. It made money for her family. Her music also helped everyone get threw some tough times. She played at many balls and other important town things. She was very good and played a couple times in a contest. She learned how to play the piano from her mom. Her music was a big part of her life. She was never able to play again after her hands where burnt.She had some tragic things happen to her that ties her to the dusty land in which she lived in. She lived in the depression which made it hard to pay taxes. Her mom got burned while being pregnant and the baby and her mom died shortly after the babies birth. Her dad had cancer which made it impossible to make money. This all ties her to the land because every thing that has happened to her was at the land she grew up on. One example is when she ran away. She thought it would be great leaving the dusty plains. She was never able to get away for very long. She came back to her house and knelt down and cried. She wrote that she could not go away as much as she could stay. She was tied to the land.She was a great musician and a sad girl. Her experiences in life taught her a major lesson. She could never get away from the land she lived on. This book is great because of her life. Try the great book Out of The Dust.

So she gets back on the train and runs back home to her dad.If you want to find out more read Out of the Dust by Karen Hesses."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I would like to tell you about my desire to review a book that has been reviewed time and again, most likely. I am sure it will be reviewed by others as many people have noted it. This is a little about the small hardback: Here on the pages of the poetic \\"Out of the Dust: A Novel\\" are found the words to savor about our willing struggle to live within the travails that we encounter, even the most horrible. The gift of heart and hope, by daily endurance, and the simple recognition of our immediate lives lived within the labour of life is written as a statement of love about Bill Jo, who is a 14 year old girl. This is a children's book, and the writer is Karen Hesse (a poet, truly).There are so many good things about this book, including the way the book is divided into sections, like separate poems. These poems read like prose, and they go together to tell a story. My desire concerns the subject of blame. On page 70 there is a part in the book about the life of the girl who is the voice of this novel. She tells about herself, in a way that I remember my own mother telling me about herself. I would like to remember many of the things that my mother and father told me about when I was young. Some of these things like the blame in their lives, the story of their parents, and the story of the parents of their parents are things of remembrance that I ponder now that I am older. These treasured and important memories make up a weaving that is the fabric of our conception of the way we can and will live in the world. This book of poetic history does this for the reader.Here is what Karen Hesse writes about in the poem \\"Blame.\\" She says, or rather the girl who is telling the story to us says:\\"My father's sister came to fetch my brother,even as Ma's body cooled.She came to bring my brother back to Lubbockto raise as her own,but my brother died before Aunt Ellis got here.She wouldn't even hold his little body.She barely noticed me.As soon as she found my brother dead,sheHad a talk with my father.Then she turned aroundAnd headed back to Lubbock.\\"My desire to reflect on the joy that this tells me about is a mystery to me, because this poem is so sad. You would think that there is just the tears, and the poor little boy, and the missing Aunt (father's sister). I can think of so many times of blame in my day, and in my life. I recall a blame where a man I was visiting in a rest home called Pleasant Care, died. I blamed the facility, I blamed his family for leaving him alone, and I blamed the doctors who made a decision to pull the plug at his family's request. Yet somehow in this story about her brother being fetched by her father's sister, there is a sense of being in touch, and being loved. I sense that in this deep conversation that fourteen year old Billie Jo is holding, there is a conversation she is making with us and God that we continue to hold with ourselves, through friends, throughout our lives.This kind of desire to remain in joy, to find that we can weep in sorrow and continue in joy in our lives is a remarkable thing about life. Billie Jo lets nothing separate her from God, not dust storms, not the silence of her father, not the tragedy of the accident that caused her mother's death. I think about this book, and I believe that you will find it something worth reading. Purchase this book, if you will, and you will discover on its pages a rich consortium of faith, and living in a way that is both simple and yet at the same time filled with the complexity of the fabric that makes up our lives every day. There is a desire within us all to be thankful about living, and my desire is to introduce you to a small book that has a prize medal on the cover that says it was given to the writer \\"for the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.\\" Certainly you will find, as have I, that there is so much merit in this slim volume that you will find it one of the treasures that you want to give some special award of your own.Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse, a novel, is a book of our desire to live in this world. How brand new the world is every day, and what a wonderful gift of desire is offered on the pages of this book including subjects like \\"Birth\\" (\\"One morning when I arrive at school/Miss Freeland says to keep the kids out,/that the baby is coming...\\"), \\"Dust Storm\\" (\\"I kept along. I know that there were others/on the road,/from time to time I'd hear someone cry out...\\" and \\"Midnight Truth\\" (\\"I am so filled with bitterness...\\"When I say this is a children's book, I mean that it is a book about what it is to be a child. That is all of my desire, to tell you that this book helps one to continue on in a journey of life as a child or as an adult.--Peter Menkin, Mill Valley, CA USA"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Do you like to go to sad movies that get you to cry? Do you like to read sad books? If you said yes to either of these then you will really enjoy reading the sad but very well- written book, Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse.This book takes place in the dust bowl. The main character of this book is a girl named Billie Jo. Billie Jo plays the piano. Billie Jo's family finds out that her mother is going to have a baby. Billie Jo's mom died giving birth to the baby after being terribly burned in an accident involving kerosene. Billie Jo runs away from the dust bowl and her father. She soon realizes that running away is not the right thing to do and that family is very important. After realizing this Billie Jo returned home.I would give this book four out of five stars. A reason for this is that this book is written as if it is the girl's journal. This shows you the emotions of the character. This is good because it lets you feel like you know the character a little better. Another reason that I gave this book four out of five stars is that this book has a really good plot. There are a lot of obstacles or conflicts that Billie Jo has to face. Some of these conflicts are dust storms and the fact that Billie Jo could not play piano because her hands were burnt. The reason I took of one star is that this book is very sad! Towards the middle, everything in this book became sad.Billie Jo is a very smart girl. One thing that makes Billie Jo unique is that she can play the piano wonderfully. She even performed in some shows. Then, she burnt her hands. That changed many things. She could not play piano or do a lot with her hands because they would hurt her a lot.Billie Jo is sad that her mother died. She is also angry at her father for putting the kerosene next to the stove.One scene that really stood out to make this book very good is when Billie Jo ran away. Billie Jo ran away from her father and all of the dust storms. Billie Jo was on the train for a few days. On the train she met someone who had left his family. The man that she met left the train. He left a picture of his family for Billie Jo. Billie Jo realized that she should be at home. She called someone so that they would tell her father that she was going to come home.I would somewhat recommend this book. This book is for people who like historical fiction. This is also good for people who like to feel the emotions that the character is having."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though the characters may not be true, the plot is.

There are two problems though, one, it is very hard to be a wheat farmer in the dust bowls. Second, is the dust. There is so much of it. They say that when they sit down to dinner their food is already peppered, and the milk is the color of chocolate milk. Almost everything that they do the dust gets in the way somehow. With lots of heat, and dust, fires can occur. Billie Jo hates fires, and there is a reason, but you have to read the book to find out why. Out of the Dust has so many little lessons. A very important one is how fortunate we are now. Life was extremely difficult and sad. People all around them were sick and dying. The way that this book is written is incredibly touching. Karen Hesse did a fantastic job of writing. The form, the vocabulary, the story line; and best of all the book. There was nothing that I didn't like about the book. As I was reading to my Mom, she broke into tears several times, and I couldn't stop reading. The entire book was outstanding."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I'm writing about the book called Out of the Dust. In this book my favorite poem is Blame. This book is about the little girl in the book who blames her self for her Mothers death and also for her baby brother's death too. This book is recommended to you for the age group of 12- 65. This poem is written, in a way that she felt alone. The reason that I say this is because some of the words in the poem are written by their self. I really think that this is an excellent book and if you are ever in the library stop by the fiction section and check out Karen Hesse OUT OF THE DUST!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In the book Out of the Dust my favorite poem is &quot;Blame.&quot; I like this poem because I think it is one of the main poems. This book is excellent! It shows a lot of different emotions in the book. There are happy times and sad times. One of the poetic aspects in Out of the Dust is that there is a lot of symbolism in the poems. I like that because it makes you think twice as hard about all of the different meanings. I think that this book is for 8th graders and up because you really have to think about what the poem means to understand it. I like this book a lot I know I will read it again some day. I think that everyone should read this book at least once in his or her lives. I can see why it got 5 stars."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I'm writing to tell you about the book Out of the Dust. This is a wonderful book that is written a poem like way. Each poem has a great amount of meaning. In this book the little girl's name is Billy-Joe. She is 13 years old and she has a very hard life and it takes all the strength she's got too get over her burns, and the sad feeling she has because she felt like she killed her mother and the baby. In this book Billy-Joe feels like she is losing her father, so she struggles to gain his love back. This is a wonderful book and it's highly recommended by me."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The novel Out Of the Dust by Karen Hesse is a wonderful and educational book for readers 12 and over. It has so much feeling that it gives to the reader. It makes the reader feel sympathetic. This novel shows the hardship and emotions that they felt. Billie Joe had one of the hardest lives a girl her age should ever have. She did stuff that most girls would be scared to do. The only difference was that she was doing it though her hands were scared."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"so much symbolism. Take \\"Roots\\" for example: it is one of the main poems in the book. It tells about the conflict between Billie-Jo and her father. The problem was her father was connected to the land like \\"Roots\\". Her father believes that the wheat will grow again. Billie-Jo on the other hand is not connected to the land and wants to move. Her father and the land have a hold on each other, but Billie-Jo is \\"left out in the dust.\\" Her only escape was her piano, until an accident jeopardized its use. Karen Hesse is a very talented writer, and really deserved the Newbery Medal. I recommend this book to everyone ages 12 and up, because it really makes you appreciate the little things; like clean water."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"symbolism.

It was written in a creative way that doesn't confuse you. It really shows what people experienced when they lived in the Dust Bowl. Billie Joes experiences something's that would be hard for a normal girl to deal with. She's lost almost three people who are very important to her; her mom and little brother's lives with her dad's spirit. He doesn't talk to her anymore and just keeps on digging. She needs him enough already. Billie Joe now has to take over her mother's jobs around the house. This includes keeping the place clean, stuffing the cracks in the house with wet cloths, sweeping the dust out, taking care of the apple trees, going to school, cooking meals, and every now and then, earning money. Billie Joe has gone through hunger and poverty. Not to mention her burns threatening her piano career. Why won't all of her problems just vanish with the dust?"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a great book about a girl (Billie Jo) who loved to play the piano. She lived in the Dust Bowl of Oklahoma with her dad and newly pregnant ma. In the Dust Bowl there were some hard times that Billie Jo encountered like: getting dust in her throat and eyes, not having enough money to get what she needed, grumpy and tired parents, and much more. Then a big accident happens that burns her and her ma, who is still pregnant with the baby. Billie Jo's hands are burned almost to nubs, and her ma doesn't even look like herself. While her ma was still burned, she died giving birth to a baby boy. And a day later, Billie Jo's baby brother died. I'm not going to be a book spoiler, so I won't tell the rest, but buy it! It is a wonderful book that I cried while reading. It takes a lot of meaning in a book for me to cry. And it's also in an easy and fun to read format! Free verse poetry; which is fun to write and read. So read the book, and I promise you will not be sorry!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a very good book. It makes you feel like your with BillieJoe. Its as if your experiencing the Dust Bowl with her. Even though that not our time period,we have a good understanding of the Dust Bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Joe, a thirteen year old amateur pianist, was happy at heart until a terrible mistake, made by her father, scarred her life forever. With her mother gone, her father silent and burned hands that restricted her from playing the beloved piano, she was left by herself to cope with her pain and sorrow. To make matters worse, dust storms attacked the town of Panhandle in the dry part of Oklahoma violently.Written in rhythmic verses and in first person, Out of the Dust was so intriguing that it was hard for me to stop reading. At first, I had some trouble getting use to the phrases and stanzas Karen Heese wrote in but soon I was enjoying the way she wrote. It has very simple vocabulary but the play of words transformed the simplicity into an elegant novel. As tragedy came, I began to feel what Billie Joe felt: devastated, excited, nervous, and even worried.I have realized that I haven't truly experienced sorrow. While reading, I felt that I was lucky to have not gone through what Billie Joe did. I found it amazing that she went through with that and came out satisfied and happy with what she had.Out of the Dust is a great Newberry Medal book that enfolds one virtue: to make the best of things. I recommend this book to everyone. This is a simple book that can change a lot in you."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the DustWritten by Karen Hesse By JaneWhen you hear the title of the book, Out of the Dust, what do you think the book is about? When I first heard the title, I thought the book was going to be about a girl trying to get out of the dust. Out of the Dust is about a girl named Billie Joe. She got that name because her father wanted a boy, but instead he ended up with her. To begin Billie Joe\`s mom was going to have a baby. Billie Joe's dad goes out a lot to drink. Her dad left gas right by the stove. In the morning Billie Joe and her mom were making breakfast. Billie Joe's mom's apron caught on fire. Billie Joe saw the bucket of gas and thought it was water. She threw the bucket of gas on her mom. Her mom caught fire. A good thing was that she didn't die, but she was badly burned. When Billie Joe's mom had her baby, she died. The baby died about a week later too. To make matters even worse Billie Joe's dad got cancer. Will Billie Joe and her dad recover? What horrible things will happen to them? To find out you will have to read this great book.Out of the Dust was a terrific book. I really enjoyed this book, because of all the interesting parts. For example when Billie Joe's mom's apron caught on fire, also when her dad got cancer. I really like the way the Karen Hesse writes. When she was describing Billie Joe, I could really picture her in my mind. When she was describing the way the Billie Joe's mom acted. The author helps you put yourself into Billie Joe's place. If I could rate this book I would give it five stars. I would give it five stars because I really liked all the interesting parts. I can imagine like I was really there. Out of the Dust is a great book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is at once intensely tragic and staunchly hopeful. Karen Hesse skillfully uses straightforward, sparse language to create images that have continually returned to my mind--milk glasses made chocolate brown with dust, Billie Joe's scarred hands, the dust-covered piano keys--days after reading. Hesse doesn't clutter her poetry with excess background information, characterization, or description, but rather relies on carefully crafted anecdotes, images, and dialogue to gently acquaint readers with her well-developed characters and grippingly rendered setting. As I read, I became increasingly eager to research the Dust Bowl, discuss the book with others who had read it, and introduce my students to Karen Hesse as an author."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I Think the novel is verry good. because it lets you know thatevery one has to go some day and some time. it also lets you knowthat evein know people might act like thay dont love you theyrelly do. i also think it should be recommended to people whofell like they are digging them a deep whole and cant get out.thats what i relly think about this novel.THE END"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think somepeople should read out of the dust.

And she help they a lot."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Book Review Book: Out of the Dust Author: Karen Hesse Imagine the life of a girl who lived on the prairies and everyday, she hoped the rain would come make the plants grow to feed their hungry stomachs. This is the life of fourteen-year-old Billy Jo. With a new child on the way, Billy Jo's family is helplessly stuck in the middle of a dust storm while their farm gets torn apart. When a terrible accident struck, Billy is robbed of the one thing that brought comfort to her life. The Piano. She remembers feeling so joyful sitting at the wooden bench with her hands placed on the keys. Her joyfulness is shown through the poem entitled, On Stage. \\"When I point my fingers at the keys, the music springs straight out of me. Right hand slaying notes sharp as tongues, telling stories while the smooth buttery rhythms back me up on the left. . . (Page 13)\\" But that was before the accident, now she wonders if life will ever be the same. Karen Hesse's book is far from the ordinary. Her unique style is hard to find. This novel is written in as a journal but also told by several poems. Instead of chapters there are different poems, each with their own theme. Reading a story written entirely in poems might not be the easiest thing but I think it nudges the reader to think outside the box: to think in different ways about the story. This novel also provides a challenge for the reader. Karen Hesse's creativity is shown throughout the book, never slacking. Her poems are shaped to suit the topic. For example in the poem, which was quoted earlier, the words are shaped like the key's of a piano as the poem's talking about the piano. This book gives a small peek into the life on the prairies, but it's enough to give a feeling of what it's like. Karen Hesse's view into the prairie life showed both the ups and downs that I thought set her apart from some other authors. So if you're looking for a brake from the ordinary, Karen Hesse's book, Out of the Dust, is the way to go!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The wind is blowing, the dust is so thick you can't see your feet.

Well your problems are probably minor to one little girl's problem. The main character in this book has to overcome many challenges. When her life could not get any worse, something tradgic happens.

Her father grows farther and farther away from her. Then finally she decides she can't take it anymore and she runs away. Then she figures out that running away didn't solve her problems, and she returns home! Her father decides that they need to start over and he remarries a lady named Louise. And together they start their journey Out of the Dust! Karen Hesse wrote many good phrases. One of these phrases is &quot;And the certainty of home, the one I live in, and the one that lives in me.

Her father started going to night school and met a women their and about a few years later sarted seeing her. Not too long after she started coming over a lot. Billie Jo liked her but didn't want to admitt it because she still missed her mother. Her hands are better now but she doesn't play as well as she used to. She plays at a local talent show but she came in 3rd place! That's good but not for her she usually came in 1st. In the end Billie Jo, her father, and her fathers girlfriend Louise live happily in thier little farm house down south. This book inspired me. It showed me that are troubles worse than our own and maybe we should start thinking about thoughs less fortunate. I think you should read this book because it's one of my favorites and if you like these kinds of books you'll surely love this one."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought the book was okay, but I didn't understand it though. But if you have six-dollars go and spend your money on this book Out of the dust. Go and buy the book or else."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a Newbery Award winning book by Karen Hesse. It is about the Depression in the 1930s and a fourteen year old girl named Billie Jo who lives on the prairies. Her mother ends up dieing primarily because of a fire caused by both her father and herself, a little. Her baby brother never breathed fresh air. Both her brother and her mother died the day he was born. Her father won't talk about it and she feels all alone. Everybody blames her for her mother's death and doesn't remember, or realize, that her father put the kerosene by the stove. It doesn't help that ravaging storms of dust come blowing and ruining everything. The only thing that can cheer her up is playing the piano, but her hands are burned by the fire. She runs away, to the west, but finds that she is lonely. She comes back to her father and there's a woman who makes both her life and her father's life brighter.i really enjoyed this book. this girl feels so alone and so do i. she has a defeatist attitude also like me. i was really satisfied when i was finished with this book. this is a great book to give to students to open their eyes to the horrors of this world. it will also help them learn about the Depression of the 1930s more easily if they read this book first. what i wrote in the paragraph above was written for my essay. this is one of the good books i've read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Karen Hesse' book \\"Out of the Dust\\" is a very touching book. Reading thru the book I sometimes felt like I could understand what she was going thru. The book is about a young girl named Billie Jo, who does not seem wanted by her Dad or Mom. When a terrible accident occurs she feels all alone, becuase her Dad can not talk about it. The one thing she loves to do she can't, becuase her hands are cracked and sore. Their crops are dying, her best friend just left, they get huge amounts of dust storms, which kill the livestock and the one person who she can talk to is gone. This is a good book to know what it was like in Oklahoma in the year 1934, but even though it is touching it can be kind of hard to follow."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book was to slow, the book needs to show race trouble early on and thoughout the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"It is amazing!

Readers will also be able to relate to the trials and situations Billy Jo is experiencing in the story. Karen Hesse makes this story quite real.I will give the book 5 stars because of the authors unique way of constructing a story in free prose, but yet, at the same time, being able to give a realistic picture of hardships a young girl went through during the depression.

I liked how it showed the transitions of the characters and how they changed as the story moved on. There were parts that were very sad and so showed the very depressing part about the time period, and then there were parts that were uplifting. The depressing parts would include the middle of the story when the characters are close to giving up on the farm and their lives, after the death of the mother and brother, then the uplifting parts are when the father digs the pond, and the father and daughter realize what they really have and then they work hard, together, to put everything into place and start over again. I would recommend this book to anyone who does not have much time but wants to read a good story that has historical content."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Written in free verse, Karen Hesse's Newbery winning novel Out of the Dust certainly captures the severity of life in Oklahoma's Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Hesse's sparse language reflects the almost unrelieved harshness of narrator Billie Jo's life. Beginning with her birth on the kitchen floor of her family's shack, 14-year-old Billie Jo takes readers through her life as an only child who struggles to overcome her father's disappointment in having a daughter while trying to develop a musical talent, discover who she is, and survive the desert-like conditions of the Dust Bowl. Billie Jo manages to keep readers at arms length despite her truly horrible circumstances. When her mother falls victim to the carelessness of the father, Billie Jo sees accusers everywhere. The book pivots on this episode yet it doesn't ring true. How could a man who had always lived in the Dust Bowl leave a bucket of kerosene near a stove? Surely he knew the devastation that could result from fire. And wouldn't the dry, wood-frame shack have immediately succumbed to the flames? Even suspending belief, would Billie Jo really have grabbed the scalding bucket? Mightn't she have thrown water or perhaps a blanket on it instead? And why did she toss the bucket before she was outside on the barren earth where presumably nothing would have been hurt? Yet even with suspended disbelief, do readers really need such gruesome detail about the mother's injuries? Other books such as Sarah Plain and Tall and the Little House books portray life in equally difficult circumstances but manage to convey the information in a more understated and emotionally engaging manner.This depressing portrayal of a young girl whose dark life is lit only dimly by the light of her mother's piano playing and a half-hearted attempt to leave the dust fails to emotionally engage the reader. Readers find it hard to bridge the distance created by Hesse's terse language, which is appropriately and beautifully used in the description of the first rain. Hesse has tackled a painful subject, but the Newbery award is for books for children up to age 14. Don't children get enough harshness today? Must everything be spelled out in blistering detail? I would not recommend this book to children younger than 14, yet because it bears the Newbery Medal, teachers and others who work with children and books may unwittingly give it to children as young as eight. Perhaps society would improve if we let our children be children."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The theme of this book is death. You meet someone, you like them, they either die or move to California. Sorry I ruined all the book talks about. This is the kind of book that kids hate, and yet teachers think they love. It is really depressing when everyone dies."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book takes realistic fiction for children too far. Although it is well-written, it is very depressing. It gives the reader an interesting inside view of life in the dustbowl, and the narrator is a very interesting and likeable character, but her life goes from sad to tragic to VERY sad to EXTREMELY depressing to UNBEARABLY sad - and only near the very end is there a somewhat positive ending. The overall feeling that this book conveys is depression. More space should have been given to dealing with issues in a positive manner and, possibly,how to overcome obstacles - even if only small steps can be taken.Most kids can think of depressing situations - very few know how to resolve conflicts and overcome life's setbacks. This is the type of book that adults choose to show their kids &quot;so you think you have it bad...&quot; and some are caught up in the novelty of the easily readable poetic form, but I don't think many children will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I liked the way Karen Hesse writes.I thought it was good because it was sad and I learned how people lived back then."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book OUT OF THE DUST by Karen Hesse is a wonderful book.

This book is very emotional and when you think that you have the worst life out of anybody in the world, you would always think about Billie Joe, a little girl that was the protaganust in the story. IN this book, she overcomes many of her injuries and makes use of the things that she still had. She was a very determined to do the things that an everyday girl would get to do. I recomened this book to people at the ages of 6-176. It is Outstanding!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Written in free-verse poetry, this novel is a harsh depiction of growing up in the dust bowl of Oklahoma during the Great Depression. The descriptive language is wonderful, especially accountings of the dust storms. While deserving of the Newbery for its literary value, I found it rather heavy-handed - too much death and destruction and too serious and sober a protagonist. Even Frank McCourt found a little light and humor in his terrible childhood of &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot;."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"As a member of the age group that this group targets (I'm 12, 13 in a few days), I feel like I should at least give &quot;Out of the Dust&quot; as much praise as those above the age level who have read it. Perhaps this book rings more true in the ears of people with real life experience, but for some reason, this book simply did not appeal to me. I like a novel where I can get deeply into the characters and into the setting, and this novel does not aid me in that as the works of Philip Pullman, Edgar Allan Poe, and Lloyd Alexander do. I have never been partial to overly dramatic poetry on non-poetic topics, and this work is 210 pages of just that. I think that the latter is the key reason I did not like the book, because I have thoroughly enjoyed most of the other books that Hesse has written. The end did give me a smile, but the smile was quite trivial and not really showing any emotion. The protagonist talks too much about her mother... So, in conclusion, I think that frankly, this book did not deserve the Newbery as much as some other works written this year by American authors did. Although I thought that it was &quot;warm and fuzzy&quot; at the end, it was overly melodramatic and weepy.

Written in blank verse form and composed as a journal of events from 1934 through 1935 rather than written in &quot;novel&quot; form, this book will both surprise and touch you deeply. If you know the &quot;dust bowl&quot; region of depression-era Oklahoma and West Texas, you will find much in this book with which to identify. Teachers will be able to use this book to demonstrate just how adverse the weather conditions became during some of the worst days of the depression; they will also find the book useful to relate the events in the story to actual historical events of the time period, as noted in the young girl's journal entries. But it is not only a book with an historical background, it is a story about overcoming grief, loss, and pain, enduring the worst of nature's hardships and ultimately, recovering and achieving redemption. A young girl endures both the loss of her mother and infant brother, but also sustains and suffers through a painful, disfiguring, debilitating physical injury. In the process of dealing with these losses, she also faces the problem of becoming more and more alienated from her father while they are each in the midst of their own grief. Now, this sounds mighty grim -- but I guarantee that if you read through to the end, you will be richly rewarded and uplifted by this tale of the triumph of the human spirit.

However there were some interesting points. I feel that it was a very well written historical fiction novel. Although the book did not appeal to me as well as it did to some other students, it does have a creative ending. It was weird, in an exciting way.I believe that some entries in Out of the Dust would be a reliable primary source because it told us about the Dust Bowl in the early 1930's. There were many facts relating to the Dust Bowl. For example the crops had suffered greatly that year. Many farmers were losing much money. During this natural disaster, the dust was so thick that you were up to your knees in it.The analogies in the book were well thought out. For example, near the end of the book the father began to sing and Billy Jo stated that he sounded like a car engine short of gas. Speaking of flammables, the one event that kept you on the edge of your seat was the cause of Ma's death. It was horrible at that. Only I'm not going to tell it to you in case your in the middle of reading the book. The book all in all was in some ways mind boggling yet simultaneously heartbreaking."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"My favorite poem in the book is \\"Midnight Truth\\". The reason it is my favorite is because it basically sums up the whole book in one poem. It would be a good thing to put on the back of the book because it gives a good general summary of the book, without giving the whole book away. It talks about her losing her mother, and how she could have loved her more. About how her father no longer talks much to her and doesn't understand her. How the dust has affected there lives so much. It also talks about her father digging his own grave. That's what the books main points are, so that's why I think it sums up the whole book.I thought for my self the book was an easy read, and I don't read all that often. It's probably easy enough for advanced forth graders and almost all fifth graders. Anyone could read the book, but it's probably almost to easy for the adults so they might not enjoy it because of that. There aren't any really hard words that if you looked up you wouldn't understand. I think the book was an easy read and recommend it for fifth graders to highschool people.The book is set up in poem form. It doesn't have rhyming in it. I did find some metaphors. When the train was coming it she was saying how the train sounded like knifes hitting together. I thought the poem set up made the book go by faster because it seems like your reading so much more when your not there just in poem form. I think the metaphor made the book more interesting, because it sort of caught your attention.Overall the book was ok. It sort of gives you an outlook of how bad people had it. I wouldn't recommend it to people who have trouble getting into books unless they are interesting in the starting. If you don't mind waiting for the book to liven up till the end then it's an ok book, but if you have trouble getting into books I don't recommend it. I didn't enjoy the book overall that much, but some parts of it were good. It's interesting to take an interesting look at what people had to go threw then though."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"I wipe off Ma's dishes, and wait for Daddy to drive in with Louise hoping she'll stay a little later, a little longer\\" (Hesse, 226)Out of the Dust is a relatively easy book to read for most ages. To understand the theme and thoughts you must be about 13 or 14 to really understand it. Although it is not really a kids book, the plot seemed pretty easy to interpret. The one aspect of the book at I enjoyed was how the author would use similes and metaphors. She would put them in the appropriate place where they would make the most sense. I dislike this book for many different reasons. The first reason is that the book is very boring and could not capture my attention in many places. Another reason is that the book's theme plays by a similar and bland idea, people suffering and trying to escape poverty. This idea has been used in many books but just shaped and twisted so that it would match the time and settings the author wants. The only reason this books sticks out is how it was written. The last reason is that the written style would skip around from one idea to another in a matter of pages. It would not fully explain the idea and then go to another leaving the reader wondering, which is good, but the author would not mention again about the idea and you never would find out what happened. I have to say that this book is one of the worst I have ever read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust ReviewChristian Wright\\"She wears a comical hat, with flowers,/in December,/and when she smiles,/her face is/full enough of springtime, it makes/her hat seem just right./She brings apples in a sack,/perfect apples she arranges/in a bowl on the shelf,/opposite the book of poetry./Sometimes, while I'm at the piano,/I catch her reflection in the mirror,/standing in the kitchen, soft-eyed, while Daddy/finishes chores,/and I stretch my fingers over the keys,/and I play.\\" (Hesse, 227)This is from the book Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse. This book, about a girl in the Oklahoma Panhandle during the Great Depression, conveys about the struggles of Billie Jo and how countless tragedies force her on the brink of self-destruction.Well, at least that what Mrs. Hesse is trying to convey to us. While the back story sounds interesting, Mrs. Hesse tells the story through free form verse, clearly which is a mistake. While I managed to trudge throughout the book, the free form poetry forces you to see it from Billie Jo's eyes alone, not allowing you to read it in a third person perspective. This would be okay if the book itself was paced right. With Mrs. Hesse trying to show how life was in the Depression while showing struggles that an individual family had to go through during the Great Depression, clearly we could do without the numerous side stories that she includes, and how Billie Jo continuously goes on about how she longs to play piano. While one poem about her playing piano is fine, having every three poems about it becomes excessive.Also, Mrs. Hesse is trying to tell us about life in the Great Depression, but why did she have almost three references referring to the Migrating workers? One is enough. Also, the voice that is speaking through the book is clearly, clearly not meant for younger readers, even though this book is suggested for 9-12 year olds. She does mention alcohol usage and one whole part of the book is about the death of her baby brother and mother. That's when the quality of the poems becomes poor. There's nothing that drives the reader to the next dramatic point or next big surprise. Instead, the reader has to continue reading about self-depression and sadness until the end, when it only gets a tiny bit better.The good points of this book is how good the free form poetry is (at least in the beginning.) Some poems are great examples of how free form poetry really should be, how they should propel the reader to move on. While there's only a few of them unfortunately, those poems are truly the highlight of the book.Bottom Line: Unless you have been sleeping during your history class about the Great Depression or don't know enough about the Great Depression, steer clear of this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Daddy named me Billie Jo, He wanted a boy, Instead he got a long legged girl.\\" That was just a token of the glorious poetry in Out of the Dust.When I first began to read Out of the Dust I was weary and there wasn't much excitement holding me to the story. The book is for 11-20 year olds and it got more exciting later in the story. The book is about a poor little girl whose mother dies by a fire which she started. The little girl named Billie Jo lived on a farm in the middle of the Dust Bowl. Her father wanted a boy but instead received a girl. The entire book is made up of little poems, my favorite is \\"Dream\\". \\"Each day after class lets out, each morning before it begins, I sit at the school piano, and make my hands work.\\" This is after the horrific fire incinerated her hands. This story opened my eyes to life in the Dust Bowl times. Before I read this book I had no idea that life was so hard and painful back then.

It's on the ALA booklist, and it won the ALA best book. It's a Historical Fiction book that has a good number of pages. Karen Hesse wrote a lot of other books, Come on Rain, Stowaway, Time of Angels, and Just Juice. Karen Hess has a husband and two daughters. They live in Williamsville, Vermont. Out of the Dust wasn't a book that I would put on my favorite booklist and I would go as far as saying that I didn't enjoy this book.Out of the Dust is about a girl named Billie Jo and her life. When Billie Jo was born her dad didn't accept her because he wanted a son. Then her mom becomes pregnant again. Billie Jo doesn't know what to do with her life, the only way to express her feelings is to play the piano. Her father is never around because he spends all of his time working outside in the crop fields. Until one day a nasty sand storm came and ruined all of Billie Jo's father's crops. After the storm settles down Billie Jo and her mom get badly burned in a kerosene fire. She's confused, sad, and all she wants to do is play the piano. Finally when the baby comes Billie's mom dies giving birth. Billie Jo was mad, depressed, and she was devastated and heart broken. But of course the worst is not over in Billie's heart broken life. There's more to come. What is poor Billie Jo going to do?Reading this book was very sad. The dad had a very strong opinion on everything. When his wife had a baby he didn't accept her because it was a girl and he wanted a boy. But he didn't care he would follow his plan as if he had a boy and he named her Billie Jo. Also, all Billie's dad cared about was his wife having a baby boy and his crop fields. Another thing that angered me was that her dad lived outside, literally, because he spent all of his time in his crop fields. I don't think that her dad cared about anything.This book did not give me the warming feeling that other books give you. In the book the mom and Billie were seriously burned in a kerosene fire because Billie's mom didn't know that the bucket on the table was filled of kerosene not water. The she starts a fired by boiling it. Her mom's whole body is burned, and Billie's partly burned. Then her mom dies from giving birth to Billie's brother Franklin. So not only does Billie have an uncaring dad but she has no mom either. But to put the cherry on top of a fantastic sundae shortly after Billie's mom dies Billie's newborn brother, Franklin, dies. So, now, all Billie Jo can do is relieve her stress by playing the piano.I personally didn't think that this book was the brightest. It was a very emotional book for me to read. Reading this book is like being in quicksand. The sadder it gets the more you sink. If I was in quick sand I would barely make it. I don't recommend this book to young readers because it's a very confusing book to read and it's not a book that I would personally recommend. Things in the middle of the book get twisted up and it's hard to find a solution."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. Someone might find it interesting and the only reason why I gave it more than one star is because it's decently well written. It disgusted me though. There was too much giving birth, nasty sicknesses, horrible death ext. I truly wish I had never picked this book up. It will haunt my dreams forever!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is sooooo boring. It is no thumbs up. We were forced to read it by my teacher. I was goin to give it no stars but my teacher said no. Someone dies then nothing happens. It keeps going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going and going on and on and on! The plot [stinks]. If you like doing nothing for 2 hours (or how ever long this would take you) then youd like this book. This book had 4 stars but it deserved none. If your dull and stupid youll like the book...."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I had to read this book as a school assignment. I wasn't expecting it to be great, but never this bad. Anytime anything good happened, it would immediately make a reference back to any one of the abundance of horrid events that had happened through out t the book. I would always leave class bored and depressed."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"(By:T.B.) I did not like the book at all. I hated how Billie Jo was scarred for life. Her mom died with the baby it name was franklin because her father was looking forward for his wife to have a boy but she had girl. Her father burned Billie Jo and her mother. Nonething grow in the field not the wheat or the apple. The boy Billie Jo likes is gone his name is mad dog. Her best friend gone somewere. This book I would recomme if you like book like that."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The mother of the person telling the story gets burned and she is pregnant , so does the person telling the story gets burned on her hand and can't play the piano and it's her most favorite thing to do it's like her dream.

A few months pass and the mother dies also the baby when she gave birth."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"When she was in the kichen Daddy left keroscene on the stove so ma got burned and a week later ma and baby Fraklin (DIED)."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though I didnt like this book very much, I still had a favorite poem in the book. It was called \\"The Accident.\\" In this poem Billy Jo's Father leaves a bucket of kerosine by the stove. Mistaking it for water Billys mother begins to make coffe with it when it bursts into flames. Billys mother runs out of the house, but Billy runs back in to save their house from burning to dust. Billy grabs the bucket of kerosine and throws it out the door not knowing her mother was right there. Billy and her mother get burned very badly. I liked this poem because it was an important part of the book, and it reflected on anything Billy was able to do and able not to do through out the rest of the book. I also liked this poem because it was one of the few areas in the book that kept me interested in reading and occupied.I poetic device that I found in alot of her poems were stanzas. I liked how she used stanzas in her poems because it kept everything neat and organized. And without them everything would be packed into one area. Another device she used alot was free-verse. I liked the way she wrote almost everything in free-verse because if everything ryhmed or whatever, it would have been harder to stay focused. But I also think that if she had put a little rhyming or something into her poems it would have made them a little more interesting.I think this book would be age appropriate for kids in grades 6 through 9. I think this because it is at like a 6 grade reading level. But then I think you need to have a big attention span, so the ninth graders might enjoy it alittle more than the 6th graders. I am in 8th grade and I found it as a harder read JUST because nothing too interesting was happening and it was very slow going. So thats why 9th graders would probably enjoy reading it more than 6th graders.Overall, I disliked this book. I disliked it because, It was slow going and boring. Nothing too exciting happened. If there were more high exciting and important parts in the book, I may have liked it better.But the poem format threw me off track too, I am not used to reading things in poem format and it made it harder for me to focus and read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I disliked Out of the Dust partily because it was in freeverse and because it would never stop. The book topic was also horiable because nothing interesting happened. People died uninterestind deaths. The only reason I read it because I was forced to. I think Out of the Dust was very plain. It took place in Oklahoma during the great depression."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I don't like out of dust it is very stupid. Alot of the poems don't make sense. The best part of Out of the Dust was THE ENDING. The only reason I am writing this is to warn u that this book sucks , its boring , and nobody likes it. This book made no sense and u wouldnt like it unless u like boring and dull books."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I'm sorry but unless you are looking to throw yourself in a state of depression, this book is of no use to you.The story is about a girl who loses almost everything she has in a fire taking place around the time of the Dust Bowl. Sounds happy, huh?And when I say that the girl, Billie Jo, loses almost everything, which is closer to 'everything' than 'almost', I mean, she loses almost everything.Family? Her mother and unborn brother die in a kitchen fire, and the saddest part is that their deaths could have been prevented if Billie Jo hadn't flung boiling water out the door her mother had been walking through, and as you might imagine, that causes grief for Billie Jo, and her father as well. In fact, he goes on to become an alcoholic, or something like it, who lives in oblivion to pretty much everything. Even Billie Jo suffers from physical pain, when her hands were severely burned from the pot of boiling water she had unintentionally flung at her mother, causing her death.Belongings? Well, her family, or as the previous reviewer put it, 'what was left of it'..(I give you credit, whoever you are!) ...lost their fields, which were their main staple of income, in the dust bowl.Now, you might think that I'm exaggerating, but I assure you I am not. Before I had read it, my friends had told me how sick a book this was (and darn it, I couldn't agree more) and I just read it because I thought THEY were the ones exaggerating.So, you can be like me, If you wish, and go along and read it, which might not be such a bad idea, so you can get a taste for yourself how morally depressing this book is, or you can play it safe and not risk the nightmares."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a very sad story. It is about a girl named Billie Jo living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Not only is that sad, but her mother dies in an accident. Also the accident feels as though it is her fault.The poem that I enjoyed the most the most was \\"Met\\". \\"Met\\" seems to signal the end of the end of the book, and you know that nothing else is going to go wrong. It shows that the storm is over and she is recovering from the emotional trauma. It also shows that she is going to be part of her dad's life. She is almost meeting her father for the first time since the accident.The book is appropriate for 5th and 6th graders. At this age, they would be able to understand the way the book is written in poetry form. But if someone older reads it I think they will find the book boring because it is written in simple terms. The story line also is very simple. Someone younger might also be able to read it because of the simple language but they would not be able to understand the subject matter as well as 5th or 6th graders. I don't think children younger then 5th grade could deal with the death and sadness in this book.I really appreciate the way the author writes in free verse. It allows her to better express herself. It also gives the readers a chance to figure out how Billie Jo is feeling and to use their imagination more in the story. Because it is in free verse it as well makes it a good book to read out loud.Overall I did not enjoy this book. Nothing really happened. I could not really relate to Billie Jo. About halfway though the book you know she is going to recover from her mother's death, since you could not end a book that way. The first three sections were really good, but after that there is no plot. It was a boring book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In my opinion, Out Of The Dust was a great book. The perspective it gave on the Dust Bowl really made you think about what it must have been like. The main character, Billie Jo, was really interesting and not dried up and boring. Whenever she succecded, you celebrated with her. Whenever she went through pain, you felt for her. I really liked the way the book was written - in poems. Since it was written like this, I think it allowed the book to be more personal. What I didn't like about this book was the fact that Billie Jo often used confusing metaphors. She often compared her life to the dust, or the future to thr rain. That just gets confusing. I would reccomend this book for people 10 and up. It might be a little confusing for people under that age. That is why I would give Out Of the Dust a 4 out of 5. It is a really good book and worth reading."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think this book offers great history, and good information about the dust bowl era. I begin to feel like I know Billie Jo personally, and because the book is her diary/journal, it provides a good description of her feelings. This novel makes me understand what happened in the thirties, and gives me a good understanding of how residents of the dust bowl dealt with their problems. The story is so credible because the action is so realistic. When Billie Jo's mother passed away, I felt like I was going through the same thing. I would give this novel a 10 out of 10! Karen Hesse really did a job with this book!"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust, a heartfelt tale that vividly describes the tragic life of living in the Dust Bowl during the Great Depression. Knowing that on any one day you could come home and your house could be covered in a drift of dust. Choking down food while you feel the sandy, grit slide down your throat. Billie Jo Kelby was comfortable living her life with her Mother and Father in the dust bowl until a horrible accident left her mother with mortal burns and her hands just stumps of what used to be able play the most beautiful of piano ballads. With very little to live for and a quite distant relationship with her father and eventually the death of her mother while giving birth to her baby brother who also died. Billie Jo had to get out. Leaving what was left of her life behind only to find out what really matters most to her. Eventually coming home to find the faintest glimmer of hope in what used to be a plain of despair."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust was a very interesting book that I felt taught me a lot about the dust bowl; something I previously knew nothing about. You could see that there was a lot of research done by the author Karen Hesse which went into the making of the book just by all the descriptive language, and descriptions of the events which was used. It must have been challenging to write a descriptive novel about an event you've never experienced. The interesting form of writing was another way to show her feelings and thoughts during the dust bowl. It also helped to not drag the story out. This was a very good book that I would suggest to anyone interested in learning more about the dust bowl, or anyone who wants to see what a little girl thought about the changing times during the dust bowl."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust was a very intriguing book to read but also very depressing. This book wasn't very enjoyable to me because it made me sad to read a story about a girl, around my age, whose family just about disintegrates in the dust and she is left alone with no one but her speechless father to talk to. Although this book was not very enjoyable for me to read, it had some good morals to it. Leave the past behind you and work with the future was one of the morals I concluded from the story. The book also made me think about life how it was back in the 1930's and made me thankful for what I have now and how good I have it. Read the book Out of the Dust and you will be astonished by all of Billie Jo's heartbreaking tragedies she lives through."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think that this book had a good story line. It informs the reader about the dustbowl and some of the actual events that took place. For example, the talent contest, dances, and other simple acts of kindness were all foound in the panhandle newspapers. I would rate this book a four star book because it is written very well and is very descriptive. Karen Hesse describes the dust storm in such a way that it makes you feel like you are in the action. I also thought that this book was very depressing. If I could rewrite this book, I would change the kerosene incident. It causes two deathes and a series of burns."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"More than any other book I've read, this one woke up all the sences. If you ever wondered what it was like to live during this period of history, don't bother with nonfiction, this story makes history live."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;And I strech my fingers over the keys and I play.&quot; This quote is of great signifigance because Billie Jo can finally play the piano again. It was a long hard road for Billie Jo Kelby. From running away to California or to watching her mother die it seemed that buried under tidal waves of dust and tons of dead wheat no luck would luck would ever come to her. All she had was ripped away when her scorche hands could not play the piano. I particularly liked all the metaphors and how Billie Jo beat the odds and succeeded. Some metaphors are &quot;Ma was a column of fire&quot;(Hesse, 61) and &quot;brown earth rained down from the sky&quot;(Hesse, 143). This book was not cheerful but extremely melancholy. This book is best suited for ages 12 and up."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot;In the kitchen she is my mom, in the barns, in the fields she is my daddy's wife, but in the parlor she is something different.&quot; My favorite poem is dazzled. I like that poem because she talks about her family. Family is the most important thing in anybody's life. Billy Joe explains her parents in this poem. She talks about them as if they were her best friends. She also explains the important thing in her house, and tells whom they were given to and by whom. Billy Joe also tells how her mom taught her how to play the piano on her fifth birthday. I think that the book Out of the Dust should be read by middle school kids because a few parts are hard to understand. Karen Hesse wrote this poem with lots of free verse. I think that is what makes the book so well-written."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"&quot; They only said, Billy Jo threw the pail of kerosene.&quot;(Heese, 72) This is a quote from the book Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse. It also comes from my favorite poem from the book, called &quot;Blame.&quot; There are many reasons why this is my favorite quote. To start off, I can connect to Billy Jo's feelings when people blame her for her mother's death. I don't believe that it was her fault to begin with, but when people accuse you of something without knowing the facts, it angers you but also discourages you. It discourages you and angers you to think that when something goes wrong people think of you first. I also like this poem and quote because not only does Billy Jo have to cope with her mother's death, she is also being blamed for the accident. This book, I believe, is appropriate for 13 and 14 year old teenagers because, being a teenager takes you through a lot of tough times and this book might be able to help or advise you through them. In some of the poems, the poetry takes a unique shape which I think helps a lot. It gives you more of a feel for the book. This way the reader can take some time to actually look and relate to the poem. I deeply liked this book because it gives you the story of a girl and her real life problems so that you can find a way out of your dilemma."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I think the book, Out of the Dust was a good to great book.

She no longer could play the piano, and her hands were scared for life, where they would peel and crack untill they were blistered again and again.

The book helped me learn more about the dust bowl without having to read it out of a text book.The book is very emotional because the time of the dust bowl and great depression was a time of worry and sorrow. The book was also quite inspiring because Billy Jo got through alot that most people wouldn't have. She grew up without her her mom and she lived with her father who was impossible to talk to. Through her life she managed to live healthy and avoid dust pneumonia. The storm dragged on and on and once it stopped there were people that regret moving away. If I lived there I would not have moved because that was my home. Overall the book was excellent."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I gave the book 4 stars because i enjoyed it, but there were some things i didn't like.

I thought that when I was going to read this book that there would be more descriptive events and how the dust bowl came about and it would be more historical and I would learn more than I already knew.

The most horrible of all the hardships is when her mother dies in an accident which she feels she is partially to blame. I love the way Karen Hesse writes this book in free verse poem. I felt it gave me a better prespective of Bille Joe. I also felt it had much more emotion then it would have had if it had been written as a regular novel. This book reminded me not to take everything I have for granted an to be thankful for what I have. I thought this was an excellent book, however I would only recommend this to people 10 and up because it is extremly depressing. If you enjoyed reading this book I would recommend reading Letters from Rifka or The Music of the Dolphins, also by Karen Hesse."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Have you ever wondered what it would be like to not be able to do what you love to do and in addition lose a loved one? Well, in Out of the Dust a novel by Karen Hesse, Billy Jo, the protagonist, plays the piano and she's the most outstanding pianist. She loved to play more than anything. However, she's no longer able to play the piano and she lost her Ma because of an accident that transformed her life into a horrible, red, fire rising nightmare. How can Billy Jo live her life thinking everything she always knew and loved is gone, and with no one to help her, except her father, who won't talk to her at all about anything? Stay tuned.One day when Ma was as big as a big ripe watermelon, Pa set a big, black kettle of kerosene next to the stove and went outside to work on the mammoth, hot, dusty farm. Thinking the kettle was filled with water, Ma put the big, black kettle on the stove to make coffee for Pa, like she does every morning. Suddenly, flames burst forth like a fire breathing dragon enveloping Ma and Billy Jo in a frame of fire. Ma screamed and rushed outside to get Pa, and Billy Jo, daunted and nervous not knowing what to do, threw the heavy, big kettle out the door just as Ma came back in. Ma was now a wall of flames on the ground. Why did such a thing happen to her Ma, and what will become of her and Billy Jo? Read Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse to learn more.The accident wasn't the only thing that began Billy Jo's terrifying, dark nightmare. In the prairie back in 1934, huge dust storms disturbed Pa's life in growing his precious and valuable wheat. Everywhere he looked there was dust. One day there was a horrible, huge dust storm that enveloped the whole house like a huge hungry whale. Pa awoke to the roof rattling above the rackety, old house and marched outside with no word of why. Pa didn't come back in for hours on end. What will happen to Pa, will he come back? What harm will come to Pa? Billy Jo just wishes that she could run away from the dust forever like everyone else, away from the sorrows, dust, tears, and painful memories. What will happen?Her days seem forever, a week an eternity, and a year never ending. The annoying, repetitive dust storms are just in the way of everyone's farming and will never end. This is her diary of one year in her amazing life, a great pianist, not being able to play because of her hands. What? Why? If only. These are the thoughts of a girl called Billy Jo. Out of the Dust by Karen Hesse is a fabulous, mood changing, and outstanding book that I would encourage you to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a touching story about Billy Jo.

Complements to the author."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought this book was fantastic. Karen Hesse used very few words to tell the story of Billie Jo, a 14 year old girl growing up in Oklahoma during the dust bowl. Although, she uses few words, the words that she does use, tell the story completely and vividly. The story is written in the form of a journal of non-rhyming poems.When Billie Jo loses her mother and severely burns her hands in an accident, Hesse portrays her pain in a way that the reader really feels. My hands actually hurt when Billie Jo is describing the things that cause pain in her injured hands. Billie Jo and her father, who is grief-stricken, must find a way to reconnect and support each other through the bleak days of the dust bowl. Although this story takes place during the dust bowl, the themes of healing, strengthening family relationships, and hope that are found throughout the story are timeless.My daughter, a 7th grader, read this book for English class and then suggested it to me. I started reading it last night and could not put it down until I was done with it."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"If you don't have much time left before that next book report is due and you need a really short book, Out of the Dust is for you. Set in the Great Depression out in the Oklahoma Panhandle, you follow Billie Jo, a young teenage girl who is trying to survive after her mother and baby brother died with no wheat on her father's farm growing because of the lack of rain. This book is written in free-hand poetry which makes it a lot shorter than it looks. I used this for my last book report and I got it read in less than an hour and a half. Don't read this though if you are just reading it for fun--there are many better books out there to read."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out of the Dust is a sad story.

I loved this book and I think that everyone should read a great book like this."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The Newberry Medal winning book \\"Out of the Dust,\\" by Karen Hesse is a novel written in the time of the Great Depression. Not only were times tough with money,but the book also is set in during Dust Bowl of Oklahoma. The main character, Billie Jo, struggles with several things throughout the novel, death of her mother and unborn baby brother, hardship with money, blaim, and sorrow. Billie Jo must live with the fact that her dad is to blaim for the accident that killed her mother and unborn brother. So from then on out her dad is too depressed to console or help her deal with everyday problems.Hesse does a great job using the poem and journal format to capture the reader's attention and it is a different style of writing that students can enjoy. I would recommend this novel to middle level readers looking to enjoy a book about struggles in life and an important time in U.S. history."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo&#65533;s life reflects the many tragedies of the Dust Bowl. A lot of people were depressed and saddened. She was also in the heart of the Dust Bowl, Oklahoma. The crops didn&#65533;t grow and the economy was going down. The author introduced a new way of writing to me.I never read a book in journal format. It is beautifully written and I love the style. Hesse is a very graphic and intellectual woman. Yet the story was sad and depressing. As in many of the books I read, I felt the author left me hanging at the end of the book. I felt the plot was very vague and simple; it didn&#65533;t have me glued to the book. Each entry had tone, mood, descriptions, and graphic words.The climax was a real page turner. Billie Jo&#65533;s father left a pail of Kerosene near the stove. Does her mother survive? Billie Jo felt it was everything was her fault. After this event everything starts to change the dust storms get worse.Out of the Dust was a good book but not my taste. The one thing that kept Billie Jo happy was her piano her mother also played the piano. She would go to piano recitals but if it was on a school day her mother wouldn&#65533;t let her go. This led me, the reader to believe that the mother was jealous of her piano playing. After the big climax she stopped playing the piano. Piano is vital to Billie Jo&#65533;s character. I thought this was a beautiful book but it is not my favorite genre."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Billie Jo Kelby is an average 13 year old girl who was living through rough times during the Dust Bowl. The book was very pleasing to read. In a few parts of the book I couldn't wait to see what happened next. Then again, sometimes I felt like she was overstressing a little too much.When Billie Jo's mother died, it seemed as though she lost the biggest part of her. She had no real connection with her father, so, while her mother was gone she was left alone.I could comprehend the pain she was going through and wished that someone could have been there to comfort her. The greatly descriptive details made me comprehend the way her house was swarming with dust.This truly is an amazing book to read. If you read this book I am sure that you will get the message that Karen Hesse is trying to express. This book will teach you that you should love your family and have faith in the people that you love."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"In the process of reading \\"Out of the Dust\\" I was struck with a sense of wonder and interest. Karen Hesse brought me into the book as if I was listening to someone actually talk to me one on one about his or her life. At the beginning of the novel, it struck me as a book that I would really develop interest in. I felt like I got to know the characters, and I could feel the emotion the Billie Jo had. This novel was very deep. It had a certain volume to it that brought out the harshness and the terrible things that were going on, but at the same time it caressed the intensity of the situations. What I mean by this is, it could show the meaning of a conflict very descriptively while it was in a metaphorical form. I really liked the fact that it was written in a free verse poem format. I think that worked better with the emotion of the conflict rather than having it a standard paragraph form. This novel really touched me. It strengthened the knowledge of what I knew about the Dust Bowl, but it also helped me interact with it a little better. I felt that through the book, the way it was written, I could express my emotions more freely."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Realistic narrative free verse of life on a poor farm as it was experienced by a sensitive young girl during the Dust Bowl days in Oklahoma.

And I mean WOW. I've been wowed by just a few books so far in my life, and I can most definately say this is one of them. It's a beautiful, heartbraking story written in a straight, blunt manner. I believe it can appeal to anyone, young or old, and so on. It's written in stanzas (poetry format, however you want to call it), and I really dislike that type of writing, but that's the thing about this book, it has so much power, that can get to anyone.This book is just incredible and draws you in from the moment you open it up."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust, by Karen Hesse, is a fabulously written book.

During the book the family goes through very painful events and lose part of the broken family.This book is sad, but is an amazing story. It was very inspiring to me and the ending is unexspected.

I was assigned the book, to read for my History and English class. I had already read the book in fourth grade, but didn't really understand it (I wasn't really interested in it). So, when I was assigned the book to read, I wasn't exactly excited.But I was very surprised when we began to read-- it was actually pretty interesting. The story was clearer than it had been before and I enjoyed the touching story of a girl in the dust bowl during the Great Depression. The story is written like a diary except that the diary entries were free verse poems. Its not like those other \\"Famous people\\" diaries out there, but a book of poetry that all come together into a story about a girl. Billie Jo, the main character, is a tall, lanky girl with a few family issues to work out, and an accident that she would remember and regret for a long, long time.But the book did sort of disappoint me. I didn't really care for the parts that included stuff like little things that happened in her town. There were a few poems in the book that did bore me a little, but once they were over, I was back into the book. But I probably would have enjoyed the book a lot more, had I not read it until now. Throughout reading the book, I vaguely remembered the main parts of the story and the main points couldn&#65533;t surprise me. Go be surprised and read this book! You'll learn a lot more about the real feelings in the people negatively affected by the Great Depression. \\"Out of the Dust\\" really revealed a lot about the Depression to me, and taught me a little more than the textbook. I'm glad I read it, and you will be too."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust is about a family living in Oklahoma during the Dust Bowl in the 1930s and their struggles and hardships.

Some people cannot understand or get into poetry. I do not like poetry and the story line was boring. If the novel was written in paragraph form then many more students and others would enjoy it. It seems that the author just pressed enter whenever she wanted to without thinking. The storyline of the book is inspiring to people who think they are lost in life, but pointless to people who know who they are. However, the characters were well explained. Billie Jo is the perfect example of a little girl who is lost in a sea of death, birth, and dust. Every family during the \\"Dust Bowl\\" had trouble, but Billie Jo and her family had more than that. Billie Jo was a young girl who had to grow up without a mother, a father who was lost, and a farm that was dead.My favorite poem in the book is called \\"Met.\\" It is when Billie Jo comes back from running away and she and her father have an in-depth conversation to make up for the past. This poem shows that Billie Jo can forgive someone even though he (father) hurt her badly. \`As we walk together, side by side, in the sole-deep dust, I am forgiving myself for all the rest.\\" (Hesse, 206) This shows that Billie can forgive herself for everything and anything that has gone wrong in the past. \\"I can't be my own mother...and I can't be my own father...\\" (Hesse, 205) Here Billie Jo is expressing her need for love and saying that she can't take care of herself. Lastly, this is my favorite poem because it expresses so many of Billy Jo's feelings.Even though the book had an okay story line it was incredibly boring and always got off track. Karen Hesse never stayed on subject and seemed to include random poems to make it longer. If you took out half the poems in this book that did not make sense a second grader could read it. A second grader could read it because it does not use a very wide variety of vocabulary and it would be really short. Karen Hesse did use a few similies, but they were not interesting because you could not pay attention to the book in the first place. One of the similies that someone could enjoy would have to be, \\"her anger, simmering over like a pot in an empty kitchen.\\" Students could understand this one because the poem it is in relates to the story line. She does not use many metaphors, alliteration, or personification.I would recommend this book to any age group that understands and likes random poetry. The poetry would be nice if it was compiled in a real sequence. Students around sixth grade and up would understand and appreciate this book. Kids a little younger might not understand the randomness of the book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I read this book in less than a few hours. As a poet and writer myself, I am impressed with her free verse structure for the book--original and somehow lending to the bleak atmosphere Hesse portrayed. The story left me pensive, wondering at who these people were that could hang on year after year with no hope; I wanted to find out more about that era. Her descriptiveness so convincing, I thought I felt dust in my eye when I rubbed it and could almost imagine the taste of dusty &quot;chocolate&quot; milk. Every child should read it...A superb book!

I was disappointed with the CD, but my students enjoyed the content of the novel."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"\\"Out of the Dust\\" is a brilliantly written, often quietly moving little story written in poems. Not everything works out in it and it is not exactly a cheerful romp in the woods. For example Billie Jo's mother dies a tragic death and after this accident her father becomes quiet, cold and desolate. Conversation becomes practically unknown in their house and happiness alien. Dust becomes a very common sight and a real problem across their home in the Oklahoma Panhandle. One of Billie Jo's only joys in life is playing the piano. It relaxes and diverts her but her hands become hopelessly burned and she can no longer play. Billie Jo tries to escape the dust by hopping a train west and when she comes back she and her father discover they are more alike than they thought. By the end of the book there is a shimmer of happiness when her father meets a modest surprisingly insightful woman who truly seems to become a part of the family without erasing the memory of Billie Jo's mother."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Never in my whole 11 years on this Earth have I ever read a book on poems. I always thought poems were supposed to rhyme. I thought poems were boring. When my teacher told me we are reading a book that is all poems I thought, this is going to be a long year. The day we started it, right when I picked this book up, I couldn't put it down. These poems showed extreme sadness and emotion. It shows how good of a life we have and how much they had to suffer. Everything they had was covered in dust. Now days, we have stronger walls with now cracks in them so that dust and rain cant get through. Back then they had cracked walls. No windows, dust and rain got in there houses all of the time. It has much sadness too. Billie Jo's best friend moved to California to try to get out of the dust. Billie Jo's hands represent how she is slowly losing self-confidence as well as her life. She and her father are slowly turning to dust. This book made me think about how fortunate I am to live where I do. I am glad I read this book because it really made me think about how hard life really is out there. It also explained to me much about the dust bowl. I recommend this book for any child to read with their family, school, or just on their own."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book Out of the Dust, was one of the most interesting and fascinating books I have ever read. Out of the dust was a book that showed the emotion of the people in the Dust Bowl, and in the Great Depression. I thought that it was good to learn about how people felt and lived back then. Also, the book is filled with symbolism of life, death, joy, hate, and much more. A great example of symbolism is that the apple trees and the piano, resembled Ma. The way the author used symbols was excellent, because some objects resembled a person's feelings, or how they act. The symbols also showed the way of life and what was going to happen.In the book, there were many times of hope. Hope that their family would live, hope to grow food, hope for the rain to come, hope for other people, hope is what kept everyone going. Acceptance was also mentioned many times in this book. The father had to accept the accident, Billie Joe accepted her life and herself, and the family accepted what they had and made the best of things. The people in the book were very giving too. I thought that it was interesting that people who were in the worst of situations, still were giving help, support, and anything that would make the time better.I highly recommend this great book. I enjoyed reading it together with my class, and discussing each chapter about emotion, symbolism,themes, and important detailed parts of the story. I thought that the book was a great way to show how people lived in the period of time. If you want a fantastic and incredible book to read, I suggest you get this book."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"I thought Out of the Dust was a mediocre book. It was very sad at some points because Billie Jo's hands got burned in an accident with fire, and she loved to play the piano. However, it was touching when Billie Jo made up with her father after her mother died in the same accident. Billie Jo and her father both felt responsible for the mother's death, because they both played a part in her getting badly burned, which led to her death. To make things worse, the mother was pregnant with a much-wanted son. This book was sometimes very depressing and would not be suitable for light reading.The free verse poem format was unusual, and stood out from other books. However, I felt that the book could have been much more descriptive if it had been written in paragraph form.The reason for my rating, three stars, was because this book was sometimes very sad. It also had a bit of a slow start. However, this book had a lot of meaning and seemed very realistic. It was very emotional, and I would recommend this book to older readers."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Though most of the review writers of this particular book are young students ages twelve and thirteen, I offer a very different perspective. I'm a nineteen year old college student who may someday want to teach this novel in a classroom. For those interested, here are my thoughts on Karen Hesse's Out of the Dust.I found it interesting when reading through other reviews from children who have read this book, that many said something to the effect of, \\"At first it was boring, but then I really liked it.\\" I, on the other hand was immediately swept into its poetic like form with its intriguing opening, \\"As summer wheat came ripe, so did I, born at home, on the kitchen floor.\\" But I can also understand how a twelve year old might have a difficult time getting into the novel. In comparison to today's world of high speed entertainment, Karen Hesse takes a slower pace as she describes a slower time in history, a harder time. I think it is important for adolescents, especially in today's society, to know what their lives would have been like seventy years ago, in a time very different from the one they know. Hoping that the crops won't fail this year is a stark contrast from hoping for the latest video game. Today's kids seem to be more concerned with continuing action. Hesse's book seems to focus more on emotion. It will take longer for these kids to react to the novel because media has made them somewhat numb to emotion. But it will penetrate, and when it does it will make a longer lasting impression than action ever could.Many children have lost someone close to them and relate to Billie Jo's loneliness over the loss of her mother. They may have problems communicating what they feel inside. In this book, Hesse becomes the potter, shaping clay emotion into words, through her poetic style. Where adolescents have trouble structuring their emotions into words, Hesse does it for them with passages like, \\"Such sorrow doesn't come suddenly, there are a thousand steps to take before you get there. But now, sorrow climbs up our front steps, big as Texas, and we didn't even see it coming, even though it'd been making its way straight for us all along.\\" Adolescence is a difficult time, no matter what time it occurs in. So many of its issues are not only universal but timeless. Everyone goes through problems with their parents as they enter teen-age-hood. Billy Jo is no exception. She describes her relationship with her father with the passage entitled, \\"Empty Spaces: I don't know my father anymore. He sits across from me, he looks like my father, he chews his food like my father, he brushes his dusty hair back like my father, but he is a stranger.\\"Karen Hesse's poetic emotion creates not only a touching, but important look at life in the Dust Bowl. But more than that this book provides an outlet for adolescents to deal with their own problems as well."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"The book I reviewed is by Karen Hesse.

There is a BIG dust storm and I mean real BIG!, this makes her dad's farming worse and there would be no food growing out of the fields. Now everything is ruined their crops and family.

These states became known as the \\"dust bowl\\" states. Karen Hesse presents a work of histroical fiction of this poverty stricken time in American history. Her narrative is written in a poetic free prose style. The events that take place are from the perspective of a young twelve year old girl from Oklahaoma named Biilie Jo who lives with her mother and father. Her father is a farmer who has been economically burdened due to the recession. Billie Jo remarks that they weren't always happy during this time, but her mother taught her the enjoyment of life and of the piano. Billie Jo loves music and actually shows promise in becoming a very good musician. A terrible fire accident that burns Billie Jo's hands and takes the live of her pregneant mother will change their lives. The impact of this incident along with the continuation of winds and drought take their toll on Biliie Jo and her father. Like their Oklahoman farm will they continue to not \\"live\\" life or will escape from the \\"dust\\" be the answer.The free prose style of Karen Hesse illustrates the thoughts of Billie Jo as she struggles with her lose and hardships during the Great Depression. This work of historical fiction explores this period of American history, and would be a useful tool for young adults in opening a discussions on the topic. The novel is an example of the many struggles of Americans living during this time. I would reccomend this book to readers who are interested in early twentieth century American history. Also, of interest would be Karen Hesse's book on a 1920s' Vermont town and the KKK entitled \\"Witness.\\""},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book will make you cry.

Karen Hesse did an amazing job in this book, considering her free verse style of writing. She makes the characters mold with the setting and the events so that it seems like the story is almost real. I enjoyed how the story went through and described the Billie Jo's feelings towards her father, and how she reacts to her mother's death. This book deserves no less than what it has already recieved."},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"This book is so moving and powerful that it was very hard for me to put it down once I began. I read the entire book in one night. Billie Jo's journal entries were very touching and makes you want to be there to experience what she was going through. The author did an excellent job with Billie Jo's character and her writing style is so descriptive and imaginable.Imagine growing up in Oklahoma during the depression, working for only a nickle or dime; thinking this was a lot of money. Imagine seeing your mother on fire and there's really nothing you can do to help her or to ease her pain and suffering. Well, despite these adversities, Billie Jo, at the age of fourteen, triumphed.

In the beginning of the book there was a dust storm. Then like two days after the dust storm Billie Joe's mom died as soon as she had her baby but then the baby died. Then Billie Joe's father was so up set he was starting to dig a huge hole in the ground and I just can't tell you the rest but I hope you buy this book.P.S It's worth the mouny"},{"Title":"Out of the Dust","review":"Out Of The DustThe book \\"Out of the Dust\\" has a very unique way of being written. The author wrote the whole book with a series of poems and diary entries which actually helps the story. Suprisingly using poems and diary entries touches the reader a way no normal book could. The writing technique was definitely well thought out because although the pages are short, it explains Billie Joe's feelings.Some of the diary entries are short, but that makes the book all more real because that is actually how I think a girl from Oklahoma in the 1930's would write. The author,Karen Hesse , has really captured the devastating effect of Oklahoma's dust storms. Even though this book is based in the 1930's today's children can still relate to her feelings of wanting to leave and go venture into the world to find more.Even in diary form this book gets the point across, home is where you make it. Karen Hesse helps explain this message through Billie Joe's relationship with her father after her mother passes away and how Billie Joe finds that she loves her home in Americas dust bowl because of her father and her memories, no matter if the memories are good or bad."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I never even heard of David Eddings before I found this book. It was long, but I finished it all the way to the end. After reading the book, I became interested on the other books written by David. First I read all of the Mallareon and then the Belgariad. Thanks for providing me a book that could spark my interest, David!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"It seem to me that &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; is the most mature work from David &amp; Leigh Eddings.

I have read all of their books and this one is fantastic. It was great to finally find out the history of Belgarath. A definite not easy to put down book. Try Polgara the sorceress. Another 10.

Too Bad!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The story of Belgarath and further on of his daughter, besides being great fun, having all the elements of unforgetable epics, say much about growing up.

However, I felt that after reading the Iliad and the Tamuli that some of David Eddings characters tended to repeat. Garion and Sparhawk could be the same person and after reading &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; characters seem slightly one dimensional. The racial characteristics of the races don't change even over seven thousand years, this is highly unlikely. There is also the feeling from reading the book that the planet seems to be permanently in the middle of the Middle Ages. Crossbows have been invented but not gunpowder. It seems as though the lifestyle attained seven thousand years ago has stayed there throughout without change. But David Eddings gets away with it though because his writings are so superb, they flow without seam. His characters are well defined, his story well thoughtout. Brilliant as ever this book is his best, because Belgarath is his best character, a loveable rogue who we wish we knew. PS Can anyone explain to me how Mandorelin (Baron of Vo Mandor)and Llandorelin become friends. In the Guardians of the West, Garion has to settle a dispute between Mandorelin and a rival baron and Llandorelin goes to his friends aid. In the first book &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot; Garion meets up with LLandorelin at Vo Wacune, where they travel to Vo Mandor and meet the Baron who travels with them to Vo Mimbre. But LLandorelin becomes ill on the way and is left behind. So Mandorelin and LLendorelin would have spent very little time together. Hard to see two sworn enemies becoming friends that quick."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"AFTER READING BELGARETH, IT MADE ME WANT TO RE-READ 'THE BELGARIAD' AND 'THE MALLOREON' I AM AT PRESENT RE-READING 'THE TAMULI' TO BE FOLLOWED BY 'THE ELENIUM'.

I'll give you the positive and negative...PositiveEddings's excellent, funny characters are back. Belgarath has always been one of my favorites. The fantasy world itself is large, with each nation displaying a distinct culture. The first person perspective gives us a new insight into Belgarath's thoughts. The magical happenings and personalities of gods give a sense of wonder to the books.NegativeCharacters sometimes seem to go through little development throughout the chronological sequels. Also, the total plot has never been earth-shattering except within the story. However, the details are given very well, with a few surprises. In conclusion, Eddings fans should DEFINITELY buy this.

David Eddings has told the same worn-out story at least 3 times now. (Belgariad, Mallorean [sp], Diamond Throne, etc.) &quot;Belgarath&quot; is an expert re-hashing and fleshing out of story already presented in other novels.

Still, I USED to like the Balgariad. After readings this book I've come up with a rule: never get to in to things. Belgarath was one of my favorite characters up to the &quot;Malorian.&quot; Now he just seems stupid. If someone can live that long without learning anything, he MUST be. Maybe David Eddings never spoke to old people, and so doesn't realize that years themselves - even if nothing tangable is acheived - make a differance. Also, through this book Eddings managed to do the nearly impossable task of taking out any element of magic and mistery that remained.. An amazing talent, but one, I hope, that will not be wide spread"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Very broing and truly disappointing......other then the maybe four humorous parts, this book went absoutely nowhere.

It's a trip down memory lane for those who have waded through the Belgariad and the Mallorean (which both became progressively more ponderous and lacking in new ideas).The fact that this book even exists suggests that Mr. Eddings is running either a bit low on new ideas, or his bank account, or both."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Book was in Excellent condition received in modest amount of time due to United States Postal System automated distribution center which operate about as reliably as Mr. OBAMA"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"now the reason that i gave this book only one star is because it like all of the other books by david and leigh eddings in the belgariad and mallorean series' are only available as audio books. now don't get me wrong i love my kindle but i didn't buy it to listen to books i bought it to READ books."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"It's been years since I read the original books in this series, but I enjoyed them a lot. So I was excited to find two new books in the series, this one and &quot;Polgara.&quot; It was fun to revisit characters and events that I had read before. I really enjoyed the beginning of the book that covered Belgarath's origins up through the cracking of the world.The rest of it is OK, but there was very little suspense present. (Note: This was NOT because I already knew many of the events. I read the original series too long ago to remember most of the details.) Part of it has to do with the whole &quot;predestination&quot; aspect of the series. After a while, it makes you wonder if many of the choices that these characters make really make any difference in the grand scheme of things.The first person narrative is a mixed bag as well. At times I enjoyed the more personal observations by Belgarath, but it grew old in a book this long.My favorite parts were in some of the more &quot;trivial&quot; events such as Belgarath's gold mining adventure or his fishing trips with his Grandson. I wish that there had been more of these &quot;human&quot; stories. Too much of the book read like, &quot;This happened, then THIS happened, followed by THIS,&quot; and there wasn't much that made me really care about the characters.So, it's worth reading after you read the original books, but it could have been much more entertaining."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The book said nothing new and the characters tend to irritate after a while, but what I really want to comment on is some of the other reviews from British readers. If your going to share your views all well and good but please spell things correctly or you make us all look stupid."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The Belgeriad and Mallorean series are my favorite pieces of fantasy literature - I've read them a couple times, and they are always super enjoyable, and always force me to stay up late reading them because I can't stop, even though I know what's going to happen.This book (and Polgara) is a wonderful cap to the whole series, going all way back in time. Although much of it is a repeat of what was in the other books, this is wonderful reading since it is all from the perspective of Belgarath, alive these last 7,000 years, and he offers many, many new insights to the events of the books. It's fascinating: construct a whole series with the omniscient narrator, and then write two more books going over the whole thing again, but from the point of views of two characters in the series. Surprisingly, it not only works, it works well, and it's quite compelling reading. And Eddings writes convincingly enough to make one think it really *is* Belgarath who has written this.Absolutely excellent reading, but of course, you really do have to read the first ten books first. And I can't recommend this series enough. Certainly the best multi-volume fantasy series that has come out (and yes, I am apostate by regarding this higher than Lord of the Rings, but so be it)."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Read this only after you've read the Belgariad/Mallorean series and don't mind getting a different view of the character of Belgarath.BtS begins where &quot;Seeress of Kell&quot; left off: in the Vale of Aldur, where the family has gathered to witness the births of Polgara's and Durnik's twins. Soon after, the topic of Belgarath's true past comes up, and Belgarion, Durnik, Ce'Nedra and Polgara begin to bully Belgarath about writing his memoirs. Belgarath remains obstinate until his wife Poledra suggests that memoirs would be a fine idea indeed. Having no choice anymore, Belgarath unhappily hunkers down to tell the story of his life.In the days when the gods walked the earth, he was born in the ancient pastoral village of Gara and orphaned young, gaining himself the name of Garath, &quot;of the town of Gara.&quot; Here he learned to steal, lie, and cheat in order to survive. In his own words, &quot;Larceny seethed in my grubby little soul.&quot; The boy Garath runs away, stays awhile with the cursed people of Ulgos, and eventually finds his way to the Vale of Aldur. Lost, cold, starving, angry with the harshness of life and ready to die, he is taken in by a kind stranger: the god Aldur.Garath the boy-thief grows into Belgarath the Disciple. Here, the other disciples appear, some of them through hilarious situations that only Eddings can pen. Zedar (&quot;he looked like a Tolnedran, or possibly an Arend&quot; - an insult), Kira and Tira the Alorns, Makor the Melcene, Sambar the Angarak, and Din the Dwarf. Each of these sorcerers is well-made and unique and for the most part, fit with the later/previous stories.Unfortunately, Belgarath's character takes a turn here from the colorful character we learned to love in Belgariad/Mallorean. It seems he isn't really quite as bright as we thought him to be. One would think that someone his age would have learned a thing or two in his lifetime. You may say &quot;Well, he's Belgarath, he's taking liberties with his story.&quot; Still, his tales aren't what one would expect from someone as accomplished as Mister Wolf the traveling storyteller. There are far too many discrepancies between this book and the previous ten. There are times even his cunning seems more accidental than planned. The old Belgarath was more fun: the rootless vagabond who drank too much, gambled, chased women (&quot;wenching&quot; - only Eddings could use the term with such aplomb), pocketed things that interested him. The old Belgarath sat in smoky taverns drinking himself into high spirits while he winked at passing barmaids. Since BtS was obviously written after the local Temperance League got their hands on Eddings, we learn that Belgarath wasn't really drinking... he was just making it LOOK like he was. He was only pretending to be drunk so the scary Murgos wouldn't notice him. He wasn't really winking at the pretty barmaids, he was just blinking from all the soot in the air. He wasn't really snoozing in the saddle, he was actually calculating the number of blankets he would need to keep the army warm. His stained, worn, mismatched clothing wasn't accumulated through travels and travails but was carefully designed by the best tailors on the continent. While this new true Belgarath may be politically correct, the old one was more entertaining. The idea of the most powerful sorcerer in the world having numerous flaws and vices made him more believable. Remember, Polgara feared that Belgarath would be a bad influence on the young ones. He wasn't perfect. Well he is now, except for having fewer working brain cells. As strange as this may sound, I felt betrayed.Eddings strains with some of the other major characters in the book. Just because Fulrach and Anheg, Silk and Barak behaved in certain ways shouldn't mean all of their ancestors behaved the same way. Some were indistinguishable from their descendants. On the other hand, the various Salmissras were almost caricaturish in their differences.The Eddings Duo kept their smooth writing style present in the previous ten, and the humor is as sharp as always. When I finished BtS I went back and reread the entire Ten, and alas, Belgarath wasn't the same exciting character I had loved for years."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I have read this book before many times and was replacing it after loaning it out and never receiving it back.

Its wry humour and great storytelling style make it a definite page-turner, despite a few qualms I had with Belgaraths' little 'asides' to the reader - amusing to begin with, but a few of his quips fell short with me. However, overall, an extremely enjoyable read.However, I must add a word of warning to potential readers out there. A lot of reviewers have been recommending Belgarath the Sorcerer as a good way to start on the Belgariad and Mallorean series - it IS a nice summary of the world Eddings has created but some people might want to avoid it until they have read the other series as this book reveals many of the plot-twists which, for me, made the Belgariad and Mallorean so enjoyable. Eddings' device of starting and ending this book with episodes from Garions' current life, set after Seeress of Kell, is a good idea but it means that a new reader will quickly find out what happens to the gang in the end - if you're the kind of person who flicks to the ends of books anyway then that's alright, but if you want to save the surprises for later then don't read this book yet! A friend of mine picked up Belgarath the Sorcerer before reading the other books and was disappointed that she then knew what was going to happen to Garion and his friends. Also, the world-building which came quite gradually in the Belgariad and Mallorean is now crammed into one book here, and I think many of the references to events in the other novels would be lost on new readers here, especially towards the end of this book when emphasis is heavily on the background of characters such as Silk, Barak and Garion.Overall, a great book, but you'll get more out of it if you've read Eddings' previous works already!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"If you are one of the many fans of \\"The Belgariad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\", here is another treat for you. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading those wonderful epic fantasy series, make yourself a favour and read them before tackling \\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\". You can thank me later for introducing you to a wonderful new imaginary world and to likeable characters :)\\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\" starts just where \\"The Malloreon\\" ended, that is the book \\"Seeress of Kell\\". And, strangely enough, it is nothing less than Belgarath's autobiography. As those who have read the series already know, Belgarath is a notoriously lazy sorcerer, probably the least likely person to feel the need to write his story. Unless someone compels him to do so, of course. But to know who or what could do that to an all-powerful sorcerer, you must read this book.What is in it for you?. Well, lots of fun, and the opportunity to know how things really started, from the point of view of one of the main characters in the series. You get to accompany Belgarath from his birth in the small village of Gara, to the fateful day when he met Aldur and became first his pupil and then his disciple. In case you are as curious as me, you will also be grateful to know that this book will allow you to learn more about Belgarath's family, and to live wondrous adventures with him and his friends.Personally, I found the opportunity of \\"living\\" the things I had merely read about in the previous books specially rewarding. The fact that Belgarath's memories span thousands of years gives the reader the opportunity of gaining a good perspective on all the things that happened, thus preparing him to read the previous books in the series in a different way. A warning is in order, though. If you haven't read the previously mentioned books, this book has big-time spoilers, so please don't risk ruining the surprises those series have for you. Do first things first, and read \\"The Belgariad\\" and \\"The Malloreon\\" before \\"Belgarath the sorcerer\\".All in all, I loved reading this book, and I highly recommend it to those who aren't ready to leave the world of Belgarath and his friends. Enjoy it!Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath The Sorcerer is more or less Belgarath's view and explanation of events which led up to the start of The Belgariad, which began with the book Pawn of Prophecy. The reader will find most of this story quite familiar in that Eddings has rehashed much of the information which was presented in the previously mentioned series. Granted, there are new twists and new detailed information, but the story is the same. Many of the characters in this new book are the very same characters we find with our original reading of the series. Now some have found this to be a bad thing. I personally rather enjoyed it. I make no bones about it, nor do I apologize for being a big fan of Eddings (and as we now know, Leigh Eddings, his wife). As I have mentioned in my previous reviews, these are comfort books for me. I read them for relaxation. The author has even used many of the tired old jokes, which are actually sort of funny, in this work as well as most of the settings and situations we have come to expect.As mentioned before, with the first ten books I have been able to identify 233 errors the author made (hey, I even have my books cross referenced). With this work, I am able to add even more errors! While this may seem a bit compulsive/obsessive (which indeed, it probably is, well too bad...I enjoy it and plan to continue the hobby). We are not talking typos, punctuation and such; we are talking major errors in plot and facts. This is a wonderful game and I love it. For me it does not distract from the story one bit, and in fact makes it sort of charming.This work, like the previous works from which it was taken, moves right along, and while quite predictable, for the most part, is still a very interesting read and great fun to just enjoy. The author can tell a good story and he does hold my interest. Again, this is not for every one. If you did not enjoy the first ten books of the series, then you will probably not enjoy this one. Actually, I cannot for the life of me figure out why someone who hated the previous books, forked out good money for more of the same...go figure.If you are a fan of Belgarath and crew, then you will quite likely enjoy this read, if you are not...Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I thought this thick book would be at worst repeating things already mentioned in the saga, as the style of Eddings is similar to fairytales rather than an attempt for a realistic feeling world, and the stereotypes (particularly describing the various peoples and cultures) he already created in books 1 to 5 were repeated enough as it is. I was right about that, he repeats some things but generally speaking 90 percent of this book is all new material, as the history from Belgarath's point of view.I had a great deal of good laughs; the book has a slower pace and allows for greater detail at points, but Eddings spares us a lot of boredom and still manages to capture not only great events but also everyday life. Robert Jordan could learn a thing or two from Eddings even though he might have greater talent."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I own all the books from the Belgariad and Mallorean series + Polgara and the Rivan Codex and this books fits perfectly with the entire collection.The book follows the life of Belgarath and how he became the legend he is, from the time he was born in the village of Gara, to the meeting with Aldur, cracking of the world...and so on. There may be some slight inconsistencies....but it was deliberate because Belgarath is telling the story from HIS point of view and how things really happen. Some folks maybe disapointed about how certain events are actually duller than what was learned from the two previous series. But thats the idea! Legends are always exaggerated and when the truth is told, people are upset.The interesting thing about the story is that Belgarath tried his best to keep the story down to earth as possible. Instead of the usual mystical mumbo jumbo, everything is laid out as if your own buddy was telling you the story.Overall, I think its a great read and will answer a lot of unanswered questions from the two series."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is a must for readers of the Belgariad and the Malloreon. It is well written and humorous, yet there is sorrow here too - the apparent death of Belgarath's wife, Poledra and the loss of his two sorcerer brothers, Belsambar and Belmakor (although the latter is not clearly explained). Although written after the Belgariad and the Malloreon, new readers would do well to read Belgarath the Sorcerer first, as this will greatly facilitate their understanding of the later series. Belgarath himself is a likeable character, full of human weaknesses and foibles despite his enormous power, and the continual bickerings between himself and his rather straight-laced daughter, Polgara, are delightful. He is lazy, lackadaisical and often untrustworthy, but he fulfils his destiny completely, and his love for his master, the god Aldur, is very moving. A great story about a great character, whom you will come to regard as a friend when you finally lay down this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"For anyone who has fallen as deeply in love with the Belgariad and the Mallorean as I have will truly cherish and enjoy this book. Told from the straight from the heart of the centuries-old, wise, witty, overdramatic and altogether lovable sorcerer Belgarath, the Old Wolf, this novel is a captivating and entertaining novel that expands on the beginnings of Eddings' world. Throughout the book we are introduced to the first people, and the first gods that roamed at the beginning of time, and the marvelous events and prophecy that lead up to the stories of the Belgariad and Mallorean. We finally are given a history of Belgarath's remarkable beginnings, from the small vilage of Gara, to his first encounter with Aldur and the other disciples, to the Breaking of the World, and onwards, following his footsteps in all the adventures and exploits that he experienced even before Garion was born. We finally are able to appreciate and realize the depth and intellect of the often shabby Old Wolf through his experiences and dialogues, and are able to hop right into his shoes and personally get to know the other characters whose presence is pivotal in directing the flow of time. Eddings ties together many loose ends and allows us to understand the many facets of Belgarath's life, from being the shabby old story teller to being the most powerful sorcerer in the world, able to instil awe and fear in so many ('Grat is not nice!). This book lacks nothing and is rich in depth, articulate and descriptive writing, and is peppered with the classic dry humour and penetrating wit that Eddings has mastered, and will keep you enthralled and laughing for ages."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath. One simple word. A word that means so much. To an ordinary man, Belgarath is nothing. To an Eddings fan, Belgarath is everything. From the start of the Belgariad, through to the end of the Malloreon, he was there, as were you...the reader. This book is an &quot;answer all questions&quot; type of read. It's basically the tale of how he became the figure that he currently is. It begins early in life and progresses through many, many years of EVENTS. Encounters with Aldur, Beldin, Polgara, Chamdar and of course Torak are all chronicled. The significance of many of the EVENTS are explained. The style in which the book is written captivates you from the start. It is indeed a page-turner filled with sadness, anger, joy, and even humour. The autobiographical feel was also something appealing. Belgarath even hints at who really runs the world, and his opinion gets you thinking. Mr. Eddings has done it again and I look forward to any future works of his, as all his past are masterpieces. If you've even wondered &quot;why?&quot; acquire this book. If you've ever wondered &quot;who?&quot; acquire this book. Or, if you just want a good read, acquire this book and you'll see why the Eddings duo are the true sorcerers of the literary world."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"If you are looking for fantasy that is fun, pure escapism and easy to read, over and over again, then Eddings is it. Predictable - yes, unbelievable - yes, but fun. Enjoyable and a light way to lose yourself into something that is not quite real to take you away into another world - which is exactly what fantasy fiction is supposed to do."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Well, this book takes off immediately (I MEAN the same second) after &quot;THE SEERESS OF KELL&quot; and than it goes WAY back. I had the luck to start this right after I finished SEERESS and I must say that it is a nice broadening of the Belgariad/Malloreon series. No, I didn't want to know everything that happend before Garion and his friends left Faldors Farm, I just enjoyed this book because it is a pretty good read and on par with the other works of Eddings (or, as we know now: the both Eddings). People who liked the aforementioned series should definitely read this: It has the same tone and the same style as the other books, only the structure is a little bit different. Well, as you can guess now, I loved it. NOW, some warnings: People who read the BEL/MAL series and want something new, should skip this. The next point: Although this book was conceived as a stand-alone-novel, it isn't. Or it doesn't succeed. I would not recommend this book to readers who haven't read the BELGARIAD / MALLOREON series. Unless &quot;you know your way around&quot; this particular world, you will be confused by this wide array of characters, countries, kings, queens and gods - this book does not work as a guide - it expects you to know already at least something about this world. Furthermore: You'll not understand the numerous side-remarks to the characters from the other novels which Belgarath, the fictional author of this novel, inserted between the tale. You can ignore them, but then you'll miss most of the fun. Finally, a warning to all readers, Eddings-Fans and new ones alike: This book starts REALLY slow. Don't let the first 100-200 pages discourage you, this book GETS BETTER and is a lot of fun. Polgara, I'm waiting for your tale now.."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is really great, I love it, but there are a few too many errors in context and references to the two book series' this is based on."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"David Eddings has truly outdone himself this time with Belgarath the Sorcerer. the Belgariad was the most awesome series, and the book that followed it was something else. DO NOT READ THIS BEFORE THE BELGARIAD BOOKS! If you do, you just ruined the whole plot and surprise. Life stories, humor, everything! Even the races and names were original, and the gods? Great! (By the way, I reall want to know how David and Leigh came up with all of these wierd..no eccentric names.) After reading all of the books, my friends and I gave each other names ie, my friend who got me started is Belgarath, But Beldin is absolutely the greatest of all. (Me) Every one loved it, and I even got my little brother to read the books. When I started the Belgariad for the second time, nobody understood me. Do You? Any way the Book is the best I probably will ever read, and if you agree or disagree, write to me.

It's great!If you agree or are dumb enough to disagree, WRITE! (to Jason)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I recently discovered David Eddings, and before I finished the first book, I was at the library looking for others. This book wasn't the best he wrote but very close. It answers all these questions about events that happened thousands of years before Belgarion. It is rich in feeling and I could hardly put it down. It is a wildly hilarious, witty story of Belgarath who is one of my favorite characters. It also gives you a real insight to who Belgarath is, and how he sacrificed himself for the Prophecy."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath was a great book. I truly explained the story behind Belgarion, Polgara, and Belgarath. It explained where things came from and it also gave you a better perspective of Belgarath. David Eddings is an excellent author who should add to this grand adventure!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Once you have read the Belgariad series, this book perfectly rounds off every little question you have. If you are an Eddings fan, you have to read this book."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"For those of you who have read the Belgariad and the Mallorean, this book is a must. It clears the cobwebs away from the dim past of one of modern fantasy's most intriguing characters. As Eddings eleborates each characters history, we see how they came to have the quirks we find in his series'. This book brings Belegarath into a more understandable and somewhat more human light.Eddings continues to lace his books with his characteristically dry and witty humor. A Must Read for all Eddings fans!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"i have read all of the belgariad series and just started the mallorea series. this is the best book out of all of edding's work."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I am a big david eddings fan and i can say this book is really , really good!!!

I love fantasy books and this is my all time favorite except for Polgara the Sorceress. I think it's great that he wrote the story from Belgarath's point of view. I hope he writes many more books that are as good as this one! READ THIS BOOK IT'S EXCELLENT!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Let me start off simple. I liked this book. While it will not satisfy that demon in you that wants realism and balltes and betrayal that is believable, it is a rather humorous account that spans an incredible amount of time, which is interesting, being read by us humans who have so little of it in the scheme of things. Eddings manages to contain well-placed humor and seriousness within this book that draws you in. While Belgarath the Sorceror will not go down in history as one of the best fantasy books, neither will it's author, who is normally only meager at best. But this is quite realistically one of his greatest works and worth a look."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I really liked this book. It had some good humor in it. I haven't read the all of the Belgariad and the Malloreon yet, but I Will! I recommend this book very highly. I like how we find out the origins of Zedar, Mandorallen, Lelldorin, Riva, and Company. I was quite surprised to discover Belsambar and Belmakor. READ THIS BOOK!!! :) The Sphynx"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Reading this particular novel made me think of how creative Mr. Eddings must be to be able to grab my imagination and hold onto it. He's taken Terry Brooks and Tolkien and merged them into one hell of a roaring adventure, MORE Mr. Eddings, MORE!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book filled in a lot of the gaps and elaborated on many of the things implied but never fully explained in &quot;THE BELGARIAD&quot; and &quot;THE MALLOREAN&quot; series.

David Eddings knows how to capture a reader and keep them hooked. Any other book to follow these are &quot;gravy on the readers table&quot;."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I loved it! I also loved the Mallorean and Belgariad set that preceded this book. I haven't read Polgara yet... I want to though. I think that David and Leigh should write books about Silk and Barak, Relg and Taiba and all the rest of them. Especially Beldin and Poledra. I liked them the best. Oh and I liked Ce'Nedra too but I don't think they should write her life story. It would be kind of short.Written by an aspiring author with VERY GOOD TASTE IN BOOKS. ( I like them all.):)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"What an absolutely fabulous book. I truly enjoyed it and appreciated the fact that David Eddings gave us a precursor to the Belgariad and Malorean. Like one of the reviewers noted however, please don't read this before the other series, it will make them a little less exciting. His inconsistancies in style have to do with the flow of the story. Some of the chapters end rather abruptly and take up rather later in the book; it's sometimes difficult to keep up. As a female reader however, I am more attracted to the female characters, thus when Polgara came out (it's not out in paperback yet, next year), I had to have it. Now that is a 5 star story."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I love this book. Even when I reread it I loved it.And I don't think anythings going to change that.Its partly the magic in it. Also, I like Polgara (the person) besides just liking Belgarath . I was surprised and glad to find out that she had her own whole section.Anyway, someone who has read The Belgariad should read Belgarath The Sorcerer."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"My sister first introduced me to the Belgariad when I was 7. I had often laughed at her for sitting for weeks on end, burried in those books... I finaly found out why. Finding myself instantainiously gripped by the story, and all the wonderful characters, such as; (Bel)Garion, Polgara, Belgarath... and so on and so on... I ended up not beeing able to go anywhere without my precious books... which is the main reason why I have had to replace them each about 4 times...I simply read them to pieces...One day, shopping with my parents, I suddently saw this book. I spent the rest of the day hopping around it, hoping my parents would buy it...and at last they did.Now, I have made it my life goal to buy the whole series, as I havent read the Malloreon yet. I am looking forward to once again be gripped by the tale... to once again let the thoughts flow... to immagine beeing that little boy in Sendaria...suddently dragged off to the end of the world and back...in search of a stone...I can't wait.A word of warning though, Once you have read one book, YOU HAVE TO READ THEM ALL! RESISTENCE IS FUTILE! Kind regards Yago"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Eddings is one of my favorite fantasy authors. His books are interesting and don't contain some of the obscure and boring sections that plague many fantasy novels. I expected this to be fairly long-winded, considering its length compared to his other novels, but it was surprisingly interesting. Anyone interested should read the Belgariad and Mallorean first, because the book is filled with comments that first time readers won't understand. If you've read the series and liked it, you've probably picked up this book already."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is probably one of the best books I've read. Surpassed maybe by Polgara the Sorceress. This book introduced me to the world invented by David and Leigh Eddings, and I've read every other book by them since. Belgarath is so incredibly well written that at times I found myself cracking up, usually while at school. Other times I wanted to cry, the characters are described so well that I find myself feeling what they feel, and hoping what they hope. Even though the paperback version has around 800 pages, I can read it in a weekend if I really get into it."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The book Belgarath the Sorceror is a very enchanting book. If you like a book that has adventure, lore, theivery and magic then you would like any book written by David Eddings. I have read many of his books but this one is by far the greatest. It talks of the universe's destiny and how this one man and his family( Polgara, the twins and Polara) can keep an entire world in order. This book talks of magic, sailing, fighting and my favorite, thievery. There are many fun characters and many gruesome battles. There are also some sad parts but overall it's still magnificient."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book gives us an outline of Belgarath's life. Of course, due to his age (7000 years), we do not read about every little thing that ever happened to him. It presents a balanced portrait of the man. While it informs us on the many good deeds he has performed, it also shows us the dark side of his character. We are shown that despite his great power and the unbelieveable adventures he has had, Belgarath is just as human as the rest of us. The best example of this, is his reaction to the deatjh of his wife. It is written in the form of his memoirs, and the book is infused with a great sense of humour. You wiil keep turning the pages of this well crafted novel until you reach the end, then you will turn back to page 1 and begin again."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"It fully explained Belgarath's life, the history of the world, and left enough gaps to make you want to read the sequal, &quot;Polgara: The Sorceress&quot;, just to see what he forgot after all those years."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is a great book. Not only for story, but in its characters. Eddings creates characters that are believable, and likeable. Their conversation gets to the point that you feel like your listening to friends talk, and sometimes you even know how they are going to react to one another. One thing i enjoyed about this book was the fact that it was written in the style of Belgarath, not in Eddings own style. His asides and apologies to the readers (most notably C'Nedra) cracked me up. Anyhow, do yourself a favor and read The Belgariad and the Mallorean if you already haven't, then make sure to read this. It is definitely worth your time."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Written in the first person, the book chronicles the life of Belgarath from his days prior to becoming a disciple of Aldur up to the time that the Belgariad starts, i.e. when Polgara is working on Faldor's Farm.The story unfolds in the form of Belgarath writing his memoirs. The reader is reminded of the memoir format throughout the story through &quot;in-jokes&quot; and references which only those who have read the Belgariad and Mallorean will understand. These jokes do not detract from the story. As Belgarath tells his life story, we learn in more depth just how and why Riva Iron Grip's line became the guardians of the orb, the history of the Alorn and Angarak nations, Belgarath and Polgara's love-hate relationship, the necessity (a/k/a &quot;the dry voice&quot; in Garion's head), and personal backgrounds of the disciples of Aldur (Beldin, the twins, et al.), and why the Chereks are a sea faring people. We also learn interesting things about Poledra, Torak, Eriond! ! , and Zedar. Furthermore we see just how Belgarath and Polgara have had a major and minor hand in shaping the world in preparation for the Belgariad.Written in the same breezy style and humor as the rest of the series, I found the book to be quick reading. Overall I really enjoyed the book and found myself laughing out loud in several parts. It's a definate must read for anyone who wants to further understand the 7,000 year war of the gods as well as the life of (in my opinion) a beloved and enduring character in fantasy/science fiction literature."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"If you loved the Belgariad series, followed by the Mallorean series and wished you could spend more time with these characters in this special world, this is a fabulous read.As others will say, Eddings isn't the most gifted writer, however this makes his books readable for all ages from teens on up and he has such a great sense of charm, most find themselves hopelessly caught up in the story and characters. Eddings spent a great deal of thought and time creating this world he's taken us on an extended tour of, and it shows.I was sad at the end of The Mallorean, figuring I'd come to the end of the story and had to say farewell to Belgarath and his extended family. After a few years, I decided to give this book a try and was very pleased.The book probably only 'deserves' 4 stars based on its literary merits but I just couldn't help myself. >;^)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I've loved Eddings' writing for years, so I greeted the arrival of this book with utter glee. It certainly didn't disappoint, either. It rehashed some parts, yes. But these parts were either so exciting I didn't mind, went into greater detail, or showed events from a whole new perspective ( Belgarath's slightly amoral but funny view, as opposed to Polgara's outraged understanding of events, or more often, Garion's befuddled and innocent take.) I understood, for the first time, the origins of beliefs, traditions, and anger-filled rivalries in this wonderful universe of David Eddings. I'd say it's a great read for those just getting into the series, old fans who want to return, or anyone who likes good, old-fashioned fantasy"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"For those of you who have encountered a David Eddings novel before, the excellent quality will come as no surprise.For those of you who have never read any of his novels, I would recommend you take the phone off the hook and make no plans.His subtle style takes you into the story and tends to make you late for appointments. If you are lucky enough to pick-up his latest offering on a weekend, make certain that someone will come over to make you the occasional meal and turn you over from time to time.Most novels look at one particular time in the protagonist's life (usually during some crisis) and tell the tale of what that person did. If the author is a really good storyteller, the reader will also have some idea of the reasons why or if the reasons are unclear, the reader will want to find out why. This book takes the reader back to a time before the events of the first books and gives us some of this insight into the non-hero characters.Oh sure, Mr. Eddings is not the first to try this, but he does it better than TSR, that's for sure.In the original series, Belgarath does something fairly nasty to one of the &quot;bad guys&quot; and I was left wondering if what he did was really necessary and I wondered if that behaviour was consistent with the character. Having read more about Belgarath, I now sympathize and feel better about what he did. It may sound like a little thing, but it just goes to show you what a novel like this does to people.Keep up the good work Mr. Eddings!!!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book was brilliant! I'd waited for this for so long! It answered so many of those unanswered questions. Sure, the story went over some things, but did so in such a brilliant and funny way, I felt instantly closer to Belgarath. I cried in some parts (When Poledra &quot;died&quot;), laughed in some parts (The funny narrative by &quot;The Ancient One&quot;himself) and was angry in others (When Torak did very evil things). This is definately the kind of writing we have come to expect from David Eddings, and his wife, Leigh. I think everyone who has read any of Edding's book should read this NOW"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath's barbed comments and muses in both THE BELGARIAD and THE MALLOREAN left you wondering what had made his view on life so jaded. BELGARATH THE SORCERER answered most, but not all, of the questions left by the two series. (If all questions were answered, where would that leave the Eddings couple if they wanted to write another companion book to this storyline?) Those who have not read THE BELGARIAD and/or THE MALLOREAN may have a hard time following Belgarath's comments to the reader, but if they are looking to &quot;feel out&quot; the story, this is a good way. I recommend a babysitter (if you have kids), your favorite munchies, getting comfortable and letting yourself be swept away in an enchanting story by two superb authors"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is one of the best by Eddings. It tells all about when Belgrath was growing up and how the different races followed their god. It tells how the gods fought and how Torak split the world. Also the life of the orb. This book is the best I have read and I have read it many times. So if you want a book with action, romance, and edge of your chair excitment buy this book. If you don't you will miss a lot of fun"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The talented and usually infuriating Belgarath the Sorcerer tells of his fantastic lifetime in this wonderfully written book by David and Leigh Eddings. It had all the qualities a fantasy book calls for- suspense, adventure, humor, and the occasional teary moment. An absolutely fabulous work of art"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"As one who awaited the ending books of both the Belgariad and the Malloreon for what seemed an eternity, I also awaited BELGARATH anxiously. I found the historical view of the Old Wolf's life and times enlightening, interesting and at times hilarious. Belgarath's parenthetical comments to his &quot;audience&quot; were well worth the price of admission.Still, somehow, the closure of the book somehow left me dry. Even though Eddings neatly tied off almost every loose end left behind at the ending of the Malloreon, the end of BELGARATH left a definite impression of incompletion.Will there be a POLGARA THE SORCERESS? I hope so. Will it be as satisfying as the Belgariad or the Malloreon? Honestly, I can't see how."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"A couple years ago I picked up THE BELGARIAD books....and read them all within a month. Ditto THE MALLOREON. I became an Eddings fan overnight. BELGARATH THE SORCERER is a delightful companion to the two series, and should be read after enjoying the ten other books. The switch to first-person narrative works splendidly (I hope the Eddingses continue that format with Polgara's history) and the humor, always a treat in an Eddings book, is even sharper here. The Old Wolf's fiendishness is here in technicolor as he explains a lot of the pre-history for which there was no room in the two earlier series....What exactly were the Accords of Vo Mimbre? Why isn't there a country called Aloria? Where did the Darine and Mrin codexes come from? It's all there, with a minimum amount of tedium. It's like spending an evening with the Ancient One over a tankard of ale while he tells tales as only he can. Bravo"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Husband &amp; wife team finally reveal that they have both been authors of all the books! In Belgarath they provide fans with insight into the Eternal Man and how he came to be. Humorous, insightful, entertaining and above all, comfortable - like a visit with old friends. Readers get to see aspects of the distinguished, regal Polgara when she was a child with dirty knees climbing trees. I strongly recommend this book to readers of the Eddings' other two series, but not to first time readers - Check out the Belgariad first. One big disappointment was that the sex of Polgara's twins has not yet been revealed!! I guess we'll just have to wait for the next book...Polgara the Sorceress"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This was the first Eddings book I had ever read. It got a little confusing here and there as I hadn't read the Belgariad yet. However, the gaps didn't become apparent until the end of the book and even then, they were passable....if barely.Eddings gives life to Belgarath who is now firmly my favourite character. In this book, you get to see how Belgarath's mind works and what he feels of other people while listening to his witty comments about this and that.I've read this book at least three times in the past six months as it is quite a good reference to check up with the Belgariad. It may sometimes get a little boring but there is usually some humour in the form of the narration, or one of the other characters.There's still a couple of gaps for Eddings to use for his next book Polgara the Sorceress and if it's anything like this, I'm definitely getting out there to buy it as soon as possible....well at least as soon as I can scrape up the money to anyway..."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The book said nothing new and the characters tend to irritate after a while, but what I really want to comment on is some of the other reviews from British readers.

I enjoyed his charactersbut wished for versatility. This book is, in my humble opinion,is a rehash of writing style and story content. Readers like myselfwho have paid good money for these series and who (maybe) are willing to do thesame for (BETTER QUALITY) deserve more. AND if you(David Eddings) really want ato expand your royalty base, try writting from an MULTICULTRUAL VIEWPOINT!!!!!Instead of involving only Caucasoid people who live in different counties in the Western part ofYOUR World, try an African, Latino, and/or Native American flavor.(Maybe the main characters aren't blond and blue-eyed but wise, gifted, and dark skinned)Teach your readers as well as yourself that others exist too. *****Give the new flavors the same respect givento Belgarath, Garion, Sparhawk, Sephrina, and Polgara in your writtings. In otherwords, &quot;Be Nice&quot; butmore imaginative."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The Belgariad began with a wonderful, original and insightful story, with unique characters who had a vast potential for personality growth. By the time Eddings reaches Belgarath the Sorcerer, however, the quality has plummeted into nothing more than trite, overused words filling the pages. The story itself had so much potential, but the writing and characters were written so poorly that the book was difficult to read without becoming frustrated. The author attempts to make the narrative amusing with smart comments and the like, but what this actually achieves is making Belgarath the sorcerer, the powerful, insightful, complex man, into a peevish, cranky, one-dimensional character. What's more, the characters have all become flat and dull - the dialogue that springs from the mouth of any character could just as easily come from any other, with its weak attempts at sharp tongued witticisms and hopeless characterization. All females are portrayed as manipulative; all males are portrayed as hot tempered lunkheads. Do yourself a favour: If you enjoyed the belgariad, don't bother with this book as it will ruin the entire experience for you."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"David Eddings is one of the rare breed of writers. Not a very good one, in my humble opinion, but an excellent storyteller and always one to weave a yarn worthy of a plane ride or a quick escape to fantasyland.I read The Belgariad when I had a cold and winced/giggled all the way through. Similarly, I made my way through all five books of The Mallorean enjoying the characters and the story line.Eddings is far from a horrible writer, but he's definitely a mass-market writer, not a genius of prose. However, when I tried to tackle Belgarath The Sorcerer, I had to admit defeat. Long winded and repetititive, Belgarath reads like the memoirs of an annoying uncle who is so captivated by himself that all stories revolve around him.If one is familiar with the character from Eddings' series at all, one knows enough of Belgarath to skip this book. There is nothing new or interesting, style wise, to warrant this book. As a history of Belgarath, I suppose this could be interesting to the die hard fan who MUST know everything about the world Eddings has created.As a reader who is mildly OCD, I feel compelled to finish what I start, no matter how badly written. Once I start a series, I feel compelled to finish it, even if I wasn't that fond of the first book. There are few exceptions to this rule, but Belgarath The Sorcerer is one of them.Unless you are the type of reader who has to slavishly follow everything a writer ever puts out, I can't recommend Belgarath to you. Stick with The Belgariad and, possibly, The Mallorean. The interaction of all Eddings' characters is really where he shines. These side ventures into the individual stories behind some of them just don't serve him well."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I enjoyed this book, as it brought back a lot of the memories of the Belgariad and Mallorean which I'd read 10+ years ago and enjoyed tremendously.There were a few inconsistancies between this book and the original series, especially with the character of Belgarath himself. I'm currently reading &quot;Polgara the Sorceress&quot; and find the same true there. In the original series, Belgarath is THE legend, the eternal man, almost holy in many cultures. In this book, you finally see that despite being 7000 years old, he's still a little slow and requires almost constant input from &quot;the Necessity&quot; or Aldur to be able to do anything. Seldom does he do anything clever on his own, and he frequently depends on the stupidity of his enemies (Torak, Urvon, Zedar etc...) to succeed.This destroyed some of my image of the character and it's just due to lazy writing. I get the distinct impression that most of this material was written before the first series of books (in proto form anyway) just to give background to this one character. This is fine, but it takes a lot of work to make a character intelligent, and you just don't see this here. A 7000 year old man should have unique perspective, be enormously clever and outwit practically everyone. That would have been too hard to do however, so you have to see the 7000 year old man who's pretty much just like everyone else. It succeeds in the first book because Belgarath is rarely the main character and the story isn't told directly by him (i.e. first person).Still, if you liked the Belgariad, you really can't fail with this book, most of the history is at least somewhat entertaining, especially the initial calling of the diciples of Aldur to the Vale. I found that most interesting."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This could have been a cool story. Could have. That is, if it weren't so liberally punctuated with the bad humor that has become Eddings' trademark. We don't really get to know the characters, with the exception of only a few scenes, and the story is just one rehashing of Belgarath and Polgara being Great Sorcerers after another. Boring. The more he extends a series, the worse it gets (same with Sparhawk). So stick with the books from the beginning."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I loved this book. I've read all of the Belgariad and the Mallorean books and never get tired of re-reading any of them."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I can not believe that people who have read the Belgariad can say that this book is &quot;brilliant&quot;, &quot;magnificent&quot; or that this is the &quot;best work of Eddings yet&quot;. They must have read a different edition than I. To me, this book was an unexiting recount of happenings that we already knew took place. There is absolutely zero character development in the story (except for Polgara's sudden change of appearence) for any of the other players, in fact Eddings makes a great effort to show that characters stay the same over the centuries in the families. The humour of the book is very repetitive and is tiring after the first 100 pages. In the Belgariad, Belgarath goes into great pains not to reveal to others (especially Garion) what forces are at work. In this book, he distributes this information freely to everyone, making people do his bidding by saying that an &quot;EVENT&quot; is taking place. I agree with the opinion of one of the previous readers, all over the story it feels as if this book has been written by someone else. WARNING: Do not read this book before reading the Belgariad and the Malloreon. (all other books are far-far better anyway)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book was enjoyable and gives insight into Belgarath's character, but it's merit should not be confused with such fantasy greats as Wheel of Time and Lord of the Rings. The detail leaves much to be desired. Having read all but two of Eddings books, I have found that he is not the most adept of authors at creating characters or scenery. This book rambles from place to place, building the groundwork for the Belgariad, which is only slightly better written. The minor characters and places are terrible to keep track of, and the assurance that these murdering, thieving, scamming protagonists are ultimately good leaves one skeptical."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"After reading the Belgariad and while waiting for the Mallorean to publish in two volumes, I read this book. I'm not much of a fan or reader of fanatasy, but I've enjoyed this series greatly. Outstanding character development and good action make this series very readable and tough to put down. Belgarath The Sorcerer provides details that support the overall series. I'm working on the Mallorean now. I'm not looking forward to seeing this series completed after spending so much time reading all the books."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I always like Belegarath from his sense of dry humor to his ability to tell great stories. Well this book was his greatest of all his stories and helped fill in alot of gaps which where left out previous to Pawn of Prophecy. I hope Eddings writes Beldin the Hunchbacked or something like that I think that would be the best individual personal history story ever. I would like to see from other people who write reviews after me name a Sorcerer they would like to have a book written after."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Sarcastic, profane,slovenly, sometimes drunk, doesnt have perfect grooming habits and dress's badly, these are some of the descriptions that fit Belgarath. This book details the events that made him \\"The Eternal Man\\". Possibly the best conceived sorcerer in literature, Belgarath will certainly take a seat in history next to Gandorf, Obe-one, and Maadi. Some have complained that the book has \\"slow\\" spots. Well thats kinda like life, years of boredom, sixty seconds of terror. If every second of every day was heart stopping, even Belgarath would eventually give up. What I really liked was the fact that this book could stand alone. Even if I had never read the Belgarid/Mallorean series, I would have still enjoyed and understood this book. It has found a permanent place in my collection of \\"Keepers\\". I highly reccommend this book to everyone."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath the Sorcerer, tells the story of the first of Aldur's disciples, and his perspective on the importance of his family throughout time as they attempt to help set the universe straight after the purpose split at the early time.From his time as an orphan child, to the rise of Eriond as the newest of the gods, to replace the deceased Torak, you're given an interesting perspective on things that is far from the tightly orderly mind of his daughter Polgara, or the wandering mind of his grandson Garion.The only thing I wait for with this series, is the possibility of the Eddings' writing a book telling the story of Beldin, the twisted little 'cousin' of Belgarath."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I read this book first before buying the Mallorean and Belgariad series. I'm glad I did. This book makes you wonder and think of the characters. Infact, at the end the end of this book, i was so shocked of how it ended! THAT'S what made me get the series and also the Polagra book! I just HAD to know how it began and ended. I love an author that can do that to his readers!This book is a great overview of the 2 series! His portrayal of Belgarath is very comical and heartwarming. Whenever i need a good book, i'm sure to pick up and reread this book or start the series all over again.This book is made to delight the reader. If you are inclined to dissect a book and its author, then you need to relax and let yourself go with this book. This book will let you wonder and feel that you are with Belgarath."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is really only for those that have already read the Belgariad and Mallorian series. It tells the tale of the Great Belgarath from thief to &quot;holy man&quot;. It really isn't an exiting read but it's well writen and the plot (if you can call it that) is well laid out, but lacks any punch. It has the thinks that always bothers me in all of Eddings work and that is repetativnes, same jokes and characters tend to say the same thing (if somebody says a word that doesn't exist then the others always say something like &quot;Gee I wish I could make upp word like that&quot; and so on). I wish that he could think of new dialogs. Theres nothing new or original in this book but some times it's good to read a tried and tested formula specialy when it involves some of ones favorite fictional charachters.If you have already read Eddings other works then this is a must, if not the give it a miss.."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarion bullied his grandfather into writing the missing tale of what happened before the Belgariad and Malloreon series, and like Garion himself, I was very curious about Belgarath's life. The book therefore did not dissapoint me! David and Leigh Eddings are now at a true literary level with their writing, for besides even their great style of writing, they can capture readers and make them part of the lives of their characters.Every fase from Belgarath's life was different and intriguing and like the sorcerer himself, you're sorry when they are over. But new times bring new thrills and even as Belgarath experiences for himself, one time will replace the next. His peaceful time in the Vale was replaced by his friendship with Cherek and his sons; the loss of his wife was compensated by his daughter Polgara, whom he had to educate.Belgarath is a wonderful, complex character and when you read this book, it's like hearing him tell the story to you in person!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"After reading the Belgariad and the Mallorean series, this book takes you back to the beginning of it all. It explains the origins of the young man who becomes Belgarath, and skirts the edges of the Brotherhood of Sorcerers. It also nicely fills in the gaps from the beginning to the battle of Vo Mimbre. A great book for the Fantasy reader, and I highly recommend the series."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"In my opinion this book was more or less unbeatable, but as i said thats my opinion. If you dont like heavy reading, i suggest you read the Belgariad and Mallorian first. in Belgarath the sorceror there are a lot of names to remember,and the belgariad introduces these at a lesser extent so you can actually remember what its telling you!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is the first book I have read by Eddings, and I find it absolutely difficult to put down. Of course I had to read the other books by Eddings after coursing through this book, and I found the rest just as great. Anyway, the plot and everything are highly imaginative, though it doesn't ruin it for people who haven't read the other. I highly recommend this book because it is fascinating, imaginative, and definitely addictive."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I have the belgariad and mallorean series as well as the companion volumes and the rivan codex. I just finished this book for the third time and it's still funny. This book is the past 7000 years as seen through belgarath's eyes it offers a great deal of fleshing out characters such as Aldur, Cherek, Torak, Beldin, The twins, Polgara, Poledra, Belar, the salmirrissas, and a whole host of characters. If you liked this book you should trying reading Polgara the sorceress."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is not going to be a thorough review, but rather a comment on the reviews of others.Many state that this 1) is slightly disappointing and lacks the humor of the Belgariad/Mallorean 2) should be read only AFTER reading the Mallorean and the Belgariad. I, however, read BtS before starting on M/B and I found it tremendously enjoyable, and my experience when reading M/B was only enhanced by this.Anyway, that's what I think."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I do love the Belgariad and the Mallorean. Whilst they do not have the overall complexity of The Wheel of Time, or the great heroism of The Lord of the Rings, they do have something these lack. Wit and charm. I have read the series a few times, and they are by far the most enjoyable reads I have ever had, except for a few niggles (&quot;nice little fight&quot; does get boring).This book is no exception to the rule. Although you need to read the series first, once you have you will find this book answers many questions and provides a compelling background to the books.HOWEVER, towards the end I noticed some inconsistencies with the texts, and this does detract from the enjoyment slightly, as you feel that towards the end, Eddings was getting slightly bored and lazy. This is not to detract from the whole novel, as the rest is superbly crafted, and the first person perspective works excellently.The other major plus point of the novel is the presentation of Belgarath as a wholly fallible character. Whilst this is undesirable in many cases, in this one it serves to add greater depth to his character, and also justify the exsistence of his brothers. You can't help but end up wondering about Beldin's history, or why Zedar ended up acting the way he did, and that is a testament to the strength of Eddings character development.All in all this is definitely worth a look if you are a fan. If you aren't, then read the Belgariad and Mallorean and I can guarantee you soon will be."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I have to admit that I read the whole series in less than one month and that includes the belgariad and the mallorean but not polgara, so of course I was addicted and will obviously give it a good review. This book, like all the others written by Eddings, will cause the reader to go into withdrawl with it closed. I'll be the first to admit that Eddings didn't do anything monumental with his series but did acomplish what I believe was his purpose- a novel that will suck you into it and let you escape reality for a while. This book wasn't quite as good as the other series but it was definately worth a try. Do yourself a favor and don't leave this on the shelf."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is the story of Belgarath the Sorcerer who is over seven thousand years old. It takes place from his childhood all the way to well past his seven thousandth birthday. I wouldn't suggest reading this book unless you have first read the two series the Belgariad and the Mallorean. This story tells most of what is not told in those series.The book is written like Belgarath is telling it. The author does a great job of writing the entire book in first person. And seeing as Belgarath is using magic to have his thoughts or words written down, it is complete with the little interruptions that would no doubt happen, and that we have no clue what they are about.This is an extremely well written fantasy book. But then again, what else would you expect from David Eddings. Belgarath is the main character. However the supporting cast of his friends really adds to the book. People like Prince \\"Silk\\" Kheldar and Lady Polgara (his daughter) are just unforgettable.I feel that the book was extremely well written. With unforgettable characters and a story that happens over thousands of years and a whole world. A main character who dismisses decades and centuries as we would months and years. If you read this book you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I waited for 'Belgarath the Sorcerer' with great expectation; hoping to finally know more about Belgarath with his mysterious past; about what really made him the man he appears to be in the Belgariad and Mallorean series; to really know the history of the Eternal Man. In this aspect the book lived up to my expectation, yet I was disappointed in a way. There seems to be some humor missing in Eddings' approach to the whole story. The beginning was entertaining enough but then it started to get boring. This might be caused by the 'I' (that is Belgarath's) point of view of the whole story. I personally think the Belgariad series is the best work Edding has done, with the Mallorean series following close behind. I still take up a book from these two series and still feel the thrill of turning each page to reveal what happens in the next pages (despite the fact that I've probably read the whole thing a dozen of times). It's still worth the time reading it. This is not the same thing I can say about Eddings' prequel to the saga. I haven't picked up this book and read it again from cover to cover since the time I finished reading it for the first time. However, devout readers of Eddings should definitely not miss this book since it offers more insight to the Belgariad realm. It's nice to know more about Belgarath, but this book lacks the thrill and humor of Eddings previous books, which just proves the point that history is not meant to be entertaining"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath the Sorcerer is best read after both the Belgariad and the Mallorean. Although it is a standalone novel, the prologue is built upon events that happen at the end of the Mallorean.How to describe the novel? Calling it a history book is a grave injustice, on the scale of calling a Lamborghini a car (which it is, of course, but surely you can come up with far more dazzling ways to describe a Lamborghini.) \\"Belgarath the Sorcerer\\" is the story of one man's love--for his god, for his wife, for his \\"brothers\\", for his daughters, and for people. It is the story of duty and responsibility (and a sense of humor) that persists in spite of decade-long diversions, centuries-long sidetracks, and millennia-long grief.Eddings manages pace very well--speeding through centuries in a paragraph, and then spending whole chapters on the events of a few weeks--without leaving the reader dizzy from wondering what just happened. The flow of the story seamlessly carries the reader along through detailed scenes. Characters are both vivid and memorable, and readers will enjoy seeing how all those insider jokes from the Belgariad started.A thoroughly enjoyable read. When you're done with this, pick up his next book,Polgara the Sorceress (Malloreon)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"You won't be disappointed with this book, as it is written in one person view. As if someone is telling you the story, it is a very personable look behind the character of Belgarath. If you enjoyed the Pawn of Prophecy, you will enjoy this book as well. This book doesn't dawdle along as some books tend to, it keeps you entertained from start to end."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"David Eddings at his finest!

The greatest danger Belgarath faces in this book is when he first meets Torak. Through the rest of the book, even when he fights Zedar in Morindim(DID ANYONE ALSO NOTICE HOW INCOMPETENT AND WEAKLY SKILLED IN SORCERY ZEDAR WAS?), you know that he isn't in any danger.

It had a certain sass and humour. Whilst Belgariad and Mallorean were a wee bit different, this book had a magical twist (pardon the pun). This book reveals some aspects that kept the readers of Bel and Mal in perpetual curiosity. Of course, there were bits that were left untold, which further accentuates your irritation (I suppose that's what makes the books interesting to read) but I expect they will be revealed in the other book, Polgara the Sorceress, but oh well. TO make it short, read this book...full of humour, action, and fun."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is quite excellent.

If you think Belgarath's a god, and can't handle the tarnishment of his character, you obviously missed what Polgara's been hinting at with a sledgehammer all these years. This is a book for people who love Belgarath's world for what it is: a rich tapestry of the ages, interwoven with true family values, and incredible character development and interaction. The Eddings' Belgarath succeeds where Tolkein's Silmarilion failed: it fills in the wonderful backdrop of the earlier books without becoming a dull academic paper. And as the end makes obvious , one man can't tell the whole story, even if he's 7000 years old. There's Polgara's story as well, and (we hope) the stories of Poledra the Wolf, and that wonderfully cantankerous Beldin the Hunchback."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"If you enjoy David Eddings work, this book is for you. It's an excellent retelling of the only briefly covered history of Eternal Belgarath. If you've never sampled Eddings' work before, this a great start.

It also gives explanations to theanimosities between certain characters in the series thatwere not given before, only hinted at. A reader who has notread The Belgariad and The Mallorean may miss some of thesignificance of this book, but for those who have read the twoseries, this book is the perfect companion and should beread.Belgarath the Sorcerer is perhaps David Eddings best work to dateand should be read in order of release, due to the fact thatthe book picks up where The Mallorean leaves off.

I stuck with them though, right through to the Tamuli. When that clunking, awkward clone of the Ellenium finished, it was obvious he'd completely run out of ideas... yet I still purchased Belgarath... Surely he could do something decent by focusing on one of the more interesting characters he's created? Unfortunately not. The whole book feels rushed, and Eddings's once fluid and enjoyable writing style now feels forced and unnatural."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I just started reading science fiction of this sort and I was thrilled with this book.

These people who complain that it &quot;isn't good enough for them&quot; or that David &amp; Leigh &quot;repeat too much&quot; have obviously skimmed through the book. I am only 12 and I can see that the Eddings couple writes very deep. Unless you pore through it, their books don't seem that interesting. But when you look deep inside them, it's like a whole new world is opened up. Belgarath the Sorcerer explains so much about the Belgariad and the Malloreon that we wanted to know. I've read the last two books of the Belgariad, the 2nd and 3rd books of the Malloreon, Belgarath, Polgara, and own the complete Elenium and Tamuli and I have NEVER had reason to complain about a single one of them! Though they use what SEEMS to be the same characters, every one of the people David and Leigh create are different. The Eddings couple makes people that seem so real, it's as if they could be in the same room with you, talking to you, and you wouldn't be able to realize that they were characters from a book. Those who say that there are no racial differences obviously do not realize the fact that the Alorns and Elenes are Caucasians and that the Angaraks, Melcenes, Styrics, and Tamuls are Orientals, and those are only a few of the answers I have to the many complaints that I have read. You may think that I am only a silly little girl, but you do not realize that sometimes we children can be as (or more) perceptive than you adults. Have you all forgotten the days of your own youth? Enough, I'm beginning to sound like I'm preaching, but sometimes I just can't help it when people act like this.

I like knowing just what is a 6000-plus year old hero doing all that time. Maybe Eddings isn't breaking new ground, but he at least has solid footing. I highly reccommend this novel to any Eddings' fan, but suggest that you wait until reading both the Belgariad and the Mallorean before starting it.

I hope that someday I can write that well, well enough to let people feel the emotions of my charecters, as well as join in the excitment of their world!!!!! Thank you Mr. Edding"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book begins, literally, at the beginning of Belgarath's life. It goes through each of the major points that you've been curious about since reading the Belgariad and the Mallorean, including the Battle of Vo Mimbre and other high and low points of history. It also tells in hilarious detail the events leading up to these events. The funniest parts occur when Belgarath, in his role as narrator, turns aside from the story to comment directly to his reader. Somehow, the Eddingses manage to fill in lots of gaps, satisfying our need to know about Belgarath's life, and create more gaps for Polgara, Belgarath's daughter, to fill in. All in all, this is a wonderful book, but it is not for the person who hasn't read both the Belgariad and the Mallorean"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Bravo on this excellent piece of work! If you have readboth the Mallorean and Belgariad, this book provides moreinformation and backround on the famous (yet mysterious)Belgarath, Polgara, and many others. Once I picked up thisbook, it never left my hands. I could not put it down norstop reading until I reached the end of the book. And whenthat ending came, I grew dissapointed that there wasno more left to be read. Oh well.......I picked it back upagain and read it from cover to cover. Truly a wonderfulstory that is a concoction of romance, adventure, and swirling mystery. &quot;Belgarath the Sorcerer&quot; will hook youand make you fall in love with the artworks ofDavid and Leigh Eddings! :-)"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"David Eddings and his wife have done Justice as it should be done. The way the books tells the story of the Sorcerer Belgarath and his life is awsome. If you have read the series that go along with the book, it would mean even more than you think. This book is the one of the best books that has ever been written. If you haven't read it, read it"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Great book,if you have readed Belgariad and Malloreon,you absolutely have read this! Following the adventures ofBelgarath,the Sorcerer,filled with humour and joy,sadnessand losses.I can not find words good enough to say whatI think about it.This book can not be described,only readed.Nearly so great as Tolkien's Silmarillion was,but much moreclosely following the life of book's main characters - Belgarath the Sorcerer and Polgara the Sorceress."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is a prequel to the Belgariad. While the book keeps the classic humor of Belgarath, it does diminish the mystique of Belgarath with self depreciating comments. Woe to the beginning reader who unwittingly reads this book first before reading the Belgariad"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"You are alway left with unanswered questions when you read amulti-triligy like the Melorreon and the Belingrad. Now wehave a volume which put a proper ends to those questions. Itwill make you laugh and see the hard choices the charectershad to make. A really enjoyable book, and one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I enjoyed reading Belgarath the Sorcerer very much. It was fun to discover the background on the mysterious sorcerer. When I finished reading the Mallorean I was sad because there wasn't any more to read about the characters I loved so much, but then I found Belgarath the Sorcerer and was happy to read it. I laughed and cried, which happens when I read my favorite books. Now I'm just waiting for David and Leigh to write another one"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Now that the secret is out, the co-authorship of the Eddings couple, everyone can now understand the amazing dialogue in the previous books. I am sure I am not the only one who wondered how a man could make his female characters think and act like real women, obviously it was his wife who did this. This co-authorship is the reason for the exquisitness of the characters in this book and like al of the books from the desk of the Eddings I can read it again and again without becoming bored."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I love it when the series is all done, and I can burn through it without having to wait for the next book to be written. This was a very good book."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Look, you don't read David Eddings for classic literature, you read him for the cool sorcery, the sharply drawn characters and a sense of humor.Belgarath the Sorcerer delivers, but it's definitely of the meat and potatoes variety. It's a trip down memory lane for those who have waded through the Belgariad and the Mallorean (which both became progressively more ponderous and lacking in new ideas).The fact that this book even exists suggests that Mr. Eddings is running either a bit low on new ideas, or his bank account, or both."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Being a fan of Edding's work I was disappointed in Belgarath. It was such a long work and I felt needlessly so. While I agree with earlier reviewers that one doesn't read Edding's for literary genius, I do expect the books to be well thought out and entertaining. Going into this book you know the outcome if you read the Belgariad. That makes it hard to inject any suspense into the work, which meant that it needed to be overcome with skillful writing and plot twists. I didn't feel that there was any of this in this work. When a situation headed towards a difficult problem the \\"necessity\\" or \\"Garion's friend\\" bailed everyone out conveniently. I just didn't find this work to be very imaginative and below Edding's standard in the first five books of the Belgariad.This book is like the movie sequel that didn't need to be made. Does Smoky and the Bandit III ring a bell with anyone?"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I love this book. This is my second copy. I have re-bought all of the Eddings series as they have worn out over the years."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Backstory the elder.In a similar fashion to the Polgara the Sorceress volume, here we get the backstory of ubersorcerer Belgarath, and learn why he is so.It all has to do with good gods and bad goods and the disciples of such, along with whacky sorcerer-name prefixes.Old is certainly the word for this bloke, and it gives you more of an overview of what is going on. Again, basically better than the main series.2.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"You liked the Belgariad and the Malloreon? Keep it this way. Belgarath the Sorcerer will reveal nothing new despite going a way back into the future. At least nothing you wouldn't expect. I also don't recommend this book as a starter to fiction reading. I believe only desperate readers continue with Belgarath, Polgara or the Rivan Codex."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"As an avid reader of Eddings works, including High Hunt, I found Belgarath the Sorcerer, and Polgara for that matter, a real disappointment. There are a number of inconsistencies between them and the Belgariad. For example, all of Garions ancestors call Belgarath &quot;Grandfather&quot;, but in the original series, when Garion first calls Belgarath &quot;Grandfather&quot;, it comes as a surprise to him (Belgarath). Polgara's engagement also conflicts with what Aunt Pol tells Garion when he suggests she marry Durnik in the Belgariad also. I have read both the Belgariad and the Malloreans, and the Elenium and Tamuli series for that matter, numerous times, I doubt that I will revisit Belgarath or Polgara."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is really no good... The whole book (and all the others in the series) coul be directly used as manuscripts for bad Hollywood movies... Nothing special, really... This CAN'T be compared with classics as &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; by Robert Jordan or &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; by J.R.R. Tolkien..."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I am really surprised at how well rated this book is on Amazon. I read it and think it may well be my last Eddings book. I did like the Belgariad and Silk may be one of my favorite literary characters. BUT, I did get tired of the humor and over all tone of the books. The humor isn't very original (jokes about wives that you've heard a million times) and is repeated again and again. Seriously, how many times can some talk about turning someone in to a turnip? Having said that, I would recommend the Belgariad series as a good read but would stop there. This book feels like a rehash of the Belgariad series and I just don't think it is dark enough. Don't get me wrong, I don't want a horror story, but it seems more like a TV show where there are lots of explosions and people are thrown in the air, but they then land on bushes or bails of hay. There just needs to be some grit in the stories and after the first series, I just can't take the \\"cuteness\\" anymore. I would read something else........"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Well, it feels just like the Belgariad. I initially liked the Belgariad a lot, but the problem is that it is the same thing over and over. The characters are pretty much one-dimensional. The humor is the same over and over, not so humorous anymore. Also, the enemies never pose a real threat to the heroes, there's no tension or drama because the &quot;good guys&quot; are all smug and the bad guys are incompetent.But if you slogged through the series which does have a pleasant homey feel to it then you're obliged to read this which neatly ties up all of the history of Eddings' world."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book takes you back to a time before the world was ripped assunder by the evil Torak. This tells you how things happend to lead up to Garion's story. It is a must read for Eddings fans. I suggest that you read this after completing the Belgaraid, and the malloreon series."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Wonderfuly written fiction. This book not only entertains by taking you to a far away and magical place, but unlike some sci fi/fantasy fiction the bases and explanations are believable. The charecter Belgareth is one anyone can relate to. Full of wisdom and wry wit. Eddings masterfully draws you into his world with this book and the others in the series. A must read. I have read it more then a dozen times and am currently reading it to my husband. I strongly encorage any fiction lovers to read this book. -UnaCeleste@aol.com"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Eddings is without doubt the best fantasy auther. This book is a must for everyone who has entered the world of the Belgariad. Here is the full story of Belgarath - funny, wellwritten and lovely (as always). Go read it - NOW!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book gives a great insight into the REAL Belgarath, the person who has as wonderful a sense of humour as Silk, only less evident in the Belgariad. I'm glad that the Eddingses have cleared up the mystery behind Belgarath's antecedents. It should be on every bookshelf-- truly a merry read!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I read all 13 of David eddings books that are about Aldurs deciples, torack, belgerath, Polgara, and such. I also read the Diamond throne, but did not enjoy it as much as the Belgeraid, Mallorian, and THIS book. David Eddings is an author that writes GREAT books, and better still, writes lots of them that are in the same series. I consider the belgeraid and Mallorian the same series, which totals up to 10 books on the same topic!!! David Eddings makes detailed characters who you share your feelings with. I am a tough customer, but Eddings makes me give 5 stars!This book is good if you enjoyed the character Belgerath, which I certainly did. The book tells about a ancient old man who is mischevious, charasmatic and always in trouble despite his worshipful reputation (not from his family members who REALLY know him of course). About the review that says this must come straight from a movie script. I say that person was high on something, because I hate most movies, but enjoyed this book (and others made by eddings) more than any other. Only Eddings (and Leigh eddings for this book), could make they're characters so well. That they could make an Autobiography on an imagenary character, and win many awards from reviewers, and leisure readers like you and me. Flawless book.P.S. I also reccomend you read books from Raymond Feist."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath tells an amazing story, filling in many gaps which we now know were placed on purpose. Excellent work David Eddings!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"The crowning achievement of both the Belgariad and the Mallorean. I was waiting for this book since I was quite young and picked up &quot;Pawn of Prophecy&quot; at the store. I waited until I thought I was going to explode for each new book in the series to come out, and after waiting soooo long, all I can say is it was worth every moment! This series of twelve books is my most precious collection in my stacks of books, they make me laugh, shout for joy, weep tears of sadness and brings me into a world as real as the one you ar I live in. I love them all, Durnik, Barak, Silk, Garion, Ce'Nedra and all the rest....yes you too Yarblek. If I could do but one thing in this life it would be to seek out Mr. Eddings and thank him for writing such a series of books that has made my life better by reading them over and over again. Thank you!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I absolutely loved this book, one of the best he has ever written, the power and the passion that Eddings portrays is magnificent. I've read it a dozen times and still find something new"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Belgarath the Sorcer was a great book. I liked how it showed things from belgaraths point of view. The bad thing about the book was that it went through a long period of time. I know it told you it was going to do this but i still don't agree with his methed's. If i spelled anything wrong do not blame me i'm only 12"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This book is by far Eddings' greatest endeavour. The complete story of Belgarath the sorcerer fills in the gaps left in The Belgariad and The Mallorean and shows the reader where Belgarath's attitude and fairly strong opinions come from. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I absolutely loved how fast this book came, and also that it was in terrific condition like they said it was. It didn't come with the cover, which i can't remember if it said it had it or not, but it doesn't matter, only the book matters. it was in excellent condition and a good price and it came before Christmas!! it was fantastic!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Excellent book, have had many paperback copies over the years. Sadly this Kindle edition is full of typos and spelling errors. It gets so bad in places it is actually difficult to make out the sense of the sentence.Excellent book but sadly let down by this Kindle edition. Kindle books may be cheaper than print books but we should still get the same level of proofing and editing as the print customer. Kindle editions shouldn't be a poorer reading experience!!!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Great book that focuses on one of my favorite characters and does a great job of pulling together an epic adventure."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I loved the Belgariad and Mallorean so naturally this book is one worth reading. This lays the groundwork for everything set in motion during the two noted series. There are some cyclical ideas in the story telling, but I find this to enjoyable since most of life is cyclical. Since this book is essentially a historical account in the series, it makes sense that it has some repetitions, after all human history is repetitive. The best thing about this book was the foundation Eddings orchestrated for the premise of the Belgariad. It was very exciting and pleasurable to read about the beginning of the spiritual mythos that Eddings created in this realm. Learning about the gods involvements with human prior to the cracking of the world was very fun and worth reading. Also, the development of the Belgarath and Polgara characters lends itself to further enjoyment of the Belgariad and Malloeran series'."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"This is the first prequel to the Belgariad and Malloreon (before Polgara the Sorceress).In this prequel, Belgarath tells us about his youth and how he became Aldur's pupil and then disciple, along with his brothers Zedar, the twins Belkira and Beltira, Belmakor, Belsambar and the dwarf Beldin.For a while they all live happily in the Vale, quietly studying, until Aldur's evil brother Torak steals the Orb and cracks the World.Then follows a history of the events that led to the birth of Garion the Godslayer: Belgarath's meeting the remarkable she-wolf who'll become his wife Poledra, the division of Aloria between Cherek and his sons Dras, Algar and Riva, the birth of his daughters Polgara and Beldaran, the start of the Rivan line and Torak's disciples' efforts to obliterate it, the Battle of Vo Mimbre...All the while, Belgarath and his brothers are taking care that everything clicks together, deciphering madmen's prophecies, and accordingly arranging meetings and marriages to ensure that Garion will be surrounded by the right companions when the time comes.All in all, I enjoyed re-reading this prequel more than the ten main volumes, even though Belgarath's flaunty remarks to the reader tended to rile me. Eddings's style and plot crafting has definitely improved during the years between the writing of The Seeress of Kell and this present volume. I hope I will now enjoy Polgara the Sorceress as much as I did when I first read it, it's always been my favourite among the lot!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"I've been reading Eddings now for nearly 10 years and his \\"Garion\\" books are by far the best. Truthfully, though, I wouldn't have been as big a fan if I had actually started with the first book. I read Belgarath the Sorcerer first and fell in love with it.Eddings' fantasy world, in my opinion, far outstrips any other series I've read simply because of the development he put into it. Cultures, a complex history, a medieval society with a bit of modernism thrown in... I get tired of barbaric worlds with \\"dangerous,\\" unsettled lands. Eddings gives us actual countries with political complexities."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"Although it would benefit a reader to have read one or both of his first serie's to be more familiar of caricter's,event's refered to,etc.,it's not neccisary to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"To me, Eddings, like Tad Williams and Raymond E. Feist, writes a kind of perfect fantasy story that harkens back to Lloyd Alexander and the Chronicles of Prydain. It's not what I reach for when I want something trying to be deep and profound, it's what I reach for when I want something completely satisfying. A well written, believable world you can instantly fall into, and want to. Marvelous characters that you want to meet again and again. Stories that hook you early, pace nicely, and keep you hooked til the end. Which is not to imply these books are shallow or merely escapist; but rather that every level on which they can be read meshes so effortlessly that you aren't ever interrupted by your awareness of them. The best storytellers are the ones who never draw attention to themselves, because that draws attention away from the story - they never shout at you through the page. Eddings is a master storyteller, and it was very gratifying to get Belgariad prequels long after you thought the series was, sadly, complete. Both Belgarath and Polgara are excellent reads. If you like The Belgariad and Mallorean books, make sure to read the Servant of the Empire trilogy (written with Janny Wurts) as well!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"What a different view of the whole picture (Belgarath's the one telling the story, and so you get his hilarious point of view the whole way through)! This book takes you back before the Belgariad even takes place, starting with Belgarath's childhood, and the earlier parts of his 7,000 year life. This book has all of the things in the Belgariad and the Mallorean that you only briefly read about, such as the cracking of the world, Belgarath's story of becoming a desciple of Aldur, Zedar's treason, The meeting of Poledra and Belgarath, as well as many other stories that are finally revealed in all of their glory in this book. This book is a definate buy for someone who has completed both the Mallorean and the Belgariad. It also clears up a lot of confusion that you might have encountered throughout both the series.WONDERFUL BOOK!"},{"Title":"Belgarath the Sorcerer","review":"It was amazing...You have to read both the Belgariad and the Mallorian first or you wont understand some of it. The story fills in the blanks that were left after Eddings finished the two previous series. We all know that Belgarath is probably the funniest character in the whole story, and this is the story of his life. Some of it was a little slow going, but the rest of the story made up for that little tidbit of slowness. I loved this story, and highly recommend it to you iff(if and only if) you absolutely loved the Belgariad and the Mallorian. READ IT! READ IT! READ IT! I DON'T CARE HOW, BUT READ IT!!!!!"},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"WE USED THIS BOOK ALONG WITH ANOTHER STUDY GUIDE FOR THE BOOK OF JAMES.

ALSO, IT IS EASY, ENJOYABLE READING."},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"I found this book very easy to read. He sticks with the scripture and really focuses on each verse. The book is great for indvidual study as well as group study. I felt he was able to make his points in language that a Chritian could apply to everyday life. He was able to relate the scripture which was written years ago, to the lives of Christians in these times. The letters written long ago are to be applied to today just as they were long ago. Jesus is never changing. I felt Wierse did an excellent job in encouraging us to 'be mature'."},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"This book has the ability to remain current. I first went through it 18 years ago, and it is just as sharp today. The truths of James exhort us to &quot;grow up&quot;, yet they are expressed in a way that makes them tremendously appealing."},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"All of Warren Wiersbe's &quot;Be Series&quot; books are just outstanding! This one is no exception. James has been called the Proverbs of the New Testament. Martin Luther didn't think it belonged in the Bible because of it's emphasis on good works! This short book, written by James the brother of Jesus, is a goldmine of instruction on how to live as a mature Christian.Warren will lead you through the book bit by bit and your study of James will be oh so much richer as a result. I'm studying James with my small group Bible Study and I'm getting so much more out of our study because of &quot;Be Mature&quot;!If you're interested in reading more of Warren's commentaries, you might want to check out Bible Exposition Commentary Set (Volumes 1 &amp; 2), which is a compilation of ALL of Wiersbe's &quot;Be Series&quot; books on the NEW TESTAMENT. He's not quite done writing all the commentaries on the Old Testament, then hopefully we'll have a 2-volume set containing those as well.This commentary is easy to understand - definitely written for laypersons. But it does not lack depth. Get this one and another one of your favorite book of the Bible and enjoy!You might want to check out my reviews of other Christian books."},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"A lack of spiritual maturity is widespread which results in Christians experiencing unnecessary strife, is a reason given for this study on the book of James. Wiersbe believes, \\"if Christians would just grow up, they would become victors instead of victims\\" (p. 5). He begins with giving us background on James. We're told James \\"was a popular name, a form of the great Old Testament name Jacob\\" (p. 7). Tradition has it that James was a man of prayer. Wiersbe provides insight into key words in this study. For example, the word \\"perfection\\" trips some people up. He explains that word, as interpreted in Hebrews 6:1 refers to \\"spiritual maturity\\" (p. 15).On the topic of growing spiritually, the author tells us it does not occur automatically, like physical growth. Rather, it is something a person must work at continually. \\"Faith is always tested\\" he writes (p. 24). If one maintains the right attitude the testing works in our favor, not against us. While immature people are always impatient, mature people are patient and persistent (p. 25). Certain character traits can come about only through trials. An additional sign of spiritual maturity is that a person does not argue with God's will, but accepts it willingly (p. 27).James tells his readers to ask God for wisdom. \\"Wisdom is the right use of knowledge,\\" Wiersbe adds, on page 29. Wisdom keeps trials from being wasted. It enables us to see the reason for the difficulties. One bit of wisdom that will help us endure hardship is the knowledge of God's love for us. Such insight enables us to know that ultimately God's love is greater than any situation we have to bear. Seasons happen for a reason and they do not last indefinitely.Chapter three explains how to view temptation. Maturation will not occur unless one has overcome trials and temptations (p. 36). \\"A temptation is an opportunity to accomplish a good thing in a bad way, out of the will of God\\" (p. 36). Desires are to be servants, not masters. We're encourage, in the next chapter, to mediate on the Wrod of God and put it into practice. Chapter five gives fresh nuggets of truth on grace. Toward the end of the book, he argues persuasively for the viewpoint that God' will is not to be feared, but to be relished. God wants the best for us. It is not logical to fear doing His will. You will be greatly encouraged by the spiritual truths in this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Be mature (A Victor adult elective)","review":"I enjoy all of the books by Warren Wiersbe.

Narrator Eve Diamond, a young reporter for the LA Times, ranges from the squats of homeless kids to the trophy mansions of the powerful and the solid, working-class neighborhoods of the settled Mexican community in her pursuit of converging stories on the mayoral race, slumming suburban teens, and the thriving Mexican-American music industry. The kick start for each story is a murder, but that seems all that connects them, disparate aspects of a city with numerous, often hidden, faces.Juggling her stories, her increasingly personal interest in the murders and a burgeoning romance with a suave suspect, Eve takes the reader across town and into the eclectic, eccentric hills and the affordable suburban valleys. Eating her way from glitzy west to gritty east, she reveals two cities with nothing in common but proximity and dependence. Economic and ethnic divergence compartmentalize the sprawling space between ocean and desert. Eve's sharp instincts take her to an encampment of homeless transvestite prostitutes, a somber Mexican funeral, various (less interesting) political functions and several (more interesting) Mexican music venues. Along the way she catches body lice from a homeless waif, stumbles over her straight-laced boss' sordid secret, and nearly gets herself fired for good cause. In the end she discovers that all communities hide low secrets and greed and hypocrisy are universal vices. She also catches a murderer in a slam-bang ending that stretches credulity a bit, but succeeds in spiking the suspense.Eve is an energetic, likeable and irreverent character and Hamilton moves adroitly in a newsroom. A well-paced mystery with a stylish and serious urban atmosphere."},{"Title":"Sugar Skull: An Eve Diamond Novel (Eve Diamond Novels)","review":"The Jasmine Trade examined the lives of parachute kids and the Asian sex trade in Los Angeles. We were immediately informed that Jasmine Trade was about parachute kids because the murder victim, Marina Lu, was one herself. Okay, fine. I thought Sugar Skull was going to look at the murder of a rich white preppy. But no, it quickly morphs into a study of Latino-American culture in LA.The first few chapters were promising- Isabel Chevalier is murdered in a run-down squat. Her weird-o father, Vince, informs Eve that Isabel likes hanging with the LA street kids, especially her boyfriend, Finch. Eve interviews Isabel's rich preppy friend, Paolo Dellaviglia Langdon, the son of a mayorial candidate. Eve is getting pulled into the world of the street kids and part-time street kids (the preppies). Then, one of the preppy's parents is found murdered. Yikes! This is getting interesting. Was it a squatter? Maybe a fellow preppy? I was ready for an adventure.Instead, we're whisked away into the world of Latino-Americans in LA. FORMULA!!!! Eve covers the murder of Ruben Aguilar and his family's rising concert promotion business. And she becomes wrapped up in the arms of Silvio Aguilar, a wonderful lover, but a man she can't seem to trust. (Mark Fukuwara ring any bells???) We learn a lot about Mexican -American culture- music, food, culture clashes, transgendered teen prostitutes, etc. Okay, I get it, it's Los Angeles.... but I couldn't get over the fact that Denise Hamilton was using a formula similar to Jasmine Trade. That's what frustrated me!In the end, the preppies, squatters, Mexican -Americans, and politicans are all tied neatly together in the now triple murder mystery of Isabel Chevalier, rich mom, and Ruben Aguilar. The way they are tied together is a bit much, especially the secrets of the politician's deceased wife. We never really get to know the squatter kids, which would have made for much better reading. We know a smidgen of Finch's life, even less of Scout's. Sophie and Caitlin, Isabel's school friends, make fleeting appearances. Vince Chevalier, whom Eve reminds us is weird, is phased out of the book until the very end, when he's got his own mini scandal, but by then, who cares? The novel is wrapping up by the time we see him at the concert, and by the time Eve can give a bland warning to his \\"victim\\", all is said and done.I absolutely loved the stand-alone Damage Control, so much so that I checked out the three Eve Diamond books my library branch had on the shelf. I'm glad I didn't buy Sugar Skull (or Last Lullaby, which I also borrowed), because it would have been a waste of money. I'm looking for creativity, not formula.(In my review for Jasmine Trade, I pointed out its similarities to Damage Control. With Sugar Skull, the main similarity is the corrupt politician, and especially the way nothing is resolved in his politican career, akin to the politican in Damage Control.)"},{"Title":"Sugar Skull: An Eve Diamond Novel (Eve Diamond Novels)","review":"Denise Hamilton, Sugar Skull (Scribner, 2003)Back when I first subscribed to Chapter-a-Day (now known as Dear Reader), Sugar Skull was one of the first books that caught my attention. Somehow, it took me five years to get around to actually reading the thing. This was a big mistake, because while it's not perfect, Sugar Skull is, where mysteries are concerned, the real deal.Eve Diamond is a Metro reporter for the L. A. Times, usually relegated to writing local-color stories and the like, or being a \\"contributor\\" to bigger stories. Unless, of course, something happens to push her onto a bigger story, and in this case, it's Vincent Chevalier, legendary sound engineer (\\"I did all of Jackson Browne's albums since Late for the Sky!\\"), bursting into the office early one Saturday morning and trying to find a reporter, any reporter, who will listen to his story before security tosses him out. Turns out Eve is the only one there, and his story is that he needs to go down to a local squat--again--and pull his daughter, educated at an exclusive private school, out. Problem is, Isabel is dead, strangled and left in the basement in a rolled-up futon. Her boyfriend is quickly fingered for the murder, but his friends swear he wouldn't do such a thing; even dad looks kind of skeptical. When Eve goes to visit one of her school friends, Paolo Dellaviglia Langdon, whose father happens to be the favorite in the upcoming mayoral race, she stumbles on an even bigger story--his legendary wife Venus. Something's off about her, and Eve can't quite figure out what. It becomes a lot more important when Venus is found dead in the pool the next day. And just to add something more to her plate, her editor asks her to do a local-color story about the rise of a Mexican concert promoter, a guy who books shows few people in LA know about, but that pack a forty-thousand-seat arena at forty-eight bucks a pop. No wonder the guy's a millionaire. But she quickly finds herself less interested in him than in his son Silvio, who's just plain dreamy.My favorite thing about this novel is that Silvio's dreaminess isn't the cardboard-cutout one expects from a mystery with a romance undercurrent. I mean, the first thing she really notices about the guy is his little potbelly. That's when most heroines would just move on and try to find the guy with the sixpack abs. Eve Diamond wonders what it would feel like pressed against her. Bless you, Eve. You give the rest of us hope. Everything that balances is out is personal nitpicky stuff of my own that has nothing at all to do with the way the book is written, and I'm trying to get better about factoring things like that into my judgments of books. When it comes right down to it, there's nothing here to really transcend genre, and everything's just a little too neat starting about halfway through the book, but it's quite well-written and Hamilton's obviously done her homework on a lot of this stuff. Definitely worth a look. ***"},{"Title":"Sugar Skull: An Eve Diamond Novel (Eve Diamond Novels)","review":"Denise Hamilton writes with understanding of the different cultures that make up Los Angeles.

In so doing, Etienne Gilson shows the &quot;unity of philosophical experience&quot; through a study of important philosophers.Etienne Gilson was one of the greatest historians of philosophy in the 20th century. His brilliance shows throughout this work and so much could be quoted. For example: &quot;As soon as Descartes published it, it became apparent that, like Caesar's wife, the existence of the world should be above suspicion . . . . Descartes had endeavored to prove something that could not be proved, not beacause it is not true, but on the contrary, beacause it is evident.&quot; (p. 146.)If you are new to the study of philosophy, get this book for an introduction; if you are familiar with philosophy, this is a great &quot;refresher course.&quot;"},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Lectures given by Etienne Gilson in 1936 at Harvard. Gilson defines the coming war, World War II, as a philosophical war of two different heads of Hegelianism. Communism, which is inspired by a look forward, into what will be, and helping it along (all conjecture of course); and the Hitlarian (Romantic) looking to the past. Thus Hitler's paganism and his desire to rid Europe of all nonindigionious elements, especially Semetic. Christianity, after all, is a conquering force upon the natural purity and indigoniousness of Europe. It is a glorification of what man, or more importantly, a nation (peoples) would be had they been left in their natural state uncorupted by foreign elements. A Darwinian, Rousousian, Kantian mix (among others) that created the ultranationalistic Romanticism. Gilson defines these misguided principles (still the dominant principles of today) as leading to a future tragic bloody war. But it also explains why Japan, in WWII, wished to be rid of Americanism in their culture, and of any foreign influences. Anyway it leads to extreme nationalism that is just an end result of Romanticism. The problems with defining the truth of Hitler to modern minds is we are not far removed from the thesis and antithesis of his metaphyiscal plain.The most important thesis of the book, however, is Gilson's defense that philosophy and more importantly metaphysics is a process and not a conclusion. Once one has made metaphysics a conclusion it ceases to be Metaphysics. Metaphyics can supose a greater truth, like an octagon being closer to a circle than a hexagon, but to incompus all truth is at least a human impossibility. However there have been many cycles in the history were postulations of a \\"metaphysical\\" entirety of truth have lead to philosophical cycles of argumentation, sometimes with real physical consequences. These cycles have turned into philosophical battles between true metaphyics and the false. The most recent false metaphicans have been Hegel, Kant, Carte, Hume, Descartes, and William of Ockham, plus their various disciples. The first cycle, Gilson defines, is that of Thales, 2,600 years ago, claiming all is an absolute of everything being air, followed by Anaximenes claiming everything was not air but water, and then Heraclitus caliming all is fire, then the first synthasis of this absurdity was Anaxaimander saying that the common things of all this stuff was indeterminable.Gilson spends most of his effort, 99% of it, in defining the modern and medieaval cycles of metaphysical certatude and the resulting problems. Any summary of it would not do it justice.The importance of this book to historians and pilosophers and historians of philosophy is immense. I don't know of any other book which so vividly paints a picture of modern thinking and how \\"it\\" got here than this book. Although I must admit I got hopelessly lost in the discriptions of Descarte's postulations, but the thesis of Descartes was made clear. One could go on forever about this book it is a cornicopia of ideas for further study and expansion. Highly recommended for any student of history or philosophy. Gilson brings a view that cannot be ignored. The question I have for Gilson, if I could ask it, is does Gilson agree that error illuminates the truth, as Aquinas did, and further, if error is good.Gilson convincingly argues that there is unity to the philosophical experience and this experience is illuminating on the nature of man and perhaps more."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"After almost missing brilliant Stanley Jaki, Benedictine priest, physicist, and consummate philosopher/historian of science because of his Catholicism; I smartened up. You wouldn't want to miss Einstein or Bertrand Russell either, would you? Okay, ditto for Jaki and Gilson. It was Stanley Jaki who sent me on to Gilson. I am a very fallen away Catholic with all the attendant hostilities, but I learned plenty from Gilson's The Unity of Philosophical Experience. Whatever your persuasions; if you respect intelligenge, methodical realism, and honesty, Jaki and Gilson are well worth your time."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Gilson's work is composed of four parts. In each of the first three parts he explores the advent and demise of a philosophical system (the Medieval experiment, the Cartesian experiment, the Modern experiment) and identifies the recurring fatal attribute contained in each: the application of a particular science (logic, mathematics, science respectively) to the investigation of first principles. The successive failures of these systems has led to the \\"natural\\" but not \\"logical\\" modern conclusion that metaphysics is impossible. Gilson rejoins that simply because no one has ever succeeded in forming a complete metaphysical system that \\"explains\\" all reality doesn't spell the death of metaphysics. Such an enterprise isn't the goal of metaphysics to begin with, and anyone attempting such an undertaking is doomed before he starts. One cannot start with a method and attempt to encapsulate being since being is inexhaustible. Rather, one must start with being and work his way out. As Gilson observes, \\"Man is not a mind that thinks, but a being who knows other beings as true, who loves them as good, and who enjoys them as beautiful.\\" The metaphysician must accept being a priori and interpret it anew for each generation. Metaphysics is not dead or static, but alive and as new as each succeeding moment. The nihilism which marks the present age is the result of systems imposing themselves upon being which results in frustration and emptiness. It is only when one allows being to reveal itself to us that any meaning can be derived from existence."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"Not too many books in philosophy or about philosophy deserve to be called delightful, but this is one such book. Originally delivered as lectures--and that's when philosophers are at their best--this work is part history of philosophy, part criticism, part positive doctrine. What Gilson succeeds doing better than most is writing a story of Medieval and modern philosophy. A single narrative that weaves through the various thematic threads and keeps them all in sight. We learn about the continuity of thought and what specific concerns a philosopher had with his predecessors. In Medieval philosophy, he concentrates on later and more obscure thinkers. He spends a lot of time--too much--on Descartes, laying out and paraphrasing his method and reactions to it.There's a pattern in the history of philosophy. A pattern of error. One philosopher's enthusiastic and idealistic doctrine will be taken by his followers to its ultimate conclusions, which then leads invariably to skepticism. The way out of skepticism has been mysticism or moralism. The book lays out how this happens in Medieval times, with Descartes, and in Modern philosophy after Descartes. He does not focus much on mysticism because that pertains to religion more than philosophy.He concludes his book by telling us how all these philosophers have erred- repeatedly. And in doing so he gives us the guidelines, the principles, of what a philosopher would have to do in order to avoid repeating the same error again. Such a philosophy would not be devoid of metaphysics, on the contrary, it would be a metaphysics that does not begin by trying to emulate an external method of one of the sciences and thus is not subject to the inexorable reductive degeneration into that science--a degeneration that often not just destroys philosophy, but the science as well.There's a lot here to be learned. The book is very clear and concise and gets to the main ideas of the thinkers it discusses. And it is also very readable. It is a quick read that can be easily accomplished, no preparation--mental or otherwise--is needed. It is at times humorous. It is not very thought-provoking though. Despite dealing with metaphysics, it's not deep, and you won't get lost in it due to overconcentration.Some criticisms: most philosophers are rather parochial. Gilson is no exception. For the most part, his philosophical universe is populated by Frenchmen. His positive teachings occupy perhaps 7 pages or so. I would have been interested in reading more about it. Aquinas is notoriously absent, unless it was assumed that his audience knew him already. Gilson mentiones him often and in glowing terms but he never tells us what Aquinas is all about."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"I found this little book a quarter of a century ago. I have never seen it since, but I've never forgotten it. What Gilson has to say here is simple, sane, important and exciting and just really fun to read. And sturdy too. It holds up. A reviewer below said that he was thrilled to see this is back in print. Well, so am I."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"When Etienne Gilson looked at the history of philosophy he saw a cycle repeated numerous times. To put it entirely too briefly, a new philosophical movement arises out of skepticism, but is corrupted into some form of idealism before plunging back into skepticism and again requiring rescue. In The Unity of Philosophical Experience, Gilson describes that process and follows it through three different periods--or \\"experiments\\"--in the history of philosophy.The problem propelling the cycle is essentially a category error, in which philosophers attempt to \\"do\\" philosophy according to the rules of some other discipline. As C.S. Lewis put it in The Discarded Image, \\"Aristotle had impressed on all who followed him the distinction between disciplines and the propriety of following in each its appropriate method.\\" Failure to do so inevitably leads to a \\"breakdown,\\" resulting in skepticism.So, for instance, as Gilson first examines \\"The Medieval Experiment\\" he shows how Abelard and Ockham undermined the philosophy revived by Aquinas and led to the skepticism of the late Middle Ages/Renaissance. Against that skepticism came mysticism like that of Thomas a Kempis or \\"the moralism of the Humanists,\\" like Erasmus. With philosophy mired in skepticism, the cycle was set to begin again, and Descartes was there to begin it. Descartes's own cycle ended in the skepticism of Hume, and Kant began the latest rotation, \\"The Modern Experiment,\\" which had still not concluded in Gilson's day but was leading quite clearly to disaster. In each case, the philosophers in question forced philosophy into the mold of some other discipline. So Ockham with logic, Bonaventure with theology, Descartes with mathematics, Kant with science, and Comte with sociology. They found that philosophy simply didn't fit, and so jettisoned vital parts of philosophy, like metaphysics.Gilson ends the book with a summary and analysis of the cycle and adds seven conclusions drawn from this history. I found it remarkably moving to read this book, published in 1936, in which Gilson makes it clear that the world is heading toward disaster on the basis of false philosophical premises.I have to concur with a few other reviewers that though this book is excellent, it is not for beginners. Even with a background in medieval philosophy the book was still tough going in places. After all, this book began as a series of lectures to university-level philosophy students, so a certain familiarity with philosophy and the history of philosophy is assumed. That said, though the ideas are sometimes difficult the book is briskly written and immensely rewarding.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"This is a good book. However, it's not the best book ever written on the history of philosophy. For one thing, the focus is mostly on metaphysics, which is only one branch of philosophy. Further, I teach introduction to philosophy and I think this would be a difficult introduction to the subject for the average college freshman. Having some background knowledge of philosophy definitely helps while reading.That being said, I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of philosophy, philosophy of science, or metaphysics. The writing is lively, engaging, interesting, at times humorous, and extremely quotable. For example, it is in this work that Gilson comments that philosophy always buries its undertakers.This quote is actually at the heart of his thesis. Gilson shows how metaphysics goes through cycles, always culminating in a philosopher thinking he's solved all the problems of philosophy and the discipline is now dead. Yet, it always turns out things are never that simple. To explore this idea, Gilson goes through several iterations of this cycle throughout history and shows how the same problems keep creeping up. He also draws a parallel with how we handle metaphysics and how we handle science, and the ways in which the two disciplines need one another. In the final section, he lays out several laws of metaphysics that he has derived from the observations he makes of the history of philosophy."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"This book is a deceptively light read. Gilson's writing is so clear that it's easy to miss the profundity of it.Just as he compares the history of philosophy to a scientist's laboratory, I'd like to compare this book to a science class. That is to say, do your homework. When a teacher explains things in class, everything makes perfect sense, but unless you take what the teacher said and see how it applies to different situations, you won't learn very much.This book is great, but I wouldn't recommend reading it unless you have time to really think about the things he says. Of course reading it quickly won't hurt, but just like you wouldn't chug a bottle of fine wine, save this one for when you've got time to really appreciate it.One more thing I'd like to mention is how impressed I was by his ability to show the greatest respect to philosophers of previous ages even while he explained why their ideas are hopelessly mistaken."},{"Title":"The unity of philosophical experience","review":"I was thrilled that this work is back in print. It is a valuable and, indeed, essential book for any library of a philosopher, historian, or serious scholar.

Maybe - just maybe - this would have worked as a cartoon episode (not a good one, for sure), but as a book, it fails.The two artists have different, clashing styles. Some pages are exceptionally good; most are not. The characters are frequently out of proportion, and often look like whichever artist responsible just copied the action figures (ridiculous proportions and all), then tacked on the faces.

Including world's aircraft engines with aircraft directory","review":"In my humble opinion as an historical aviation enthusiast, all AEROSPHERE volumes are on par (and sometimes even better) than Jane's All the World's Aircraft. 1939 was pre-WW2, and this was AEROSPHERE's 1st volume. All aviation information obtainable at this time (1939), as well as advertisements, etc., concerning ALL the world's aircraft (Germany, Japan, Italy, etc.) are included. Very informative on the world's aircraft engines of 1939 as well. An absolutely SPLENDID historical aviation volume! There's well over 1,000 pages in this historic book. FYI, many times some of the advertisements, pictures, etc. were pulled out. To avoid disappointment, I'd advise you to ask BEFORE you buy if the one you're purchasing is complete."},{"Title":"Lies and Deceptions (Novel Devotions)","review":"As a father long past my teenage years, I am obviously not this book's target audience. However, once I got past the initial embarassment of reading a book with teenage girls on the cover, I found myself literally unable to stop my fingers from turning page after page. My disappointment at reaching the end was quickly tempered by the realization that TEMPTATIONS (the second book in the series) was ready to carry me back into Caroline's world.It is almost impossible to find teenage devotionals that teenagers will actually enjoy reading. These days, it can be nearly as difficult to find really good literature. A confluence of the two seems an impossible dream, but it is a dream that Ms. Hergenrader has made into reality. Do yourself and your teenager a favor, buy this book (just don't let them know you enjoyed it as much as they did)."},{"Title":"Lies and Deceptions (Novel Devotions)","review":"LIES AND DECEPTIONS is one of the best young adult novels I have read. No, that's not right. It's one of the best novels I've read. Period. I'm a teacher and familiar with young adult literature, and this first book in Christina Hergenrader's series is wonderful. Caroline Krinke is a junior struggling to make it in a Senior Advanced American Literature course. She can't afford to fail, but when she meets popular Matt Cook, more than her grades fall. Matt is funny, flirtatious, and, amazingly, interested in Caroline. But the mixed messages he sends-breaking study dates and ignoring her, then asking her on a ski trip and kissing her in his backyard-confuse Caroline. Pretty soon she's lying to her friends, her parents, her teachers, even herself to keep Matt interested. But when Caroline is faced with cheating on the American Lit final exam or failing, will her lies and deception catch up with her?This book is a fun, thought-provoking read for adults and teens. Each chapter ends with a devotion and Bible verses, and Caroline and her friends and family look to God for guidance throughout the novel. But even if you're not religious, this book is not to be missed. I found myself unable to put it down. I HAD to know what mess Caroline would get herself into next. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Lies and Deceptions (Novel Devotions)","review":"Christina Hergenrader's books are super! They feature REAL characters dealing with REAL-WORLD issues with a Christian influence. Ms. Hergenrader does a great job at presenting Christian values to a pre-teen audience without being \\"preachy\\". The characters are intriguing, and the story lines are about issues that all kids can relate to. The devotionals included at the end of each chapter are great conversation starters for your family or youth group."},{"Title":"Modern Latin","review":"After having reviewed some three separate Latin books for self-study, I would have to say this one was the clear winner. All the material was laid out in a consistent, concentrated manner. The chapters were very short (2 or 3 pages each) so you could sit down and run through one relatively quickly (an hour or so to do all the questions/memorize the vocabulary).There is a glaring, unforgivable flaw with this book - or atleast how it presented on amazon.... There is no answer guide. Well let me be correct, there *IS* an answer guide, but its not in the book, and the book that it is in ... is no longer in print. So there is no way to check your work without a teacher - or an old, used answer guide (One of which I never found - thus not completing the book).So Sadly, as well written as this book is, I cannot recommend it for purchase unless you happen to be in a school that uses this curriculum."},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"The woodcuts are beautifully reproduced. Included are the verses that originally accompanied each woodcut. The text is provided both in the original Latin and in modern translation. The Danse Macabre was originally a visual artistic presentation, and this book is faithful to that performance. The explanatory text before the woodcuts begin is short and to the point. Dover allows the art to speak for itself, rather than 'interpreting' it for the viewer."},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"Again, the thrifty publisher Dover supplies us with an affordable classic, this time in the art of woodcuts. Hans Holbein's macabre and morbid series, \\"The Dance of Death,\\" gives us a chilling view into Europe during the time when its denizens, well, weren't really expected to make it too far into life.This Dover edition, though not as thorough as the complete 1538 French series (now out of print), provides a faithful reproduction of Holbein's masterpiece, with the original textual accompaniment in Latin (with English). In these marvelous woodcuts, the viewer can easily sense the feeling of dread within the European community during a time that death came all too easily.Of course, death is a theme from which we can never truly escape, so I suppose Holbein's art speaks to all the ages. Until we ourselves come to meet the Eternal Footman, we have Holbein's \\"Dance of Death\\" to give us a glimpse into what we may expect."},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"Holbeins illustrations are brilliant and fascinating. This book is very inexpensive. These two factors should make it a great addition to any library. But the images are something like 2 inches square. You can't see any detail really. I was disappointed and I guess I'll have to find another book as I would like to enjoy this macabre and fascinating series."},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"The woodcuts are very small, maybe 2 inches each side.The details are hard to see this small.

It is completely reprinted in a another language; threw half the book and the other contains images that are about 1x2in. DON'T WAIST YOUR MONEY!!! Not on this one! Your better off doing a google image surch"},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"The Dance of Death (\\"dance macabre\\" in French, \\"Totentanz\\" in German) is one of the most enduring art forms of 15th-16th Century Europe. And the most popular and famous Dance of Death series is that of Hans Holbein the Younger - a set of 41 woodcuts depicting death interrupting the lives of men, women, and children from all walks and stations of life in order to make its unwelcome and ineluctable claim. Holbein's series also draws from and incorporates a related pictorial tradition of human mortality - the \\"Memento mori\\" (\\"remember that you will die\\"), which emphasizes the need for the devout to always be prepared for death. What makes Holbein's series so striking is his depiction of death in the form of mocking, leering, gleeful skeletal figures.Holbein's Dance of Death was first published in collected book form in 1538 in Lyons, France. The greater part of this Dover edition (the first 104 pages) consists of a facsimile of that 1538 book. Inasmuch as it was written and published in 16th-Century French, few modern native-English-speaking readers are likely to be drawn to it. The attraction of the Dover edition is the last 41 pages, in which Holbein's 41 woodcuts are repeated in order, with English translations of the original Latin Biblical verses and French quatrains that appeared with each print in the 1538 edition.As set forth in this Dover edition, Holbein's prints are small - 2 inches by 1 inches (the same size as in the original) - and not as sharp or crisp as one would like (probably the result of deterioration of the original wood blocks used in 1538 to print the particular copy from which this facsimile was made). Still, this Dover edition is the only relatively affordable edition currently available that I know of, and the prints are of sufficient quality to make Holbein's genius and the underlying 16th-Century milieu readily accessible.Enhancing each print is the English translation of the lively and sometimes caustic quatrains from the original 1538 volume. For example, here is the quatrain for Print XVIII, \\"The Judge\\", which portrays skeletal death prying away the staff of office from a seated judge who is deciding a case between a poor man and a rich man, the latter reaching into his purse for some coins to give to the judge:\\"From out thy seat thou shalt be taken,So oft bribed to iniquity--Thy ill-got gains must be forsaken'No bribe can buy thy life from me.\\""},{"Title":"The dance of Death","review":"...You're going to need it to view these lovely but frustratingly tiny prints. I don't know why they are so little, they do deserve more size so one can appreciate how great they are. Many reviewers here lament the same condition. Does anyone know where the complete set can be had in a book that permits more than a squinty glimpse of these marvelous images? That would be well worth having. Some of the prints seem to be omitted from the series for some reason also. I remember seeing online \\"Death and the Drunkard\\", the skeleton pouring a tankard of ale down the unfortunate man's throat. Also \\"Death and the Idiot\\", Death playing a tune for him on some bagpipes, if I remember correctly."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"This book surprised me. People told me that, yeah, it was decent, but nothing to the Sevenwaters trilogy. I walked around it at the book store for nearly a year, thinking, I'll get it in paperback. I mean, I don't *really* want to read it. Finally, I gave in, got it. I've been reading some crappy books, lately. I was not expecting much here, either.Stupid, stupid me. I re-read the Sevenwaters books every few month, at least in pieces. It shocks me now that I could have expected anything but excellence from Wolfskin.The story is set in Norway and in Orkney, in the days of Vikings. The main character is, in fact, one of these northern warriors - the very best. He is a very simple man, is Eyvind. All he wants is to be a brave warrior for three, maybe five glorious years, and then to die a brave and glorious death. He is, for lack of a better word, wholesome. Despite the fact that he basically kills people for a living.When Eyvind is a boy, his brother brings home another boy child - Somerled - and asks Eyvind to teach this boy to be a man. Somerled is as complicated a person as Eyvind is simple; as unhappy as Eyvind is content; as brilliant as Eyvind is strong; as strong as Eyvind is brilliant - which is to say, not much. Nobody likes Somerled. Spending time with him loses Eyvind all his friends for the few months each year when Somerled is visiting. And yet... They become brothers, in more ways than one.Eventually, they grow up. Eyvind is the warrior he intended to be. Somerled seems to have a brilliant future at court. Everything seems right and just as it should be, except for some things that Somerled does - some things that are less than humane, less than conscionable - some things that are beyond Eyvind's ability to believe of his friend. Eyvind genuinely believes in the goodness of people and certainly in the goodness of his friend. He refuses to follow his suspicions to their logical conclusion. He refused to see the clues.An expedition mounts to sail across unknown waters, to find a place of rumors - a beautiful place, that promises advantages beyond count. Both men find themselves on the ships. Then, both men find themselves on the Light Isles, which are everything they could have expected or imagined. Here is a new place - a place for new beginnings, a place for opportunities, a place where a man like Somerled - weak, but brilliant - can have a worthy place. The only problem is that a place this beautiful has not been sitting unoccupied in the ocean all these years. It has a people and a long, deep history. There is a girl here, as beautiful as her land - Nessa. She sees in Eyvind more than he thinks of himself. And, soon enough, Eyvind begins to see things more clearly - all sorts of things, including his friend. And what he sees scared Eyvind, though he be a great, fearless warrior. It scares him and his bonds of brotherhood with Somerled begin to chafe. Unbearably.This is not an easy story to fit into your heart. It examines the worth of loyalty, the pain of betrayal, the necessity of denying love, and the strength required to do what is right. Nothing is over-exaggerated. Nothing is melodramatic. Nothing is predictable or obvious. Marillier has an extraordinary ability to capture life - the way it never seems to promise more than is already there, and the way things can change in the blink of an eye despite all expectations.Truly, I highly recommend this book. I can't wait for the second one, called Foxmask."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Having read The Sevenwaters Trilogy, I was somewhat nervous about reading this new effort by Marillier. Too often in the past, I have been disappointed by second series from an author. Not this time.I won't try to compare the two, as this is a more realistic painting, with less, though not empty of, the magical elements of the old myths and legends. It is an excellent psychological portrayal of disparate personalities, forged in totally different settings and cultures.Marillier's blending of historical reality and fantastical imagination was well paced, beautifully worded and ended with a combination of both hopefulness and a fear for the future. All the characters came vividly to life.The basis of the story is written in other reviews, but the beauty of the book is in how it is brought to life. There is no stereotyping, no simplistic escapes. There is no dumb Norseman, no feministic ranting, no male chauvanistic chest beating.For a reader who likes depth to his or her fantasy reading, who likes character and plot development over gory action, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Although I felt this was a strong foray into another world for Marillier, Wolfskin never ended up affecting me as strongly as her previous Sevenwaters trilogy. The book in general was an excellent read, with some extremely haunting parts regarding Somerled's acts that made the story more real for me. However, after bringing the story to an emotional height, Marillier still had about 100 pages to go, and those 100 felt a little too dragged out for me.Although the fate of the Isles still had to be decided by the end, I felt as though much of the tension and interaction between the main characters had already been resolved, leaving me a bit bored while waiting for the ending to fall into place. I would still recommend it as a good book -- just doesn't compare to her first trilogy."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I read and enjoyed Marillier's Sevenwaters Trilogy, but found Wolfskin to be an unsatisfactory follow-up. The language itself is beautiful, but sometimes I just got lost in it and had to surface for air. Anything that draws my eyes out of the book is not a good thing.I liked Eyvind, although he's not the sharpest tool in the shed, but, unlike some other reviewers here, I found Somerled to be completely unbelievable. He was straightforward evil. Boring. Marillier tries to make him conflicted, but she never showed me more than one act of kindness on his part in the entire novel. This doesn't make me feel that there is good inherent in him. I felt cheated. I felt like the other vikings were much too easily swayed to follow him.Also, I felt like she missed opportunities to truly show me people's reactions. With so many pages, there was ample opportunity, but her tendency to tell rather than show distances me as a reader.Overall, it had a good premise, but it fell short of expectations. On the positive side, I did finish the thing. If I really can't stand it, I just can't make myself plow through to the end."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Reading over the reviews other readers have given, I can see frustration in the lines. too little, too late, some say....can't find the good part, others say. If you've read the Sevenwaters Trillogy, and you expect this to be also the Sevenwaters Trilogy, then yes, you're to be frustrated.The main character is not so perfect, here. Indeed, a great deal of psychological and sociological ugliness happens in this book, and there's many times when you want to reach into the pages and grab necks and thump heads, but that is the power of Juliet Marillier's writing.The first chunck is slow. Yes, indeed. Painfully so. But folks, get past the first bit, and you won't be sorry.It's a story of the evolution of personal mentality and ethics and awareness that takes the book to span. The psychology is good. The characters breathe. It isn't a tidy story...the convenient thing doesn't happen, and it does not bend to the reader's want for instant and complete gratification.I ADORE this book, even more than Daughter of the Forest, because of that."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Overall I really enjoyed reading this book. The writing is beautiful, though not brilliant, and the story flows nicely with enough of a balance between action and character development.Probably the main reason why I wouldn't give this book five stars is because I feel that it doesn't quite live up to its potential. Marillier has plenty of wonderful ideas for plot and and characters, but at times I felt a little cheated, as though she had taken the 'easy way out'. For instance, I immediately liked the main character Eynvind and his introduction to an elite warrior society known as the Wolfskins. The fact that Eynvind's brother is already an extremely successful member of this group makes for an interesting situation, I thought (younger brother, wants to prove himself, has to live up to his older brother's example, etc.). Although there are trials to overcome for Eynvind, however, he moves through them relatively quickly and without major problems, becoming one of the leading warrior himself very soon.The ending is similarly promising, and similarly disappointing. Marillier sets up a numbers of problems and obstacles for Eynvind to overcome, and he indeed struggles for a while, but in the end all the problems seem to disappear rather too easily, without a sufficient explanation. It almost feels as if she had gotten bored or run out of steam and just wanted to finish the book as quickly as possible.As I said, I truly enjoyed this book overall and would recommend reading it, but I was not 100% satisfied."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"DON'T listen to the low reviews this book has gotten- wolfskin is positively magical. after reading wildwood dancing by juliet marillier, and being so struck by the beauty of her prose, i knew i HAD to read more. so i picked up wolfskin and was enthralled.wolfskin and its sequel, foxmask, which is just as incredible, if not BETTER, have become my two favorite books of all time. juliet spins these tales so mindblowingly that you can't put them down. wolfskin is similar to a classic fantasy novel- full of blood, sex, adventure, secrets, and magic- but there's so much more to it. it is the heartwrenching love story of two young people brought together by fate. it is the painful and joyous growth of a boy to a man. it is a story of the bonds of brotherhood, family and friendship, blood debts, and personal evolution. it's packed to the brim with drama, betrayal, sorrow, carnality, bloodlust, tricks and killings, marriages and births, and above all, destiny.not only did i thoroughly enjoy the captivating and effortlessly fluid stream of words that juliet has put together, but i fell in love with the characters and the settings, became obsessed with viking and pictish history, and truly questioned my own morals. you will find yourself crying and pounding your pillow and letting out little laughs of triumph. honestly, buy this book today. you'll LOVE it."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Eyvind lives in snowy Rogaland where the Viking warriors called Wolfskins are honored above all. Every waking minute he longs for the day when he is old enough and skilled enough with bow and sword to answer god Thor's call and become a Wolfskin himself. In his training, he meets Somerled, the small, strange brother of the respected chieftain Ulf, who has neither friends nor survival skills. Over a summer of fishing, hunting, and combat, they become blood brothers. And strangely, years later it is quiet, in-the-background Somerled who secures Eyvind's chance to earn his place as the King's right-hand Wolfskin on a risky expedition to find the mysterious Light Isles. Unbeknown to Eyvind there will not be much need for fighting at first, and Somerled's quietness belies the cunning, ambitious man underneath. The native Folk are peaceful people willing to share their cold, untouched land, and the first treaty Ulf agrees to is peace. But soon enough and under dire circumstances the Warfather Thor will call, and Eyvind won't be so sure to answer him. Worst of all Somerled is calling in his blood-sworn loyalty against the very rare beauty Eyvind's found worth loving and fighting for.This under-read historical novel set in Norway and the Orkney Islands by Juliet Marillier has cemented her place as one of my few beloved authors. Everything is here: the painstaking historical accuracy and attention to detail, the hard-won love story, and two protagonists overcoming great, dooming hardships of work and endurance before earning their bought and paid for happily ever after - all, of course, lined with the trademark magic of legend which naturally eases its way into the story. Again, these people and places feel like they exist, the events a part of history. Though Wolfskin builds slowly from Eyvind's boyhood to his departure on the grand Viking vessel Golden Dragon, the investment is worth the payoff. Evyind and Somerled's bond is something the reader experiences firsthand. Without it, our multifaceted understanding of Somerled's character and their relationship would not be possible. Instead of being black or white, I found it impossible to hate Somerled and rather sympathized with his plight. I also identified with simple-minded Eyvind and his conflicted honor. Like him we all underestimate our own potential and capacity for greatness. Ignoring the tiny pain I feel in reading the last book in Marillier's backlist I can not wait to open Foxmask."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I hopped into this tale shortly after reading the last book in Marillier's Sevenwaters Trilogy (Child of the Prophecy), having still been in the nostalgic mood for her stories and characterizations. Unfortunately, this book does not live up to her earlier efforts.Before I go into that, however, I would still like to exort Marillier's good qualities-- they do make an appearance. She is a very good researcher and folklorist, with an excellent grasp on names and places. The reader will actually be able to see the oceans and valleys and forests in which the story takes place, and have fun slipping the tongue around names like Hafnarvagr and Tadhg. Interesting, too, is the exploration of three religions: Nessa's mysteries (mostly made up by Marillier in this case, but fascinating nonetheless), Norse religion, and Christianity. Marillier resists the two most common (and thence, boring) depictions of Christians in such novels: either they are evil, or they are good heretics. Brother Tadhg has a Bishop of D--- feel, and Marillier's conversations between the priestess, Nessa, and the holy brother are some of the most interesting passages in the book.Granted, there are problems with this novel that made it intensely boring to me as a read, overall. The first were lines like \\"Stupid young fool!\\" What is the definition of \\"fool\\", but \\"stupid\\"? There were several instances of bad editing like this scattered throughout the tale.The second problem was that of unrealistic trials. Several times in the story, a character is put on trial. They have a painfully modern feel: too often the basis is on hard facts, the words \\"premeditated fratricide\\" occur (did the Norse have a worse penalty for premeditated murder?), there are advocates like lawyers, and the phrase \\"a man has the right to remain silent\\" was actually said. While these are not blaring difficulties, it did make me wonder how much research Marillier bothered to do into Norse trials. She certainly had the penalties down-- usually money in compensation for injury. The trials themselves, though? I'll have to do a little research of my own.The third is perhaps my biggest problem with this book: two-dimensional \\"good\\" and \\"bad\\" characters, who are quite predictable and come to their conclusions too easily. Somerled was a particular disappointment. Marillier could have played up his good qualities in Eyvind's eyes-- could have made him something other than the entirely twisted boy who was obviously going to cause trouble at the beginning of the book (the prophecy of his becoming a king, far from helping this inevitability, makes it even more obvious). His utter inhumanness could have been a surprise to Eyvind-- after all, it is said many times in the book that Eyvind is incapable of understanding deceit and wicked acts. Why would a reader who is seeing through Eyvind's eyes never have a shred of compassion for Somerled? It is unfair to both characters.The love story, while not wholely without reason, was so archtypical of Marillier's writing that I confess, after having read her previous trilogy, to have been utterly uninterested. The magical woman and the outsider man fall in love. I have seen it before. In every single Marillier book.Prophecy and divination are also used too freely. I know that it is a question of style, but clear-cut prophecies such as Marillier's only make the story easier to predict. She is not good at using foreshadowing without making it obvious. Subtlety is lacking here, as it was in her characters. What I would have liked to see is more on the three religions-- particularly that of the Norse. When our brave adventurers make it to the islands of the Folk, we suddenly stop seeing anything mystical to do with the Norse at all-- merely an occassional invocation to Thor or Odin. And if powers like the Seal Tribe and the Hidden Tribe work for Nessa, why doesn't Thor really work for Eyvind? One wonders if only Nessa's ancient gods exist, and Eyvind and Tadhg are deluding themselves.An interplay between them would have been more interesting.All in all, Wolfskin created a vast cornucopia of disappointments. I will still buy its sequel, but I will no longer expect the tale to knock me to the floor. Meanwhile, if you want to read anything by Marillier, I'd suggest the Sevenwaters Trilogy."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"After finishing the Sevenwaters trilogy, I was eager to read her other books, but hesitant as well. Although the beginning of this book got a bit long describing Evyind's life, I understood that it laid down a foundation for the rest. I enjoyed the romance much more in this book than her Sevenwaters trilogy. There was more leading to the romance and less abrupt in the coming together of the two people. Although I'd like some new material from Ms. Marillier rather than just having a heroine nurse a hero back to health all the time (like most of her other books). I enjoyed it at first but would like something new and maybe some more obvious romantic tension (kinda like in this book but more). Additionally, I liked how she wrote a little bit about the life they lead after coming together (some books just end at the part where the couple gets together and it always leaves me curious to know more). There were some cheesy parts in this book but it was a good, leaves-a-goofy-grin-on-your-face cheesy. Something I'd like to read in her sequel is about the life Evyind and Nessa have together and not just cutting straight to their children. It's a bit depressing to read about the people, who you cheered for in the previous book, die or become minor characters. I'm sure their lives can still be interesting and challenging after they come together... Thus far, my favorite book from Ms. Marillier is the first book in the Sevenwaters Trilogy (Daughter of the Forest) though it could've had more romance earlier, the characters and situation pulled me in and made it very interesting. Overall, I have really enjoyed Ms. Marillier's books and hope to read more in the future!"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I think that this book was very good, i finished it in like 1 day and I don't normally do that. I usually go and hang out with friends but I believed that this book was kind of historical in the fact that it relates closely to Christopher Columbus and explained the differences of culture. I felt that this relates to the past world in the times of imperialism. The difference of cultures and the desire to follow your dream and create your own place that you can get away to."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"A second star only because it is about vikings. This is a moronically simple tale full of ludicrous characters and plot-lines, told in a clumsy, heavy-handed style. The main character is dumb, beautiful, and ever-conscious of the rights of women, and he also happens to be a berserker. As was the case with Daughter of the Forest, the author seems to think it's important to let us know how well-endowed her male characters are, i.e., &quot;I see why they call you 'the little ox' ! &quot;."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"If you liked Marillier's previous sophomoric efforts, you'll love this. In addition to being the same dumb, hackneyed story lines and stock characters we are used to from the previous books, this one has the additional feeling of being pure romance novel stuffing. I mean, come on, so this gorgeous hunk of man who is so civilized and nice to the ladies is a berserker?! Fabio should have been on this cover. Anyone who would read this, I guess, has already read the previous lame offerings by this author and doesn't object to laughably contrived plots which rely heavily on coincidence, caricatures who grow or change through jarringly modern pop psychology processes, and historical detail that sounds like it was lifted from other bad fantasy novels rather than any real scholarship. So go for it. But please, if you want something exciting that will also make you think, look at the really good fantasy and historical fiction efforts out there--Gillian Bradshaw, A.A. Attanasio, Dorothy Dunnet, Sharon Kay Penman, Charlotte M. Yonge, Margaret Elphinstone, or Barbara Taylor Bradford to name just a very few..."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Comparisons to Marillier's first books, Daughter of the Forest et al., are inevitable. I'm not much of a fantasy reader - the cheesy novel covers and melodramatic plot summaries on the back covers usually turn me off. But I do love historical fiction, and so I picked up that series on the advice of a friend. I was astounded and bewitched the quality of writing in all three novels. I'd heard the fairy tale of the swans as a child, and it was a delight to relive it as fleshed out on the page by Marillier, and to see how she imagined the continuation of the legend in the two equally excellent sequels.However, I was less than impressed with Wolfskin - even though, as one reviewer mentions, it is still very good compared to most fiction out there. Marillier really has a magical style of writing that draws you into another world. It is so utterly romantic. I also love the themes that seem to be a common thread throughout her novels - respect for the earth, respect for other peoples and other beliefs. I wish the Bush administration would read her novels; perhaps it would awaken some humanity in them.While the things I loved about her first novels are still present in Wolfskin, there's such a thing as too much of a good thing, and it's this quality that ultimately means I can only give 3 stars. First of all, while the novel starts out well, the second half of the book really drags. Most notable is the entire section of the plot when Eyvind is taking refuge with Nessa and Rona. There is just too much dialogue and description, and too little action, which weakens the pacing and the reader's interest tremendously. At least 100 pages could have been shaved off of the last half of the book, without losing any of the intriguing plot twists and character development. Even the characters grow weary of it - during one particularly lengthy debate towards the end, Somerled growls something akin to, \\"Can we get on with it already?!\\" Amen, brother.Another weakness is constant repetition. For instance - and this just might be my little quirk - must we really be reminded thirty or so times through the book that Kinart is Nessa's cousin?Despite these criticisms, Wolfskin is still an entertaining read. It's an interesting story with profound themes, and the characterizations are also well-done. The exception is Nessa, who isn't very original. Most of the time, she seems to be almost a Xerox copy of Sorcha or Liadan from Daughter of the Forest and Son of the Shadows, respectively. However, the interplay between Somerled and Eyvind - or should I say power play - is fascinating. Marillier portrays Eyvind's inner conflict - as he struggles between his violent Viking identity and the awakening of more pacifist beliefs, between his oath of loyalty to Somerled and what he knows to be right and just - with true finesse.I didn't know much about the Vikings at all before I started reading this book, but this fictional rendering of their colonization of Orkney has prompted me to want to begin learning more about them. (Note: There's a historical note at the end of the novel that provides good background to the story. It's meant to be read at the end, I suppose, but I wish I'd read it before starting the novel, since it provides some valuable context.)"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Marillier is a very talented writer, and anything she has written would be a good experence. Although, I didn't care for the characters in this particular novel. The viking hero was just too dumb. It made the story a bit unbelievable. The beginning and ending are slow. Marillier takes a lot of time setting up the character and wrapping things up. I simply scanned at these points. The rest of the book was interesting and I wouldn't mind reading a second if Marillier decided to make this into a series.I know I didn't make this novel out to be worth anyones time, but I like to repeat, Marillier is a good writer. My suggestion is to read her trilogy (Child of the Prophesy, etc.)"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I have been a fan of Juliet Marillier since I read the Sevenwaters Trilogy. This book is another example of how Marillier blends real life with fantasy to create a new world. Her characters are very real. Their flaws are human flaws that many people can relate to. I was very impressed with this book and look forward to reading _Foxmask_."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I can't wait for book 2. I found this Sunday at my local Barnes and Noble...took it to my favourite pub, and was so engrossed I let my beer get warm *lol*. Before I knew it I was halfway through and finished it last night. Evyi and Nessa made for fine hero's in the tale. Somerled, while twisted and devious, had a certian spark that you can't help but hope he comes around. Once again Marillier has struck gold....."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I adored \\"Daughter of the Forest.\\" Sorcha was an achingly human heroine, with all her faults and virtues, and her struggle to redeem her brothers from their stepmother's curse was heartbreaking. The remaining two books of the \\"Sevenwaters Trilogy\\" weren't quite as well done, but beautifully completed the tale.So, I eagerly looked forward to Ms. Mariller's next tale. What a disappointment. Instead of a vulnerable, yet strong heroine, we get a dumb lummox. Eyvind only wanted to be a Beserker, an exceptionally violent Viking warrior who would sacrifice his conscious choices to kill in service of Thor and his king. So...dumb obedience replaces conscience. Or, as Sommerled, his cunningly manipulative and amoral friend would say, Don't try to think...you're not any good at it. Sommerled, the villain, is the more interesting of the two, in his straightforward dedication to making himself king of the Isles. He lies, murders, outwits, and manipulates everyone around him. Those who see through him either die, or quietly escape. Evyind, however, because Sommerled manipulated him into a \\"Blood Brothers Forever\\" type oath as a child, continues to blindly believe the best of Sommerled long past the point of the reader's screaming frustration. With the help of Nessa, a native priestess of the Isles, Evyind finally gets a clue about Sommerled's true nature...but not until murder, betrayals, and bloodshed have permanently damaged the Isles. Thanks Eyvind...but too little too late for me.Forget this one and read \\"Daughter of the Forest\\" for a heroine you can believe in."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I read the first two Bridei Chronicles books before Wolfskin, and I /thank the gods/ that Marillier was able to shed some disappointing qualities in this series for her next series, the Bridei Chronicles, because--truly, this was a disappointment.I found myself wanting to tear out pages, as well as throw the book, asking myself, \\"God, when will this **** be over?\\" I find myself relating many parts of the book to a scenario that many of you may be familiar with: \\"What do you want to do?\\" \\"I don't know, what do you want to do?\\" And, in between all those chunks of the book, are chunks of embarrassingly corny scenes involving an extremely feminine male. So far it's SO easy to acknowledge that the writer is a female and doesn't wish for the book to end at any necessary point, but be dragged on with crap thats almost like \\"I love you, I love you too, I love you, I love you too.\\" One thing I like about many other books and movies is that there is a climax, and then a nice \\"general\\" ending that doesn't need to tie *every* loose end with a couple more pages of M_o_n_o_t_o_n_y, but allows the reader to understand with a well-planned sentence, or leave it to their own imagination. I wish so much that there were pages that either were omitted or had a post-it note saying \\"Skip to page ##.\\"Words I would use to describe this book:Monotony, corny/cheesy, dragged-out, stressful.Again, I've read the first two Bridei Chronicles (waiting for the third to be released mass-market), and they were excellent compared to this series. Skip this series if you're new to her writings and go straight for the Bridei Chronicles--unless you're looking for a Romance Novel with a feminine male. 3 out of 5 stars is *generous*."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"In comparison to most novels, this perhaps deserves more than 4 stars. But in comparison to Marillier's other novels, I have to own I was a bit disappointed.The story does draw you in and hold you, but the expectations created by the Sevenwaters Trilogy didn't quite hold up."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I couldnt put it down.... Well worth a read!"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Although I personally preferred the Sevenwater series, Wolfskin was a great book with many of the same characteristics as her previous series. If you want to know what it is about the best way is to go to Juliet Marillier's Website."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"This is a moronically simple tale full of ludicrous characters and plot-lines, told in a clumsy, heavy-handed style. The main character is dumb, beautiful, and ever-conscious of the rights of women, and he also happens to be a berserker. As was the case with Daughter of the Forest, the author seems to think it's important to let us know how well-endowed her male characters are, e.g., \\"I see why they call you 'the little ox' ! \\"."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"This is the story of a brave Pictish (Scottish) girl who falls in love with a dumb, strong Norse invader. I love Marillier's writing, but this book could have been so much more! It comes across as a very pale imitation of her first novel, Daughter of the Forest. Do yourself a favor and read that one instead."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"While reading this book one scenario kept popping into my head. A group of children say all about eleven years old, goes on a walk to an abandoned field. Once there, they set up their own little world, totally cut off from adult supervision. The child among them most interested in law and rule is somehow removed. What happens to the truth in this group of children? Left all alone will they act as they should, with morals, or fall into a pit of desperation? Will the strong bully the weak and allow power to solely rule the people? What role with fairness, wisdom truth and standing up for what is right hold in this new world?That sounds a lot like Lord of Flies (not that I've ever read it) but it's also what happens in this book, about Vikings. A settlement to a far off island, already peopled, heads in a terrible direction when those interested in peace are removed, and everyone left falls under the spell of blindly following the leader. This novels deals with truth, redemption, and quite a bit about faith. Specifically, when does blind faith, or trust, cross a line that prevents free thought? How far can we go in our faith to anything? How much does truth matter compared to trust and faith and keeping your word? This is also a fairly dark book, but reminds us that there is always light in truth.Like all of this authors books the writing is beautiful. I felt this was a much more complicated novel then anything she's written before, especially with the subtext of the book. The plot also seems to be more complicated, even if it is a bit like something out of a fairy tale and thus fairly predictable. I did get annoyed with the latest in this authors never ending stream of amazingly wise, competent, beautiful and powerful 16 or 17 year old girls. An older heroine would be nice.This made me think, so four stars. I'll read the sequel, but this will never be one of my favorite novels. I did learn a lot about Vikings, especially the faith element of the so called \\"berserkers\\", and the way their life of war was viewed."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"While, having read Juliet Marillier's Wolfskin, I am personally conflicted, I would not recommend this book to others simply because its promising first half dwindles and deteriorates into a boring and unsatisfying second portion of the novel.The issue here is becoming too interested during the first half. The main character, Eyvind, is decidedly milquetoast and nonsensical from the first, being a berserker with a heart of gold (eventually to become an anachronistic women's rights advocate, but more on that later). He's pretty insipid, to the point of not being able to put simple two and obvious two together on repeated occasions, which gets frustrating as the novel goes on. But aside from this, the plot at first seems to be really going somewhere. The villain, Somerled, promises to be a complex and intriguing character, and the voyage to an uncharted land is engaging enough to put the flaws of Eyvind's character in the background for a while.Then, all of a sudden, we are introduced to a surprise heroin, well after she should've been introduced. As a result, it's hard to become attached to such a new and unexpected character, and the fact's not at all mitigated by Nessa herself. She's a Mary-Sueish, typical pagan priestess type, who is unfortunately, astoundingly uninteresting. Needless to say, Nessa and Eyvind make a perfect pair. Eyvind realizes he no longer wishes to indiscriminately lob off people's heads or hack them in half. He wants to spend the rest of his life with Nessa, and that means protecting her people from Somerled's cruel schemes. At which point, I was thinking, \\"Oh, please!\\" Eyvind is very progressive for a berserker; suddenly he's all about social justice and treating women right.As if this weren't disappointing enough for a book that began so well, Somerled, the most interesting of them all, devolves into an evil caricature. I'm not really sure what the whole point of Lady Margaret, another interesting character who seemed to be Somerled's equal in cleverness, was in the end either.I will also second what other reviewers said about excessive dialogue and drawn-out romantic passages of Eyvind and Nessa proclaiming their love to each other. Not only was this cheesy and cringe-inducing, it was also needless to the plot and did nothing for character development, which would've been sorely needed help. Overall, the book was a disappointment for me, especially because I was so invested in the story at first. Wolfskin had great potential; unfortunately, it was wasted."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Wolfskin earns a high 3 star review, more like 3 stars. I liked 70 percent of it. It is the first novel that I have read from Juliet Marillier, but it will not be the last. Wolfskin makes me want to read more of her work, which means the novel did its job.At the heart of Wolfskin are its protagonists, Eyvind and Nessa; both are wonderfully drawn characters. I sense that the author cares for her characters; this affection comes to the surface in her sensitive portrayals. Because she cares for them, the encounters with each other never seem contrived or out of place.I also like how Marillier writes with refreshing earnestness. She attempts no misdirection or reader manipulation. She just tells the story simply, often with memorable imagery, and she lets the characters speak for themselves rather than resort to narrative exposition.Wolfskin is a straightforward story, which is a strength and a weakness in my opinion. The novel has no dramatic twists, which can be a good thing. On one hand, it allows the reader to focus on the characters and their growth. This novel needs no plot devices or gimmicks. On the other hand, the storyline is predictable; you know what will happen before the characters do, since there are no surprises or shocks.I think that the author could have explored Somerled's character further, especially the reasons for his actions. His environment must have impacted his character. A weak, sick boy would not strive in a masculine, Norse society unless he developed certain characteristics. It would have made him more sympathetic, at least. Also, the novel felt a little too long. The pace drags in the middle and the ending seemed stretched out.I look forward to reading more of Marillier's novels."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I was not disappointed with this offering from Marillier. Although I admit, I do prefer the Sevenwaters trilogy offerings, Wolfskin was an exciting and interesting tale of Viking and Scottish lore. I wish more background had been given on the Somerland character as he was a very dark and interesting character but overall, I was satisfied with the mystery left surrounding him. Definitely worth a read."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Is what I can say for one of those books I can bear to finish within a day. I haven't read any of the author's other works, so I can't compare.The story starts out with a promising concept; the friendship between the boys Eyvind and Somerled, Eyvind's dreams (as straightforward as they may be)...but it goes a bit downhill the moment the passages begin to 'tell', telling of how the boy got accepted easily into the ranks of the Wolfskin, and so on and so forth. Whatever magic there might have been between Eyvind and Somerled was lost in-between praises and women and mentions of 'little ox'. I could scarcely believe, at that point, that they WERE friends.Everything happens a little too fast from there on. Focus was given on subjects that shouldn't matter, while we lose our sights on Somerled. *He* was the reason I even got to the story so far, but by then I was beginning to lose hopes that the author would ever get back on *him* and not remain on the 'evil shadow' that he becomes. It seems as if the author tried too hard on making him hateable (and by there she succeeded greatly). Every time a 'bond' between him and Eyvind was mentioned, I was apt to go, \\"Huh?\\" and backtrack JUST to remind myself there had been.Eyvind as a character himself I have no true problems with. But again, I liked him better as a child than as an adult.The language is beautiful at times, and tedious at others. The dialogue is clumsy and laughable, corny even. The characters talk way too much. Sometimes I felt like shooting them, just to get them to shut the hell up. They talked way too much about feelings. They reasoned too much (often a sign of insecurity on the writer's part). What the hell was that Nassa blabbing about before they made love the first time? Who talks that much in the heat of emotion? Every time someone began to talk, I would glance down, and tell myself, \\"No way can someone talk for most of a page! That's not possible!\\" The last few parts reminded me of many a movie, only I couldn't help but ask myself WHY such a thing was in fantasy--you know, the courtroom scene. Nevermind that we've talked the whole story through--no, for a better climax, let's all TALK some more! Up till the end they were yapping away.I liked the story, true enough, though now that I've written this review I can't really see why. But like always, I say, judge it for yourself, if the faults seem like the type of thing you can stand. It is a decent story, better than some in the genre that I have read, though you do have to try and keep a straight face at times."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Reading through all the other reviews a second time I understand that this great book cannot compare to Daughter of the Forrest. But compared to all the other books I have read this one is still an excellent read.I was compelled to write this review in order to urge people to read this book and not be put off (like I was) by some of the bad reviews. I was also angered to find after finishing the book that the 'dumb' hero never turned up through-out it, like I was told he would. Eyvind was not smart - he was wise. If you fail to see that then you are merely being drawn in by Somerled's words. Somerled - a man who is not at all wise, although he is wily and clever with words. Euvi had a dream to be a warrior - why is that so stupid? To believe in a God of war and to actually have a dream, which is more than some people, is amazing. Infact thats what he and Somerled shared - a dream. The fact that many people scorn those whose dreams are deemed 'stupid' shows how narrow-minded and cruel these people are. Any dream is great in itself.This story is not as good as Marillier's other series but it is still a delight to read. There are common plots and themes throught these two series but the mere fact of a different setting and race (like Vikings) make Wolfskin enjoyable.I look forward to reading Foxmask, the second book that follows, which is also not unlike the Sevenwaters trilogy in its link between children to continue the story."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Ulf, already a Viking warrior Wolfskin, learns about a magical place across the sea. Believing there must be plenty of treasure and a chance to do honorable deeds in Thor's name, he decides to sail for the Orkney Islands. Young Eyvind sees this as his chance to become a Wolfskin and pleads his way onto the crew.They reach this land, but find friendly people led by a kind-hearted king Angus who are willing to share their bounty with the \\"invaders\\". Eyvind meets the monarch's niece, the seer Nessa and falls in love but though attracted she does not trust the newcomers. Eyvind's new happiness is tested when his heart friend, Somerled, invokes their childhood blood oath of lifelong loyalty. Somerled's demand places Eyvind in a tug between honor andlove exacerbated by a disease that ravages the natives Folks, but not the Norsemen which leading to enmity and perhaps war between the two groups.Juliet Marillier takes her audience to the same Dark Ages that is the focus of many of her novels with this deep gritty tale. WOLFSKIN takes no prisoners as the audience observes a hostile world even when the two groups forge an alliance. The key to this powerful historical is the cast as Eyvind, Nessa, and Somerled seem genuine and their \\"triangle\\" makes for great insightful reading. Ms. Marillier shows why she is among the top writers of historical fantasy with a fabulous opening novel that will excite readers with its depth.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"This book is one of the most interesting books of historical literature I have read in a long time.

I really enjoy this author's work!"},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I loved the Sevenwaters Trilogy and when I found out Marillier had written another book I ran to get it. I started reading it but it did not grip me the way Sevenwaters did. It took me quite awhile to finish it and I just was not left with the urge to read more. It is a good book and I'm glas I read it but there is something lacking."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Juliette Marillier writes wonderful stories that take historical settings, folklore, romance, adventure, intrigue and suspense, all wrapped into the most beautiful stories I've read. The style in which she writes allows you to imagine so much so that you can really get wrapped into the stories. I can never put her books down. The characters are well developed, interesting, exciting, and can really capture your heart. Did I mention I hate reading? Before this author I never read unless required by school. I would recommend these books to EVERYONE. I LOVE THEM!!! I have read 13 of Marillier's books, and I'll keep reading them as long as she keeps writing them."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"This begins as almost a Shakeapearean tragedy and is more of a character study than a fairy story like Daughter of the Forest was. The book describes the relationship between Somerled and the protagonist Eyvind from when they first meet as boys and follows it as the dark consequences of their childhood bond unfolds, the boys growing into extremely different men. Despite the incompatibility between Somerled's cerebral, manipulative, power hungry, psychopathic personality and Eyvind's identity as a trusting, simple warrior, the two are bound together by history and loyalty.The book still contains magical elements, beautiful writing, and a love story, but it's very different from the Sevenwaters series. For one thing the protagonist is male, and the story in general is much more bleak and depressing. Don't read this book if you don't want to be awash in a pervading sense of doom for almost the whole story, something that made this book hard for me to get into- I didn't read Wolfskin until after I read Foxmask, which will be more familiar and romantic to fans of the Sevenwaters series, though still much darker. That being said, this is still a great book. It just doesn't conform to the expectations I had after reading the Sevenwaters series."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"Unlike most of the readers who have reviewed this book, I found it much surpassed Marillier's first series. I had trouble getting into the author's first trilogy and it never really sang to me. I was hesitant to pick up any more of her novels, but the setting of this one made it hard for me to pass by. In this book Marillier has interpreted one of my favorite and one of the darker tales of folklore - the story of the bone harp. In the classic tale 2 sisters fall in love with the same man and one kills the other by pushing her in the river. A minstrel later finds the bones and they speak to him, instructing him to make a harp of the bones so they can speak to others. In the end he turns up at the living sister's home and the harp plays the story of how the second sister was killed. This novel is much more complex and very different from that brief story - a weaving of many folktales, legends of the Orkney and Norse cultures and historical events. It is both a skillfull and beautiful weaving of the dark and light natures within humanity. The companion book \\"Foxmask\\" is equally wonderful and will tie up some of the loose ends for those who were unhappy with the more open finish of this book. For me it will ever be favorite standby, a book to return to again and again."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"After reading the first fifty pages of this book, I feared I wasn't going to finish it. The pacing was somewhat slow, and I wasn't all that gripped by the characters. Thankfully, I'd read Marillier's Sevenwaters series, and knew enough of this author to give her a chance. Marillier's books are typically a little slow to begin with, but totally rewarding by the end.Wolfskin did certainly get good. It took its time, but once things started happening, I found it to be a real page-turner. Whilst definitely not as good as the Sevenwaters series, Wolfskin is still definitely a rewarding read for those patient enough to stick with it.I liked the characters. Despite my reservations about the main character (I feared he would be very cliche and lacking personality) I came to care about him immensely. I don't want to say too much of the other characters, for fear of spoilers. I will say that I found them each to be interesting and believable.The plot was nicely paced, and satisfying. Though I must say I had the ending figured out, I did not mind that it was predictable. It felt right and fitting that it should be the way it was.Although not as good as some of Marillier's other works, Wolfskin is still definitely a highly recommended read."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I found Juliet Marillier a few months ago and have read all of her books now except Foxmask. She is now my favorite author! I was a little disappointed at first in Wolfskin and partly it is my preferences. I have never been interested in the Vikings and a little turned off by them. I am more interested in the settings of her other novels, but I kept reading. I was not disappointed! I would give the first half of this book a 3 but the last half a 5 - more if there were more to give. Once they were in Orkney and Nessa entered the story I could not put this book down. I finished it after one in the morning. The characters, once developed are incredible from Somerled who I wanted to find some redeeming characteristics in but never did to the great hero and heroine. LOVED the way it developed. I will re-read this some time in the future and am betting I will enjoy the first half better than as I know it was necessary in order for me to really understand.

Eyvind was likable enough, but a little too dense to truly sympathize with. Nessa never really has time to develop into a strong character. This is a book I enjoyed reading, but I'm not likely to pick it up again."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"WOLFSKIN is the fourth offering from extraordinary historical novelist Juliet Marillier, and if she can continue in the tradition she has established thus far, I have hope for many more. Ms. Marillier has a gift for spinning tales such as one might hear from a particularly skilled storyteller of old, sitting with friends and family around a fire on a long winter night hundreds of years ago. We don't have many such professional bards today, but we have not lost our taste for good stories, nor our need of people to tell them. In our modern world, the printed word has reached its highest known distribution, and our modern bards have turned to that medium to entertain and to teach us with their tales. Ms. Marillier's Sevenwaters Trilogy (which, if you have not yet, you must read) is a collection of such powerful stories, and her newest offering, WOLFSKIN, is nearly as good.The unlikely hero of the story is a Viking &quot;Berserker,&quot; one of the legendary Norse warriors who went shrieking into the forefront of battle, blindly and lethally courageous. Its heroine is a young woman -- a daughter of the royal line and a priestess of the mysteries -- who belongs to an ancient people of the Orkney islands, a people so shadowed by history that we know little about them today. Other characters include the brave and tragic king of the Orkneys, a Viking chieftain with a bold dream of settlement in a far off land, and the warrior's clever and dangerous friend, who has saved his life and sworn with him a bond of brotherhood in blood, and who does not hesitate to call in his debts. How these characters come together is a long tale of friendship, sorrow, rage, grief, terror, magic, and deepest love. It is an exploration of the value of life and the strength of a promise made.Compared to other works of historical fiction, WOLFSKIN ranks with the very best. Compared to the Sevenwaters Trilogy, which is perhaps the most powerful and compelling fiction I have read, it is very slightly lacking. Some elements of plot seem to pass too quickly, and the reader is left wondering why, if they were so important, they were over with so little ceremony. Sometimes that effect seems to me intentional, meant to make us feel as the characters do, but at others it disrupts the flow of an otherwise excellent story.As for the characters, they lack nothing; they live in your mind even when the book is not in front of you, and as usual what makes Ms. Marillier's tale so powerful is the sheer emotional impact. If you spend time with this book and you have feelings, you will cry. You may laugh and sigh and otherwise feel what goes on, but Ms. Marillier specializes in sorrow, and this book cannot be experienced without tears -- of eyes or heart, or both. I would recommend plenty of time and perhaps some tissues to hand as you really get into the story. If you are separated from a loved one, you might want to wait until he or she is back with you before you begin; this is a tale of many kinds of heartbreak. It's easy to think I'm exaggerating here, but the power of human emotion is perhaps the greatest on earth: it makes us what we are, and shapes our world and our lives. This story is about that, in a way, and our reactions to it, and to others, are about that power, too."},{"Title":"Wolfskin","review":"I loved the Sevenwaters Trilogy so much but this book is just horrible. I tried so hard to like it that I actually read to page 225 which is way beyond my normal commitment to a dumb book. The 3 primary characters are either disgustingly evil, a gorgeous dumb murderer/warrior, or a too late in arriving heroine --- too late to save my interest. I stopped just about where she was going to \\"save\\" him --- this theme felt to similar to Liadan saving the Painted Man in the Son of the Shadows book. At least the murdering Painted Man seemed smart before he was reformed."},{"Title":"They Call Me Agnes: Crow Narrative Based on the Life of Agnes Yellowtail Deernose, A","review":"&quot;They Call Me Agnes&quot; is a very personal recount of the life of Agnes Yellowtail Deernose, a Crow woman growing up in the first few generations of reservation Indians. The book is centered around the accounts of Agnes, although the author took some liberties in inserting historical information from field research. Because the book is not about the tribe as a whole, it is not ideal for learning about the Crow as a whole, but is a wonderful resouce for gaining insight on the impact that the enstatement of reservations had on Indian life and the struggles that were faced. The book deals with changing lifestyles and struggles montetarily, religiously and racially. Be aware that because the editor was from anthropolical background, there may be some misinterpretations of things due to the scientific way of looking at things.

There's very little on technique and not a single trick for churning out cute landscapes. What it offers is image after image of suberbly crafted landscapes, images worth studying again and again. His handling of values, and the subtle variations of hue, temperature, and intensity within each value shape, are absolutely masterful. Clearly, he practices what he preaches: landscapes which blend artistic invention with an acute observation of what exists in the landscape.

The book is filled with example after example of his artwork and if you like Crozier's style and approach towards landscape painting, this book will be a joy.I, however, am not too happy with his choice of subjects. I'll explain. In the text there are numerous painting of fairly featureless hillsides, explorations of both man-created landscape and naturally occuring symmetrical landscapes, and quite a fair number of landscapes with palettes that seem somewhat dull (but mostly likely quite accurate). While many of these painting he pulls off nicely, too many of them are paintings only another artist could fully appreciate."},{"Title":"Inventing the Landscape: From Plein Air Study to Studio Painting","review":"I am a new painter interested in doing landscapes, and I like his book because he paints (painted?) land not far from me -- the same kinds of woods, hills, trees. His discussions of how he paints both outdoors and in the studio, how he chooses subjects, what appealed to him in a particular painting, are helpful if brief. He does wonderful work with color and texture and simple, straightforward composition. The reproduction on the cover is not particularly representative of his work, which is not nearly this abstract. There are many, many pictures inside, Some of them are reproduced rather small, but many are full page and well worth studying."},{"Title":"Technologies and Methodologies for Evaluating Information Technology in Business","review":"Charles Davis has compiled a set of timely articles related to the evaluation of information technology (IT).

Dr. Davis correctly identified the need for several interlocking models to adequately broach information technology evaluation.As a software testing professional, I was especially interested in the Balanced Scorecard measurement framework. It underscores the importance of complete, well written requirements for the success of all IT development projects. By strong implication, the Balanced Scorecard underscores the importance of thorough testing of requirements before any detailed software planning is begun.

The lead \\"detective\\" character is an English psychiatrist, Mrs. Bradley, who is a bit eccentric but who moves in circles of a certain class -- upper middle class, it seems. The setting for this mystery is a minor English \\"public\\" school (what we Americans would call a private prep or boarding school) set in the village of Spey. Mrs. Bradley has come to this village looking for a book of magic written by one of her ancestors, who was a witch. She believes a present-day witch in the village, also a descendent of the elder witch, has the book.Before she can obtain the book, however, one of the teachers (masters, as they call them) in the school is found dead, apparently murdered, and somehow or another, Mrs. Bradley ends up assisting the school and the police in solving the crime. The deceased had many enemies, so the list of suspects is quite long -- after all, there are all these teachers and students living together in this school. Mrs. Bradley -- sometimes with the aid of the police or one of the school faculty -- interrogate a number of people until in the final pages, the killer is revealed.I found the style of the book a bit irritating, particularly the scenes with the village witch, who is given to talking like one of the witches in MacBeth -- confusing, cryptic statements that you have trouble understanding. Mrs. Bradley is given to responding in kind, compounding the work for the reader in trying to figure out what they're saying.The mystery itself was quite well plotted and that part of the book I enjoyed well enough that I intend to read more in the series."},{"Title":"Tom Brown's Body","review":"Gladys Mitchell is often linked with Agatha Christie and Dorothy Sayers as the three queens of the Golden Age of Mystery, but in reality Mitchell was not as well known or published in the United States. Thanks to the British Broadcasting System, however, many of her stories have found their way into feature film, with Dame Diana Rigg playing the part of Beatrice Bradley. Mitchell was a teacher of English, history and games at several British public (in reality private) schools. She was made a member of the Detection Club in 1933, and in 1976 she was awarded the Crime Writers' Association's Silver Dagger.Beatrice Bradley is hot on the trail of a witch in the village of Spey, who she believes has in her possession a book written by one of her female relations. But she is waylaid by a friend on the Board of Governors of a local school to investigate a recent murder. The victim is almost universally disliked by his colleagues, but murder is murder. The school boasts the usual population of mischievous boys, and two of them might have real knowledge of the murder. Ms. Bradley joins her favorite nephew from Scotland Yard, Detective Inspector David Gavin, and the fun begins:\\"'You, yourself, not to mention your sister, had actually been out of the house and at the Roman bath that night,' she gravely explained, 'and therefore you wanted to be sure that the police not suspect you of having murdered Mr. Conway.''Oh, nonsense!' said Mr. Loveday, with unusual vigor. 'We could scarcely have known that somebody would attack and drown poor Conway on a night when we were out of the house! By putting my house in order, as I believe I termed it, I merely wished to be certain that none of my boys could be held blameworthy. It was a very great shock to me when I was told that Merrys and Skene had been absent from the house one night not long before the event.'\\"Gladys Mitchell contrives to turn TOM BROWN'S BODY into a whodunit twister and succeeds. From the first page she presents the reader with a whodunit barnstormer. Everyone is a suspect, and the real murderer does not emerge until Mitchell allows it.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"Tom Brown's Body","review":"Set in a boarding school for boys this is a brilliant example of Gladys Mitchell's Mrs Bradley mysteries. The boys themselves are well drawn as are the masters and the murder victim is the best sort of corpse - one who everyone dislikes. Mr Conway is found dead in the garden of a cottage occupied by another master - Mr Kay - who has many reasons to dislike him.There are plenty of suspects both boys and masters - very few of either category can account for their movements on the night in question. Mrs Bradley, who knows the headmaster, is staying in the area and trying to buy a book belonging to her ancestress, Mary Toadflax, who was a witch. The book is currently in the possession of a blind witch called Lecky Harries who seems to have doubtful associations with several of the most likely suspects.The inimitable Mrs Bradley is at her best in this book, seeing what is going on under the surface and uttering her gnomic pronouncements at regular intervals. The plot is complicated and intriguing and the writing is crisp and stylish. I thought the dialogue between the boys was well done and their behaviour was convincing. An enjoyable story which will keep the reader guessing until nearly the end of the story."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"THE BOOK, IN A FEW WORDS, CLEARLY EXPLAINS THE BASIC AND ESSENTIAL CONCEPTS.

However, I took AP Calc BC last year in which we used this text. I can speek from experience that this explains everything very well. After a few weeks (we were working on chapter 2-differentiation; ch. 1 is limits) I stumbled across the Mr. Rigorous Foxtrot (if you are a Foxtrot fan you know what I am talking about) and wanted to know what Jason was doing. I new it was integration, but that was the extent of my knowledge. Several weeks before we reached integration in class, I read through a couple sections on integrating. While a lot required knowing stuff from later in ch. 2 and 3, I was nevertheless able to gather a strong sense of integration, and plenty to understand fully how Jason arrived at the area of a rectangle being 300 in^2.I have looked at three or four calculus texts (in fact I own one I picked up at a book sale for a couple bucks) and so have a little bit of basis for comparison. The Thomas/Finney seems to have a couple minor &quot;errors&quot;. I put that in quotations because they don't actually change anything substantive, but merely use a less-accepted, but equivilent, definition for some things, etc. And there is the very infrequent error in the key in the back of the book, most likely caused from not updating a problem that was changed from edition to edition. However, I also found that the other texts seemed to be harder to follow. If I had the book I own, for instance, I doubt very much that I would have been able to learn integration in an evening.As for the comments others make about the problems being to easy, I cannot comment. I have a natural knack when it comes to math, and I think just about anything is easy. Finally, to address the comments about how the book would be better in high school then in college, I cannot comment either, for obvious reasons."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"This book, in my opinion, is not a very good book especially if you are the kind who enjoys an intellectual challenge.

In short its like the &quot;The Ultimate Calculus Cookbook!&quot; But cookbooksdont really increase your math ability and may even suppress it!But theres another side to the story.. if you are kind who is interested in just knowing the recipies and how to apply them( engineering students)...then this must THE BEST BOOK you can find.

The graphs and diagrams are especially useful, and the book is extremely well-written. True, some of the examples in the exercises are a bit repetitive, and extremely simple. However, I used this text for an honors calculus class at Cornell, and when supplemented with the proper theoretical background to the subject (in lecture), the text is suitable for a course of that caliber. The &quot;theory and examples&quot; sections (where most of our problem sets came from) presented challenging questions which required a great deal of intuition. Overall the text is excellent, and I learned a lot from it. It has earned a place on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"This is perhaps one of the finest high-school Calculus textbooks in existance. The first eight chapters of Thomas-Finney deal with calculus of functions of a single variable, going through what is commonly known as BC calculus. In addition to covering the essential topics of differentiation and integration, Thomas-Finney pays ample attention to the applications of the two. What results is a lucid text full of examples that ground calculus in the real world.The second half of Thomas-Finney is devoted mainly to three-dimensional analytic geometry, multivariate calculus, and finally vector calculus. Partial derivitives, conic sections, vector-valued functions, and multiple integrals are just some of the topics covered in the second half. Here too, the book devotes ample time to examples and applications. The presentation of advanced concepts is top-notch.The text is also interspersed with mathematical biography and sidebars that explain how to use CAS to help understand concepts. These are well presented and do not take away from the core math taught in the book.I taught myself calculus during a summer using this book and without teacher intervention. It was the only one of five calculus textbooks that presented material clearly and simply enough to understand without outside help. In my mind, that's the highest compliment a math textbook can be given."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"I recall seeing this book in my living room when I was seven or eight. I'd pull it off the shelf, open to chapter one, look at the word \\"limit\\" and feel my mind go blank.Well, six years later, I took AP Calculus AB and I made a five on the test. Many factors went in to that. This is one of them.This book feels very comfortable to read. The margins are very wide and there is a good space between the examples and the text.Professors Finney and Thomas wrote so clearly. Precise and concise. Whenever I didn't understand what was going on in my AP class, this helped to clarify it better.There are ample problems for you to practice and apply what you've learned.It's a shame that this isn't really sold anymore. This is the best. If you can get a copy of this, keep it. So good."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"I used this book (5th edition) for a University Honors Calculus class that I took as a senior in High School. As a math enthusiast (my dad was a Math Professor), and compared to other math books, I would say that the exposition in this book is very very good. Addison-Wesley (MA) is renowned for publishing simple and complete books on complex technical subjects - nobody does it better! The authors were from MIT (first 4 editions) and U-Illinois (helped with the 5th edition), respectively (the latter is where I took the honor calculus class), and at the time it was being used at both schools.Some people have criticized this book as 'repetitive' and 'obvious' but I HEAVILY disagree. Calculus is a set of tools for approaching geometric problems. There are hundreds of tools in this book. My honors calculus professor had us working one sub-section of the book EVERY NIGHT, FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. In that time, we finished the entire book. I worked 4 problems EVERY NIGHT, FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. Later on, I attended MIT, and I was helping the freshmen in their calculus homeworks 5 years later FROM MEMORY! Meanwhile, the MIT students, who had less practice (one problem set per week) quickly forgot what they had learned! So I was helping the upperclassmen to remember their calculus, too !!Calculus is the very last \\"bag of tricks\\" subject that is taught in most math curriculums. The theory behind integration and differentiation and other techniques are all there, in the Thomas and Finney book. The burden is on the reader to understand the theory, before they jump to the practicum. It's true that Thomas and Finney do not ask you to derive new theorems, but there is too much material to allow this in a 2-semester or 3-semester textbook.I wonder how far people have gone after complaining that there was too much rote practice in this book. In my case, I enjoyed the book and completed a PhD in theoretical computer science."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"I used the 5th edition.This is a standard textbook. It is a bit more detailed than the competition (because it was written by mathematicians, I guess).Calculus books all cover standard topics. Where they differ is in the quality of the exposition and the bag of tricks they teach. You want a book with both, and this might be it.It's on the recommended reading list of the Mathematical Association of America as the first choice - as in \\"***\\" - for introductory Calculus (i.e., not \\"advanced\\") (see: http://www.maa.org/BLL/calculus.htm)."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"This text since its first edition way back in the 1960's has been held with high regard. The authors have sailed smoothly and presented the vast and ever increasing scope of calculus in the most pleasing manner which is indeed very reader-friendly.The authors also go down memory lane and recall age old instances in the history of calculus. The treatment of conceptual topics such as limits,derivatives,Integration as the area under a curve etc. is marvellous. Majority of the text also include computer related theory and problems. Critically speaking, the only drawback if any is the level of some of the exercise problems of which further some are outrageously simple. Nevertheless, this book should be recommended for all those readers and the mathematically oriented for learning calculus the way it ought to be learnt."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"The approach to the self study of calculus that I've adopted involves working through every problem in each section. This text is excellent for that technique. The authors present the material in sections that usually build upon on another and can be read in about thirty to forty five minutes while working through the examples. The writing is for the most part clear and easy to follow. Every now and then a section seems disjointed. The progress through differential and integral calculus of functions of a single varible (Chapters 1-7) is very thorough and smooth. The approach is both intuitive and mildly rigorous so that the student is not left thinking that calculus is not without rigor. The emphasis is on applications hence engineering and applied physics students will benefit most from this text. The introduction of transcendental functions is divided into two parts with most material in chapter six. The best aspect of this text is the problem set found at the end of each section. The authors have worked hard to build into the problems the material put forward in the text of the section. The problems are designed to reinforce both calculations as well as to provide stimulation to deeper thought (Theory and Examples section). Problems are divided into sets of problems reflecting the divisions in the section. These problems start as computational exercises and progress into applications and thought problems. Every concept can be looked at from different perspectives and the problems are designed to bring out this understanding of the ideas that are presented in the text. The emphasis is of course on the board applications of the concept. In addition the problems vary in the type of function so that there is a constant review of the techniques of approaches to solving the functions.An average classroom problem set for a section would be fifteen to twenty problems that would take about an hour and a half for the average student. To work all the problems in a section (range 40-100) takes about six to eight hours.I bought this text four years ago and a new edition has since been published. I am very satisfied with both the content and approach. I can pick up most texts on the subject and find that my working knowledge as learned from Thomas and Finney is more than adequate to follow the study."},{"Title":"Calculus and Analytic Geometry (9th Edition)","review":"Use this book along with CDs on intermediate algebra Calc I and Calc II from www.thinkwell.com. as an excellent way to start your college studies.I especially liked the depth he went into with conic sections. I for one had not had that much prior use for conic sections. Newton did. He invented calculus in order to answer specific questions and that involved conics. I like that the writer goes beyond using some of Newtons conclusions and goes into more depth. If you dont like depth, then you can read the first first half of the book and stop there (as is done by most nonscience majors). I have seen other calculus books and specifically bought this once because I dont like just memorizing formulas. I wanted to know more about why this subject was invented in the first place.The amaising thing is that if you get through this book, you will be able to understand some math and physics known a few generations ago only to Newton and Libenez.

My current book is basically unintelligible, even for subjects that I feel I have a solid grasp on. It is hardly worth reading, whereas the Thomas and Finney book really enhanced my learning experience.The book/bookstore situation at most universities is a crying shame. It seems that politics play a larger role in assigning books than usability. Needless to say, I will be using the Thomas/Finney book and not my current one when doing readings for homework.

I would like to take Analysis down the road, and I wouldn't want to go from this book to a standard analysis book. But you have to learn the nuts and bolts somewhere, and compared to what I've seen in other large intro texts, this one is at least as good as any and probably a little bit better. Despite the computational emphasis, when the authors do need to develop a new idea, they generally do it in a clear, concise, and un-patronizing way. It's not 'rigorous' Calculus but it's not for kids, either.p.s. I'm using the 9th edition which has plenty of pictures but isn't gaudy or glossy in any sense (it's from the early 1990's). The diagrams are all purposeful and substantive. No fluff. I suspect the newer editions are more typically magazine-like in their layout.

Carlylye loved the English Language and used it masterfully, energetically, and reverentially, without a trace of the trivial overindulgence of self-conscious and self-absorbed &quot;poets.&quot;"},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"Six lectures delivered by Carlyle in 1840. He classifies six kinds of heroes: as Divinity (Wotan, paganism); Prophet (Mohamed); Poet (Dante, Shakespeare); Priest (Luther, Knox); Man of Letters (Johnson, Rousseau, Burns); and Ruler (Cromwell, Napoleon). The trait that defines a hero is: absolute sincerity and firm belief in his principles.In his highly rhetorical lectures, Carlyle highlights and reinforces the role of the individual in the social process, as opposed to the role of the masses. And he did that precisely when the foundations were being laid for the most influential &quot;pro-mass&quot; movement in History: Marxism. The tragedy of Marxism, at least one of them all, is that, when translated into action, the blind masses were also led by &quot;heroes&quot; of the most authocratic sort. Not properly the work of an historian, these lectures are vivid, inflamed and enthusiast. Their uselfuness for our present age is precisely that they remind us of the crucial role significant individuals play in history, to accelerate or slow down (and even reverse) the process of social change, which is usually more gradual, diffused, and diverse."},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"This is an extraordinary work, let modern liberal critics say what they will of their 'mass movements' and 'diversity'. Long after they and their productions have bitten the dust, Carlyle will continue to speak to the enlightened few, and perhaps one day, it is to be hoped, to the enlightened many.This work is much more than just a study of various influential men in history. Carlyle has very interesting notions of the historical process itself, the spread of religions and their demise, the importance of \\"true belief\\" in things, as opposed the unbelief that merely follows rituals and procedures. For Carlyle, true belief, is the beginning of morality, all success, all good things in this world; Unbelief, scepticism, the beginning of all corruption, quackery, falsehood.Unbelief, for instance, is at the root of all materialist philosophies, eg Utilitarianism which find human beings to be nothing more than clever, pleasure-seeking bipeds. It is also at the root of all democratic theories: faith in a democratic system means despair of finding an honest man to lead us.Whether one agrees with Carlyle or not in his appraisal of democratic and other systems, one must admit, at least, that very little good is to be gotten from \\"the checking and balancing of greedy knaveries.\\" If we have no honest men in government or in business, but only a bunch of self-interested quacks, then we cannot expect any system, however ingenious, to save us. Even the most skilled architect will not be able to construct a great building, if you give him only hollow, cracked bricks to build it with. Find your honest men, says Carlyle, and get them into the positions of influence; only then will it be well with you."},{"Title":"On heroes, hero-worship and the heroic in history","review":"There are not many books sold at Amazon.com that were written almost two centuries ago. There might be a few written a few millenniums ago but they are mostly translations. There is something special when one reads the spoken word untranslated. Only in its original form, words have the mysterious effect that let the reader have a special connection with the author.Carlyle was Scottish and lived in England, but he had close relations with the \\"New World\\" and had readers in United States. He had a lifelong friendship with an influential American Philosopher, Ralph Waldo Emerson. At his time, there were not many philosophers who witnessed the industrial revolution but still kept a transcendental and not a materialistic view of the world. In the 19th century, Materialism was in full swing, and the people in the West were mesmerized by the scientific technological advances of the times and running away from God like herds of cattle, just like the way intellectuals of the East did a century later. Carlyle, Emerson, Thoreau and a few others were the only exceptions in the West that still tried to keep what is beyond the \\"apparent\\" in focus or at least in search of it. Bediuzzaman tried to do the same with the voice of Qur'an and called the people to what is beyond the apparent in the face of materialism in the East in the 20th century. One interesting observation I have to point out, is that one common theme among these Western Philosophers; many were all influenced by Emanuel Swedenborg, famous 18th century Swedish PhilosopherIn Heroes and Hero Worship Thomas Carlyle makes an attempt to draw a picture of the development of human intellect by using historical people as coordinates. There are people who has a perspective of history in terms of \\"environment\\" and \\"times\\" and \\"causes\\" while others like Carlyle has the view that human advancement was not continues but discrete and these jumps were mainly due to specific individuals he calls \\"Heroes\\". This is like the wave - particle duality of the \\"nature of light\\". In some phenomenon Light behaves like a wave in others like a particle. One can write a history based on ideas, cultures and mediums in which people lived, or the same history could be written by taking certain individuals and following them and their actions.Writings of many other authors of that time and Carlyle's of course are very perceptive. Carlyle does not really care to be objective on the matter. He has an idea and he wants to tell you that idea and when telling you what that idea is, he uses whatever his hands and mind get hold of. Being so passionate about what you are telling is probably a good thing. But if one overdoes it, one cannot help but show wild swings in appreciation of the historical person in question. If we use the drawing analogy, his historical person becomes no longer a point on the painting but a thread on the brush. But that should not prevent us from benefiting from his writings.Muhammad (PBUH) has a special place in the book under the chapter title \\"Hero as a Prophet\\". In the book Carlyle declares his admiration of Muhammad (PBUH). Carlyle's answers to pointed questions on Islam and Muhammad (PBUH) showed interesting similarities to Bediuzzaman's line of answers to similar questions. ......Considering the fact that while the West and East were at odds and the means of communications were quite inferior to our times, seeing Carlyle having such an open mind to the \\"other\\" puts him in a category of his own with others like Swedenborg, Emerson and Thoreau. I think when we are trying to build bridges between the peoples of the West and the East we should not overlook these early historical representatives of that dialogue, as Bediuzzaman foresees in his writings."},{"Title":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook","review":"This is an excellent resource for residents. It contains detailed information on treatment plan, and is extremely well-organized with a good index, something that is lacking from many handbooks. However, it often misses information that might be necessary for medical students. If you are a medical student interested in surgery, then I highly recommend using this book along with another more rudimentary handbook such as Boards and Wards or Surgical Recall. It is good to start getting used to this book now. However, if you are a medical student who is not interested in going into surgery, then this book is overkill. It has more detail and information than you will need both on the wards and on your shelf."},{"Title":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook","review":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook is a unique medical source. Written by residents for other residents this book give you the very most essentials about the major issues in surgery. Moreover, it is easy to use and a pocket size. It gives you the right information on the right time about what to do and how to do it right. I cann\`t wait for the next edition!!!"},{"Title":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook","review":"This is only a handbook. As a result, it is not very complete. I would not recommend &quot;Mont Reid&quot; if you are looking to carry a broad based quick reference book."},{"Title":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook","review":"I kept this book with me while on my surgery rotation as a medical student. I also used the Surgical Recall book during that rotation, but that book did not fit in my labcoat pocket.This book goes into a fair amount of detail and it was nice to have to read up on topics just before rounds with the attending or to look up information while evaluating a patient. The book is probably better suited to use by surgery residents, and may be overkill for a medical student, but it is not that expensive and I found it to be quite helpful.Surgery Recall is excellent, but is in Q/A format and so is not something you can use to cram in information at the last minute or while on the go.The Blueprints Surgery book, at least at the time I read it, was barely adequate and I was quite disappointed in it. So overall, I would recommend this book to medical students interested in surgery, or who just want to \\"shine\\" while on your surgery rotation."},{"Title":"The Mont Reid Surgical Handbook","review":"It has all the information a resident needs in the surgical ward.

The book helped me commit to becoming a better citizen/businessman working to strengthening our society. My consulting company helps implement what Dionne calls &quot;the Progressive project&quot;, providing management, planning and communications consulting with business, government and non-profit organizations. Many of the CEOs I coach would benefit from reading this book. Dionne puts his finger on the pulse of the broad political spectrum of Americans, analyzes our hopes and helps us see our false solutions. He then helps us reaffirm our deeper commitments and shows us a nation of citizens worth trusting. I found him fair in dealing with those he clearly disagrees with and instructive when speaking about the failures of those he held out hopes for. The section &quot;Why politicians don't get respect anymore&quot; is a continuation of his earlier work, &quot;Why Americans Hate Politics&quot;. I read these books in sequence over the past month and recommend that others do also. His discussion of four crises, economics, politics, morality and our understanding of America's role in the world, allows us to see their interdependence. His discussion of Clinton and Gingrich shows the pivotal role personal risks, or failure to take them, and leadership play in political history. I wish he had spent more time on them as participants in the 1960's. Readers would have gained a better appreciation of their actions in the 1990s. Neither were significant players in those days yet they have assumed responsibility for history they were peripheral players in. I would have liked to have seen more discussion of leadership development and how and why others stepped aside to make room for minor leaguers to play in the majors. The discussion of the press is very good. While I had earlier studied the development of some newspapers, I felt that this book gave me a context in which to appreciate what I had learned. I look forward to Dionne's next book. His first two helped me see that the downfall of Gingrich and Livingston and the impeachment of Clinton are natural outcomes of the process we have all participated in. I hope he and/or others put more focus on the intergation of policy, programs, budgets and personnel. Americans need greater help understanding how change is implemented. It would also help to put more focus on changes across the nation, not just in Washington DC. Dionne has done an excellent job with Washington, however. Thank you for what you have given us. I recommend this book for all citizens. It will help us participate in realigning our society. It made me revisit my political values and strengthen my commitment to a progressive agenda. I hope others are equally challenged and inspired."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"I have given this book a very high rating although ironically, I do not agree with its thesis. Progressives (code-word for &quot;liberals&quot;) will not dominate the next political era. Anyone studying the past decade can see that the trends of history are moving in the completely opposite direction of Hillary Clinton and Ted Kennedy. Nevertheless, Dionne is such a lucid writer and his book is so crammed with interesting facts, that he comes as close to proving his thesis as any liberal possibly can. I appreciate that. His pen is liberalism's best hope."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"This was just an all around excellent book, not only did it have the tone and future I am hoping for, but it was just so well written. The pages just moved effortlessly on and on and before I knew it the book was over. The only disappointment would be that it had to end. Basically the author takes a look at the early 90's and makes an argument that the trend in America is moving to more support for the Democrats if they can maintain the perception that they have evolved as a party with the times. There is just a ton of interesting facts and stories woven together to provide a very convincing argument.I admit, I wanted to be sold so I am not the most objective as to the overall effectiveness of the argument so take this review with a grain of salt. I guess it is comforting, if not a bit short sighted, for me to believe the book in it's totality, but I want a nice view of the future and this book provided it. If you are a Democrat and are not feeling too good about the current state of affairs then this book will give you hope and who knows, maybe the author is correct."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"Particularly when read after WHY AMERICANS HATE POLITICS, this book deserves to be bound to the hearts of young leaders-to-be with hoops of steel. Implicit in Dionne's entire project is the oft-repeated yet seldom-heeded mantra about knowing the past in order not to repeat it. By situating his analysis in the thick of cultural and political history, he is able to offer not only explanations of our suffering but prophecies of our healing. The ease with which his relatively simple historical inquiry illuminates the enormous blind spots in contemporary political discourse indicates how frighteningly ignorant we are of what our own history has demonstrated about what works and what does not. Dionne is at his best here when he illustrates how eerily parallel are the current conditions under economic globalization to the era of a century past when industrialization and urbanization were reeking the same sorts of havoc. Showing how Newt Gingrich's techno-futurism buffonishly copied McKinley's Gilded Age laissez-faire makes all Dionne's points with precision and weight. The argument to avoid such ominous idiocy by engaging our history--the history of the virtues and failings of ALL our political inheritance--combines with a brilliant section on the role of journalists which could apply to intellectuals and elites of every stripe, to outline precisely the principals which could guide the present and future leaders of the republic toward a greater realization of a more perfect union. Those compelled by Dionne's comparison of the Gilded Age with the Global Era would much enjoy Lawrence Goodwyn's DEMOCRACY'S PROMISE, or its abridged version, POPULIST MOMENT. For a fuller explication of the philosophy of intellectualism found in Dionne's section on journalists, see C. Wright Mill's SOCIOLOGICAL IMAGINATION. In any event, take THEY ONLY LOOK DEAD to heart and let it guide all your future citizenship and leadership. It's that good."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"Washington Post columnist E.J. Dionne validates both my faith in American government and the progressive agenda with They Only Look Dead. This is a must read for any serious student of government, or anyone with an opinion about how it should work."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"E.J. Dionne is such a fine writer and historian that one can be forgiven for believing, for wanting to believe, that the self-flagellating and pusillanimous lot that is the Democratic Party leadership these days can actually pull the country from the neo-conservative, bible-thumping swamp in which it is mired. &quot;They Only Look Dead&quot; was written before the Supreme Court selected a president for us, before Good King George took us to war on a pretext (with strong Democratic support), and before the popular &quot;no millionaire left behind&quot; program. Mr. Dionne is well aware of the cyclical nature of history and draws many apt parallels between the Gilded Age and our present malaise. So maybe he's right, maybe (triple cliche alert) it is always darkest before the dawn, maybe the pendulum has swung too far to the right. Maybe if the party of FDR and JFK follows Mr. Dionne's advice and remembers who they are and where they came from then happy days will be here again."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"E.J. Dionne's central thesis that the new (new?) Republican majority's philosophy in Congress is a throwback halfway to America's colonial times is this book's first -- and most perplexing! -- wrong turn. It gets worse from there. The author's assertion that 1994 was a fluke has no rationale basis of any kind. Dionne proves to be a poor prophet in that he presumes a Democrat takeover in Nov 1996 or shortly thereafter. To date that has not occurred and it has been nearly 7 years. Over and over again Dionne inappropriately and clumsily attempts to parallel modern politics, circumstances and consequences with ancient history. The worst thing about Dionne's theories is that they aren't even very interesting. Clearly Dionne is living in the past when forward-thinking is needed to save the Democrat party from itself. This book like Dionne's columns and TV commentary over-thinks rudimentary concepts. Lastly, Dionne suffers from wishful thinking."},{"Title":"They Only Look Dead: Why Progressives Will Dominate the Next Political Era","review":"Over and over again Dionne inappropriately attempts clumsily to parallel modern politics, circumstances and consequences with ancient history.

Now, both men are dead, and Katherine has returned, out of necessity, to stay with an old friend of her mother's.Kat is basically hiding herself away, when her &quot;country cousin&quot; and said cousin's new husband show up and demand to be touted around society. Unfortunately for everyone, Tom Marchington is an idiot who is embarrasing the entire family by salivating all over the salacious Countess Standen. In desperation, Kat asks one of her former suitors, Lord Oliver Stonenden, to distract the Countess until the Marchingtons are called back to the country. What Kat doesn't know, though, is that Stonenden still desires her hand in marriage.THE MARCHINGTON SCANDAL's plot is too twisted and meandering for its length, not to mention being pretty silly. However, my main complaint for the novel is that the attraction between the main characters is lukewarm to nonexistent. At the end of book, I had serious doubts that they loved each other at all, or that their marriage would be a happy one, and in a romance novel, that's a major deduction point. The writing was fine, and some parts of the novel were interesting, but THE MARCHINGTON SCANDAL fails in its main purpose: as a romance. Hence, I can only give it three stars, for being mildly entertaining."},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"For those of us that are on the Path, this is a valuable easy to read volume that provides priceless wisdom and insight in such a way as to make a profound impact into your life.

The books i read before this were Ervin Seale's classics on the metaphysical translation of the bible. I am not a 'Christian', but even so they made a lot of sense to me. They also provided a 'soft start' to this brutally honest book.Why is honesty always described as 'brutal' though...I do wonder at that?!! Perhaps a reflection on our ego-self, that lies to us and makes us soft and weak in our ability to deal with the truth.Maybe thats why the 'God' described here sounds so uncompromising. This book is all about understanding 'tough love', the kind of love and understanding that really changes you and informs you because it loves you. That does not hold out false promises. You need to be either ready to really liberate yourself or you can go back to the la-la land of a 'sunday - only religion' and business as usual on the rest of the days.I find it interesting that the 'bible reading christians' are so opposed to this book in the reviews ...in many ways the bible speaks the same truths, or for that matter so does the Quran, Gita or what have you. How deep are we prepared to read in these books? Or do we just use them to further the ego's demands?Only read this book if you are ready for some in depth introspection with an open mind. it will change your life if you get out of your way.

isTo experience myself I create illusionIllusion requires oppositesI give parts of myself the illusion ofidentity by slowing down its vibrationEach part has a piece of my consciousnessOne special part is given the ability to createSome of these you call angelsThey are perfect, as you are perfectYou are all still meThis state you have called EdenThese special parts are fully aware of meThere is no illusionAll of their expectations are being fulfilledTo become more like me, they are offered anopportunity to enter a world of illusionThe ones that choose to do so become explorersSome will create unknown experiencesThrough them I am able to experience whatthey experienceThe ones that accept are placed intobodies that are vibrating very slowlyand their rememberance of me is blockedTo motivate this part, I give them desireUnconsciously they remember EdenThey know they are missing something,butthey can't remember whatTheir quest will be to return to EdenThey will return to me with more compassion,empathy, and loveThis is what they were sent to findThis is why I ask you to give your love to meso that I can give even more back to youWhen you start your first quest you arefull of expectations, butYou will have no experience or conscienceto draw uponIn time you will find that you can call uponme at anytime for any help neededAt all times I will have helpers, both seenand unseen to guide youYou will also meet many on the road you aretraveling, ready to help you, but you won'tknow this, and you will be crying for helpwhen it is already thereThe teacher will answer when the student isready, but you will not be experiencedenough in the early quests to recognizeme in the eyes of your fellow travelers,you will be unable to tell your teachersand your helpers apartInstead of giving fear and receiving fear,you will eventually come to the realizationthat to get anything you must simply give itWhen this happens you will start giving thelove you need, and you will be creating andgetting it back in even greater measureUnknowingly, you will be filling yourselfup with experiences creating love, awarenesscompassion, all being the same thingAnd this is what I sent you out to findAs you start giving this love to others youwill also be giving it back to meRemember, we are all still the same 'one'The steps you will need to go through togo from fear to love are simpleI

strengthThoughts without any emotion will simplydissipateMixing thought and emotion gives birth toa magnetic force that goes with youeverywhereThis thought will have it's own colorIt will seek to find

expectation long enoughyou will come to a realization that itis unprofitableYou will then eliminate it from your circleIt will be replaced by an experienceThis experience will allow you to

become more and more 'enlightened'You will no longer have to depend upon ateacher, a book, or a friend for answersThrough your efforts of taking control ofyour life, by controlling your thoughts,taking responsibility for your actions,and trying to make wherever you go betterthan when you arrived, you will reach apoint in your development where otherswill start coming to you for answers.Then you will be able to share yourexperiences with them and help them growBy example you will become that teacheryou were searching for.You are no longer the 'problem', you arebecoming the 'solution'.You will come to the realization that theconscious mind is only able to executeplans, it is incapable of laying outthese plans, this requires the sub-conscious.You will then merge the two and 'become'that which you have so long sought.As you look around you will start findingme looking back at you, with a knowingsmile, in the eyes of everyone you meetEventually you will even find me in

The presentation turned me off some or I'd of given it 5 stars. Excellent book though."},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"I've just finished reading this book, and I have NEVER felt any worse after I put one down. Maybe I'm missing the point of this book because everyone else believes it to be a 5 rating, transformational, and bringing them closer to God. The way I understood this book's meaning is that God is impersonal so He has no feelings. God is within us, manipulating, and guiding us totally and completely by HIS desires for HIS own selfish purposes. God THINKS for us, and we do not think as humans unless they are God's thoughts. As humans we have no original ideas, they all come from God - God thought it and sent it through to us to act upon. We ARE God, an extension of HIM that HE created for HIS own personal use, as we would use a machine, or other objects to fulfill our needs, HE uses us to fulfill HIS. Our real selves have no personality - we are impersonal. So, when we die we become a part of God's essence and totally lose our individuality, personality, memories, experiences, etc. that we learned in this lifetime. We won't recognize our loved ones after death because: 1) We won't care because we have no brain and our consciousness has blended with God's 2) We are nothing but impersonal energy dictated and manipulated by God. Let me tell you this....I have never read anyone's opinion that is so depressing, scary, and infuriatating as that of this author. No wonder he's anonymous! I have read hundreds of books on religion, philosophy, spiritualism, etc. and never experienced such a negative and horrific picture of God.

The book is such a blessing that opens the door wide for you, if you're willing to step across."},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"A very humble man named Joseph S. Benner; whose human instrument was the channel through which this inspired Message was given to the world, wrote this amazing book in 1940. He has passed on now and thankfully his daughter has continued to publish this work. Here is the Introduction to the book from the Publisher to give you an idea of just how special this book really is.&quot;In order the better to comprehend the deep and vital truths contained in this Message, you are urged to approach each reading of it with a quiet and open mind. Still the intellect and invite your Soul to do the teaching. Read but a sentence at a time, and do not pass to the next until Something within you responds to the truth therein, and clearly points out the meaning for you.More than all, try to realize that the &quot;I&quot; speaking through the Message is the Spirit within, your own Soul, the Impersonal Self, the Real You; the same Self that in other moments of quiet points out to you your mistakes, your follies, your weaknesses, and is ever chiding and aiding you to live up to Its ideals, which It continually holds before your mental gaze.It was to such a quiet mind as this that this Message came during months filled with an intense yearning for the guidance of the Spirit and an opportunity to serve the Loving Father Who had been found to be ever-present and always ready to bless those of His children who loved Him enough to make Him first in their hearts and lives.The help and guidance thus received is passed on to you, for the wise and loving teaching is so unusual and so wholly Impersonal that it will apply equally well to everyone who is ready to receive it.The great blessing of the Message is that, if you are ready, the &quot;I&quot; speaking herein will continue to speak directly to you from out your own heart, after you lay aside the book, and in so intimate and convincing a way that It will make clear all your problems, be to you a fount of Wisdom and Strength, and bring you Peace, Health, Happiness, Freedom, - and abundance of everything your heart desires.This little book, therefore, is intended to serve as a channel or open door through which you may enter into the Joy of your Lord, the comforter promised by Jesus, the living expression in you of the Christ of God.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"I am a person that in my life has had much success. I have made money, traveled, furfilled my heart desires more than most people when it came to material things. I was blessed by this, but not because I was able to attain them, but because I realized that they did not make me happy. Each time I was able to succed in getting something it felt great, but there was something always missing. That something was God. I knew it although. So being catholic I turned to my church. I felt God would come to me there, but He did not. I knew that I felt God when I did something good. I always felt something was inside of me that was great but I never made the connection. Until one fine day my life went into ruin. I had failed to succeed in something that was so important in my life. I got so depressed. I did not know where to turn. No human could help me. I, because was desperate(selfish) turned to God. At the same time a dear friend said to me &quot;I have a book for you that may help you&quot; Call it faith, call it coincidance, my life changed. each day I read the book I got closer to God. Within 1 week my life went from the worst time in my life to a blessing. Not because the problems went away, but because when you have God, problems do not exsist. I know that if you have never had such experience you probably think I am crazy. I know that because if before I had this experience someone came up to me and told me they have found God and it is better than any orgasm they ever had, I would think they are crazy. But it is true. I am writing this memo, letter, whatever you want to call it. the spelling, the grammer is not the best, I know, but the message is clear. Find God and you are in hevan on earth, do not find God and you are in hell. the more money and happiness you have, the greater is the chance that when you fall, and you will, and you will get hurt. However it is that pain from that fall that will make you go to God. As I review this book I am ashamed to use the word review. Do you review God. We are not capable of doing this. I leave you with this. thank you aurthor, thank you publisher &amp; most of all thank you God because without you, there would be no aurthur, publisher, bookseller or review."},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"When I first read this book I hated it, it took around 5-6 reads and a few more years before my mind would sit with what was written within it.The writing comes across as a bit harsh sometimes, but if you can stay with it, your may be in for a treat.My old spiritual/meditation teacher told me that he believed this was one of the most spirtual books available and he was a Sikh.The text comes across as decidedly christian in the beginning, but with in depth study is universal to all faiths.Read it if you dare ;)"},{"Title":"The Impersonal Life","review":"Dear Walkers of the Path: Would you like to know how it is that we were created in His Image, and how we can call upon, use, and manifest His Powers in our lives? Would you like to know, by using a tool given in this book, how it is that you can feel Him within? I think you may be interested in some of the messages in this book - so I'm going to quote some passages:&quot;But to you who are strong enough to bear it, I say you need no mediator between you and Me, for we are One already. If you can but know it, you can come direct and at once to Me in consciousness.&quot;&quot;I AM the LIFE, I AM the INTELLIGENCE, I AM the POWER in all Substance, - in all the cells of your body; in the cells of all mineral, vegetable and animal matter; in fire, water and air; in Sun, Moon and Stars. I AM that in you and in them which IS. Their consciousness is One with your consciousness, and All is My Consciousness. Through My Consciousness in them All that they have or are is yours - for the asking.&quot;&quot;Speak to them then IN MY NAME. Speak in the Consciousness of your Oneness with Me. Speak in the Consciousness of My Power in you and of My Intelligence in them. Speak - COMMAND what you WILL in this Consciouness, - and the Universe will rush to obey.&quot;&quot;For I as the Christ dwell in all men and AM their One and Only Self. Through all men I AM ever calling to you and trying to reach and impress your human consciousness. As I AM continually teaching you, not only through all men but through every avenue needed at the time, I have many ways of reaching your consciousness and utilize all to bring you to a realization of My Meaning.&quot;&quot;I speak with many voices, - with the voice of all human emotions, passions and desires. I speak with Nature's voice, with the voice of Experience, even with the voice of human knowledge.&quot;&quot;Yes, these are all My Voice, which I use Impersonally to express to you the one fact, that I AM in All and that I AM All. What this Voice says, in Its thousand ways, is that you, too, are part of this All, and that I AM in you, waiting for your recognition of Me and your Conscious cooperation in the expression of My Idea of Impersonal Perfection on earth, even as It is expressing in Heaven.&quot;That's just a taste. My dear friends, there are secrets in this book that if you find them, and if you know them with true and simple understanding, will lead you beyond what you have ever possibly dreamed could exist in the pleasure of the spirit, body and mind.
