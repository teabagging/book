Jafar was one of the bravest soldiers of World War II, out-witting all the Western generals (he fought against the British with the Germans and after the Ottoman Sultan murdered many of his friends, he came to see that Arab lands would never know freedom under the Ottomans; then he switched sides and fought WITH the British.) He won the highest medals from both the German Army and the British Army, and was greatly admired by soldiers from both countries.This was a man who was so brilliant that he wowed the biggest statesmen of the world. While serving Iraq as Foreign Minister to Iraq, he obtained his law degree in England and became a barrister!In 1936, Jafar returned to Iraq at the request of the Prime Minister, who happened to be his brother-in-law, and best friend, Nouri Al-Said, the man who ruled Iraq (under King Faisal I, II, and King Ghazi I). Tragically, Jafar was the first of the Iraqi Ministers assassinated, setting off a stream of events that led to Saddam Hussein, the first Gulf War and the second Gulf War. Had Jafar lived, it is believed that the formation of modern day Iraq would have had a much better outcome. Certainly, the wars fought by Iraq against Iran, Kuwait, and the Western governments would have been avoided. Think of the lives that would have been saved if only this one man had lived. Jafar was a statesman who believed in compromise, and he would have led Iraq in a different, more peaceful direction.This man was the grandfather of the modern day Mayada Al-Askari, whose story is told in Mayada, Daughter of Iraq. Jafar was killed before Mayada was born, but she was told about the wonderful Jafar by her own beloved father, Nizar. Mayada lived in Iraq under the brutal Saddam, and escaped after being falsely arrested and thrown into prison.These two books, A Soldier's Story, and Mayada, Daughter of Iraq, should be required reading. Both books are lively and entertaining, yet filled with so many interesting Iraqi antedotes that if a reader was to read these two books ONLY, that person would receive an entertaining education on Iraq, and much of the Arab world.I highly recommend these two books. I hope everyone who reads this review takes my advice. You won't regret it.Also: Both books are perfect gifts for soldiers in the field, those brave men and women who are putting their lives on the line."},{"Title":"A Soldier's Story: From Ottoman Rule to Independent Iraq: The Memoirs of Jafar Al-Aksari","review":"I recently met the author of Mayada, Daughter of Iraq, and made the wonderful discovery that Jafar Al-Askari, a great Arab hero, is the paternal grandfather of Mayada. It's a wonderful edition to Mayada and I plan on recommending this book to many people. The Al-Askari family was indeed special and had Mayada's grandfather lived (he was assasinated in 1936 when serving as Defense Minister of Iraq)I believe that Iraq's history would have been very different.This story about Mayada's grandfather is wonderful. I do recommend it, along with the story of Mayada.

If you want to read a refreshing point of view, or if you know of someone who could use the mental shakeup, then this booklet will be worthwhile.Two of the selections in this set are abbreviated versions of much larger books (and hence are available elsewhere).I didn't gain much from this set, but I'd already read the much larger book by John Taylor Gatto, which made up section 2 in this booklet."},{"Title":"More Than Petticoats: Remarkable Wisconsin Women (More than Petticoats Series)","review":"I've read about four of these books so far and they've all been interesting. If you love history and insight into the past, you'll love these books!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As a Filipino American, I read this book with a critical eye. I was impressed initially of Garland's grasp of Filipino language and his descriptions of Manila life. The narrative was not the greatest, at times slow, mundane, and lacking in texture. Part II of the book was, I think, most unbelievable. The book left me wondering whether Western writers actually see places like Manila the way it is written in The Tesseract. If so, then it gives reason not to read this book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Very interesting and well-written set of interwoven events and stories centered on a single day in Manila. It starts with an English sailor waiting in a hyperdingy hotel to meet with a local mobster. As he waits he becomes more and more convinced he is about to be executed. This is intercut with the mobster in the car with his retinue treading on verbal eggshells. The two meet in an explosive climax, whereupon the book shifts to the story of a woman putting her kids to sleep. This leads to the story of her childhood in a coastal village, her the discovery of love, and we gradually learn how she came to be in Manila, married and with kids. As she talks on a cell phone to her husband, street kids throw some nails in the road puncturing his tire and delaying his arrival home. This segues into the story of two street kids and the psychological researcher who tapes their dreams. At the end, all three stories converge into a brief, bloody resolution of sorts. Garland is definitely a talented writer and I will think about reading his first book, The Beach--which I have avoided as it looks very shallow and annoying."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"If you pick up this book expecting another &quot;The Beach&quot; you'll be disappointed. While the Beach was entertaining and slightly vapid, this is a sharply observed, beautifully paced, almost impressionistic novel. I give the author credit for even trying something this daring. That he succeeds is a bonus to all readers."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex makes it look so easy. I attempted a similar structure in a recent novel &amp; only wish I had read this book first so I could see the possibilities. Most impressive to me was the way Garland writes the human thought process. The entire space of the book is set over a time frame of perhaps an hour, possibly less. What makes up the bulk of it is the characters' internal monologues, spliced between snippets of fast-paced action. For example, the first character, Sean, standing at a doorway about to kill two people on the other side, is distracted by sweat trickling down his face and begins to meditate on the nature of scratching. The book is told from multiple viewpoints culminating in a fast-paced finale told from 13 different points of view. Very impressive."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After reading The Beach, I was expecting something just as exciting, descriptive and facinating as Garland's debut. The Tesseract lived up to my expectations. Alex constructs the story with such skill, it seems that he is an old hand at it. But remember, this is only is second book and what a one it is. Garland has all the makings of a classic modern author."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland's first novel the Beach was fascinating, one of the best books I've ever opened. That was enough for me to give The Tesseract a try. While, I couldn't put The Beach down, The Tesseract was easy to forget. Until the hypercube finally unwinds, it is only a mass of boring characters writrten in the monotonous style of Genesis. My suggestion: read The Beach if you haven't and wait for Alex Garland's third novel."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"i couldn't stop reading this book once i started because it gave me the feeling that i could reach out and touch the characters. it's a rare book that allows one to actually feel that the characters are human. i was touched by every character, even the most horrific: they all inspired sympathy in some way. bad things just don't happen to bad people, they can happen to any of us at any time. don't expect it to be a page-turner like The Beach was; instead expect to not want to see the pages go by. the thoughts and images that this book provoked in me are very similar to those of one of my favorite authors, haruki murakami."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"An exciting read. The Tesseract had more likable, interesting characters than any novel I have recently read. The tale, despite a complex structure, was in the end relatively simple using the most basic human themes. Surpisingly (given the write-up on the Jacket) I found the story and the plights of its characters touching. The author demonstrated a remarkable sensitivity creating and getting into the minds of a diverse spectrum of people. At the same time the story unfolds at a blistering pace with constant changes of perspective. It was really interesting, the kind of story one thinks about for weeks after reading. Garland has been added to the list of authors whose books I'll rush out to buy in hardback the first day they are printed."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"While the writer is a thinker and talented, I found the novel a downer, and felt disappointed. After reading it, I had no sense of having learned anything, except perhaps the meaning of the word tesseract. There were so many directions that could have proved fruitful, had the author chosen to explore them, but he didn't. He chose to go for the gimmick, and to write a story that was itself an illustration of a tesseract. That's the problem I have with the book. Like the movie, \\"The Usual Suspects\\", there is a gimmick. And like screenwriting, he works from the outside in, instead of from the inside out. This is a movie, it's not a novel, in that respect.People may enjoy it as a movie, but I didn't enjoy it as a novel. However, the writing is good, and the execution is excellent. It can't be faulted in any literary sense. Just not my cup of tea.Michael P. SakowskiAuthor \\"The Enterprise Zone\\""},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract proves the point that once you have one bestseller, they'll publish anything you write.While definitely not the worst book I've ever forced myself to finish, another year of work could have made this book better. Maybe. I know that Garland comes quite often to SE Asia, but I think even if he lived here he'd still be biting off a bit more than he can chew with a narrative based on a local Filipino perspective. The tiny details of \\"pusoy dos\\" and \\"byente nwebe\\" thrown in everywhere for flavor just wasn't enough. You can smell he's trying to introduce authentic details, but the effect is more like somebody giving too many details to cover up a lie.But enough railing on the details, let's look at the story. Oh, wait a minute...WHAT story? While the reviews rave about the suspense and bla bla bla of this book, as far as I can tell, there was a shooting with a few people killed in a fraction of the book. That's the action. The rest is a long winded character development.Not entirely bad character development, mind you. I liked reading about Rosa's romance. But it really is a tiring read with constant changes of perspective and zero reference for new narratives. If not for the fact that he published first, I'd say he'd read The Kite Runner or some other novel that led him to leave a potentially powerful storyline and write an endless sequence of, well, poorly written vignettes, in the belief that a book where every character somehow overlaps in a coincidental Big-Bang would be a good thing. It was for The Kite Runner. It definitely wasn't for The Tesseract. Like the Vincent and Totoy narrative, which goes on for a third of the book, just because they happened to see the main character fall in the sewer...If only Alfredo had been shot by a stray bullet on his 30th story balcony from Jojo's first shot at the cat, it would have completed the web of contrived circumstance. Alex, what were you thinking? You still need a storyline, and The Tesseract definitely doesn't have one. The entire book is a snapshot of minute and forced details of anybody, and their family, and their lost loves, and their pets, remotely related to the one action sequence. All this warrants a double thumbs down, regardless what the sycophant critics write.In the end, this book is less of a story than an artifact of Garland's attempt to move from compelling story teller to artistic writer. Emphasis on \\"attempt.\\" With The Beach, he was just telling a story. He wasn't trying to impress anybody with his writing or literary prowess. I always felt that The Beach was Garland's attempt at Michael Crichton (not a model of literary genius, but a good storyteller). The Beach was basically just a good story, with no literary pretense getting in the way. In fact, The Beach is one of the only books I've ever read twice.With the Tesseract, unfortunately, Garland's writing definitely does get in the way. Perhaps he'd read too many Atwood or Ondaatje novels and wanted to imitate their style of writing endless meaningless details in a book that has almost no plot. The problem is that those authors ARE literary geniuses. So while they bore the crap out of me, I still read everything they write because they can make the most meaningless plot points beautiful. I will reread paragraphs just to hear the sound of their writing again and again. Reading Atwood is not easy - it's like getting an unneeded root canal, but the pain is bearable and sometimes addictive. Reading The Tesseract is like getting a root canal, without the benefit of anesthesia or a lolly from the nurse.In summary, The Tesseract is celebrated because of the author's track record instead of on the merit of the story or the writing. So ignore the hype. This book is pretty bad. It has little or no plot. The characters are shallow and their motivations contrived. It just tries way too hard by introducing unrelated asides (after the speed-of-light and going to hell asides, I was going to throw the book in Manila Bay, which was about 2 meters from where I was reading at a restaurant at Mall of Asia. But I lumbered forward. Luckily, 5 beers is only $4 in Manila, which helped.) This is definitely one of those books you'll want to borrow rather than buy."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland follows up The Beach with a novel which is geographically similar, but stylistically independent and thoroughly entertaining. He creates vivid characters and tells there stories in an amazing fashion, with every small detail slowly coming into focus until it finally reveals something much greater than just the sum of its seemingly disparate parts: a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is average"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This is a book for those who appreciate tightly written and character-rich writing. The Tesseract is a stunning change for Garland. Unlike in his previous novel, The Beach, he draws his scenes and characters with great sensitivity.For example, there are two brilliantly written funeral scenes. One of them, concerning the disfigurement of a child during a funeral, is particularly gripping. When Garland came to Seattle for a reading, I asked him where he got the idea for this scene. He then told a story of him attending a funeral in the Philipines during which the deceased's body was accidentally exposed and broken apart to the shock and horror of everyone there. All who see him on his book tour should ask him about it; it will rivet you."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I read Garland's first novel, The Beach, and found a literary gem. However, his latest work simply baffles me. Unlike his debut which is fast-pacing and doesn't keep the reader waiting, The Tesseract is slow to the extent of almost being drab. His characters are probably his only redeeming quality in this book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Amazingly enough my generation is succeptable to information bits. We have short attention spans and even less time to read or so we think. Tesseract is a brilliant example of getting our attention quickly and making us want to turn the page. Alex Garland is truly a voice for this generation and his ablity to speak to us is not an easy task. The story was balanced and left me with many anxiously awaited page turns. I think even if you had never been in a foreign country let alone the Philippines he captures a very real perspective of the culture. READ IT!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I read a few good reviews of this book before reading it and can't understand how it's managed to even get reviewed in major publications. The dialogue in this book is atrocious and the attempts to describe the underbelly of Manila come off as amateurish writing. I was very disappointed and definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I honestly gave the book a chance and finished it all but it just wasn't worth it."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I haven't read &quot;The Beach&quot; yet but I enjoyed this book. There are a lot of beautiful moments captured in the book. It is fascinating how the author moves backwards and forward in time and yet somehow it all seems to flow beautifully. Words are sparse but the impressions they created in my mind were great. Well written, I am sure I will love &quot;The Beach&quot;, its next on my reading list!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I found myself very drawn into the respective worlds of the main characters (like in Patrick Gale's Tree Surgery for Beginners) and enjoyed the writing style. The ending certainly had no surprises but it was certainly worth the journey."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I was drawn to this book based on both the hype and the Graham Greene comparisons. Boy, does Garland have a PR firm or what? The dialogue in this book is silly. Read aloud, one can only cringe. As for the structure, it may be cool and of-the-moment and postmodern, but it isn't handled well enough to engage a serious reader or to even entertain a serious thought. The most sagacious, smartest moment of this book is the epigraph."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After the beach, which I quite enjoyed, this book was disapointingly pedestrian and predictable. It was like a mills and boon set in the tropics - nearly 'her heaving bosom' sort of fiction. The title was mysterious enough to have me running to the dictionary during the book but, like the Beach it did'nt deliver. You feel the book was published on the strenght of the Beach's success as opposed to the literary merits of either book.I don't think I'll be reading any more Alex Garland."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Having read and enjoyed the Beach, I decided to try The Tesseract - Big Mistake! The only thing that kept me going was the thought that it had to end soon. Badly written and I've seen more substance on the side of a cereal packet - do yourselves a favour and bypass this one."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I don't even know where to start reviewing this book. It is one of the best books I've ever read, I enjoyed it very much. It represents a major step forward for Alex Garland as an author. His first book, \\"The Beach\\", was full of bravado and energy, as well as some genuine insight, but this one is much deeper and more poignant. His storytelling ability is superb, and it's just a shame that he got away from novels and started writing screenplays (as good as they are). All I can say is, you owe it to yourself to read this book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is a whirlwind character driven effort that really deserves critical acclaim. Garland paints a vivid picture with prose that's precise and never excessive. He imbues his characters with a level of depth and just enough random touches that you feel you know them one paragraph in. I loved how the story came together and I was thoroughly impressed with the author's range and depth -- this poignant story will make your head spin. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I really wanted to like The Tesseract, and I couldn't have been more excited when it was released. The Beach is one of my favorite novels (if not my absolute favorite), so I fought through The Tesseract, waiting and hoping it would get interesting, but I made it to the last page and just thought, \\"what a waist of my time this read was.\\" Again, I really did want to like it, and I understand what Mr. Garland was trying to accomplish with the whole \\"Tesseract\\" thing, but a decent storyline was lost in the process. Basically, I felt it didn't flow well, the characters as well as the stories were not interesting enough, and the ending was not worth the journey. Unfortunately, though Mr. Garland has written one of my favorite novels, he has also written one of my least favorite novels. I gave The Tesseract 2 stars because I have faith in Alex Garland as a writer and still look forward to reading his other works."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book will inspire the unthinking to think and the unfeeling to feel. An amazingly deep story - tied together in ways you cant even imagine in 3-d."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"i thought 'the tesseract' was really cool- i haven't read a good book in ages! i really liked the idea of changing between different characters. i felt as if i was actually in the story because it was so well written!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After reading the synopsis, I was sold on the idea of reading this book, which I then did over the painstaking period of a month. This book was easy to close and quite uninvolving, mainly due to the large amounts of unnecessary padding, and the simple fact that the story doesn't really go anywhere of interest. After finishing the book I was cross I had wasted my time reading it, and equally cross at the fact Mr Garland had bothered to induce such an awful attempt of literary art upon us, when he could have just sent it to the film companys, and kept us out of the equation."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Let me tell you something about The Beach, not only is it one of my favorite books, it's one of my favorite books to recommend. I made all my friends and family read it and they all loved it, I think it was my older sister, who's favorite author is Jane Austeen and stays away from modern lit like from the plague, who said she'd never enjoyed a book this much before. Her exact words were \\"the best literary experience I've ever had\\". So when The Tesseract came out I was the first one to but, and apparently the only one, I found out why later. The Tesseract is a failed attempt by a beginning writer to prove that he can write more than a Leo movie. After seeing the movie I do understand the writer's need to get as far away from The Beach as possible but this is ridiculous! It reads like an essay written by an ambitious 12 year old, it is uninteresting and at any given time you can skip 50 pages and not have missed any crucial events simply because - there are none! The characters are boring and after a while you are faced with the fact that you just don't care what happens to them! I am not only disappointed but in mourning for this brilliant writer who obviously is trying to impress someone god knows who, and I am sincerely hoping his new baby The Coma will redeem him from this joke."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Perhaps I was expecting the Tesseract to be 'The Beach' set in the Phillipines. Perhaps I was expecting too much. The Tesseract is a really depressing, disjointed, infuriating and pointless novel. It really felt like Garland wanted to show everyone how smart he is. It felt like Grisham trying to write Camus. Stick to what you are good at Alex, the gulf between a great writer and a good one is huge, and you're on the wrong side i'm afraid. Buy this book if you want something different, but I think you'll be more likely to get a headache than be captivated."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"i also thought this book was appealing to my age group too. (14-15 years"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I am surprised that so many people on Amazon did not like this book. The purpose of the novel is not to illustrate the Philippines for those of us who want to travel there nor is it supposed to be a mere thriller. Granted, it may be too complex and elaborate at a few points, but these points help serve the ideas behind the novel. It is about the chaotic nature of how lives come together for absolutely no reason and how we come to explain the tragedies that occur in our lives. Some of the characters use religion(corazon) while others subscribe to sciense (alfredo), but what I think Garland was trying to do was show how senseless life can seem at times and how we deal with that. It is very compassionate and mature, and for those who wanted more of &quot;The Beach&quot; I can only say that to expect that of an author is very narrow minded and not realistic. It you have the time check out The Tesseract because it is an interesting and unique read that is both exciting and intelligent."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After spending all last year giving &quot;The Beach&quot; to friends and telling them how good it was, it's nice to finally have another book to rave about. Something about Alex Garland's writing really speaks to me. I finished &quot;the Tesseract&quot; felling as I had when I finished &quot;the Beach&quot;, like it was a book I wished I'd written myself. Its simultaneous allowance for stark reality, comic-book fantasies and mythological backgrounds, is really stunning. There's so much to this book, and all the real-time action takes place in maybe half an hour. I don't think that this is better or worse than &quot;the Beach&quot;, I just think it cements Garland's reputation as a serious writer of fiction for my generation, and I'm already looking forward to his next book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect after reading Alex Garland's incredible debut, The Beach. I was hoping for similar excitement and fast-paced adventure. Well, I definitely got that in spades! The Tesseract is so much more realistic and dramatic, and I was feverishly turning pages to find out how this tesseract would unravel.Told in four parts, The Tesseract begins with Sean, a sailor on the shipping waters of Manila, waiting in a seedy, run-down motel for the gangster, Don Pepe, and his motley crew. Then the story switches gears entirely and begins the tale of Rosa, a woman who remembers her first love, Lito, through flashbacks. This part of the story is told gently and almost romantically. The next story follows two Filipino street kids, Vincente and Totoy, as they wander the streets of Manila in search of hand-outs and a little excitement. Finally, the fourth part, a gritty and fantastic conclusion, has all three stories violently entwined.I'm positive this novel was no easy feat to write; however, Alex Garland has done it flawlessly. The stories within this novel are powerful and dramatic, some violent, one wistful and romantic, and all are stunning and solid. A perfect novel to pick apart and invoke energetic discussions. Some things might go over novice readers' heads (when one of the characters, Alfredo, waxes philosophic), but for the most part it is easily understood. A highly recommended novel about how your destiny can be shaped by strangers, and how forces beyond your control can come crashing into your life in a moment's notice. Brilliant."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book a page-turner just as &quot;The Beach&quot; was, but I loved this book more. &quot;The Beach&quot; was thrilling and filled with adrenaline, but when Garland turns his attention to character development in more &quot;normal&quot; settings (although not without violence) he surprises you with even more profound thoughts about human life, destiny, chance, truth &amp; reality. &quot;The Tesseract&quot; seems a more mature book, and the details of Manila and its surrounding areas are so real, you feel like you yourself are running down the grimy streets of the slums, trying to salvage your life. Garland proves himself a master of character portrayal by having vastly different people inhabit the same book &amp; even interact with each other. From destitute street kids to a well-to-do doctor to a European fleeing gangsters, Garland shows that no matter what level of society, all humans have thoughts, fears, concerns, dreams. These poignant glimpses of human emotion make this book impossible to put down. Can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"There are about 90+ reviews to this book so far, and if you choose, you can read them all. As best I could tell, those who didn't like &quot;The Tesseract&quot; tend to be disappointed because it is not like Garland's first novel, &quot;The Beach.&quot; But if you judge this on its own merits -- which I did, not having read The Beach -- I think you will be pleased.If you read the reviews, you'll get the impression that this is a crime novel, too. I think that would be a mistake... Others may focus on characters (a mistake, too).I believe this novel's star is its structure. The story threads that are here (there are basically three of them) are all fine, but they are laid out so as to support Garland's effort at an intricate structure. The novel starts off somewhat linear, but then retraces itself from another character's view... And with each retelling, it gets less linear, and the non-linearity gets more complex. Now, the interesting thing for me is that as Garland build in ever greater complexity from the weaving of the story lines, the characterizations do not suffer. The story could have been more linear, and the story would have been just as fine - - that is, the characters would made as much sense, and the story would have made as much sense. But Garland has made a clear choice in his telling, and I'm all for it.* * * * * * * * * * *OK, beyond the structure, what do we have? As several other reviews point out, it's basically three character lines which converge. One involves a smuggler holed up in a hotel for a meeting, who misinterprets a series of events, and the same sequence of events from others' eyes -- leading to an intense gun battle. The second story involves a family whose lives will intersect with the escaping smuggler, and the events that led to their point in the story. The third involves two street urchins and their pursuit of the gun battle (and events leading to their chase). Each narrative is gracefully provided with details to make the thread seem rich with emotion and independence. As a result, no one thread dominates, and characterizations of this as a &quot;crime novel&quot; pay too much attention to the initial thread surrounding the smuggler.I truly enjoyed reading this novel - - it's a great display of artistry and skill."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Great book, detailing a small moment in time (although not exactly run of the mill!) and how all the protagonists got there. Based around a shoot out in a dodgy hotel, it first deals with the two sides of the shoot out. Once they move the gun play outside the hotel it starts to affect others (not suprisingly!) and they affect others etc. The book breathes life into the bystanders, rather than just the core 'interesting' characters, and how each of their actions affect the others. It's hard to say much else, other than it's hard to put down and if his books keep getting better like this I'm seriously looking forward to number three!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Let me first say, that if you are picking up this book in the hopes of another story like &quot;The Beach&quot; you will need to re-adjust your view of Alex Garland before jumping in. The Beach was one of my favorite books of the last few years, but with The Tesseract, Garland has surpassed my expectations. His new novel is a thrilling read and an experiment in plot construction. His gritty style is out in full force as usual, this time on the streets of Manilla. Fans won't be disappointed, as Garland weaves another complex tale set in a foreign tropical surrounding that, once again, allows you to lose yourself in another world. If you have read The Beach, you already know that it is an incredible book. Once you read The Tesseract you will see that Garland is an incredible writer as well."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract is the second novel from Alex Garland, author of the popular The Beach, which was also made into a movie starring Leonardo diCaprio. Set in the Phillipines it is split into three basic parts with a few subplots thrown in for good measure. The first story has Sean waiting for gangster Don Pepe in a small cramped hotel room, not knowing what will become of him. This first part is particularly well evoked, with Sean panicking and trying to guess how his predecessor died. This has the most similar narrative style of Garland's previous book, as it is both fast-paced and deceptively descriptive, managing to convey perfectly what's going on in very few words.The second part involves a long series of flashbacks of a middle-class Phillipino woman named Rosa as she pieces together her past. This is much more gently written, with a constant contrast between who Rosa is and who she used to be. Garland ensures that when the climax of the story does come that it's not only shocking but makes the reader reevaluate what has gone on before.The final story is about two street kids, how they came to live on the streets and their relationship with one another. This is definitely the most gritty part of the novel and Garland ensures us that this is not the backpacker's paradise that The Beach was but an urban hell. Thankfully though Garland refrains from dipping into sentimentality, preferring to unflinchingly describe the inner turmoil of his characters than exploit their depressions.The Tesseract is one of those books that will definitely keep you hooked but unfortunately it does suffer when compared to The Beach, which was just that little bit more exciting. Also unfortunate is the book's very format which virtually forces its reader to pick a favourite story and character. Still, that doesn't take away from the fact that compared to most modern novels this is excellent and is well worth picking up."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"If you're looking for another Beach, foget it. Garland takes 10 giant steps forward to create one of the most unique and satisfying novels of the year. Lyrical, visual and exhilarating. Can't wait to see where he goes next."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"For starters,The Tesseract is a much better book than The Beach. Why everybody wants to knock it so much is a mystery to me. I kept thinking that it should have been a book of three short stories but ultimately Garland ties things together in a masterful way.The only flaw is a blatant and somewhat pretentious attempt at incorporating the whole 'Tesseract' theme. He actually sells his own book short by doing this. Let a very good,tight story speak for itself. Not to compare the two, but what if instead of Moby Dick, Melville would have called his book 'A ship captain explores inner meaning and life's struggle with the hunt of a whale as metaphor.'..That aside, read this book as it is brilliant in parts with great movement through time with fascinating and gripping characters."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract and The Beach are the most amazing novels I ever read. I read this book in two sittings, not because it is simply, but because you can't wait to read the next sentence. This book is not about finishing the last page. It is about being amazed at each word, sentence and page, you will never want it to end. Just as wonderful as the Beach, but written very differently. The complex characters make you wonder about the world around you and the stories of the strangers you see on the street. Mr. Garland please write another soon. Alex Garland has a gift from God and is gracious enough to share it with the world."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland's Second novel, did not impress me as much as his first, yet I found his tightly woven plot,(though sometimes tedious and tiring), was very interesting. The three stories that occure are somewhat unbalanced in depth, yet provide a nice variety in character style. Overall, I would recomend this book, and am eagrly awaiting his next novel."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I love the way the characters are so exotic, yet humdrum. Author gets into each person's head, though they're incredibly different types of people. Really good writing."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I'm not a 20 something but I loved both The Beach and this book. Garland's writing style sucks me in and his exotic locales and compelling action keep me reading. His books are unique and exhausting!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Very fascinating but also very pretentious ---. It appears that the author has spent some time in the Philippines --- as he peppers the narrative with lots of Philippine words but somehow he misses the nuances and sometimes inappropriately uses words in context and thus falls flat when read by Filipinos. Of course I am sure that this book garnered or is garnering critical reviews especially of the depiction of scary and exotic Manila. But that's what it is really - it is an exotified Manila, close yet far from the truth. I didn't even finish the book - as soon as I was in the section where the the protagonist was instructed to go to Patay (Death) hotel, I put the book down. Who the hell in the Philippines would name a hotel that way? It's just makes a mockery of Manila which, given, is a very tired, dirty city."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"A much more mature novel than The Beach, which was a waste of time. I found the first part of the book, the gangster stories, somewhat tedious, but when I got to the story of Rosa I was solidly engaged."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland's follow-up to his highly acclaimed 'The Beach' proves to be just as compelling, yet infinitely more clever.The three apparently separate storylines will of course prove to be linked - we all know this from the book's blurb - and the reader is urged to turn every page whilst hypothesising how Garland will do this. Whether or not he is entirely successful in his finale is a matter of opinion, but no-one can accuse him of not doing what he sets out to do.To explain anymore would be to reveal plot details that are a joy to discover, held together by concise language and a fragmented structure which ensure a smooth, yet never boring, passage through the novel. Although the second story, concerning Rosa, is arguably the best, all three contain intriguing elements and a vague quirkiness which fascinates.Although comparisons with Greene are abundant, it is actually reminiscent of Iain Banks earlier works, particulary 'Walking on Glass'. Liked that? You'll love 'The Tesseract'."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland serves up a literary treat as tasty and Filipino in flavor as chicken adobo. A hip, literate, crime thriller both gripping and thoughtful. Nicely spare--a lot is conveyed (about plot and character) in few words. Only weakness is when Garland waxes overly metaphysical (e.g., forcing the tesseract analogy, or serving up post-modern existentialist cliches). Still very cool. (I will definitely go find a copy of The Beach.)"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"It is extremely difficult to read an author's second novel - following a debut of sheer brilliance - without comparing it to the first. 'The Tesseract' is no exception: I found myself comparing it to 'The Beach' at regular intervals. Personally, I thought The Beach was a more enjoyable read but this in no way means that The Tesseract is a bad book. Garland's debut was of such a high standard that it would have been extremely difficult to better it. The Tesseract still rates as an excellent book. It is a very cleverly written novel - three stories that &quot;collide in a shattering finale&quot; (back cover). I often found myself nodding my head in admiration for intelligent comments and witty observations. There are pieces in the book that send shivers down the spine on account of their tangibility, a factor in common with The Beach. Where it does differ from the author's debut is the subjects that it deals with. I could also not help noticing that Garland's style had matured - it is a much cooler commentary. On the whole, I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has read The Beach, but equally to those who are new to Alex Garland."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"the precision and the absolute reality of the characters in this fiction makes me think of Goethe.the philosophy behind the book reminds Albert Camus.the style is like paintings by Seurat:shadows of information here an there finally give a complete picture.Einstein's relativity is not far.like a great wine with many flavors,this book leaves its mark in your mind"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"yes, i would agree with the other reviewers that it would be hard to peg the author of 'the beach' and 'the tesseract' as the same person. but what does that say about a writer facing the expectations of following up such a critically acclaimed piece with a work that shines twice as bright? garland presents such a keen psychological understanding of so many different types of people in this novel that i swear he is either exceedingly intelligent or excessively schizophrenic, or maybe even both."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After reading &quot;The Tesseract&quot; I was impressed enough to go out and pick up &quot;The Beach&quot;.

It's actually quite a good plot, but his misses the mark with the telling - falling back on the old formula of a single incident told by several characters. One suspects he's looking to sell the story to Hollywood. The novel certainly has a screenplay feel, and lacks depth of character. Nevertheless, it's worth a read if you don't take it too seriously."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Great mix of fiction, life and culture !

It felt like a book, while &quot;The Beach&quot; felt real! It's still worth reading, but &quot;The Beach&quot; is twice as good.

More importantly, though, it's written with a compassion which pulls the reader in and doesn't let go until the final page. But the best thing about The Tesseract is that there's absolutely no chance of it being made into a Hollywood blockbuster, and for that we should all be thankful."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland's writing is still strong, and that is what kept me reading. This is a suite of four story threads which intersect, but not in a very tesseract way. I felt he didn't get the real idea of a tesseract, or else used it cheaply. This was a fine book, but not as exciting as The Beach. However, readable and well-written. As with The Beach, ignore flyleaf accolades, as they are sickening and overdone."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Oh, what a pain it was to finish this book! After reading and enjoying The Beach, I bought The Tesseract without even opening the cover. Sean's run-in with Don Pepe and his boys, and Rosa's life story, could have made two good short stories. I guess there's not much money in that, though."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"A Tesseract is a four dimensional entity, or a hyper-cube. Sometimes, the word is used to describe the three dimensional object that is formed when a four dimensional object unravels. A tangible outcome of an intangible concept. The Tesseract also doubles as the title of writer, Alex Garland's, follow up to his magnificent debut, The Beach. The latter's reputation was somewhat muddied by a mediocre cinematic adaptation, but go back to it and you will find a molasses of nihilistic exuberance. Indefinable, provocative, sensational and sensationalist, The Beach was a brilliant piece of work. Anybody who tells you otherwise is a vile little vermin. PG rated obscenities aside, Garland has, wisely, not tired to duplicate his earlier success, but instead has chosen to head into a subtler (not necessarily less violent) terrain. Fortunately, he has lost none of the vigor that made his first novel such a success.Think of each of the three major interdependent plot threads that run through The Tesseract as an isolated hurricane. Every protagonist goes through paranoia, weariness, succor, discovery and paranoia again. A British expatriate, Sean, sitting alone in a crummy Manila hotel, waiting for a local mestizo to grant him an unofficial safe passage for the business he represents goes a little beserk. He looks at the crummy room's crummy telephone. It has cigarette burns all over it. He looks at the keyhole and sees that it has a metal plate blocking it. He decides that mestizo and his henchmen are out to kill him, he waits, with a gun. Garland then leaves the agitated Brit, mid-cycle, and flashes back to a point in his past. At first it seems abrupt, the past doesn't completely explain the present. Instead of going back to the hotel room, Garland then observes the mestizo and his henchmen for awhile, they too have pasts that are, briefly, dragged into this hot, congested Manila afternoon. They all meet at the hotel, shots are fired, and the invisible cycle is broken by random violence.Instead of following the chase that ensues, Garland leaves this story and observes a middle class Manila family, a doctor, her mother, her children, her husband and their complicated history. Off all novels you'd expect Garland's follow up to The Beach to resemble, the least likely would be Arundhati Roy's The God of Small Things, yet this segment is strongly reminiscent of that novel. A third brilliantly observed tale of two homeless kids is introduced. The kids sell their night dreams to a rich, strange child psychologist, who then looks out from his high rise luxury apartment and observes the inter-connectedness of things.If nothing else, The Tesseract is an amazing architectural achievement. But there is an inherit danger with a novel as ambitious as this one. The temptation for authors to fall in love with metaphysics and other crude forms of self love has consistently proven too great to resist. For The Tesseract to stand a chance the characters must be, at least, three dimensional, making choices and not succumbing to an author's grand vision of the world. A luxury Garland provides. The only thing certain about the inevitable convergence of the plot is that it will involve violence to counteract the violence that started this chain. It is a testament to Garland's great skill that he seems a mere observer of this outcome rather than a manipulator.Comparisons with The Beach are, ofcourse, mandatory. In that respect most critics have judged The Tesseract to be more mature, ambitious, level headed, expansive and less jaded. I would agree and I'm heartily recommending it. I would also argue that the Tesseract, because of those qualities rather then inspite of them, is the lesser of the two."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland's first book, 'The Beach', somehow transcended its plot holes and difficult opening pages to become one of the most compelling and effective novels ever written, and it was always going to be a tough act to follow. Still, the first 50 pages of 'The Tesseract' are promising enough: Garland moves confidently in a promising new direction, serving up a tense atmospheric Tarantino-esque meeting between Sean and Don Pepe -- a meeting that explodes in sudden violence and segues into a life-and-death footchase through nighttime Manilla. Then -- perhaps at the promptings of some misplaced high-art, novelistic impulse? -- the action abruptly stops mid-chase, and for 150-odd pages Garland indulges in a digressive flashback centered around a new character, Rosa.Digression and flashback can be used to good effect (again, cf Tarantino), but here they're deployed gratuitously, as Garland drags us back and forth across the surface of Rosa's dull and (despite the exotic trappings) entirely conventional world. And where, incidentally, is the one scene -- Rosa's break up with Lito -- that might actually have been interesting? Like other potentially powerful scenes, it seems to have been almost studiously avoided. Perhaps these omissions are meant to reflect the haphazard workings of life? Or to illustrate how the 'big' things dont really matter? Whatever. The received impression is simply that the author was too lazy to deal properly with his material.Finally, after at last getting back to the chase for a couple of paragraphs -- although all the tension and interest in Sean and his pursuers has by now completely evaporated -- we're off on another digression, admittedly with marginally more interesting characters this time (Vincente and Totoy, the Manilla street kids) but so larded with embarrassingly adolescent conceipts that it becomes a real struggle to make it through to the end of the book.What a mess -- and what a shame!What Garland has written here is a short story -- and a pretty good one too! -- padded out to novel length with 250 pages of boring, pretentious filler. Do yourself a favor, and do what Garland's editor should have done: tear out those 250 pages, toss them away, and then sit down and enjoy the remaining 70 pages of effective, atmospheric writing."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland is an experimental author, whose willingness to take risks has paid off in some outstanding books. (Beach, his take on utopia is one) Unfortunately, for most lay readers, the Tesseract isn't one.By definition, a Tesseract is a mathematical construct with connective properties beyond the description of an Amazon review. The book is written in such an interwoven style. As a technical (and artistic) achievement, this is both unique and novel. As a readable thriller, not so much.Perhaps the lasting impact of the book is it predates the Montage style movies (21 Grams, Crash, City of God) who try weaving less \\"mathematically perfect\\" stories toghether. Again, this is a successful artistic vision, but the readability of the novel suffers. It's not one the average reader will find gripping."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I found it gripping all the way through, story telling for itsown sake, a study in how to grab and hold the readers attention.It was also an interesting look into life in the Phillipines, atleast as viewed by Mr. Garland."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"While I personally prefer Garlands first novel &quot;The Beach,&quot; &quot;The Tesseract&quot; is certainly an excellent book as well. It may be challanging at some points for younger or less mature readers (condescention intended), but read it again and try to get it. I would know about &quot;not-mature-enough&quot; factor, by the way. I read this first two years ago, and didn't pass Sean, and again a year after that, where I couldn't get further than 15 pages into Rosa. Now, having just finished it, I can honestly say that the payoff is extream. It does come off as kind of a tease starting with Sean, but putting him in at first was the best way to catch attention. Would you read this book at all if it began with Rosa? Most likely not."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract starts off so much like The Beach (Alex Garland's first novel). The setting is a slimey hotel in the tropics (Manila), and we have a man caught up in some rather nasty (criminal) business. However just as the tension really builds the author does a major context switch and the reader is then told the lives of various tangential Filipino characters. In the end Alex Garland pulls everyone together for a rather shocking (read: violent) finale. Weird? Yes. But surprisingly well done.For me The Tesseract is a better book than The Beach, an incredibly successful first novel by Garland. Firstly the author really captures the sense of despair of the Filipino people and the seedy, humid, polluted, and impoverished elements of Manila. Rather than being a singular story of urban violence Alex Garland paints a panorama of unfortunate lives. While its \\"bouncy\\" structure works very well generally I thought the beginning (mondo violence) and ending (mondo violence) were a bit inconsistent with the rest of the book (human drama, no violence). But unlike The Beach, The Tesseract certainly isn't cool. No sex, no drugs, and no beautiful people. It's just a well-written novel..."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"For those of you who read the Beach, expect something completely different. Moving away from the theme of paradise lost, Garland weaves several stories together at different points in time. The stories vary in tone, from crime to love, and the end of the book brings all thirteen of the main characters together. While the plot is hard to describe, rest assured that anyone that reads this will be more than satisfied. Garland is at the top of his game here, created cinematic gunfights for some characters and picturesque tranquil landscapes for others. He captures the essence of all of his characters, male, female, old, young, and makes them all believable to the reader. He also, as in the Beach, succinctly summarizes foreign lands in such a way so that you can actually picture yourself there, along with each of the characters. This is a fantastic book, and I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is beautifully and artfully written, with strange twists, sullen characters and several stories which eventually intertwine to form one story. The Philippines is often a very dark place, and Garland portrays it in a deep and meaningful way."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract offers a rich and diverse assortment of characters that collide in a novel that is original and intense. The setting in Manila provides the location whereby fate brings them together in the climax of the story, yet Alex Garland expertly weaves their past and futures intricately throughout the novel to grip the reader in a book not easy to put down. I anticipate more unique work from Garland."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"this man really is something special. the rashomon format (telling one story from multiple perspectives) is not new, but the novel as a whole, to my mind, glistens with originality. unlike in the beach where every character was an unlikeable smelly hippy, here garland makes you feel a close attachment to every single character. which is interesting, given that many of these people are in conflict with each other. with the tesseract, garland has created something which for me is all too rare--an edifying, intelligent, literary piece that is accessible and enjoyable to everyone."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"the tesseract is obviously not as well written as his debut novel, the beach. hence the three stars. the extra star added because he's cute."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"A bit of a bummer coming after The Beach, this one really feels like what could have been a terse, tense short-story padded with filler into a slow-moving (despite its brevity) novel. The connections at time seem strained, and the constant flash-backs and attempts at scope really just slow things down. You certainly get drawn in with the first part, but find yourself wandering considerably until a very well done payoff. If anything, though, the end of the book only shows the considerable talent Garland possess but never fully realizes this time out. But I'll still be waiting for the next one."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Dissapointing and unoriginal, I would have expected so much more from the man who wrote &quot;The Beach&quot;. I couldn't help feeling so much more could have been done with the rather cliche and dissapointing ending, I was expecting a huge climax. The stories involved came together in a way which felt oddly familiar. Not to say that Alex Garland isn't a truly impressive new writer, which he is (&quot;The Beach&quot; was one of the best debut novels I have read), but if you read this and hated it, &quot;The Beach&quot; will restore all your faith in the world. One question: Why is Leonardo DiCaprio to play the lead in the movie?"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"If The Beach was your favourite book of recent years you have to read the Tesseract!

A number of different characters' experiences over one night in Manila are told, the stands of the story gradually coming together to an explosive climax.The Tesseract is a more &quot;mature&quot; (oh how patronising, sorry Alex) novel than the Beach, and as such may not be appreciated by some of all of those who bought into the 20something fantasy of the Beach. However, if you have the stomach for an altogether deeper read (without sacraficing tension and page-turning excitment), I cannot recommend the Tesseract more highly."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I liked the movie \\"The Beach,\\" but reading \\"The Tesseract\\" made me not want to finish the book (&quot;The Beach&quot;). I agree with a lot of the reviewers who did not like &quot;The Tesseract&quot;. I thought this book was unfocused, discursive and not very compelling.The only reason why I persisted with this book was because I am Filipino-American and you don't get very much about us in art nowadays. His description of the climate and Tagalog social intercourse are insightful. But author's atheism and the nauseating violence annoy the most patient reader. Persistence does not pay for this one."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The beauty of The Beach was that everything happened seamlessly, unfolding in a seemingly natural way even though the story took many unconventional twists and turns. In The Tesseract, Garland's desire to explore a more experimental narrative hurts the story in that the narrative seems forced, the story unbelievable, with too much time spent on unconvincing characters (the orphans with hearts of gold come to mind). O.K. -- not great."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"It starts interesting enough. Manila in the eyes of a Westerner. Garland manages to capture the grit and darkness of the city I live in. Thrilling, to say the least. But when it reaches part II (Rosa's story), it sucked big time. I don't know about readers outside the Philippines, but Rosa's part reads like something out of a high school textbook. It's cliche (at least on this part of the world); the bucolic setting, the pretty lass not marrying her provincial boyfriend, making it big in the city, and so on. This setting has been written so many times by other authors and probably students as well. The third part, also leaves much to be desired and seems irrelevant (I think).On second thought, contrary to press releases, Manila isn't even integral to the story. Sure Garland (being a frequent visitor) captured the mood, the language, the mannerisms, but his novel can take place anywhere in the world. After The Beach, I'm disappointed."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"An amazing novel. Garland is a master story teller who speaks to this generation. He shows us the seedy underbelly of the world and then brings us into the hope of those above it. He brings the characters to life with vivid imagery until you actually feel for their sorrow and happiness. I read this book in one and a half days and it has remained one of my favorites ever since. I seriously could not put it down."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is one of the best I've read in a long time. I can't compare to The Beach because I haven't read it. But The Tesseract is enthralling, the images perfectly laid out and the description beautifully articulate. You are INSIDE the lives of the characters, and the whole story has an air of sinister mystery about it. It starts out a little slow but becomes gripping, even if the logic is a tiny bit hard to follow. You have to piece things together, Alex Garland did not write a single straightforward sentence in the whole book, but this just adds to it's mystery. The story ends a bit abruptly, but it doesn't give you that unsatisfied feeling at the end. It is a unique work and I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I was extremely disappointed with Mr. Garland\`s second novel. Apparently he is a victim all the premature praise heaped upon him for his first novel &quot;The Beach&quot;, which although I found interesting, was essentially merely a retelling of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. In &quot;The Tesseract&quot; Mr. Garland attempts to write in a style far beyond that which he is capable of. The unfortunate result is a &quot;novel&quot; which is is not only poorly written but actually painful to read. One gets the feeling they are reading a 12-year old\`s first meandering attempt at writing fiction. If Mr. Garland decides to continue writing, I hope that he realizes that his talent is not great, and that he would be best served to write in a simpler style. All in all, I very much regret having wasted my time reading &quot;The Tesseract&quot; and would warn all others to stay away from this worthless drivel."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Do not buy this book if you want a sequel to The Beach, it is written in a completely different style and pace. Alex Garland is obviously a very intelligent young man, every now and then he shows this in The Tesseract by rambling on about 4 dimensional objects and the psychology of all his characters, but these great jaw-dropping paragraphs are not part of the novel in any way, in fact I think Garland puts them in to try and teach us all a thing or two. The Tesseract is a strange novel, Garland introduces us to a writing style I've never seen before, he describes in great detail the events leading up to someone being shot, then quickly cuts to that persons funeral and all the events around that, only to cut back to the moment of death - right where he left off, this is a strange and joyful way of writing. He uses this technique several times during the novel, ending on a cliff-hanger, seeing the resolve, only to conclude the cliff-hanger and get back into the story. Playing with out minds it seems is Garland's speciality and this book is written just write for the big screen, though it would never be made. The characters are too weak, with as many as 6 main characters and 10 others being crammed into a 350 page novel. The book charts four different lives and lifestyles and throws them all together for an explosive ending - kinda. Stick with Garland he will soon be an icon, but not with this novel, wait for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Being a person who found Garland's well-reviewed THE BEACH to be nothing more than a re-hashing of LORD OF THE FLIES, I can't say that I was surprised with this novel. Garland's short-lived exploration of the concept of the tesseract reveals nothing more than the fact that he has fooled himself into thinking that he is the next Joyce, who explored similar ideas with his notions of parallax and metempsychosis. Some of the reviews exhibited on this page reveal that he has fooled a few others as well. Garland's lack of interest in his own characters is revealed dually in this novel, by the brief treatment that each character receives and by the narrative's oversight of the most sympathetic character, the deformed fisherman. The most disappointing part of this novel is Garland's loss of his unique descriptive style. There are no memorable phrases here to rival those such as a &quot;tie-dye sunset&quot; which appear in THE BEACH. Garland is a poor man's David Foster Wallace."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"IF YOU LIKE &quot;THE BEACH&quot;, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK. IT LEADS NOWHERE.

Every time I watch it, it climbs my favorite movie ladder(which it is now in the top 10). So I decided to (gasp) read the book The Beach to see what all was different from the movie. Sadly my library only had The Tesseract by Alex Garland, so no Beach for me. While I don't read many books, The Tesseract held my attention and was a fun read.The book is simply brilliant, as others have said. This is what I got out of the book: It tackles the issue of time or the 4th dimension something that we as 3 dimensional beings can never really see happening nor control. Whether it be someone who has gotten themself into a bad situation, someone who has loved, or someone who has forgotten the past, time is what none of these people could predict. Much like they could not predict how they would end up spending time together themselves.What we end up with is a group of 3-dimensional people who are haunted by time. And by doing so only look at the next step up, the 4th dimension, but never understanding it as a whole. And with this comes a sense of godlessness that if humans are struggling to comprehend what's behind time, how could they ever comprehend god or some higher dimension in life or the hereafter?The end result is a group of people who at most can only comprehend their view of actions that take place, who never have the full story, who can only make their daily lives less complex but never more. A book through 3 different stories that shows the limits of humanity. Everyone should read The Tesseract."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"A tesseract, as Garland explains, is a four dimensional object. We live in a three-dimensional world and therefore cannot comprehend a tesseract. A tesseract cannot be understood until it is unraveled into a three-dimensional object.This story is like a tesseract. If one were to read the final act first, there would be no understanding of how these very diverse characters could end up at such a violent climax. So Garland uses changes in time and location to tell the story from the beginning. He does this in a way that intrigues the reader.The diverse characters are an agitated Englishman, a malicious Phillipino crime lord, his three thugs, a mother of two young children, and two teenage street kids.Garland's use of language is impressive. He seems to meticulously choose each word to suggest the seedy side of the city of Manila: Dirty, Humid, Dust, Stains, Heat. He also draws a distinction between the chaotic and menacing city and the slightly more tranquil suburb. However, even in the suburbs a neighbor may come to the door with a shotgun in hand.Like in an ancient tragedy, fate mercilessly drags these characters together for a violent climax. The concept of fate lurks just under the surface of this novel leaving the characters with little autonomy and propelling them like trains on a track to a final cataclysm.Thinking back on this book, my pleasure in it is still somewhat a mystery. I think the answer is this: taken separately, I would have had little interest in these characters. However, Garland weaves their lives into an intricate yet compact passion play that gripped me and compelled me to finish and ultimately enjoy the book. Together, they make up the tesseract, which is not fully understood until unraveled."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Okay, I'll state my position on 'The Beach' straight up (well, everyone else seems to) I thought that Garland's previous book was good - not great, but good. I thought that it might have been great to start with, but felt eventually that it was too long and the ending was rushed and confused - I still don't think I'm sure what happened (perhaps I'll find out if I ever watch the film). So I felt Garland was just another prettyboy brand-name dropping, overhyped, right-place-right-time-face-fits-nice-smile writer. But this book is great - not brilliant, but great and there are few enough of these to be thankful for them when they come along. The story shows us perhaps a dozen people in sympathetic characterisation, all of whose lives become dramatically interlinked in the events of one blood-soaked Manilla evening. Everything is a shade of grey, everything portrayed is understandable if not forgivable (except the spoiled, power-hungry Don Pepe) and all is believable - from the out-of-his-depth Englishman abroad, Sean, trying to cut an unspecified deal in a seedy hotel with folk he doesn't trust, to the streetwise bario child Vincente still trying to understand why his well-off father never returned to the traffic lights with his soda-pop five years before. Having been lent 'The Beach' as a &quot;you've simply got to read this&quot; book and finding this one while on holiday, I've still never actually owned an Alex Garland book. If his next one is as much of an improvement upon 'The Tesseract' as that one is upon 'The Beach', however, I certainly think I'll be buying his third novel."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Most authors would steer away from exploring the topic of life's interconnectivity because they would be intimidated to attempt to explain the unexplainable. Only an author that is extremely confident in their ability would try to explore such an audacious theme. Fortunately for the reader, Alex Garland is such an author. While Garland doesn't entirely succeed in wrestling this topic to a manageable level, he is able to create a powerful story that holds the reader's interest.Garland's success is derived from his superb depictions of the book's characters and setting. From the metaphoric (the PhD candidate who almost literally lives in an &quot;ivory tower&quot;) to the realistic (the doctor who has yet to heal the pain in her heart), Garland creates characters that are unforgettable. These characters are complimented by his vivid description of Manila and other parts of the Philippines. The effect of these efforts gives the reader clear focus points to reference while the broader theme is explored.It wouldn't have been surprising if this book had rambled out of control, especially given its topic. However, it's a testament to Garland's skill that he can tackle a subject of such scope with the incredible focus that is apparent in the narrative. In fact, the only criticism I have is that the book is a little too focused, as is evidenced by the tidy ending. Still, a book that attempts to explore such a complex issue, and does it in an entertaining manner, should be read immediately."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland is a magician of language, dissecting and constructing words to unravel layers of stories and emotions that, like the geometrical figure, he assembled and rotated before the audience's eyes, revealing marvels and yet keeping a lot in secret. It is only a pity that the show was not long enough to allow all the wonderment and thrill to sink in, and we see only surfaces of this mysterious tesseract.Coming from the city where he chose to hold such a show, and reading somewhere that he liked Manila better than the other cities he visited abroad, it's a pity that he never seemed to like it that much get to know it better. Alex Garland claimed he never had to do background research for this book -- having lived in Manila for a long time -- and that he never considered culture relevant in the story; that culture was incidental. That was a big mistake, because culture was not only not incidental but pivotal. I always had troubles with foreigners who have lived a year or two in another country and write about it as if they know the soul of its people inside out. Maybe he should have just stuck with the perspective of a total stranger, dazed, caught in confusion; the way he did in The Beach.The trouble is not with the story, not with the characters, maybe not with Alex Garland even. The trouble is all with the show, because just like the magic act, after pages and pages of enchantment and explosions, one really gets and understands nothing. Not the intent, not the characters.When Garland had one of the characters muttered &quot;A Tesserract is something you can not understand...&quot; the reader wonders if he is not just excusing himself."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"There's no question that Garland can put pen to paper and seduce a reader into several hundred pages of story. Likewise, he does an excellent job at revealing detail and plot at a rapid pace keeping his audience hooked. His talent as a writer is what kept my attention throughout the story. The plot covers several hours of events that involve a number of characters. Unfortunately, in my opinion, he spends only a small portion of the pages on the plot, and the majority on character development and background information. Just when he delves deeper and deeper into a characters history, so much so that one's dedication to finishing the book comes into question, we're dumped back into the action of the plot. Despite the shallow plot and superfluous details provided for each character, The Tesseract is worth the read to enjoy Garland's writing."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"While it certainly doesn't pack the same kind of punch The Beach did, Alex Garland's second novel The Tesseract is a new kind of literary experiment in its own right. The story is split between several characters and describes a short night full of murder and gunfire, but this simple setup unravels into each of these characters' lives, jumping from their past experiences to things happening in the present to restatements of plot events from different points of view to how they eventually end up where they do. It can be annoying at some points because you really want the action to come into play soon, but the wait throughout the novel is definitely worth it since you're delving into these characters' minds and learning about them, providing you with some provocative questions about life, while at the same time being explained to how they're connected with the other characters. My only problem with The Tesseract was the boring second act, but everything picks up quickly and the end result is a fantastic novel that makes you wish Garland would stop writing movies for a little bit and just write a new book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Think Quentin Tarantino movies. Now picture that in written form. Garland takes three individual stories and allows them to run their natural course, eventually overlapping with one another through brilliant twists pulled off by the author Alex Garland. If you have read his first novel, The Beach (much better than the movie) then you are already familiar with his writing expertise. He grabs your attention from the very first page, and doesn't let go until the last sentence of the novel. I would also suggest looking into the meaning of \\"Tesseract\\" which is quite an interesting concept in itself. Somehow Garland manages to take seemingly unrelated stories and intertwine them with ease. A must read!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland's second effort as a professional author is actually quite good. His first book being the award-winning The Beach - he did have a tough act to follow.This book reads very much like a &quot;Pulp Fiction format.&quot; It is three stories woven into each other, while having flashbacks upon themselves at the same time. You really have to read it to get what I am saying, and you really have to know writing to appreciate how difficult it can be to write the way Garland did. I give him more credit as an author after reading this book. I did not, however, like this story as much as I enjoyed The Beach story. By its very nature, sometimes I got the names confused bouncing from one story to the next (and as an american I also can't relate to the asian names, and remember who is who clearly.) Short of those minor issues I still enjoyed the story.The way Garland describes things, it is like you can actually picture being there -- which is rare for authors to do. Many try and fail, but this is one modern author who does paints a picture for you with his words. Something you can't learn in college...I recommend if you have read The Beach or not, but if you haven't read The Beach get that book also. They are both excellent and very quick reads."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"If all writers wanted to do was write their last book again there really would be no point-so do not be surprised that this is far removed from The Beach. Be pleased.The Tesseract is an intelligent, complex and intriguing book that deserves more than to be either better or worse than The Beach. The interweaving of polarised characters is a feature of the book as the reader is often jolted from different times and places but always managing to stay on the right tracks. Set in Manila, the book has an exotic feel that sways from the passionate to the rustic to the cold moralising of the criminal underworld.The different characters are explored and enlightened in a manner that would suggest this writer has written more than he actually has. A distinct feeling of momentum is built up and the last third of the novel is like a growing force that one senses is going to be smashed apart. And herein lies the problem. One is acutely aware of the impending interweaving of characters and is looking for reason, symbolism and satisfaction to all the enjoyable and admirable ground work that is put in previously. It is unfortunate that the many roots of the book do not lead anywhere and instead jut out in the memory for their eventual incongruity. There are many layers to the book and it is an engaging read- it is simply a shame that such a rich construction could result in something far removed from its' seeming potential."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I wasn't ready to dismiss the author just quite yet, after pointless and shallow The Beach. I have never put down a book after 18 pages, until now. I will give Alex Garland credit for at least moving The Beach along, but The Tesseract's opening scene just sits there for 18 pages. I guess if I want to read a great adventure/suspense novel, I should just dust off my old Alistair MacLean novels."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After reading The Beach, I ran to my bookshop to buy the second novel of Alex Garland. I had no doubts that Alex Garland was such a good writer that he'd written another chef d'oeuvre. But I just couldn't believe how awful and sad was Tesseract. It was empty and tasteless. Absolutely rubbish. I still don't understand how Garland managed to write such a piece of crap after writing such an amazing first novel. Was he so desperate for publishing ?? If you liked the Beach, don't bother with tesseract. At least, wait for the third novel, it can't be worse anyway."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I do not understand how this type of book can be published. Its a painful reading, an empty story and a total waste of time."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As great as I thought THE BEACH was, TESSERACT is twice as amazing. This book is as detailed and tightly woven in structure as any that I have read this year. It disappoints me greatly that Alex Garland still has yet to gain the widespread respect that he deserves in America. Garland is everything that Douglas Coupland, Bret Easton Ellis and Jay McInerney have never been. In my opinion, after only two books he has proven himself to be the great writer of his generation. This is a book that you MUST read. If you don't want to spend the $25 then get it from the library, but don't pass this book up."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Beach was a good book. Why? Because it combined travelling with adventure in a way that many guide books do not. I snapped up a copy of The Tesseract hoping to travel through the Philippines without actually going there and be persuaded that I should. I read this book three months ago and cannot remember anything about it, other than it was set in the Philippines. If you want a suspense thriller with travel, buy Le Carre. If you want travel pure and simple, buy that guide book. If you want to waste your money, try Las Vegas. Don't buy this. Mr Garland should takle several leaves from Mr Grisham: develop the winning formula first, then repeat it. And then repeat it. My advice for a third novel: Call it &quot;The Boat&quot; set it in Indonesia, have a lead character that keeps Leonardo Dicapprio in work and give the twenty-something something to think about."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"ALEX GARLAND SHOULD HAVE WAITED AT LEAST TWO OR THREE YEARS BEFORE PUBLISHING ANOTHER BOOK.

Now we're told it's to be the basis of a movie. If it were not for these facts, I doubt if this rambling mess of a book would have made it into print. Novels are stories - or should be.

Of course not..."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"What a disappointment! Less plot than the average allotment and a worrying slide towards the vogue of pretention over story.The idea is interesting and Garland writes well enough to almost get away with that alone; but not quite well enough.Read The Beach, which is a joy, and leave this on the shelf unless you're a committed Garland fan."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Reading 'The Beach' (also by Garland) was what made me get The Tesseract. Being a fan of Southeast Asian set novels, and knowing that Garland is a master of the \\"Backpacker's Culture\\", I knew from the start that The Tesseract will not disappoint.This book is no beach culture.It is set in the heart of Manila, in a seedy hotel along Roxas Boulevard. Garland describes the smallest of details of Manila with the precision expected only from one who has lived in Manila itself.While The Beach has both its plot/climax and raw narration to offer, The Tesseract's gem is its fast but just right rhythm, and the way it unfolds how the characters of 3 separate 'stories' are interrelated, hence the title 'The Tesseract'. Take six cubes and arrange them into the shape of a crucifix, at the point where the cross is made. Thats the tesseract.Sean the English seaman and Don Pepe, the aristocratic mestizo. Corazon, Rosa and her children. Rosa and Lito. Totoy and Vicente. All of their stories are presented independently but in the end they all climax in a common joint.I also liked particularly how Garland personified Don Pepe, (a Spanish mestizo with assistant thugs). The author even knows the concept (and the word) of \\"sip-sip\\"--an irritating trait in the Philippine Society. This Don, who also has the mindset of most elite Filipinos, cannot seem to get enough of the irritating habit of uselessly comparing the Philippines to the countries theyve been to.Its also pleasing to know that although Garland also touched on the provincial life in Infanta, Quezon, he didnt stick to the usual Maria Clara stereotype that most foreign authors, and even Filipino authors cast on the female characters.I found out that there's been a movie adaptation produced, the movie altered a whole lot of details. It was set in Bangkok (maybe Manila wasnt exotic enough or marketable enough?), and a female assasin character (not present in the book) was wedged in...perhaps to add a sex factor to it.Directed by some dude named Oxide Pang. That's what you get for tampering with a fantastic novel. A B-grade \\"Chuck Norris\\" type of film."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After \\"The beach\\" the eyes of the world turned to Alex Garland, waiting to see what he was going to write next. It was \\"The tesseract\\". A story divided into three segments, seemingly unrelated, but that are obviously sewn together in the end.The first part is about Sean, a seaman involved with Don Pepe, the mafia boss controling naval traffic through the ports of Manilla. Sean is lying in bed in a deserted, decaying hotel, sweating as he waits for Don Pepe to show up and maybe kill him. This part is very graphic and violent. The second part - the best one in my opinion- is about Rose, a young woman that left her poor village in the Phillipines to become a successful doctor in Manilla. Rose remembers how she found her first love with Lito, a crippled and humble fisherman. The third part, back in Manilla, has Vincente and Totoy, two street kids, as main characters. This part is somewhat boring, slow, and almost ruins the entire book. If the first part has an interesting setting and plot, and the second part has great characters, the third part has nothing much interesting.But what is the tesseract? The tesseract is a hypercube, something that we cannot see because it's in forth dimension. We can only see an aproximate form, like a 3-d cruciform. That's an analogy to the three stories in the book. We know they relate to each other, they come one on topof the other, we just can't see how. The problem is, when Garland tells us, it is not satisfactory. The final moments of the book could have been more developed.All in all, \\"The tesseract\\" is not in the same league as \\"The beach\\". But it is two-thirds of a good reading.Grade 7.2/10"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"He's done it - and confounded his critics! The Boy can write after all - buy this book. Sell everything you have to buy this book! Ring up your friends and tell them to buy this book - you won't regret it! You have to buy this book! Alex Garland has proved his critics wrong - he really can WRITE! This is a much more ambitious book than his last one, and he's done it so well! ENJOY!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alex Garland has the potential to be a great novelist. Like the Beach, the Tesseract doesn't quite pull it off, but it fails in an absorbing, entertaining and thought-provoking manner. In short, it's a good read.The central issue of the book's three main stories is the interconnectedness of life. Our existence interlocks so unexpectedly with that of others that we can't help seeking explanation. It's as though our life-changing chance encounters mean something, but we can't quite grasp what the meaning is. Hence the tesseract, a three dimensional representation of a four dimensional shape. We see the effect, but not the shape itself. Trying to imagine a four-dimensional shape is like trying to make sense of life.However, if philosophical musings aren't your thing, don't let the above put you off. The first eighty pages of this book are a superb example of dark and paranoid thriller writing. The suspense builds as you read to find out if the Englishman will escape alive from the clutches of Don Pepe and his henchmen. The finale of the book is nail-biting too. This kind of 'intelligent thriller' (as many live ideas as dead bodies) reminded me of William Gibson - except Garland is interested in the realism of Manilla, rather than techno-fantasy.I loved the character portrayal in this book - so understated, so evocative. In particular, Don Pepe's murderous obsession with his Spanish blood; the musings of the PhD student in his high tower, buying dreams from street kids. Characters like these make Manilla come alive. Not one way of life but many and disparate. The city itself brings them into collision."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"a very clean piece of writing. The Tesseract is really three (long) short stories connected by location and certain events which characters from each of the stories participate in. in accordance with Martin Amis's prediction that good fiction will embrace science, the speed of light makes an appearance in the last story, as does the tesseract, at which point it becomes clear that Garland's interest in science has a faintly mystical edge to it. i had the sense that the tesseract was intended to explain, at a deeper level, how the stories were connected, but was unsure how it did so. thus, if the three stories, when read together, were supposed to reveal a fourth story, or a supervenient meaning, that story/meaning didn't seem clear to me. Garland is a sensitive portrayer of character and an unobtrusive presence in his work. as far as his prose style is concerned, he packs a fair punch without giving the impression of overexerting himself. overall, this was an absorbing, well-crafted novel, and though i didn't feel the author wrote with sufficient intensity to make the book really demand to be read, it was still a great pleasure to read."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract is a brilliant book ... rich and multilayered, subtly playing on the ideas of destiny and fate without directly introducing them.It is divided into three main sections, following first Sean, waiting to meet the gangster Don Pepe in a roach-infested motel; Rosa, a doctor haunted by her past and first love Lito; and Vincente, an intelligent and thoughtful kid cast adrift on the rough streets of Manila. The back of the book says something like 'in three hours, their destinies will violently collide.' - which pretty much sums it up.The Tesseract is a sophisticated book about fate but also anti-fate - it's recurring theme is the possibilities of destiny (along with the other themes of expendability, and random unfairness, of life) without being directly about destiny. It can't have been easy to get this right - but Alex Garland did, to perfection.I would recommend it to anyone. At any level, it's enjoyable. At the very least it's an interesting, thought-provoking read and a gritty look at Manila. Read it a little deeper and all sorts of subtleties, links and themes become apparent - and it's all these apparently inconsequential details that bring the book together. Mr Garland really is an excellent writer who has created a carefully crafted and detailed story about three interlocking lives. I suggest you give it a try."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The majority of nergative reviews were apparently expecting something on the order of &quot;The Beach Part 2.&quot; Usually people complain when a favorite artist merely rehashes his earlier work, but Garland chose not to do this, and gets slammed for it. While the Beach was a great book, a study of today's youth culture wrapped around a wonderful story.AG outdid himself with this book, an analogy of the f***ed-up ways life works, and one for fiction itself. A tesseract is someone that no one earth can and or ever will understand- the only way to study it is to reduce it to one or several cubes, something manageable. Life is the same way- you can never understand everything that happens, or why it happens. The only way to understand it is to view it in several reduced parts- which is just what any book or story does.The plot itself is great, weaving in and out of the different characters to show all the different sides of a bloody gun battle in Manila. If you don't think the main storyline is too impressive, think about all the people who are involved but who are not mentioned often or at all- the hotel clerk at the Patay, Alan, and the former captain of the Karamajoun, the police who will be investigating the shootings- those people are all part of the little slice of life that the book presents, are all part of the tesseract, some huge, undefinable thing we can't comprehend.While the book failed to be as descriptive and evocative in its portrayal of Manila as the Beach was (its main shortcoming), it made up for it in many other ways. The first part of the book alone is worth the price for the wonderful writing Garland has produced, some of the best I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Let's cut to the chase - 95% of you want to know: is it better than or as good as The Beach? Well, the answer is a resounding yes!, even if that does seem to be a minority view. If you disliked The Beach's rambling narrative but loved its angst, disliked its pseudo-intellectualism but enjoyed its intellectualism, hated its lack of statement but loved its subjective insight, and, more importantly, felt let down by the out-of-the-blue ending, then you will love The Tessaract. Though perhaps not as easily defined as a 'cult classic' as Garland's debut, The Tessaract is by far the better book in terms of scope, drive, characterisation, writing ability, passion, power and sentiment, and what's more, rather than comparing it to The Beach, I found myself comparing The Beach to it. Though its central narrative covers only perhaps an hour of time, the book feels more like a journey than it's predecessor, a dark, rollercoaster of a journey that grips and stuns, surprises and moves in equal measure.In story terms, this is the literary equivalent of Go (Doug Liman's frenetic Pulp Fiction-styled ensemble actioner), three tales that twitch and turn around the same central hook and are in the end reeled in to the same grisly conclusion. It is in this structure, and in this ending, that lies the book's key strength. To flow seamlessly from a doctor in Manila watching ER with her mother to memories of a girl's childhood romance and back again in the blink of an eye, without it feeling staged or forced, is a talent in itself, and the ending is simply too good to be conveyed in words - it should confound you, should annoy you, should make you say: oh, was that it?, but remarkably it doesn't. A hypercube cannot be imagined, and nor can the workings of Fate that brought a paranoid sailor, a doctor and a street kid together at the same time; the best you can do is realise that it is there, whether we understand it or not, and that concept is one so risky that there are very few authors today who would have the courage to go with it.In short, The Tessaract is gutsy, powerful, imaginative, provocative, and is an entirely unique experience. If The Beach set up a list of expectations for Garland to fulfill, The Tessaract fulfils them, and then some.'Maybe there is nothing here I am meant to understand.'Maybe there is no meant to understand.'This means something.'Hello to a whole new era of literature."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract is one of those books you can't put down until your finished reading it. In the beginning I got a bit confused with all the character changes and found myself looking back a couple of times just to check the facts but it didn't take long to get used to the way the book is written. Sometimes, though, i did feel as if the book wasn't going anywhere and kind of rabbled on but all those thoughts disappeared when the extremely violent but extremely satisfying ending came about. The difference in this book though is that the characters are much more believable and you can really connect with them. I didn't think this book was going to very good but i'm pleased to say i was 100% wrong. I wouldn't be surprised if this book got turned into a movie in the near future, lets all hope it is a bit better than disappointing movie version of the beach.Pro's - The characters are much more belivable as is the location of where the book is set.Cons - The constant change of the characters perspectives."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I loved The Beach, Alex Garland's first book. The movie was ok ,however it is the writer's voice in this book that is so unique. In The Tesseract, the writers voice is totally different,and I did not find it unique or compelling as it is in The Beach. I bought the hardback of The Tesseract because I could not wait for another book by this author and was totally disappointed. I do not like short stories and this reminded me of stories not a book. I have read books I like that were written in parts with different points of view and different stories that intertwine but this book I did not enjoy at all! If you haven't read The Beach it is a must read even if you saw the movie. The plot is enjoyable but it is the writing that makes this book special. If you have read The Beach The Tesseract is totally different in tone and writers voice.Do not read The Tesseract just because you liked his previous book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I loved to read that book. When I read it I did not put it down a single time until I had finished it, though at first everything seems to be very strange. I read that Alex Garland did not do any research in advance which is really extraordinary for a book that plays in a foreign country. The characters are described with great accuracy and the plot is brilliantly designed. While reading you fear with each of the three parallel described main characters for each of their fates and wish you could change some things. Since the book has so many facets you should never stop thinking while reading the book because there are lots of subtle remarks you would miss. Since the author is still very young the book is also, and especially interesting for young people. I think even though the reviews by papers differ a lot from each other that this book is even better than his first novel &quot;The Beach&quot;.

Make no mistake, Garland is a Writer. To begin his new adventure, I recommend first reading &quot;Hyperspace&quot; by Michio Kaku, which discusses 10-dimensional universes and other Grand Unified Theories. As a two-dimensional mosaic cross reveals its three-dimensional cube unfolded, the tesseract (a sort of side-to-side cross of cubes) reveals a fourth dimension of space unfolded, and so on. Garland has given us not a story but a mosaic novel. Forget character. Forget plot. Just look at the tiles of the mosaic one by one and then slowly begin to step back to observe the whole. There are tesserae of time: for Sean, a narrative cat-and-mouse chase; for Rosa, the denouement of a lifetime; for Vincente and Totoy, the instant explosion of adventure; for Alfredo, distant dreams. And there are tesserae of circumstance: a meeting gone wrong, a flat tire. And there are tesserae of place: each character living in a Philippines as different, both real and stereotypical, as if they were separate countries. All of these converge to a point in time and place, like the Big Bang of the universe, and then explode in a sudden profusion of viewpoints. Like fireworks, they are individual but whole, abstract but cohesive. Now stand all the way back and observe the entire mosaic. Some will see the inexorable march of Grecian fate. Some will see the divine hand of God. Some will see the coincidental emptiness of existentialism. Some will see the raw evolution of Darwinism, complete with an explosion of Burgess Shale magnitude. Some will see chaos theory, with patterns formed from random events. What is real, the individual stories, the collective image, the points of view or the process itself? Is it another serendipity of human nature that we somehow reflect our multi-dimensional universe? This is a GUTsy book. It cannot be read just once. Like a kaleidoscope, it surprises with each visit."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This is the first book by Garland that I have read... The book is a quick read, well-written, and has a unique point of view. The story is interesting, and there are several very clever bits in the book. Based on my experience with this book, I will read THE BEACH."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract is very Pulp Fiction like in style. It intertwines three short stories into one very nicely. Although the first thirty or so pages of the novel are very slow and boring don't give up. It's gets way better with time and you'll be glad you kept reading. The story is very engrossing and cleverly written. However, if you are expecting The Beach, this is not the same genre of book. Happy reading!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I had thought I wouldn't like this book for the simple reason that is it set in Manila (where I am from). I thought the characters would be shallow and lack any substance, given the fact that Alex Garland is an outsider to the goings on in Manila and couldn't possibly get inside the head of a Filipino, in any part of society.I was wrong.The people I met in the course of reading this book were so real. Alex Garland had a pulse on what runs through the mind of a Filipino...the haciendero/gangster who longs to be a true Spaniard, the street urchin who survives the perils of the urban jungle, the mother with a lost love in the past. Once the book reached its climax, I held my breath, afraid for the ride to be over. But when it did end, like most rides enjoyed, it was worth doing it all over again."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The book isn't very long, and the pace is surprisingly quick. I found myself racing through it pretty quickly. It's a good read, really, though I haven't read The Beach and can't compare.Garland is very good at creating atmosphere, such as the thick heat of Manila, or the isolation of Barrio Sarap. Each of his characters are compelling-- I especially wanted to know more about Rosa. The crash/burn ending wasn't exactly unexpected, but it had a resonance that was surprising for such a short work."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This is the kind of book that you need to read in a short time span. Even then you will need to flip back through the pages to remember which character is which. The same prickly heat that Garland gave us in The Beach is here but not the depth of character. If you are a dedicated reader I would whole heartedly recommend this book, if only for the Manila scenery, but if you love to know the characters and to feel their world, this is not the book for you. Garland jumps from character to character so fast that you can't relate to any of them."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Let's be honest with each other. The Beach was a kid's book, a book written to bolster Garland's bank account, a book for bestseller lists, a book that only flirts with the word 'literature'; Let's start by conceding Garland's first novel was little more than a low impact Golding (Lord o'The Flies) re-write with a formulaic exotic adventure template, and a startling lack of plot. The Tesseract, on the other hand, is a masterpiece; as terse, brief, and brilliantly executed as a professional mafia-hit. I was warned by friends that it wasn't as good as the Beach, and difficult to read too. Nonsense. This is Garland's first real novel, and it does what even Martin Amis has struggled with through 'The Information', and 'London Fields'. It threads the narrative with a vaguely scientific, almost astral, laypersons physics theme which ultimately suggests that - like certain molecular structures - our lives can only ever be viewed in their parts, when they're unravelled; they cannot be conceptualised as a whole. And neither can this plot. Written in three parts, which you can tell will combine for a grand finale, the Tesseract maintains a level of tension and compassion throughout that is reflected best in his insightful writing of Cente and Totoy, two Filipino streetkids. Their interactions are written as if he has been one, and knows their mind closely. Indeed, Garland's greatest skill is his ability to imbue every character with a personality, a soul that avoids stereotyping. He works tirelessly to write of people, not Asians, or women, or even drivers. His eye is as clear as Delillo's, and his perception of the world a continuous source of intrigue. Again, a sensational novel, probably a masterpiece, and all the better for its brevity. It's no surprise there are readers on this page wondering what it's about, or yearning for another mediocre exotic thriller; most revolutionary novels confused and angered the hoi polloi of their time. Savour the Tesseract, and witness the birth of a truly Great novelist."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"More a set of short stories than a novel. The main character is Rose, with her mother Corazon and her children Raphael and Lita. They are a tightly knit family, living in Manila. Rosa, who came from a poor barrio, escaped to be a physician - but can't forget Lito, the love of her teen age. Don Pepe highjacks ships for a living and makes some extra pesos with protection money. Alfredo is the lonely savant. Vincente and Totoy are street children. All their lives are written up nicely, against the background of Manila and the barrio. The mood is set by innumerable sunsets.Now all these fates are converged and twisted together. There is no reason for it, just sheer happenstance. The writing is good and clear, but twisting all the fates into a final strand really makes little sense. A nice read, but not overwhelming."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"...the character development in The Tesseract was much deeper, causing me to relate to almost every character in the book (and there are a lot). I thought the different points of view Garland wrote from gave this book added dimensions that set it apart from most other books. I was very impressed with Alex Garland's second novel and can hardly wait for him to write another!"},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book is well-written, and has an interesting enough story that it would make a great read at the beach, in an airport, or on a long weekend. Descriptions of Garland's place in literature tend to be overstated. He is no Graham Greene (at least not yet), as the publishers would have us believe. The book reads surprisingly fast, an easy 270-plus pages. Definitely worth the time it would take to read, but be wary of those trying to sell this book as &quot;the best&quot; anything. Buy it, read it, and have fun."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Am I the only Alex Garland fan who preferred this title to the Beach? I found the Tesseract a more maturely written and constucted book. I would go so far as to say - an almost perfect read."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I thought The Beach was great, and was hoping for something similar, in depth and thoughtfulness at least. But I found The Tesseract a mish-mash of characters, peppered with irrelevent dream sequences and semi-random characters. It wasn't BAD mind you - just not great, which is what I was expecting. Everyone else seems to think this book is another masterpiece, and maybe I'm just missing something - but I found it convoluted and choppy."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"A disappointing book, despite the snazzy screen advertising. The author seems caught awkwardly between a desire to write a thriller, with its potential for movie deals and big sales, and Literature (capital L). The result is a self-conscious, ponderous tale, that never becomes exciting, and fails to be interesting at the intellectual level. Garland may want to be the next Grahame Greene, but for my money the comparison is a joke. In short, the book just doesn't justify its billing."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract by Alex Garland, has a literary freshness to it. The old tried and true methods of plot writing aren't his style. He doesn't write for the market, but readers love him because he never gives them what they are used too. His work, though gritty at times gives the feeling of a real experience. The plot swells, contorts and bends, some of the corners meet and some don't. The shape of it all is strange, but hauntingly familiar. It is unusual, but then it's not. What happens to the characters at times seems startling, but then it's not, because life happens like that. The story's gritty reality is about people and their lives and how some come together while others pass each other by never knowing there is a connection. To describe any of the action is to give away too much, because in this tale you spend time a lot of time in the character's heads while they seem to seep into yours. It is a fast story, I read it in one afternoon and came away feeling both enlightened and mystified and looking for another book by Garland."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Writing Style - 3/5Characters - 2Storyline - 3Resonance - 2The Not-Too-Revealing Synopsis:The Philippines, the racketeering scene, a misunderstanding and a bunch of people who are tangentially involved.The Review:Garland is at his best when he deals with the sarcastic, insightful, Generation-X transient Westerner traveling abroad. It is a pleasure to be introduced to the afore mentioned character in the beginning of the book and even more enjoyable to witness him in a mischievous quandary so fantastically twisted that it can be called no less than wicked. The remaining flashbacks and cutouts of the Philipino characters fall flat. They do not fit Garland's style and as with everything else I've read of Garland's, the quality of the writing reflects the quality of the characters. The concept of the tesseract is something thrown in almost desperately, as if a mindbending novelty could bring everything together. But the tesseract is little more than a mention and while the reader is free to expound on it, Garland did not. The Tesseract reads like a short story idea that a publisher pressured an author to work out into some minimum page length before it could go to printing. I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"&quot;The Tesseract&quot; is perhaps not what one would expect as a follow-up to Alex Garland's enormously popular and well-received debut novel &quot;The Beach&quot;. While &quot;The Beach&quot; may perhaps be construed as a decently plotted pop culture novel (albeit with ominous undertones), this second novel takes the reader in a different direction, culminating in an ending that seems designed to - God forbid - make the reader think.With that said, I have mixed feelings about this book. The first part is misleading - taut, psychologically compelling, more-or-less a return to the territory Garland first explored in &quot;The Beach&quot;. What follows though is a book that strives to be multi-layered (like a jigsaw puzzle, if you will - hence the meaning of its title)with seemingly disjointed sections all coming together for a big bang-'em-up ending. While the whole is rather perversely satisfying, the sum of its parts don't always make for a compelling read.The central focus of the plot is the story of a young village girl named Rosa who has a brief - and fatefully aborted - relationship with a semi-deformed young fisherman whose family seems cursed by physical deformity. She moves away to study medicine in Manila, marries a decent, loving husband, and has two children by him. When she and her family revisit her village upon the death of her father, tragedy strikes in the form of a reunion with her ex-childhood lover.Another section of the book revolves around a Ph.D candidate's thesis interpreting the dream-lives of Manila's street kids.All of these disparate elements come together in a conclusion that is surprising, well-crafted, and really very exciting. Upon closing the book for the last time, I found myself reflecting on all that had come before, piecing it together and then tying it into the book's title &quot;The Tesseract&quot;.Unfortunately, I found a good portion of the novel slow-going. The writing certainly isn't bad - Garland has a terrific feel for naturalistic dialogue - it just didn't keep me anticipating what was coming on the next page. Again, however, I really enjoyed the pay-off at the end as well as scattered passages throughout.This is the work of a serious novelist-in-development. I eagerly await Mr. Garland's next book and look forward to the development and maturity of his craft."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I wasn't too fond of this sophomore novel from Garland. I found it hard to follow, and didn't really care too much for the characters. He tried too hard with this one."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I'm sorry but after reading 'The Beach' I had high expectations of Garland's second novel, but after finishing it I was left with the question. What's the point?The book builds slowly, very slowly and when you finally get to what you think the point of the book is, it ends.I'm not going to write in this review aboutthe story line because as far as i could tell there's no story.Don't buy it, just re-read the beach and wait for the third book."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland's second book is about the inexplicable tragedies that occur and the ways we attempt to explain, understand, and rationalize them. Like Scott Heim's books, this doesn't leave the reader with any easy answers, but does achieve its own goal of exploring the parts of human experience that are often overlooked."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This is a very short book, which the publisher has struggled to pad with lots of white space and big type (at least in my edition); but it still manages to be dull. Yes, the opening is quite good. Some of the writing is quite good, but clearly Garland has no idea how to develop his story and shies away from anything with too much plot, as if afraid of losing his literary street cred. So he opts for a meaningless and unengaging structure with lots of jumping around between characters, and ends up with a mess. That some reviewers think this is all a sign of his being a 'serious' novelist only shows how pitifully timid and easily led most of them are. Next time, I'll pass."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Ok so as almost every one else has mentioned the Beach ,I am not . I could see exactly where he wanted this book to go and in what format to do it , but this ,unfortunately did not happen . He tries to give a compasionate edge to the characters by explaining phases of there life. For example Jojo - where was that all going ? and again Alfredo , what was the over all reason in him apart from a tool to give us a greater insight into the street kids life and thoughts . When Alfredo's tool like job is done he is quickly dropped . He was trying to make the reader empathise with the characters and wasted a rather lot of time trying to do so. The nice touches where when the different story lines clashed and characters interacted .However this did not happen very often and when it did it was rather brief . Ending on a more positive note I still believe that Garland has the skill to do much better than this and eventually do so ."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Having read &quot;The Beach&quot; some time ago I was elated to see that Garland had written another novel. I went into &quot;Tesseract&quot; expecting it to be similar to &quot;The Beach&quot;. It isn't. At all. It's dry, sparse &amp; moody. If you liked &quot;The Beach&quot; and are wanting another read like it, then know beforehand that &quot;Tesseract&quot; ain't it. Saying that, I must set forth this: &quot;Tesseract&quot; is a good novel. Sort of a &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; or &quot;Short Cuts&quot; in novel form. It's interesting how Garland sets up stories for different sets of characters &amp; then has them finally interact in a showdown at the end. &quot;Tesseract&quot; is entertaining, very well-written and altogether a satisfying read. I enjoyed it. Just not as much as &quot;The Beach&quot;. And that's the problem when a reader comes to a novel with a mindset or an idea of what to expect. If you pick up the book not expecting it to be &quot;The Beach&quot; all over again, I think you'll like it."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Alien landscapes that seem all too familiar, person devastation, and random violent acts. Those are the stock-in-trade ingredients of Alex Garland in this novel and in his accomplished screenplay for 28 Days Later. His characters roam through these stark scenes, just able to survive amid the most inhuman acts of destruction. Whether it's science fiction or the grimy back streets of poverty stricken cities, the pull of his stories is magnetic and inevitable. Garland hanles his innocents of the world and his hardened villains with equal aplomb. The reader is taken, the viewer is fascinated, and all in a deft, sophisticated style. Garland is grim, but beneath the gritty survival story lies a potent and hopeful humanity. Better that The Beach, a complex and intertwined story awaits you in The Tesseract."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"Garland will not escape the comparison between the Beach and the Tesseract. All those who have read both books feel some sort of unutterable compulsion to place them side by side and declare one the victor. I will not do so. Instead, I will say that I loved both books. While the Beach was more psychological, descriptive and in many ways more full, the Tesseract is exploding with measured terse prose and riveting characterization. Each character that Garland paints is as complete and complex as the last. They come together naturally without being forced into the same scene, confused and startled, dissapointed and moved. Its as if Garland was a chance observer of the most remarkable events, not a storyteller. This book reminds me of life, the way it would be viewed if someone had the ability to step back and probe it with soft fingers and a keen eye. Garland has this gift, and both the Beach and the Tesseract are more than worth their while. Garland is something different entirely, his insight is not forced, his quirks not heavy handed, he comes across warm and distant, full and ghostlike, the semiomniscient charcter in every scene, never the writer behind some laptop in England. A fantastic all too short read. My only dissapointment with Garland's work is that there is not another volume for me to get my hands on... yet."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"The Tesseract is a great read, the first story is set with action, a shoot out between philippino gang members and merchant seamen. The second, is the story of a mother putting her children to sleep in the suburbs, while she reflects on her own life and her first love. The last story is about two thirteen year olds who sell their dreams to a young psychologist. In the final act all these stories are inter connected, and it makes for a good story. This has been done before, and probably better, but still Garland is an important young writer and this Novel is proof of it. IT IS NOT THE BEACH, but it is still entertaining."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"After one antisocial day and a sleepless night I have begun and finished The Tesseract. I went out to buy it the minute after I had finished The Beach. The Tesseract is a fantastic story about different people and how their lives in some amazing ways collide. Garland shows great insight in childhood, parenthood, in being a woman (or a young girl becoming a woman), in loneliness - in everything really! Some say it is Tarantino-like... I don't know - it has more depth than that! Advise: If you like Garland I am pretty sure you would like Douglas Coupland or perhaps Robert McLiam Wilson."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As it seems I'm not the only one who went into reading &quot;The Tesseract&quot; expecting it to be something like &quot;The Beach&quot;. Well, as many have stated it's not, and I was not too sure what to think of this book. It's definitely far more complex than &quot;The Beach&quot;, and I'm pretty sure I didn't get the real meaning . What I made of it was that it's a story that shows how coincidences change our lives, and I think that is a bit of a problem for some of us: if I reflect upon it, most books give you the feeling that there's an explanation for everything, and this one doesn't. That's what makes it so strange, I guess, because we're looking in books for something we can't have in life - logical explanations, causes for the terrible things that happen."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"I absolutely loved The Beach, and I went into reading this novel not liking it BEFORE I started it. I had read reveiws saying it was lacking this and that and making references to the poorly staged scenes in Manila. WHO CARES ABOUT THE LOCATION! I couldn't. The characters and tie ins to each subsequent &quot;chapters&quot; and subsections were brilliant and I caught myself anticipating them at every turn. The story wasn't as in depth as The Beach, but it read easily, quickly, and every part had it's purpose. Just when I thought he couldn't tie a character or scene to a previous one ,Mr. Garland did...and in the present AND the past! I was amazed at how it all fit together, and was equally as pleased with the ending. The last subsection has each character &quot;wrapping up&quot; their role in the whole sceme of things, and it doesn't leave you wondering what just happened as in some suspense stories. After I finished the last sentence, I actually had to sit there for a minute, ponder the book, and say... WOW. Maybe not the best STORY in the world, but one that you really shouldn't miss reading."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This book firmly places Alex Garland as a one hit wonder. I read the beach and thoroughly enjoyed it.....so I thought I'd try the Tesseract....I wish to save anyone else the trouble. This book is patronising, incoherrent and nauseating to read. I perservered just in case there was an elegant twist at the end - there isn't."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"This feels like an exhibition, an exercise to show Garland's talents in plot, storyline, and structure (had this come out before &quot;Pulp Fiction,&quot; would this be THE one considered the breakout narrative masterpiece?). Unfortunately, these structural factors call attention to themselves. Garland comes up short twice: in fleshing out his characters (making them real enough for us to empathize for them), and in providing sufficient backstory to most of his protagonists (except Rosa). But maybe that's his point, that random acts occur without any deeper meaning into them. If that is so, then that's fine. However, he lost his readers with the weakly drawn characters, leaving most his fans simply reading about Sean, Don Pepe, Rosa, 'fredo, et al. without much concern or empathy. You don't hate 'em, nor like 'em. They're just there. Blah. To compare it to The Beach would be asinine, as they are two completely different works. Garland's first novel is 100%, hands down original, and has unequivocally immortalized him. &quot;The Beach&quot; could have been made without Mr. DiCaprio. THIS would need starpower like Leo's to make it to the big screen."},{"Title":"The Tesseract (Nova Audio Books)","review":"As a Filipino living in Manila, The Tesseract served as an interesting non-Filipino interpretation of the culture. Garland's relatively deep understanding of that is clearly seen.

For those of you who have read it, I have seen a couple of Totoys hanging around the McDonalds at Ermita."},{"Title":"Voiceworks","review":"I really like this book.

The role of Hamlet requires the actor to deliver 40% of the over 4,000 lines in the play. Shakespeare is the supreme playwright of the ages and Hamlet is the pinnacle of his dramatic genius.Hamlet is haunted by the ghost of his father old Hamlet. The ghost is in purgatory; Hamlet has returned from study at Wittenberg University. The Ghost tells Hamlet to kill Claudius. Claudius murdered his brother old Hamlet and married his widow Gertrude. Hamlet renounces his lover Ophelia the daughter of Polonius an advisor to to King Claudius. Ophelia goes mad and drowns in the river as a suicide victim. Hamlet mistakenly kills Polonius thinking he is Claudius. Hamlet and Laertes fight a duel but each dies; Claudius and Gertrude also succumb to poison. The play ends with bodies littering the \\"prison of Denmark\\" as wasteland imagery abounds. Fortinbras and the Norwegian army seize Elsinore Castle.This relatively simple plot of a revenge play is turned into a philosophical inquiry into such weighty subjects as Death; Family dynamics; the afterlife; incest; murder and love. No generation or actor can plum the full depths of Hamlet.One thinks of the great lines:To thine own self be trueTis kind to be cruelTo be or not to bewords, words, wordsthe play's the thingfrailty thy name is womanthere is something rotten in the state of Denmarkall the rest is silenceThe list of memorable words and the enigma of young intellectual Hamlet forced to act make this the play of the ages. Shakespeare is not easy to read or understand but knowing Hamlet is essential to everyone's cultural education."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"There really is no way to review a masterpiece like this. Shakespeare is considered by most to be the greatest writer of all time, and Hamlet is almost universally considered to be one of his best works. There are so many immortal phrases and lines in this play, the most famous being &quot;to be or not to be.&quot; The play contains seven soliloquies by Hamlet which provide an interesting look at his character. If you consider these soliloquies side by side, you can see a sort of 'backstory' dealing with the development of Hamlet's character, from suffering to suicidal to vengeful (&quot;My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth&quot;).It is impossible to study Shakespeare without studying Hamlet. This is certainly one of the cornerstones of English literature. These folger editions are light and convenient to carry, and are very affordable as well. Hamlet is an excellent place to start if you want to become acquainted with Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This was a great book. I enjoyed it immensely. Hamlet was very clever but was quite a brat. Towards the begining when he was busy feeling sorry for himself, he said he would kill himself if God wasn't against it. But what would Hamlet care. He only murdered about 10 million people throughout the play. To me, Hamlet seemed more of a villian than a hero. In this Shakespeare play a lot of people die but I think the only truly sad dealth was Opelia's. The modern version really helped me get so much more out of the play."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Before this book, my wife and I never enjoyed Shakespeare very much.

In a book about revenge there is no way revenge is bad when it is necessary. Hamlet had all the reason for his form of revenge. When you find that your father is dead and the person sleeping with your mother is his murderer, is that revenge or a necessary just.With Hamlet's Edipus complex, is he mad at the new King for doing to his father what he wanted to do for himself. Hamlet like other young boys love their mothers' and by loosing his father, he felt it was his right to take his father's place. The revenge of Hamlet is not only for the death of his father but for the taking of his place.When the ghost of his father comes to his mother's room after the Mouse Trap, Hamlet finds himself on the bed with his mother. When he sees the ghost he gets off the bed and pleads with his mother from his knees. With the mother believing he was crazy, he tried to proove to her he was thinking sensibly. Earlier in the play when Hamlet speaks the familiar line, &quot;To be or not to be&quot;, is he really wondering to himself if he is to be or not to be with his mother.With the death of his father Hamlet feels unwanted and shunned by his mother. For the rest of the play Hamlet is trying to proove he could be the man to feel his father's shoes. His hate for the new King stems from the feelings of inadequacy he brings on himself. Hamlet knows one day the kingdom will be his but with the new king in the way he will never have his kingdom or his mother."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Readers should note that this site does not distinguish between the various editions of Shakespeare, so the reviews you read may be for audiotapes, modern translations, etc. I am reviewing the Kenneth Branaugh BBC Radio recording of Hamlet. It is adequate, which I consider high praise for this challenging play. Like Branaugh's movie a few years later, it includes the entire text of the play, which is a nice way to remind yourself of some issues you may have forgotten.The performances are pretty good, and include Branaugh (of course) as Hamlet and Derek Jacobi as Claudius, giving us a hint of the performances they would later give in the movie. No one's performance really blew me away, although Jacobi was excellent.Ultimately, the play loses quite a bit when transferred to audio only. There's a lot to be conveyed with stage placement, physican action, expression, etc. Somehow, listening to the play limited my imagination on those issues, preventing my from using my &quot;mind's eye&quot; to the fullest."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This edition of Hamlet, with its accompanying critical essays is a good introduction to literary theory (in fact, my lit interpretation professor used it as exactly that).

It is a story of a Danish prince caught in the middle of an uncle who recently became king at the death of Hamlet's father, a mother who married Hamlet's uncle after Hamlet's father's death, and a girlfriend who is a bit crazy. This all sets up a Shakespeare's classic. It is a reference of the monarchies of the late 1500's early 1600's when family members killed other family members for the monarchy. Their is the outside conflict Hamlet has with his mother and uncle but also their is the intricate inner conflict in Hamlet of what to do. This discussion leads to the question is Hamlet crazy.

Hamlet was a great play, filled with exciment of Hamlet's next move,mystery of the ghost,treason and finally death. Hamlet's procrastination is his tragic flaw; Laertes is a nice contrasting character to Hamlet and is a great example of Hamlet's tragic flaw directly effecting others in the play.Hamlet is filled with sorrow and grief, it is easy for the reader to sympathize with the characters of the play.

It follows the standard Shakespearean tragedy plotline (Guy has stuff happen to him that's either really good or really bad, two little subplots, and then everybody dies), but this one lacks spark, or even a pulse for that matter.Well, there's my two cents... Go ahead, find my review unhelpful if you want... but seriously, if it's Shakespeare you want, go buy a different play than this."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Just a warning, unlike many editions of Shakespeare's plays aimed at a wide audience, this one does not include glosses at the bottom of each page to explain the meaning of archaic language.I tried to check this before I bought the book, but the sample only contained the introduction. :(So unless your Shakespearean vocabulary is top-notch, maybe this edition isn't for you."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I never purchased this item, so make sure you're not being charged for something you didn't buy.

The characters are very relatable but at the same time very fictitional. All of them have qualities about them that we see in ourselves and each other. They also have qualities that we want to see in ourselves and each other. Although the plot thickins throughout the play, one still gets an understanding of what is going on. The play has its good and bad parts of it, just like any other book or play. The plot is one that is fictional because this kind of thing usually dosn't happen to people. That is why it is liked so much by people. The play begins actually, slowley, so one gets the point of what is going on, then goes into depth about why this is going on. And about why all this is happening and how it starts. Most of all , the play is understandable. Although the words are old english, one still gets the meaning. Shakespeare put in words what he needs to to get the point across."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"The plot of Hamlet had many twists and turns. This made the play very complicated but it was still very easy to follow. This was helped by the characters explaining things thoroughly. You never really knew who was going to die and how they were going to die. This was a very well written play. It was written to keep the audience interested while telling a sad and depressing story.Hamlet was interesting because the way it starts out just pulls you into the plot by starting out with the ghost appearing and from there it just get more interesting. This play had many unexpected twists such as Ophelia going insane and all of the other main characters dying. The first twist though was the ghost appearing and talking to Hamlet. This within the first act was what compelled you to read on. then when the players come and Hamlet is going insane that compells you to read even farther.The play of Hamlet Prince of Demnark is possibly one of Shakespeares best written plays and quite possibly one of the best plays ever.

It kept the new twists and ideas flowing.However I thought that it was long, and excrucitating. It took a long time to get to the main point, and one could predict the out come of the play.Ophelia was one of the more interesting characters of the play. She fit the role and she never was the same. Ophelia was a character that was more non predicting.The overview of the play in my thought, was long and boring.

I enjoyed most of the book before all the people died and no one lived. I think that Hamlet should of left one of the People alive in the play to make it more exciting at the end.

The characters arouse all the sympathy, hatred, and love they were intended to. I read this play in a matter of days because I couldn't put it down.

Shakespeare Made Easy is the key. The general stories that William Shakespeare put down on paper are truly remarkable and quite fun to read. However, these days there is hardly any interest in deeply analyzing pages and pages of Shakespearian English, especially with his longest play, Hamlet.With the original text on one page and a modern translation on the opposing page this version of Hamlet can be an insightful read as well as a pleasure read. By having the option of both translations the reader will be fully immersed in the story, rather than the text, and come out on the other end singing the praises of Shakespeare and Hamlet. This is a breakthrough version of Hamlet and should be the premier choice of teachers and students alike. Nothing, except perhaps the movie, will excite the adolescent world to Shakespeare more than this version of Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"The reading of Hamlet and Lear in high- school helped me understand my father. Or rather my father helped me understand them. All the hesitation and delay and indecision, all the great outpourings of feeling in soliloquy , all the great sense of life as tormenting and impossible and yet somehow great and sublime, all this echoed and reflected from my own childhood family life world back and forth to Hamlet. The great language reaching out to metaphor no ordinary mind could find. This too.Of the plot and the story of the father murdered and the son who needed to revenge and delayed and the mother who betrayed and enticed, this was far far from me. More I loved the language the great speeches even when we were taught that they were ironic and self- condemning (To thine own self be true as triteness not truth) I loved and memorized much of Hamlet's solitary crying , \\" Oh that this too too solid flesh would melt thaw and resolve itself into a dew\\" and felt in the pain of Hamlet my father 's pain and poetry. I know for most this is the greatest play ever played, and I know too how down the generations critics have given their own long theories explaining why Hamlet delayed and what the ultimate meaning of the play is. But what each of us is given in his own way is another story. And if I have here said a few private words it certainly will not harm or change very much that vast sea of readings which have accumulated around this work, and which will grow still larger and larger in time. One of the great works unquestionably, one mankind will go on reading and rereading as long as mankind keeps reading. And for me a hint that my father's life and suffering somehow related to a higher world called Literature where it might have its echo, and who knows one day truly find its meaningful expression."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This 2-star rating is based not on the content of the original, which is quite good, but on the absurd &quot;modernisation&quot;.

Since I was young, probably middle school aged, I have loved Shakespeare. Whenever there is a chance to attend a production, I'm the first one signing up. In fact, the boys and I saw Macbeth on stage last spring and will be going to King Lear in a week. Shakespeare was one of the key reasons I decided to major in English in college.That being said, I was skeptical of an abriged version. Shakespeare in sixty minutes sounds like a good idea, especially when you want to expose young minds to the bard without weighing them down with language and lengthy disposition, but, could it be done right?Cass Foster, Professor Emeritus of Theatre, doesn't retell Shakespeare, but, rather, keeps the language and tone of the play intact while condensing some of the lengthier scenes and removing those that are extraneous to the key story. I know Hamlet well. Reading this copy, not a single key event was missed keeping the story and its intriguing tale intact. While some of the excitment of the fighting has been removed, students might find the original rhetoric laborious. Keeping the outcome unchanged makes sure none of the final suspense is lost.I did appreciate that Foster uses footnotes at the end of each page to help explain trickier wordings that may be lost on the young reader. One example - Hamelt states, \\"O, old friend, thy face is valenced since I last saw thee.\\" Valenced is notated and at the bottom of the page is defined as \\"bearded.\\"Additionally, some cues are added to help the instructor use this text as a script for the play. It may not be suitable for school-wide production; however, the comments are helpful if the play were to be enacted in a class or co-op to help the students identify with the characters and really get into the spirit of Shakespeare.There are five additional plays in the Sixty-minute Shakespeare series: Midsummer Night's Dream, Macbeth, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo and Juliet and Twelfth Night. Personally, I would love to own and read them all. I'm already thinking of how I want to incorporate more Shakespeare into our high school literature.Whether you love Shakespeare and want to introduce it to your children, or you find Shakespeare difficult and would like a simplified option for enjoying these acclaimed stories, I have to say I would readily recommend these books.*** I received this book free via MamaBuzz Media for my honest review..."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"We used this book in a drama class I took, and I fell in love with it!

How can a book with lines like, &quot;Imperious Caesar, dead and turned to clay, might stop a hole to keep the wind away,&quot; not be seen as humorous. It is almost lightly, though somewhat bitterly, mocking the futile achivements of human kind.

It wasn't easy to read, but I'm very proud that I followed through with my decision. Hamlet is about personal conflict and it has sex, murders, and incest. Hamlet is a prince of Denmark who returned from his studies to attend his father's funeral. After only the short time, his mother remarry with Hamlet's Uncle Claudius. Hamlet thought something was rotten in Denmark. Hamlet discovered that Claudius had a hand in his father's murder. This is where Hamlet's conflict lies which is \\"To be or not to be, that is the question.\\" Should he revenge his father's death or should he listened to his mother and forget his father's death and get on with a normal life and eventually, it ends with tragedy, characters either being murdered or committing suicide. I think Hamlet is trying to show us that sometimes it is difficult to make decisions. There are sometimes conflicts between what we think and what we feel."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I'll use one line to show the problem with this text. Many other lines have a similar problem. Shakespeare has:\\"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,trippingly on the tongue.\\"'No Fear' has:\\"Perform the speech just as I taught you, musically and smoothly.\\"Do you really have to translate \\"Speak the speech\\" as \\"Perform the speech\\"? If you can't understand \\"Speak the speech\\" then you need more help than any book can give (e.g., a very good teacher!)Also, Shakespeare is being more exact than \\"no fear\\" here. \\"Perform\\" is too vague. Shakespeare is talking precisely about speech and pronunciation. Note how 'no fear' translates 'as I pronounced it to you' as 'as I taught you', again losing Shakespeare's stress on vocalisation, and again wrongly translating something that should be left as obvious.'Musically and smoothly' is an even graver error. Trippingly is used in a sense that might trip up students here, so they certainly need help. But all 'no fear' does is confuse them. Does trippingly literally mean musically and smoothly? No it doesn't. If you look 'trip' up in a good concise dictionary you are given the main literal meaning that Shakespeare is using as a metaphor. That is: 'walk or dance with quick light steps'(concise OED).Then again, although this is the main meaning, Hamlet might be joking with the player. That is, using both (or all 10!) meanings of 'trip' in a multiple metaphor. But I digress, one meaning will do for the first run through in a 'non-honours' class.But 'no fear' will do for no one.Shakespeare is hard. Students need help. But not this kind of help.Check out the \\"Oxford School Shakespeare\\" series to see a better approach. If you like a more \\"adult\\", and more lightly annotated, text then try the RSC Shakespeare version edited by Jonathan Bate. If you want heavyweight commentary then Arden might be best (though Oxford UP and Cambridge UP also publish detailed versions worth looking at.)I gave an extra star for the attempt to make Shakespeare a smoother read for the general reader and school child. This is something that publishers should certainly attempt. It is certainly needed. But this isn't a very good attempt."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Bravo to the writers, editors, and publishers of the entire No Fear Shakespeare series. Rendering Shakespeare into prosaic, colloquial American English not only explains what Shakespeare was saying, but reveals how much better he said it! Here's a few examples from HAMLET:Hamlet sees the Ghost, but his mother doesn't. In modern lingo, she says, \\"This is only a figment of your imagination.\\" That's a cliche. In the original, she says, \\"This is the very coinage of your brain.\\" That's vivid.Rosencrantz tells Hamlet in modern lingo, \\"You're not doing yourself any good by refusing to tell your friends what's bothering you.\\" Sounds like a reprimand. The original line sounds like a threat: \\"You do surely bar the door upon your own liberty if you deny your griefs to your friend.\\"Hamlet remembers his mother's relationship with his father: \\"She would hang on to him, and the more she was with him the more she wanted to be with him; she couldn't get enough of him.\\" Sounds good, but the original sounds disturbing: \\"Why, she would hang on him / As if increase of appetitite had grown / By what it fed on . . .\\" Change the word \\"she\\" to \\"it\\" and you have the image of a parasite. That alone says a lot about Hamlet's view of women and sex.I know of no better guide to reading, understanding, and appreciating Shakespeare than Spark Notes' No Fear Shakespeare series."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"All in all (not all and all, as one reviewer has it; people who write such things [and then place unnecessary commas between subjects and verbs] have no credibility), &quot;Hamlet&quot; is one of Shakespeare's greatest tragedies, a sophisticated play which, among many other things, casts an ironic eye on those tragedy-of- blood conventions which the Bard had embraced wholeheartedly in &quot;Titus Andronicus.&quot; Its witty, urbane, generous hero, whose struggle to balance his father's demand for bloody revenge (one of those conventions) with his own humanistic sensibilities forms a major conflict of the play, has intrigued audiences and readers for four centuries. Unfortunately for Shakespeare and his creations, the English language has changed over the past four hundred years, and people have gotten out of the habit of reading and understanding poetry. This is where Alan Durband's edition of &quot;Hamlet&quot; in the Barron's Books &quot;Shakespeare Made Easy&quot; series comes to the rescue of the inexperienced reader. Its modern &quot;translation&quot; of Shakespeare's text is readable and clear, making this masterpiece approachable for those who find Elizabethan English too thorny. Having watched college freshmen struggle with &quot;Hamlet&quot; for some twelve years, and having discovered the Barron's edition during the summer, I strongly recommended the book this past fall as a supplement to the assigned literature anthology. About half the students in my Freshman Comp classes bought the book, either from the university book store or from amazon.com. (Amazon's price was better.) To my great pleasure, I found that more students than at any time before were asking questions in class, answering my own questions with knowledge and insight, and even debating points of interpretation among themselves. It was the most fun I have ever had teaching &quot;Hamlet,&quot; outside of a Shakespeare course. So now my syllabus suggests this book as an important supplement, and now I look forward to teaching &quot;Hamlet&quot; with confidence that many of the students will be able to experience the enthusiasm for literature that educators so dearly love to communicate. Any book that can facilitate such enthusiasm is high on my list, and I hope it will be high on yours as well."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"There is little need to review the actual text: it is undoubtedly (along with many other of Shakespeare's plays) an extremely influential work of the human mind, and very well may be the best work of literature ever written, period.The actual presentation and annotation of the text is rather indivdual as well. Whereas most annotated texts of Shakespeare place annotations on the other side of the page, here they are at the bottom. Considering your eyes spend much more time across the lines and down the page, instead of the small amount of time your eyes take jumping to another page, this annotation makes for a very fluid and efficient way of reading. I think this is the best annotation I've ever seen of Shakespeare. The quality isn't just present in form, however: the substitutions and explanations are always accurate and almost never redundant (to the average reader, not the average professor =]).The introduction by Burton Raffel and the concluding essay by the legendary Harold Bloom only add to the benefits the book presents, and help to understand the book from a wider perspective once your ideas and feelings reconcile with theirs.All in all, a great product for anyone who loves Shakespeare, literature, or expanding their minds!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Man, I wish I would've had this book 25 years ago!I've always been interested in Shakespeare but it's been hard introducing anyone else I know to the greatness of his plays: the language is just too hard for most people to follow.Thankfully, the No Fear Shakespeare books have come along, and I've been buying them for myself as well as others. It's wonderful to have a side-by-side comparison of the Bard's original lines with a modern translation that makes the play easy to read.I hope the publishers do this with all of Shakespeare's plays!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I hated Shakespeare in high school, partly because I could only understand about one word out of every three. Recently -- that is, thirty years post-high-school -- I forced myself to read it again, in the Signet edition, and was dumbfounded at how different my response was. All the difficult terms were explained at the bottom of each page in footnotes. I learned the difference between the two terms of address, \\"Sir\\" and \\"Sirrah,\\" and a lot of other things as well. As an adolescent I asked myself why the hero didn't just kill Claudius right of the bat and have done with it. The reason, it seemed to me, is that there wouldn't have been any play. Hamlet refuses to use his sword on his uncle for the same reason the Indians don't shoot the horses when they're chasing the stagecoach. What a change time has wrought. I guess when you're a kid you don't know the meaning of the term \\"moral doubt\\" because so many things seem black and white. It takes a certain degree of maturation to realize that murdering a king because some ghost told you to is a bit morally -- well, fuzzy. For instance, can you be absolutely certain that you're doing it to avenge your father instead of being jealous about your mother's affections? Questions like that, which a thoughtful adult might ask himself, are enough to give anyone pause. It's a fascinating tragedy. Probably the best film about it is still Olivier's from 1947 or 1948, which won an Academy Award if that still means anything. The signet edition is extremely helpful too in providing brief critical essays that review the play from differing perspectives, the Freudian, the feminist, and so on."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This is truly a No Fear way to understand Shakespeare. There is a modern day interpretation writing on one side of the book and the Shakespeare way on the other. It was a lifesaver!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Ah, yes. Hailed by many as Shakespeare's Magnum Opus (is that right?), this is certainly one of his most significant dramatic works. Hamlet is an atmosperic story of internalization - of feelings (guilt, love, hatred), of people, thoughts, and actions. Marked by indecision and a strong sense of self-pity and self-consciousness, Hamlet makes the slow transition from fear to determination in his quest to avenge his father's death. Oedipal complex, supernatural powers, royal incest, revenge - these are all explored in the play. Several famous questions are posed and thoughts explored - of existence, suicide, meaning, value. Hamlet is just packed with philosophy, psychology, and humanity. A must-read in which you will find many of the most famous soliloquies in all of Shakespeare. Thrown in Yorick's skull, poor Ophelia, good Horatio, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, you've got yourself one awesome play."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"If you could read only one thing in your lifetime Hamlet should be that one thing. It is Shakespeare's best work by far, and within its pages is more meaning than you could find within the pages of an entire library full of books, or plays as the case may be. A mere review, a couple words, cannot do Hamlet justice. At times I realize that the language of Shakespeare can be difficult that is why I recommend the Folger version because it helps to make the images expressed by Shakespeare's characters clear to the reader, and allows them to get their own deep personal meaning from Hamlet, Shakespeare's greatest work, with out being bogged down in trying to decipher and interpret his antiquarian English. Don't just listen to what I say, or read what I write, read the play on your own outside the cumbersome restraints of a classroom and see for yourself what I mean."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I cannot more highly recommend this particular book, No Fear Shakespeare's Hamlet.I am approaching 50 years old and my only real experience trying to read Shakespeare was in high school where we were assigned roles in class and made to read, without comprehension, Romeo and Juliet and Julius Cesar. In the interim, I tried watching a few plays and dragged my kids to see the play Taming of the Shrew, which they hated because they couldn't understand the language nor the plot. Rather than becoming a Shakespeare hater, I've always felt inadequate and dumb for this huge hole in my education.My current inspiration to try Shakespeare again was my desire to try and help my high school aged son become more educated and cultured than I have been.I tried first with the Folger annotated editions of Shakespeare. They look excellent and define the unfamiliar words, but I still could not make sense of a substantial portion of the dialogue. I guess maybe I'm just dumb, I don't know.Anyway, I saw good reviews about this No Fear series, and I ordered several. So far I have read the modern English translations of Hamlet, Macbeth, Othello, King Lear, and The Tempest. While I feel a bit like I'm 'cheating', I actually have really enjoyed all the plays and at least now I know the plots and the characters and even some of the more subtle themes. I can't answer the complaints that the translations don't adequately translate Shakespeare's meanings. There are a few side notes that point out double meanings and things like that, though there are not extensive footnotes or sidenotes.To answer those who rate these books one or two stars, my answer is that they are at least a door into the world of Shakespeare for those of us unable to navigate the originals on our own. And they only take a couple of hours to read. It's not like this is a lifetime commitment or anything. The book only costs five bucks, so why not invest a couple of hours and read it? And, for me, I liked the plays so much that I AM now going to dig out the Folger editions and read the originals, with the No Fear books available in case I get in trouble. These modalities of trying to appreciate Shakespeare are not mutually exclusive.Well, hopefully that's helpful to someone. I wanted to write this so that people would know that these books are not just for lazy students hoping to avoid reading the originals or somehow 'cheat' in their English classes. I'm not a Shakespeare scholar or teacher and never will be, just an ordinary guy, but for me, these books were the window of opportunity that I had been searching for. Two thumbs up, most definitely."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"There they lay, dead on the page, all the incomprehensible words of Shakespeare. I saw them all through school, starting with Macbeth in sixth grade. Then years later a girlfriend recorded on cassette for me the Hamlet of Paul Scofield and I played it night after night through the next two years as I commuted to school. Driving in the dead middle of the night through the pine forests of south Alabama the world I knew vanished, and all that remained was the world of Hamlet-- the prince maddened by grief, the treacherous uncle, the uncomprehending Gertrude, innocent Ophelia, her passionate brother and foolish father, faithful Horatio, the players and all the rest-- more alive to me than my own life.To know Hamlet you cannot read it, you must hear it, whether on stage or elsewhere. And the more you hear it the more its lines come back to you, whether in earnest or in whimsy-- &quot;safely stowed&quot;, &quot;meet it is I set it down, that one may smile and smile, and be a villain&quot;, &quot;thus conscience doth make cowards of us all, and thus the native hue of resolution is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought&quot;, &quot;alas, poor Yorick. I knew him Horatio. A fellow of infinite jest.&quot; And so many more. If there is any hope that you will fall in love with language, then you will fall for Hamlet.There is even some sense that you will never have completely spoken English until you have said the lines of Hamlet.Paul Scofield has never been replaced in my affections by another Hamlet.

The only thing that would be more helpful would be a &quot;real life&quot; scholar. Congratulations to this publisher for making Shakespere more understandable."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet is, by far, the most complex of Shakespeare's many plays. Many of the themes covered are love vs hate, action vs non-action, revenge, and jealousy. Hamlet discovers that \\"something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" when he encounters the ghost of his father, the King, who has recently been killed in battle. From here, Hamlet goes on a search for the discovery of what happened to his father. However, Hamlet not only uncovers secrets of the past, but also the depths of his own being.The Folger Edition of Hamlet is a great edition to buy, especially for those who are studying this play in high school or college, because it is relatively cheap in price and is very \\"reader-friendly\\" with side notes and footnotes that accompany each page of each scene. So, even if you aren't a Shakespeare lover or if Shakespeare is just a little intimidating (we all know how this feels), this version at least allows you to get the gist of what is going on. Also, there are summaries of each scene within each act, to let you know in layman's terms what is taking place. I highly recommend this edition."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I am writing this review not so much as in reference to any one particular title, rather to the Folger Library editions of Shakepeare.

It is often hard for some to understand the complexities of Shakeperean work, and I have seen the way Folger's organizes their books help readers to understand them better.

If you haven't read it yet this this Case Studies in Contemporary Criticism edition would be a great place to begin.The text notes that are included with the play are very helpful to understand some of the more difficult language nuances that are inevitable with any Shakespeare. The structure is well laid out and conclusive. It complements the complexity of Hamlet very well.Of course Hamlet is one of the great paradoxes and mysteries every written. The search of finding yourself and what it is that fuels the human spirit. Hamlet can be a very confusing play because of the depth of substance. However, the critical essays that suppliment the reading make it very accessable.Each of the critical essays are of different schools of literary criticism: Feminist Criticism, psychoanalytic criticism, post-structuralist (deconstuctionist) criticism, Marxist critism, and finally a New Historicist criticism. Before each critism there is clearly written introduction to explain the motives and histories of that type of criticism.This edition of Hamlet will not only introduce the reader to more Shakespeare, but also explain the play and help to familiarize the reader with literary criticism too. It is a beautiful volume that cannot be more recommended if you are wanting to buy a copy Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This cover caught my eye, with its snazzy black and red thing. Plus, when I paged through it, I wasn't disappointed. Clear text, useful notes (footnotes, not endnotes), and an informative introduction and following essay. I'm only an amateur, but I would recommend this edition over any of the others I've seen."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet is one of Shakespheare's more complex plays, which doesn't exactly make it more enjoyable, although I recommend reading it for its famous \\"to be or not to be\\" speech. After reading a few of the bard's plays, his patterns, conceits, and crutches begin to emerge. Often he has characters comtemplating suicide or mortality like Hamlet does in the play; he usually has a dead body pile-up at the end of the play; he often favors poison as as a means to kill his characters off; there is usually a bit of court intrigue or underhanded dealing which leads to disaster, and he likes to have characters go mad.Hamlet feigns madness in this play and after reading it four times, I still don't know why he does this. As far as I can tell, he doesn't really say. If this is a strategic move, it is a bad one, because it only makes his uncle King Claudius, who has killed Hamlet's father and married his mother, more suspicious that Hamlet knows of his committing this \\"murder most foul\\" and is upset by it. There are a lot of madness scenes in the play in which different characters try to figure out why Hamlet is upset--Is it because of his girlfriend Ophelia's feigned rejection of him? Or is it the death of his father and quick marraige of his mother to his uncle? Or does he know something about the murder of his father? I thought there were too many scenes like this which made the play overly long. Since there was no explanation for Hamlet's madness, the whole conceit of having him feign madness left me confused.I also thought that the characters weren't very appealing in this play. Most of the time the play is focused on Hamlet and his indecisiveness about killing off King Claudius because of his lack of courage, even though he was a war hero. Much of Hamlet's brooding over the matter isn't particularly interesting and tends to slow the play down to a standstill. I suppose he was afraid of being accused of treason since Hamlet only knows about the murder of his father by way of his father's ghost--he has no evidence. Finally near the end, Claudius plots against Hamlet's life, which backfires and Hamlet gets his revenge even as he is dying.Probably the most difficult part of the play is the middle in which Hamlet puts on a play that is very much like the reality of King Claudius killing off Hamlet's father. This is done to see whether Claudius looks or acts guilty during the play. It seems Hamlet does not totally trust his father's ghost's revelation that his father has been killed and he needs further confimation. This middle part refers the Aenied in which Pyrrhus hesitates to kill Priam, just like Hamlet hesitates to kill Claudius-get it? I had to read this passage several times to learn its significance. This middle part also contains a lot of in-jokes about the theatre business at the time which seemed self-indulgent to me.There is also another confusing part of the play in which references to battles and a coming war are made at the beginning and a warring noble named Fortinbras shows up near the end to ascend the throne as king after Hamlet dies. I don't think these scenes were necessary.Shakespheare writes often in a high poetic style that I'm generally biased against--to me it comes off as stilted when compared to having characters speak in a more normal conversational manner. --Hey, but thank Providence for modern language translation of Shakespheare; I don't think I could have made it on my own without it. It's the best thing since guitar tab, bicycle training wheels, and pocket calculators! I suppose there will be those who say that you've got to read everything in the original language to really understand the text, but until I thoroughly bone up on Greek, Latin, Arabic, Old and Middle English, Russian and French, modern English is good enough for me.Here ends my rather cheeky review of the Bard's Hamlet. I hope I'm not haunted by his ghost just for explaining why I didn't like the play that much."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This Kindle preview is lacking because it doesn't include a sample of Shakespeare's text.

These editions are always exceptional, but in Kindle format? I can't tell."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Just so all of you are aware, Shakespeare was not in the practice of writing \\"books\\". He was a playwright, so when you go ahead and say that this \\"book\\" was boring, or hard to follow, make sure you realize that what you have in front of you is dialogue never intended to be read by the public, but only seen on stage. This gives the words more power and more accessibility. If someone reads you the To Be or Not To Be soliloquy aloud, you will understand it far better than a first glance at the text.I would simply state that for many in this day and age, reading Hamlet is a very difficult undertaking. We are not trained in this language, and can hardly tie our attentions down for a 10 line speech, let alone the so-called \\"ranting\\" discourses that take place in this play. This does not make the material worse, it makes us inferior to the text. The play touches on themes that every person must face at some point, love, familial duty, vengeance, politics, friendship and betrayal. It is about Hamlet's struggle to discover what life is, and he discovers this by defining death. It is a brilliant text with some of the best use of language before the publication of Moby Dick in 1851 (another reportedly long and boring work that, in fact, touches on nearly everything man has thought)."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I recommend this for anyone who has had trouble with reading Shakespeare line for line in the past.

Or how do you make it possible for those who just don't have the time to do the play full justice, but nevertheless want to have more than just a taste of the bard, to find the time to read it? The answer is the Sixty-Minute Shakespeare series. I've got in my hands their version of Hamlet. There are two important distinctions to this edition. First, it is abridged. The core of the play is left untouched, so the play and its themes are still understandable. Famous soliloquies are also left untouched. The dialogue that fleshes out the minor characters is often abbreviated. Second, the play is rendered in the original language, but uses standard spelling. This is not a modernized version of the play.The Sixty Minute Shakespeare series was also written to give a shorter, easier to produce version of the play for theater groups that wanted to put on a production of a Shakespearean play. Any of this series would be a great production piece for a homeschool theater group. I recommend Hamlet in particular because there are so many resources available to help young actors learn more about their roles, especially the many fine productions of Hamlet on video or DVD. A short section on staging a production gives useful advice for staging and pacing of a production.For those who want to use this edition for a study of Hamlet, I suggest getting a study guide to help with understanding the themes of the play. The notes at the bottom of each page help with understanding some of the unfamiliar words used, but those who are not familiar with Shakespeare will benefit from additional explanations of what is happening in the text."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This book was pretty boring. Its very long and I don't really get the point because everyone dies in the end anyway. The modern version text makes it a little easier to understand but I still didn't like it very much. I have never really liked Shakespeare because of the words and difficulty to understand the story. It was easier just to watch the movie instead. I guess you might like it if you're a big fan of shakespeare but if you don't want to read a long, boring book, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This is a MUST read book! Have you ever read any Shakespeare books? well, if you haven't, now's the time to start! Hamlet was the first book i've read of Shakespeare and I loved it! and I think you will too. After I read Hamlet, I started to read Othello, Julius Ceaser, and all the other Shakespeare books. I still have a few to read, but i just love them! This book will hook you on and if you're traveling, this is a great book to bring on the plane! Trust me, this book is DEFINATELY worth buying!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Shakesperes Hamlet is the best play because of three things. Icluding deep philosophical meanings in the sililoquis, death, and aslo suspence. The play is well written in terms of charictor development. The only charictor that is not needed is Fortenbras.Fortinbras is not a key player because he has no important role in the play. The only thing he is there for is to be there in the end to show all of the dead bodies. There is suspence in the play whene the main charictors try to figure out who someone died. More suspence is in the play when Hamlet puts on his own play to expose the killer of his father. There are deep philosophial meanings in the sililoquis said by Hamlet. &quot;To be or not to be,&quot; poeple say that he is questioning life and death. He is not; there is a deeper meaning to it. He is questioning mans essence and not his own life. If he were questioning his own life the play whould have no meaning.The play is good in the sence of deep meanings. Ophelia is the most dynamic person in the play because she is ever changing. At the end everyone but a couple people expect the worst. Read the play."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I think that Hamlet was a pretty fair book. It was very sad though. I still enjoyed the story and kept intrest in it. Hamlet was very sad to me. Everyone died that were the main characters in the plot. Heck the only main character that didn't die was Horatio. Even though Fortinbras didn't die he still wasn't a main character in the plot. This kind of made me dislike the play, but still enjoyed it. I thouhgt the book tought a good leson. It showed what greed and the driving force of vengence does to people. Hamlet became mad with vengence and almost killed everyone around him with it. It showed how a greedy person works. The king became angery and insane because he was trying to protect his interests. Hamlet was an all around good book and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"In the past, I have never been too crazy about Shakespeare. The big words confused me, the plot lines bored me, just generally bad stuff, so needless to say I wasn't looking forward to reading Hamlet this year in my 12th grade English IV class. However (and dont ask me how) THIS year, things were different. Suddenly, I knew what all the words were, and I understood the plotline, and I must say, I now LOVE this play! But I am VERY annoyed at some of things I've heard that belittle Shakespeare and his works, so allow me to elaborate.Yes, we all realize that it is difficult to read, but if you dont like it, dont read it! Dont sign online and spend the money you worked so hard at the gas station to earn, just so you can show your complete lack of intellect during the 3-minute break between &quot;World's Deadliest Swarms&quot; and &quot;Real Stories of the Highway Patrol.&quot; You come off as a childish, whitebread yokel who probably tries to break anything you dont understand. However, realize that this review doesn't apply to everyone. I understand there are those out there who HAVE an education, who UNDERSTAND Hamlet, and for their own reasons, they dont like it. Though my thoughts surely differ, at least their opinions are valid, and they know who they are (such as the person who read Hamlet several times, and has seen countless productions of it.).This review only applies to the uneducated, trailer-trash, intellectually devoid souls out there who connected to this here newfangled internet thingy just to flap their gums and prove how ignorant they are about the ways of the world. If you are one of these people, you'd best turn around, cuz the new Fox lineup is just starting! Yee-haw!Now in summation, let me state again that I firmly believe that William Shakespeare is one of the greatest playwrites in history, and Hamlet, in my opinion, is his greatest work."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Still on my Shakespeare kick, I decided to carefully read Hamlet including the footnotes and introductory material in my Arden Shaekspeare version of Hamlet.The play; there is much to say about Hamlet, more than such a review like this can handle. What I took away this go-round was how much happens off stage; the murder Hamlet's father, the marriage of Gertrude and Claudius, the love story between Hamlet and Ophelia. I think this give the play great ambiguity and tension which deepens and enriches the experience of watching the play.The Arden edition: the footnotes were often unhelpful. Frequently the notes would concern the derivation of a word or meaning when I what I was looking for was some explanation of the meaning the sentence. Perhaps I am expected to have more knowledge of the play to get value from the notes. I also found several of the introductory essays concerning versions, sources, publication too academic to hold my interest. However, the critical essay was very readable and helpful; it concerned whether Hamlet's indecisiveness was simply a device to keep the play going or intrinsic to his character and the story."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Ah, me.

Theycould all put on HAMLET and be successful.' PerhapsMeyerhold exaggerated because of his frustration -- hewas prevented from ever staging the tragedy by Sovietdictator Joseph Stalin, who apparently thought it toodangerous to be performed -- but Meyerhold's sense ofHAMLET's extraordinary breadth of appeal is amplyconfirmed by its stage history. Praised by Shakespeare'scontemporaries for its power to 'please all' [not inthe modern era, 21st century Ameriky on the verge ofsliding into either &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;Bladerunner&quot;barbarism and mediocre diffusion...] as well as to'please the wiser sort,' it provided his companywith an immediate and continuing success.-- Michael Neill.

Was a little more damaged then I thought out would be. But overall good purchase."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This book was not in as good of condition as I had expected. When I received it, I was surprised to see highlighting on every page and illegible handwritten notes in nearly every empty space."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Admittedly, there is really nothing I can say about Shakespeare's brilliant The Tragedy of Hamlet that has not been said before. The fact that this tragedy is so praiseworthy does not mean it should no longer be praised, though. So many of us had to read Hamlet in school, but there is something to be said and much to be gained by reading it on one's own again for pure pleasure. The story is a compelling one, the characters are sharply presented and unforgettable, and the play represents human tragedy in the fullest sense of the word. No matter how well you know the story, you as a reader are totally captivated by the human drama of the ill-fated prince of Denmark. The Bard's characters are incredibly human, be they good or evil, powerful or fragile. One can delight in the downfall of evil men and lament the fate of their innocent victims. The language is beautiful but difficult, of course. I often found myself rereading lines or entire passages to try and get a better sense of their meaning, and even then some vagaries of the language escaped me. The story itself, though, is vividly revealed through the Bard's poetic words, and even the most insensible lines roll off the tongue beautifully. I was most amazed by all of the famous lines and quotations found in this one drama; pop culture itself almost demands of you some knowledge of Hamlet. If \\"Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio\\" or \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" mean nothing to you, you would do well to brush up on your Hamlet. If you draw a blank at the words \\"To be or not to be,\\" you might want to check your pulse to see if you still have one.I will not attempt any literary criticism here because libraries are already overflowing with books on the subject. The madness of Hamlet is, I suppose, debatable; certainly, his madness is feigned early on, and I have much admiration for his manner of calling forth the guilty conscience of those who wronged his father through his supposed ravings, but one must particularly question his dealings with the lovely and innocent Ophelia. Madness, rage, murder, incest (of a sort), graveyards, sword fighting, poison, love, betrayal--this play has all of these things and more, yet it is the great humanity of Prince Hamlet himself which makes this tragedy foremost among all of the Great Bard's dramas. Good and evil exist in each soul; evil does not always lose, and good does not always win. Shakespeare understood this, and that is why this tragedy will always serve as a literary mirror in which careful readers can peer into the depths of their own souls."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet and his family have lived in Denmark. They stay in a castle at Elsinore. A short distance on the estate is an orchard with cool shade. The time is the afternoon. The king leaves to get some rest in the orchard. Time passes, and he does not return. The family becomes worried. Someone goes to the orchard and finds the king. The rumor is that he has been killed by a poisonous snake. A madness has fallen on Hamlet. Thus the deceased king's apparition is clearly seen and heard. For a time members of the family and others detect Hamlet's queer demeanor. As time passes, it is seen more frequently. It sounds as though he spent much of his salad days with the jester. A reader is not as easily mousetrapped as other readers about Hamlet's motives. The historical record shows that Emperor Claudius was poisoned by his wife so that her son, Nero, would inherit a throne."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"&quot;Hamlet, Prince of Denmark&quot;, was a book about a royal family and the deciet that lie beneath the surface. Hamlet, the son of the former king, Hamlet I, has an encounter with a ghost who resemlbles his father. The Ghost informs him that his father, the king's, death was actually a murder. Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, had poisoned him as an attempt to steal his wife and the crown. Hamlet struggles throughout the play to avenge his father's death in a justified manner.The begining of the book was much easier to understand than the end but still interesting. As the plot thickened, the story was harder to follow. The summaries at the begining of each scene were very helpful in understanding the characters actions.Ophelia was the most interesting character due to her depth. Ophelia's madness made more emotions surface that would otherwise remain hidden. Most of the characters are one sided, bland, and could only be judged by their actions. We suggest you read this book."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"A masterpiece in the minds of many play critics, shakespeare enlightens and motivates the minds and souls of its readers. Not only are the charecters dynamic, but the reader will be able to feel the overwhelming emotions flowing throughout the play. The shakespearen language stimulates the mind along with the body. Through Shakespeare's brilliance in the arts, he is able to write a play that can take place in a variety of settings and times. An example of this would be Zefferelli film compared to Bronnach's interpretation of the play. They both illustrate the time and motivation that Shakespeare intended, yet they take place in a different setting. Ophelia, Shakespeare's most dynamic character, overwhelmes the readers with a bluster of feelings. They inlude happiness, depression, true love and many others. Readers are able to relate with this rounded character and this demonstrates why many critics coinsider 'Hamlet' as one of Shakespears best works."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I would not recommend this book to anyone who likes to interpret books. Shakespeare is old and the old English language is hard to understand. The Modern English version still can confuse the most developed minds. It is a great book to read in High School but not Junior High. The book can be interpreted in many different forms, which can also make it very difficult to come up with a straight answer. Fights broke out over who could interpret the book better.

It was the first Shakespeare play I ever read and I liked it. If you haven't read the play, don't read any thing in these: {la la la la la}. Hamlet is very good for quite a few reasons and here they are.The characters, especially Hamlet are very witty. There are several jokes that you don't have to konw anything about Shakespeare's time to enjoy. My personall favorite is the one about Lady Fortune.The characters are very realistic. My favorite is Horatio and Hamlet. They are both smart and witty. During that play, Hamlet goes under a tranformation. He was once a great man, a scholar, war hero, a lover. When the play begins, he has sunk into a deppression {because of his father's death and mother's marraige.}But by the end of the play, he is the man he once was, and it's good to see him back.There is a lot of philosophical talk in this play. More so than in any other Shakespeare plya, in fact. Most of the slioquays are about suicide and death, but they're still good.The way the plaot develops is very good. Most stories take time to build up the story, Hamlet throws you right into mystery and intrigue in the first page or so. In most stories, the book leasds up to the problems, the tension starts to rise to the climax, the climax happens, and then it ends. like a hill.Hamlet works like a mountain that ends at the peak. Know what I mean? The whole play builds up to an amazing climax and then ends. The further the play goes, the better it gets. It's like a wheel. It just keeps going out of control and then blows into a million pieces.WARNING: Most of the words in the book are managable. However, as the play carries on, there are harder words. Also, get an annoted version with the notes ant the bottom of the page."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"A good text for the most part -- nice layout, good font, adequately annotated -- but there are sections included in the Folgers that are cut here. This is certainly fine for the casual reader, but if you're teaching the novel and expect students to turn to a particular section, it may not be there."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Someone has probably thought of this but one reason Hamlet might delay killing the king is he is really conflicted about his feelings toward his dead father. Sure, he says a lot of fine things about him, but doesn't this raise a red flag? Isn't he maybe idealizing his pa? Hamlet, after all, is the only person who sings the king's praises. Some evidence in the play suggests that Hamlet Sr may not have been all his son cut him out to be. For example, if the ex-king was such a wise leader, then why did he have such a fool as Polonius for a counselor? And if he was such a good husband, then why did his loving wife fly so quickly into the arms of another man? And what about those sins that he mentions himself, the ones he's paying the price for by wondering the face of the earth in the night. Was Hamlet Sr really a great and virtuous man? And if he wasn't, then is it possible Hamlet Jr is secretly scornful of his dad? And is that perhaps the reason he doesn't take his revenge right away?Just food for thought. Something else that bothered me about the play are Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. These two guys are supposed to be two close friends of Hamlet. Yet they're both dim-wits and total mercenaries. Just the opposite of what Hamlet is. What could Hamlet ever have seen in these two guys? It doesn't make sense. Something else that belies belief is Polonius. How is it that the king's chief counselor cannot suspect that Claudius had a hand in the king's death? This kind of thing was not unknown is those times and Polonius must have known the character of Claudius, not to mention his dalliances with the queen. How can someone who is so close to the crown not suspect something? His innocence is hard to believe."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"After reading this play, playing the part of Hamlet on stage, and after reading countless numbers of critical material and comments, I still am baffled as to why Shakespeare, a master of play writing could display to the world one of the most confusing tragedies ever to take centre fold in literature today. Even after watching the performance on stage, or having seen film adaptations, not one could ever be certainly correct.

There are even Marxist, feminist, and psychoanalitical interpretations of it. That fact, alone, says much about the depth and width of &quot;Hamlet&quot;. In this immortal tragedy, the Danish Prince Hamlet is extremely sad and suspicious about the death of his father, the King. His mother has remarried to the King's Brother, Claudius. Hamlet's suspicions are confirmed by the ghost of his father, in an unforgettable scene: yes, Claudius is the murderer of his brother. Hamlet goes mad with pain and fury, and starts to plot his revenge. Its outcome will prove fatal for many people.This peak of drama is an exploration into the human soul, emphasizing emotions such as remorse, rancour, the need for revenge, and folly. Long before existentialism, Hamlet asks for the meaning of existence: what it is and why existence exists.The dramatic tension is perfectly crafted and sustained; Shakespeare's sentences are also perfect and magnificent; the scenes eternal: Hamlet's encounter with the ghost of his father; his monologue on &quot;to be or not to be&quot;; Ophelia's death and burial; the theatrical representaiton of Claudius's sin; the climax at the duel. Hamlet is one of those works of art which have done the magic of becoming part of the popular, &quot;subconscious&quot; culture, much as &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; or the classic Greek tragedies.

Truely extraordinary!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This is a good copy of Shakespear's Hamlet. The Begining took a little while to get going and was slow intruduceing the characters and plot. At first the ghost did not make any sense till one finds out the story line. The &quot;Mousetrap&quot; was a good way for Hamlet to insure his susspisions that Claudius was the one that killed his father. The &quot;Moustrap&quot; was also a fundamental developement in the plot. It also gave way to the end of the play and the deaths of all the main characters.The last Act was very suspensful and dramatic. The dual scene is a very good example of Shakespear's ability to conjur a tragedy and make it plausable. The end was good because every one died and it left no loose ends for one to wander about because they were all DEAD. There was only one unexplained part of this play and that was wheather or not Ophelia killed herself or not. For if she did not then that raises some questions on how would killer her and why?"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I listened to this version of Hamlet over and over again in preparation for a production I costumed last year. And I still listen to it on long car rides -- it's a great production. Having the full text read so well led me to new insights about the characters. Contrasting these interpretations to those of our own actors showed how flexible Shakespeare's writing is. And listening to the full text helped me understand why our director cut what she did. While the volume level is sometimes uneven (as it always seems to be with BBC Radio and TV productions), this is still essential listening for anyone preparing to act in, direct, or study Hamlet. Branagh is, well, Branagh -- sometimes the ego gets in the way, and sometimes he is astounding. The &quot;oh, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt&quot; speech is one of my favorites -- he falls into a wonderful rhythm that just carries it forward at the perfect pace. I think he handles the &quot;my thoughts be bloody, or nothing worth&quot; speech better here than in the film version -- the shouting and musical crescendo overwhelmed what should have been a more intimate speech. In any case, buy and listen -- you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"If you're not familiar with Hamlet, a pox on you! Hamlet is the most famous failed law student in Western culture. Go see a live production. Read the play. Or get a video, or listen to an audio version. Do all four. Versions of Hamlet have been done by Laurence Olivier, Nicol Williamson, Mel Gibson, Kenneth Branagh, Derek Jacobi, or the unattainable version done by Baylor University Theater in the 1950s - the film version won a world film festival in Brussels in 1957. (Yes, I know Jacobi plays the King in Branagh's version, but Jacobi himself played Hamlet - - about the time when Branagh was 15 years old. It's better than his I, Claudius.)Hamlet, like Shakespeare's other plays, has created a huge cottage industry of scholars, actors, theaters and books. The force of Hamlet's personality dwarfs all others, however. To see a man driven mad, and while mad, feign madness, is one of the most clever story twists of world literature. The mind and heart of Hamlet has been thrown into great, tortured pain by several levers -- the death of his father, the overhasty marriage of his mother to his uncle, the usurpation of his throne by his uncle, the threat to the entire kingdom from Fortinbras, the horrifying appearance of the ghost of his father in purgatory torments, the news of the murder of his father from a supernatural phenomenon. The rejection by his lover, Orphelia, and his ensuing mistrust of her, adds nuclear fission to the fire.You must experience Hamlet. Oh, for a true friend like Horatio!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet has always been thought of as one of the classics of literature. I could not think of another book which deserves this title more. The story of a Danish pricne who learns from his fathers ghost that his father, the king, was murdered by his brother, Hamlet's uncle, who then went on to marry Hamlet's mother. Hamlet is overcome by a longing for revenge, but also indecisive. Shakespeare creates a great amount of tension between the chatacters with powerful confrontatoins and biting language. It is a suspenseful tragedy, filled with anguish.William Shakespeare was a genious when it came to breaking down the human psyche, and Hamlet is perhaps one of the most complex plays when it comes to human emotions. It is undoubtably one of his finest works, full of very complex, interesting characters, and a wonderfully chaotic plot. There are innumerable theories on Hamlet, why he is so indecisive, and if it all comes down to an oedipus complex. whatever way you interpret it, everyone can get something out of it. I feel like I am priveleged to have read such a wonderful play.Hamlet is a character that I can relate to in some ways, being a very indecisive person myself. I felt I could connect with him better than many Shakespeare characters, MacBeth, Ceasar, Juliet, Helena or Hermia. That is one of the reasons that I enjoyed Hamlet so very much. I wish that everyone could love Hamlet as much as I did, but I know, especially being a high-school student, that it is a little much for general reading. For high school students, like me, I very strongly recommend this book, if you really like Shakespeare, and aren't looking for a quick read. Otherwise, it might be a little to much to tackle, if you don't really enjoy Shakespearian tragedies. For anyone who has time required to comprehend such a complex work, and is looking for a masterpiece of literature that will keep them thinking, Hamlet is the book for you."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"HamletThe Characters in the PlayGhost of Hamlet, lately King of DenmarkClaudius, his brother, now King of DenmarkGertrude, Queen of Denmark, widow of the late King and now wife of his brother ClaudiusHamlet, son of the late King Hamlet and of GertrudePolonius, counsellor to the KingLaertes, son of PoloniusOphelia, daughter of PoloniusReynaldo, servant of PoloniusHoratio, friend of Prince HamletVoltemand, Cornelius, Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Osrick, A Lord, Gentlemen: members of the Danish CourtFrancisco, Barnardo, Marcellus: soldiersTwo MessengersA SailorTwo Clowns, a gravedigger and his companionA PriestFortinbras, Prince of NorwayA Captain, a NorwegianEnglish AmbassadorsFirst Player,Second Player,Third Player,Fourth Player,Lords, attendants, players, guards, soldiers, followers of Laertes, sailors---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\\"Hamlet\\" is a monster. On the one hand, Anne Barton tells me that it is, by a wide margin, Shakespeare's longest play. Looking at those 5 acts, 20 scenes and more than 3700 lines, I can well believe it. On the other hand, the sheer popularity of the play is intimidating. I see it repeatedly described as \\"Shakespeare's best\\", \\"one of the most quoted works in the English literature\\", \\"one of the most influential works ever written\\", etc. It is amazing to find so many familiar phrases in Hamlet's lines: \\"Frailty, thy name is woman\\" (I.2.146), \\"To be, or not to be\\" (of course, III.1.56), \\"slings and arrows of outrageous fortune\\" (III.1.58), \\"conscience does make cowards of us all\\" (III.1.83) and many others. The most disappointing of these discoveries was that the famous \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\" (I.4.90) is actually not spoken by Hamlet. It was a big let-down to \\"hear\\" the words from the mouth of Marcellus. The most surprising discovery was that one of the earliest and most obscure essays by Bertrand Russell took its title from Hamlet's words: \\"Seems, madam? Nay, it is\\" (I.2.76). Clearly, the influence of the play has been tremendous if so many phrases are familiar to somebody who has read virtually no Shakespeare so far.Now, all this is very fascinating but I don't particularly care about it, or at least I will do my best not to care. Scholars may argue where exactly to place \\"To be, or not to be\\" and critics may hail this and the other soliloquies as the most profound stuff ever written. That's their own business. My objective here is much more modest: to formulate as clearly as possible what \\"Hamlet\\" means to me as a newcomer to Shakespeare who is rather anxious to explore what's considered the playwright's best.On the whole, my experience with \\"Hamlet\\" has been like my previous encounters with Shakespeare. I was prepared for something unreadable and overrated: I actually got something compulsively readable and rather underrated. No, of course I don't think it is the greatest work in English, nor do I think Shakespeare is the greatest writer in that language. Neither any single work nor any single writer should be degraded by such cheap accolades. Shakespeare himself, I am sure, would not have taken his modern fame seriously. He might have been offended. But more probably he would have been amused.The play is by no means perfect. It has some dull moments and it has some, indeed many, issues that remain quite unresolved after the final curtain. Above all, there is a tantalising, and often perplexing, ambiguity about the central character. My overall impression, however, is of a superbly crafted piece of theatre that deals with many serious issues. It will not answer any profound philosophical questions. Great literature is not supposed to do that anyway. It is you who should do it for yourself. The best that a great writer can do is to make you think harder than ever before on such questions. That Shakespeare does.Unlike \\"Othello\\" or \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", the action in \\"Hamlet\\" takes place over longer periods of time, weeks and even months, and this may be one of the reasons why it is not quite satisfactory as a structure. The plot depends a little too heavily on eavesdropping, some scenes are unduly extended with material of whose importance I fail to be convinced (e.g. Hamlet's ranting to the players and to Guildenstern and Rosencrantz in II.2. and III.2., or the exquisite but inappropriate comedy with the two gravediggers that opens V.2.), and the mass slaughter in the finale is just a trifle too lurid. Four corpses in four pages tends to turn a tragedy into a comedy. I also expected the critical play within the play (III.2.) to be dramatically more effective; as it is, it gives the impression of something that was written in a haste and remained rather unfinished, or unpolished if you like.Despite all that, \\"Hamlet\\" makes for a surprisingly dramatic read. The second act and the beginning of the third are almost painfully dull, but after III.2., one of the longest and most important scenes, there is no slowing down until the holocaust in the end.I can well see why nearly every actor, including many ill-qualified ones, is only too eager to play the Prince of Denmark. Hamlet is a most fascinating creature, full of contradictions. Much like, broadly speaking, Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham's \\"Of Human Bondage\\" or David Morey in Archibald Cronin's \\"The Judas Tree\\", Hamlet is one of those characters you can always sympathize yet are often exasperated with. The finest description of the Dane I have ever heard is Mel Gibson's: ''Hamlet is more than a part. It's an assault on your personality. Every passing day his doubts become more your doubts.'' Indeed!In the end, somewhat surprisingly, I find myself overwhelmed with sympathy for the Prince. Much as I sometimes want to shake him by the shoulders and cry into his face \\"Get a grip, man!\\", I often find it much easier to identify with Hamlet's uncertain mind, a bizarre mixture of integrity, cowardice, nihilism, morbidity, nobility, madness. So, let's have a look inside Hamlet's head, as revealed in his relationships with the other characters as well as in his famous soliloquies.First of all, it must be said that Hamlet is no fool. In fact, he is well educated, having just returned from the university of Wittenberg, and highly intelligent fellow, as obvious not just from his introspective soliloquies but also from many of his lines addressed to other characters. Nor, with the obvious exception of his deliberate ''antic disposition'', is he insane. Quite to the contrary. He often shows a remarkable capacity for dispassionate self-analysis.The soliloquy in which Hamlet, after reflecting how drama mirrors life, decides to set a ''Mousetrap'' for his uncle is very rich in self-disparaging remarks, one more apt than the other: ''O what a rogue and peasant slave am I!'' (II.2.147), ''A dull and muddy-mettled rascal'' (II.2.164). Please note that this is no pose. There is no one else on the stage for Hamlet to pretend. I wonder how many people can look inside themselves with such degree of honesty. Hamlet goes even further, mocking himself how ''most brave'' his lack of determination is:O, vengeance!Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,That I, the son of a dear father murdered,Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,Must like a whore unpack my heart with wordsAnd fall a-cursing like a very drab,A stallion![II.2.579-585]It is striking how accurately Hamlet describes some of the other characters, too. ''Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!'' (III.4.83) suits Polonius perfectly. It's also notable that sometimes he reveals himself, unwittingly, in conversations with others. It is a superb touch of irony that Hamlet, while discussing the drunken habits of the Danes, should make an acute analysis of his own personality. It might even be that he is aware of the irony, but thinks, rightly, that Barnardo and Marcellus wouldn't grasp it and he doesn't mind if Horatio does. Not for nothing did Laurence Olivier start his classic movie version with these lines:So oft it chances in particular menThat - for some vicious mole of nature in them,As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty,Since nature cannot choose his origin,By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavensThe form of plausive manners - that these men,Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,Being nature's livery or fortune's star,His virtues else, be they as pure as grace,As infinite as man may undergo-Shall in the general censure take corruptionFrom that particular fault.[I.4.23-36]In fact, Olivier even went as far as declaring the above to be the essence of all of Shakespeare's tragic characters: Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, Othello, Richard (Shylock if you like). This is surely an over-simplification. But it's worth considering.Not the least important, nor the least attractive, feature of Hamlet is his sardonic sense of humour, often expressed by subtle puns and allusions. The very first words of his, prompted by the King's ''my son'' and brilliantly summing-up Hamlet's predicament, immediately establish the Prince as a sharp-tongued fellow: ''A little more than kin, and less than kind!'' Hamlet also has an enviable ability to make quips. Favourite examples include a rebuke of Polonius' complain that the prologue is too long - ''It shall to the barber's, with your beard.'' (II.2.497) - and a daring reply to his uncle who asks where (the now dead) Polonius is. Hamlet replies that he is at supper but ''Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.'' (IV.3.19), and a little later adds ''In heaven. Send thither to see. If your messenger find him not / there, seek him i' th' other place yourself.'' (IV.3.32-34). My favourite example of comedy within the tragedy must be Hamlet's blindly slaying Polonius, hidden behind the arras (III.4.28-29).Queen: What thou hast done?Hamlet: Nay, I know not. Is it the king?Last but not least, when Hamlet is in the mood for talking dirty, the poor Ophelia is left almost speechless. I am grateful to the editor for pointing out to me that ''country matters'' actually means ''sexual intercourse''. Now that's magnificent:Hamlet: Lady, shall I lie in your lap?Ophelia: No, my lord.Hamlet: I mean, my head upon your lap?Ophelia: Ay, my lord.Hamlet: Do you think I meant country matters?Ophelia: I think nothing, my lord.Hamlet: That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.[III.2.121-128]On the other hand, Hamlet's inability to make up his own mind is pathological. His complete lack of resolution, his simply outstanding incapacity to take any responsibility, often diminish my sympathy to nearly non-existent levels.In his first soliloquy (I.2.129-158) we see Hamlet distraught by what must be a serious predicament: his father's dead body is still warm, yet his uncle, a ''satyr'' to ''Hyperion'' compared to the old king, has already married his mother. For some rather inscrutable reason the new King and the old Queen insist on Hamlet's staying in court, rather than returning to his studies in Wittenberg. It is understandable that the Prince is depressed by the whole situation, especially considering his obvious love for his late father. Shortly after that, indeed the very same evening (I.5.), Hamlet meets and speaks with the Ghost of the old King. He tells him in no uncertain terms that he had been killed, poisoned by his own brother who, moreover, had an affair with his mother.Then follows, naturally enough, Hamlet's second soliloquy (I.5.92-109), which is a passionate ranting that he would fulfil his father's request and revenge his death. What do you think Hamlet does next? He decides ''To put an antic disposition on'' (I.5.172), in simpler words: to pretend he is crazy in order (presumably) not to be discovered that he has any suspicions. Being a theatre lover and apparently an adept dramatist himself, in his third soliloquy (II.2.547-603) Hamlet decides, with furious passion yet rather sensibly, that he must have something more substantial than a mere Ghost, and the theatre is the perfect weapon for the purpose:I have heardThat guilty creatures sitting at a playHave by the very cunning of the sceneBeen struck so to the soul that presentlyThey have proclaimed their malefactions.For murder, though it have no tongue, will speakWith most miraculous organ. I'll have these playersPlay something like the murder of my fatherBefore mine uncle. I'll observe his looks.I'll tent him to the quick. If he but blench,I know my course. The spirit that I have seenMay be a devil, and the devil hath powerT' assume a pleasing shape, yea, and perhapsOut of my weakness and my melancholy,As he is very potent with such spirits,Abuses me to damn me. I'll have groundsMore relative than this. The play's the thingWherein I'll catch the conscience of the King.[II.2.586-603]It is notable that the Prince has absolutely no idea what he would do if the king did prove guilty. When this duly happens, what do you think Hamlet does next? The answer is absolutely nothing - except his usual specialty of evasive, opaque, obscure, confused reflections. Not deeds or actions or even plans, but just that: thoughts. And there is a superb irony here, an irony I already learn to expect in Shakespeare. Just some fifty lines after the above quote, when Hamlet openly questions the veracity of the Ghost, we, the audience, have our first proof that Claudius is indeed guilty of his brother's death, as clearly expressed in his short soliloquy (III.1.50-54). But never mind that. For there follows an even more exquisite irony.After the critical scene (III.2.) with the inset play, Hamlet has a superb opportunity to kill his uncle. While on his way to Gertrude's closet, he glimpses Claudius on his knees, praying for his sins, altogether an excellent target for some sword practice. What do you think Hamlet does? Why, he soliloquies, of course! This is his fifth monologue (III.3.73-96) as well as one of the most suspenseful scenes in the whole play. Hamlet, of course, does nothing, and his excuses are characteristically vague, not to say stupid. If I kill him now, the Dane reflects wisely, his soul would go straight to Heaven, ''Why, this is hire and salary, not revenge.'' (III.3.79). Such a spineless creature! The sheer dramatic genius of Shakespeare shines brightly in the last two lines of this scene. They belong to Claudius, Hamlet having apparently left the stage, and they make it clear that his prayers had been quite unsuccessful.\\"My words fly up, my thoughts remain below.Words without thoughts never to heaven go.\\"In other words, Hamlet needn't have worried. He might have cut his uncle's throat without his soul going anywhere near Heaven. It really does take a dramatic genius to finish a scene like that.As for Hamlet himself, in his last soliloquy (IV.4.32-66) he continues to agonize over the weakness of human nature, finishing in grand style (my emphasis): \\"My THOUGHTS be bloody, or be nothing worth!\\" It is by no means unimportant that all three killings Hamlet does commit until the final scene are of victims he doesn't see because they are either behind the arras (Polonius) or far away in England (Rosencrantz and Guildenstern). When he finally does kill Claudius, face to face, he knows he has been poisoned and will be dead soon.Yet to condemn the Prince of Denmark for his lack of character is only too easy. And pointless. After all, what could Hamlet do? Kill Claudius and take the throne? Yes, certainly. But imagine what kind of king he would be! Why becoming a king only to have Fortinbras knocking spots off you? Hamlet knows only too well that he would never make half as good a king as his father did. No matter what he choose to do, he is doomed. On the one hand, he is quite unfit by temperament to be king and, on the other hand, his own inactivity and cowardice, not to mention his mother's betrayal with his Cain-like uncle, torture him more painfully than anything else. Perhaps the only thing that Hamlet could possibly have done in order to save himself was to go somewhere far away from Denmark and try to forget the whole thing. But probably it would not have worked anyway.There is, perhaps, a deeper reason for Hamlet's essential incompatibility with this world. I have deliberately left out above his most celebrated soliloquy: ''To be, or not to be'' (III.1.56-89). You know, these thirty lines are very much like Newton's three laws. They are so obvious that it's often neglected how profound they actually are. To be, or not to be, that really is the question to end all questions. Does life have any meaning, and if it does what is it?To be, or not to be - that is the question;Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortuneOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them.[III.1.56-60]So far as the Dane is concerned, the answer is a resounding ''not to be''. In this soliloquy Hamlet's nihilism, pessimism and morbidity reach their absolute peak. This is a most unhealthy state of mind, to be sure, but if that's what you are, if that's the way your mind has developed, you don't have much choice. Hamlet looks around and is horrified by the world he sees, a world that can be ended once and for all with a ''bare bodkin'':For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,Th' oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,The insolence of office, and the spurnsThat patient merit of th' unworthy takes,When he himself might his quietus makeWith a bare bodkin?[III.1.70-76]What stops Hamlet from committing suicide is what stop us all, myself included, who have the same mental defect: a deep, deeper than anything, fear of this ''consummation / devoutly to be wished'' [III.1.63-64]. Yes, it is tempting. Yet here is another nagging question for which there is no answer. What happens afterwards? Either you simply cease to be - forever: a horrifying enough notion - or something else which, being unknowable, is every bit as frightening:To sleep - perchance to dream. Ay, there's the rub!For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause. There's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life.[III.1.65-69]Who would these fardels bear,To grunt and sweat under a weary life,But that the dread of something after death,The undiscovered country, from whose bournNo traveller returns- puzzles the will,And makes us rather bear those ills we haveThan fly to others that we know not of?Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,[III.1.76-83]Most people, no doubt including many who have read Hamlet, never ask themselves questions like ''To be, or not to be''. Their lives are purely instinctive and, to continue echoing Somerset Maugham, theirs may be the greater wisdom. I envy those people for whom the answer is definitely ''to be'', who consider their lives worth living and death not worth bothering about. Didn't Spinoza once say that the free man thinks of nothing less than of death? True. Hamlet is not that kind of man, nor am I. And this is what, above all, makes Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" such a shattering experience for me.Now let's get down from those rarefied planes of metaphysical speculation.There are other extenuating circumstances as regards to Hamlet's endless vacillating. To begin with, the only piece of \\"evidence\\" about his uncle's guilt he has, apart from his own suspicions, are the dubious words of the Ghost or his uncle's leaving the play in the middle, obviously deeply shaken. Both of these are, to say the least, circumstantial. How exactly does one stab in the back a man during his prayer on such grounds? Not until the end of the play (IV.7.) does Hamlet learn about some of the dark sides of the King's character, as he intercepts the letter that asks the British to secure his own death. But even then Hamlet can't really be sure that Claudius committed fratricide. It seems to me that, despite his deeply disturbed mind, Hamlet's refusal to take his revenge does say something about the nobility and the humanity of his character.We, of course, know only too well that Claudius is guilty as hell. Whether he had seduced Gertrude while the old Hamlet was still alive remains elusive (we have only the Ghost's testimony for that), but his two soliloquies made it clear that he did commit fratricide. The reasons for this, as so much in the play, remain unclear. The most likely explanation, it seems to me, is that Claudius did indeed seduce Gertrude, or at least lusted for her while she was married to his brother. I can't see why he, and not Hamlet, should be elected king after his brother's death. The editor is silent on the matter. Does it make any sense rushing into a questionable marriage with your sister-in-law soon after your brother's death if the kingdom is what you really want? The editor doesn't tell me that, either.There is about the King the same duality of character that makes Hamlet so fascinating. The significant difference is that the case of Claudius is black-and-white, far removed from Hamlet's intensely grey mind. The King's decision to kill his nephew, including his chilling plotting with Laertes (IV.7.), are perfectly understandable. After all, the play that Hamlet has arranged, in addition to making it clear that the Prince knows of the fratricide, is as clear a threat to the King's life as anything. In ''The Murder of Gonzago'' it is the nephew who slays the ruler. The dramatic contrast with the King's rather friendly, almost affectionate, attitude in the beginning of the play is very effective. The same is true for the characters on the whole: Hamlet never dares act until he is on the verge of death; Claudius acts immediately after he is provoked, especially after the Prince slays that patent eavesdropper Polonius.By the way, the councillor of the King is not without charm himself. You have to admire the stupendous amount of common sense he imparts to his son before he leaves for France. It may be preachy, but it is nonetheless profound for that. For my money, it's one of the most amazing passages in the play:And these few precepts in thy memoryLook thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,Give thy thoughts no tongue,Nor any unproportioned thought his act.Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,Grapple them unto thy soul with hoops of steel.But do not dull thy palm with entertainmentOf each new-hatched, unfledged courage. BewareOf entrance to a quarrel. But being in,Bear't that th'opposed may beware of thee.Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice.Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;For the apparel oft proclaims the man,And they in France of the best rank and stationAre of a most select and generous chief in that.Neither a borrower nor a lender be,For loan oft loses both itself and friend,And borrowing dulleth edge of husbandry.This above all: to thine own self be true,And it must follow, as the night the day,Thou canst not then be false to any man.[I.3.58-80]It is difficult to imagine that there may exist a man on this planet who cannot profit in one way or another from following at least some of these ''precepts''. It's also diverting to learn (III.4.) that in his youth Polonius was an actor and even played ''Julius Caesar'', a nice ironic touch as regards to his death in the very next scene. The verbosity so typical for him is rather amusing; as the editor tells us, in a rare flash of wit, Polonius' first lines are typical: he takes 33 words to say ''yes''.Yet, for all of his apparent wisdom, Polonius is a fool. He is totally taken in by Hamlet's feigned madness (II.2.) and he continues to believe until the end that the sole reason for this is Ophelia's rejection (on his advice) of the Prince's advances. It never passes Polonius' mind that Hamlet may be troubled by trifles like incest and adultery. It is interesting to speculate whether the councillor knows of the King's crime. There is nothing in the play - or if there is, it went above my head - to suggest that he does. This effectively makes Polonius less of a fool. Also, there is no evidence that there ever was any friendship between the Prince and the Prime minister. So it is hardly surprising that Polonius should stick to the easiest explanation of Hamlet's bizarre behaviour. To arrange his murder while doing his favourite thing - eavesdropping - was a masterful stroke of Shakespearean irony.In passing it may be noted that the Ghost is a very fishy subject. That's perhaps not something unusual for a ghost, but it's disappointing that his nature - whether by Shakespeare's deliberate intention or by his fault - is never fully explained. That he is the old Hamlet is certain enough. But he can be neither seen nor heard by his former wife (III.4.), and to the rest of the characters who do see and recognise him (Horatio, Marcellus, Barnardo) he never speaks a word. The oath in the end of I.5. is the only place (except the Closet Scene of course) when the Ghost speaks in the presence of somebody else but Hamlet. But the words of Horatio - ''O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!'' (I.5.164.) - do not necessarily indicate that he can hear the old king; he may be referring to Hamlet's speaking apparently to the air. So it seems most probable, if decidedly strange, that the Ghost, though real enough to be visible at least to some of the characters, is not very talkative.I am inclined to believe that his words materialize only inside Hamlet's head as a kind of vivid imagery of his suspicions. Not for nothing, perhaps, does the Prince exclaim ''O, my prophetic soul'' (I.5.40) when it becomes clear who slew his father. Fascinatingly enough, Hamlet's only basis for such remarkably correct suspicion is the fact that his mother married his uncle rather in haste (a mere month as abundantly clear from the first soliloquy) after the old king's death. It might also be relevant to note that the Ghost explicitly demands of Hamlet not to plot against his mother. I surmise the only reason for his appearance during the Closet Scene two acts later is to prevent his son, now beside himself, from disobeying his command.Another fishy point of contention is Hamlet's frequent harping on incest. Either I am missing something here or \\"incest\\" had a different meaning in Elizabethan times; if the latter, I wish the editor had warned me. We do have Hamlet's words that ''man and wife is one flesh'' (IV.3.) but they seem to be either more devoid of brains than is usual for him or they lean to some obscure convention of the times. For incest between Claudius and Gertrude is, of course, not possible at all. Adultery, yes. But to have incest there must be a blood relationship, preferably a close one. There is no such thing here. Claudius is Gertrude's brother-in-law. This is a legal relationship, not a blood one. This accusation seems to be Hamlet's chief objection to his mother's behaviour, with adultery and hurried marriage firmly on second place. He mentions it in his very first soliloquy and never tires of repeating it throughout the whole play, often including Claudius. The Ghost, too, speaks of incest in I.5.To say the least, this incest obsession is a trifle strange. Even though I do not share \\"Freudian\\" or \\"Oedipal\\" interpretations of Hamlet's relationship with the Queen, they may still play some part in his attitude. Opinions have ranged from Olivier's somewhat blatant pro-Oedipal kisses in his movie to Asimov's complete rejection in his Guide. I would rather view Hamlet's incestuous ramblings as part of his personal weakness, rather than as being motivated by some unconscious desire for his mother. This does not fit really well with his cerebral make-up, yet it might have something to do with his madness (the real and subtle form of it, not the ''antic disposition'').Hamlet's relationships with the two female characters in the play are, perhaps, the most perplexing of all. The fact that the parts of both Gertrude and Ophelia are at best sketchy doesn't help the matter either. Hamlet himself hardly comes out of both confrontations with unstained conscience. His treatment of Ophelia is absolutely abominable. In III.1. he rejects her in a pretty brutal fashion, and in III.2. he constantly uses her as a scapegoat while he is really angry with his mother. Even Gertrude herself hardly deserves the vitriol she gets in III.4., the justly famous \\"Closet Scene\\". But, of course and as always, the things are not that simple. It is certainly significant that in both cases there is in the end something very much like reconciliation, no matter that, again in both cases, it's too late for it.Don't you believe anybody who tells you that there is a love story or any kind of romance between Hamlet and Ophelia. There was something like that, but by the time the play opens it is completely over, presumably because the shock of his father's death and his mother's second marriage had disturbed Hamlet's amorous disposition too much. What is one to make of his confused \\"I loved thee once\\" and then, four lines later (!), \\"I loved thee not\\"? I really don't know. Perhaps it is not worth exploring this direction.Ophelia, after all, is not a character. She is a pawn, blatantly used by her eternally scheming father for demonstrating Hamlet's \\"antic disposition\\". Despite her most affecting madness, I cannot bring myself to be especially sorry for her. Hamlet's feelings, however, might well have been much deeper. Nothing else could explain his outburst at the funeral (V.1.), with the bold declaration to Laertes that 40 000 brothers can't equal his love for Ophelia. Or maybe he just feels guilty? It is never made clear why the girl goes crazy in the first place. I suspect that it was Hamlet's brutal treatment, and not her father's violent death, that was instrumental in that.Gertrude is a more sympathetic character, if very scantily drawn. It is interesting that in the Closet Scene she makes no attempt to defend herself against Hamlet's torrent of abuse. Then again, what does she have to apologize for? The whole problem - adultery, hasty marriage, incest - is mostly in Hamlet's mind, not in the events, most of which are unsubstantiated enough anyway. What seems certain, and what speaks in favour of Gertrude, is that she probably doesn't know anything about the fratricide. It is not that her surprise at Hamlet's mention of it is genuine, but earlier in the play (II.2.56-57) she makes the perfectly accurate diagnosis of her son's mental disease: ''I doubt it is no other but the main, / His father's death and our o'erhasty marriage.'' She tells this to the King alone, and there is no reason why she should not add at least an allusion to the murder of the old Hamlet had she been aware of it. Last but not least, she finally yields to Hamlet's uncompromising requests: ''Assume a virtue, if you have it not.'' (III.4.161). (The editor tells me that ''assume'' here means ''acquire'', but the modern meaning ''to pretend to have a particular quality'' suits the occasion so much better!)In short, Shakespeare's \\"Hamlet\\" does deserve its fabulous fame. It should be required reading for every thinking creature, unless one has some strong aversion to drama, which is unlikely considering how much it resembles life. I suspect it should also be a ''required seeing'' for everybody who enjoys the paper version. Since I have never seen the play on the stage, I have to rely on the cinema.PS The above reflections refer to the edition of the text by T. J. B. Spencer, first pulbished in the New Penguin Shakespeare. It was later reprinted, together with Anne Barton's introduction (Mr Spencer having died without writing one), in the 1994 Penguin Classics edition titledFour Tragedies. ThePenguin Shakespeareedition which is currently in print uses absolutely the same text; only the introduction and other additional essays are different."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I read Hamlet fifteen years ago in college and got very little from it. This time around I really felt engaged. I'd read the original, then switch to the plain English when I didn't understand. I tried to stay on the left side for as long as I could. Now, having finished it, I'm going to go back and reread the play on the left side only. My only complaint is that there should be more annotation like in the old Signet editions. There are a few, but hardly enough to convey the complexity of the text and its allusions."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"All the reviews I've read here are for the \\"No Fear\\" edition -- which is NOT the same as the Cambridge School series on this page!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"\\"Hamlet\\" doesn't need any introduction -- the tortured Dane, the ghost, meditations on suicide and a climax full of death. But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own. Brilliant, complex and intense."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This is one of William Shakespeare's greatest works. The tragedy features ghosts, murder, betrayal. . . . The arc of the play moves from Hamlet's father's ghost appearing to him and speaking of Hamlet's uncle (Claudius) murdering him and taking Hamlet's mother as his queen--a scandalously short time after the murder took place. Talk of vengeance from the ghost. . . . Thus begins the plot line.Hamlet, though, is perhaps too reflective a person and does not take immediate action. Even feigning something like madness (As Polonius observes: \\"Though this be madness, yet there is method in't\\"). The play is filled with lines like that, lines that people use (normally a variation on the original) without knowing that they came from this play. Polonius also mentioned that \\"Brevity is the soul of wit\\" (rather ironic since he was launched into a long speech). His daughter, Ophelia, is enamored of Hamlet; after her father's death, unwittingly killed by Hamlet himself, she goes mad and drowns. A lot of people die in this tragedy!In the context of indecision, Hamlet gives his great soliloquy, beginning with \\"To be or not to be.\\"\\"To be, or not to be: that is the question:Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sufferThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;No more; and by a sleep to say we endThe heart-ache and the thousand natural shocksThat flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummationDevoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;For in that sleep of death what dreams may comeWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,Must give us pause: there's the respectThat makes calamity of so long life. . . .\\"The effort by Hamlet's uncle, Claudius, to dispatch Hamlet provides some impetus for the Prince to make up his mind. A lengthy set of deaths ensues at the close of the tragedy.There are many themes at play in this work. Hamlet's indecision based on his uncertainty about the truth of the ghost's statements, his musings on death and how he might/should die. He is a rather mysterious character and the viewer of the play itself can never be certain what he is thinking. This ambiguity itself lends power to Shakespeare's tragedy.One of the great plays. . . ."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Let me begin by saying that Hamlet is truly an amazing play.

Acting how one wants to be could not only let one be true to one&#8217;s desires, but could influence how one sees the world, and then subsequently acts.

Though it is acclaimed as the greatest work of drama ever, it is hardly that. People who say such things, have absolutely no credibility. Hamlet's only purpose is to confuse the reader. Any intelligent person can see through his character and realize that he is little more than a feeble mind with a large vocabulary. He is almost the mirror image of Lennie in OF MICE AND MEN, Barnaby Rudge in the Dickens' book of the same name, Benjy in THE SOUND AND THE FURY, or Dogberry in Shakespeare's own MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING. The rest of the main characters (Claudius, Gerturde, Polonius, Ophelia, Laertes, The Ghost, Horatio, Rosencrantz, Guildensern, The Player King, Fortinbras, The First Gravedigger, Barnardo, Reynaldo, and Osric) are ridiculous and annoying caricatures. HAMLET would have been a much better play had these characters been eliminated entirely. Their only contribution lies in the fustian and obfuscating nature of a horrid play. Take my advice: if you want some real entertainment, read Shakespeare's TITUS ANDRONICUS with the great intellect Aaron the Moor, the forerunner of Iago, or THE SPANISH TRAGEDY, containing the sublime Hieronimo, the forerunner of Jane Austen's Anne Elliot. You will find these plays far superior to the &quot;aesthetic failure,&quot; as T.S.

Even more devastating to the book is how it all ended. I actually got to say once Hamlet,Gertrude, and Claudius died I was leaping with joy, it was impossible to contain my excitment. Why? Because it meant that if every one is dead, well, IT IS FINALLY OVER! Finally, this book not only is long, boring, and an embaressment to the whole romantic time period.

Before the play opens, the king of Denmark has been murdered by his brother, Claudius, who has taken the throne and married the queen, Gertrude. The ghost of the dead king visits his son, Prince Hamlet, and urges him to avenge the murder. Hamlet, tormented by this revelation, appears to be mad and cruelly rejects Ophelia whom he loved. Using a troupe of visiting players to act out his father's death, the prince prompts Claudius to expose his own guilt. Hamlet then kills Ophelia's father Polonius in mistake for Claudius, and Claudius tries but fails to have Hamlet killed. Ophelia drowns herself in grief, and her brother Laertes fights a duel with Hamlet.Hamlet's dilemma is often seen as typical of those whose thoughtful nature prevents quick and decisive action.Hamlet contains several fine examples of soliloquy, such as &quot; To be or not to be&quot; and Hamlet's earlier speech lamenting his mother's hasty remarriage and Claudius' reign which opens &quot;O! that this too too solid flesh would melt&quot;. Much quoted lined &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot;, &quot;Something is rotten in the stste of Denmark&quot;, &quot;Brevity is the soul of wit&quot;, &quot;To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;&quot; The lady doth protest too much, methinks,&quot; and &quot;Alas, poor Yorick&quot;.

Hamlet proves to be a masterpiece of masterpieces -a shining paradigm of unparalleled magnificence unlike any other play ever written. I thoroughly enjoyed Julius Caesar, Othello, Macbeth, Henry V, The Merchant of Venice, Much Ado About Nothing, Romeo & Juliet, The Tempest, etc.Nonetheless, I unquestionably rate Hamlet as Shakespeare's crowning achievement - his magnum opus.Hamlet proves to be a prodigiously powerful and profoundly potent play incredibly chock-full of amazing quotes and axioms that I memorize and incorporate into everyday life - from Polonius's sanctimonious speeches spoken to Laertes and Ophelia(\\"To thine own self be true\\") to Marcellus(\\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark\\") to of course the avenger himself Prince Hamlet(\\"Frailty, thy name is woman!\\").Although Hamlet's faults of inaction, procrastination, and paradoxical impetuosity preclude our protagonist from overcoming his impending and unalterable doom, I unavoidably empathize with him and his inevitable plight. Hamlet is grievously wronged by so many in his life - his uncle Claudius, his mother Gertrude, his love Ophelia, the ostensibly wise Polonius, shamefully by his traitorous \\"friends\\" Rosencrantz & Guildenstern, and lastly by his murderous foil(no pun intended)Laertes. The undeniable central theme of uncontrollable fatalism pervades throughout Hamlet. I felt as if Hamlet was on an unstoppable one way train going 200 miles/hour straight into a brick wall. Sadly, he knows he shall soon meet his untimely demise as he picks up his foil to fight Laertes. Fittingly, the victorious young Fortinbras proves to personify what could have and should have become of our tragically departed hero.To be read time and time again - even if just for the supremely witty quotes.

From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.The &quot;BBC Presents&quot; audio version of Hamlet is long--3 1/2 hours over four cassettes. Most audio publications of Shakespeare's plays run to two cassettes. One contributing factor to the length is the inordinate amount of music. Lengthy musical performances mark the separation between acts and major scenes. The music does not enhance the production."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"My only complaint about this play is that Shakespeare kills the suspense of the actual play within the play that 'catches the conscience of the king,' with the inappropriate dumbshow. This play is a phenomenal masterpiece. While some plays deal with 2D good and evil characters like Albany and Goneril from &quot;King Lear,&quot; &quot;Hamlet&quot; offers us a hero (Hamlet) with prevalent evil traits and a villain (Claudius) with several good points. Aside from the deep psychological insights into human nature it is an interesting situation. To be sure, Hamlet wants to revenge the murder of his father. But, Hamlet also wants to kill Claudius and get the crown too. Claudius wants to kill Hamlet and keep the crown too. But because they are both loved by the public, direct action is impossible. It is also interesting that Gertrude and Polonius are not intelligent enough to see the plainest point. Hamlet and Claudius on the other hand are both so highly intelligent, that it is like they are playing political chess. I also find it striking that Shakespeare at times presents the hero Hamlet with evil traits such as the brutal killing of Polonius. On the other hand, Claudius the villain shows himself to be a capable ruler, especially when he quells Laertes' raid with pure courage and intelligence. Also, he does not delight in what he had to do to get the crown. He clearly regrets it and suffers for it."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"The Folger Library series are your best Shakespeare source. They specialize in Shakespeares' greatest plays and are quality books that are perfect companion and translator to Shakespeare. It is loaded with page after page of translation from the Old English expressions that are no longer in use to our modern talk, and pictures as well as historic background information on th Elizabethan era and Shakespeares' life. Hamlet is without question Shakespeare's greatest tragedy, remaining in our theatrical culture to this very day. It has become a conversation piece for English professors, dramatists and screen actors (Mel Gibson tackled the role in 1991) and even psychologists, who claim that Hamlet had the Oedipal complex, especially when they read the scene in which Hamlet is in his mother's bedroom. What makes Hamlet so great ? Why does this old play still come alive when performed on the stage in the hands of the right actors ?Shakespeare, believe it or not, was a people's person and knew about the human condition perhaps more than anyone in his day. Hamlet deals principally with obscession for revenge. Hamlet is a prince whose father has been murdered under the evil conspiracy from his uncle Claudius and even the support of his mother, Queen Gertrude. Depressed, wearing black all the time, and very much as solitary as any \\"Goth\\" would be in our day, Hamlet laments his situation, until his father's ghost appears and urges him to avenge his death. The mystery still remains, is this ghost real ? Is it, as many in Elizabetheans thought, a demon in disguise ? Or is it simply a figment of Hamlet's own emotions and desire for revenge. At any rate, Hamlet's father appears twice and Hamlet spends most of the play planning his revenge. His most striking line that reveals this consuming need is \\"The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king!\\".Pretending to be mad, he scorns even the love of the woman he genuinely loves, Ophelia, whose mind is shattered and heart is broken and who has an impressive mad scene. The deaths of Hamlet's friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, are also in Hamle'ts hands and a consequence of his revenge. The famous soliloquy in the play, is of course, \\"To be or not to be\\", taken on by such great actors as Lawrence Olivier and Orson Welles. Hamlet muses on the brevity of life and the suffering which can only cease through death, as he holds a skull and is evidently suicidal. Finally, the last scenes are the most dramatic. Hamlet duels with Laertes, Ophelia's brother, and with Claudius himself. The deaths of the main cast, including the Queen, goes to show how tragic the human desire for greed and revenge is.This is Shakespeare's finest tragedy, and quality drama, best seen in a live stage performance, but that also works as a film. As for this book, as I said before, this is the Hamlet to have. You will become more acquianted with Hamlet and Shakespeare even more than taking a year's course with a teacher. This book itself is the teacher."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Okay, so I am reviewing \\"Hamlet\\". It's good. Everyone should know that.But more importantly, the character Hamlet is a microcosm of us all. Our potential for reluctance, revenge, soaring intellect, and noble actions. Shakespeare created in this character a person who transcends the play he is in and helps to create a realistic humanity in fiction that has rarely, if ever, been equaled. A good reader is a rereader and \\"Hamlet\\" should be reread after life intervals. This text keeps giving, and that is a marvelous gift!As for the Pelican Shakespeare series, they are my favorite editions as the scholarly research is top notch and the editions themselves looks good as an aesthetic unit. It looks and feels like a play and this compliments the text's contents admirably. The Pelican series was recently reedited and has the latest scholarship on Shakespeare and his time period. Well priced and well worth it."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I'm not ashamed to admit it. I find Shakespeare difficult. I need help. The Cambridge School Shakespeare editions, with the classroom activities and assignments on each facing page, give me the focus and direction I need to finally truly enjoy the text.I thought I didn't like Shakespeare until I took a class on several of the plays. It turns out that I love Shakespeare when I'm doing close reading or studying it carefully but for whatever reason I find it extremely difficult to do on my own. The Cambridge School editions allow me to replicate the classroom experience on my own, providing enough background and questions for critical thought that I keep a close focus on the text. Previous times I've attempted to read 'Hamlet' I was struggling just to figure out what was going on; reading this edition I was analyzing the characters and considering different acting and directing choices. It's amazing."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"As a college student who had to write a paper on Hamlet,Again,I of course had to get away from any classic ideas about the play. Being a student with a talent for writing I would never be able to \\"get away with,\\" these common theories, as professor's expect much more. This book really helped me to create a rather ambitious and interesting thesis; one which went against the criticisms in the book, and was refreshingly new.I like the individual criticisms in this book as they really force you to look harder for textual evidence. One of the BEST things about the book was that it included the whole play as well. That was so useful because I didn't have to juggle two books -one of them being the complete works of Shakespeare which weighs about 20lbs. I was able to take this book everywhere and work on it whenever I had spare time.However, I would not sugesst this book for an individual who does not have a very strong background in Hamlet. You need to know the play Extremely well in order for this book to benefit you. If you do not know Hamlet inside and out, then this book will only cause confusion and you should probably stay away from it, as the theories may be difficult to comprehend."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"This book is definitely God's gift to all college students.

Some valuable insights too and not just for students."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"In my eyes, Shakespeare could do almost no wrong, but some of his plays were decidedly better than others--Hamlet, for example--for reasons of literary style, subject matter, etc. In my case, his tragedies are far more interesting than his romances/comedies/histories given the wide range of emotions you're made to feel upon reading them.In any case, Hamlet has the best quotes, and has spawned a million books/movie versions/spin-offs. \\"Get the to a nunnery\\", \\"something rotten in Denmark\\", \\"To be, or not to be\\", \\"A hit; a very palpable hit\\"... the list is endless. If nothing else, it's the kind of material that's easily visualized and easily understood. I might have been 15 years old when I first read it, but it all made sense.Moral dilemma--ethics--deceit--virtue--honour--revenge... these are all things that make a story classic, not rustic. Over 400 years later, the source material is as vital as ever. Excellent stuff."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet is considered by many to be the greatest story in the English language. At any rate, it is one of the most famous of all of Shakespeare's works, only Romeo &amp; Juliet really comes close. I recently finished reading the book in my Honors English class and I truly believe that it stands the test of time, and that it's reputation is well deserved.But I would also like to comment on this edition. It provides a lot of helpful notes on vocabulary and cultural notes about the period in which it was written and takes place. There is also an essay in the end with some analysis, and several pages of notes and helpful facts at the beginning. If you are reading Hamlet on your own and/or this is your first time reading it, I suggest using this edition."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Like another reviewer wrote, Hamlet is a tragedy of youth, but it isn't the tragedy of lost innocence, it's a tragedy of youthful rashness. Yes, I said rashness. Hamlet doesn't think too much, he thinks too rashly, too hastily, without mature consideration. Just because his mother is a whore he quickly concludes that all women therefore must be whores. This is why he torments Ophelia and bids her, \\"get thee to a nunnery\\". This is why he decries, \\"woman, thy name weakness\\". This is why he's despondent and unable to respond to his father's injunctions.There are plenty of examples in the play of this youthful recklessness. Laertes, when he learns of his father's death, immediately rushes back to Denmark and assembles an army to exact revenge. Fortinbras does the same thing in order to retake the land his father lost to Hamlet's father. Both are checked in their youthful exuberance by their respective kings. Polonius' advice to his son is nothing but words of caution against youthful excesses (drink, women, gambling). Polonius' advice to his daughter is nothing but strictures against falling hopelessly in love with Hamlet. The little dialogue between Hamlet and Rosencrantz about the state of theater in London is about how a wild and vociferous younger generation of actors have sabotaged the stage and are holding the older generation at bay.Hamlet himself exhibits other rash behavior. When he sees Ophelia's funeral procession and hears Laertes' expressions of grief, he (Hamlet), regardless of the danger he throws himself in, he recklessly jumps into the procession and proclaims HIS love above the brother's. When Hamlet first sees the ghost he doesn't think to question whether the apparition is authentic. He believes it instinctively. It only occurs to him much later that he may have been the dupe of an evil spirit. When he discovers someone eavesdropping on his talk with his mother, he immediately kills him without even looking to see who it is. When the king invites Hamlet to fence with Laertes for a stake, he rashly throws caution to the wind and cavalierly accepts the offer.Cases of this youthful impulsiveness are legion in the play and wherever it goes unchecked, tragedy ennsues. Not just Hamlet's death, but also Laerte's deception by the king, and Ophelia's suicide. Fortinbras alone comes out unscathed, and only because he accepted the wise counsel of the king of Norway.So Hamlet can be seen as a play about the folly of youth. Issues about the evil in human nature are raised, but these are not the central themes. In fact, the play lacks a certain unity of design because there is a big difference between the rashness of youth, which is not an evil, and fratricide and incest, which are. There's a big incongruity between the central and secondary themes. For this reason I give Hamlet less than five stars."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark, written by William Shakespeare, considered to be one of the best playwrights of all time, was a solid, entertaining drama. Hamlet is consistently suspenseful and full of struggle between the characters.As a first time Shakespeare reader, I found the play challenging to read because it contains language written about four centuries ago. However, Shakespeare carefully crafted his words of prose so that every sensible person would enjoy reading it.Hamlet is about a prince of the same name. He learns that his father, once King, had been murdered by his uncle, now the King, who, soon after his father's death, married Hamlet's mother. The ghost of King Hamlet arrives one night and wants Hamlet to revenge his father's death. The Tragedy of Hamlet, Prince of Denmark is woven with many unique characters that only Shakespeare could provide. These characters include the pathetic Polonius, the suicidal Ophelia and the ignorant and foolish Queen Gertrude. Hamlet struggles throughout the play to determine the right thing to do regarding his father's death, and how to do it.I recommend this book to all people who love great drama. In this bold piece of literature and many of his other works, Shakespeare has the unique ability to teach many valuable and interesting lessons, some of which are comical, and some of which are serious. If you are new to the world of dramas such as Hamlet, you may soon become an addict. As you can see, Shakespeare is an amazing playwright, and I hope you have the pleasure of reading this story in the future."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Great literature has often been compared to a mirror that reflects man's inner development. Described as the first true modern work, Hamlet is full of the uncertainty and skepticism modern readers are only too familiar with. Unlike other tragic Shakespearean heroes such as Macbeth and Othello, Hamlet is rational before he is valiant. With most of his strife and turmoil being metaphysical rather than physical, Hamlet is at his best an obsessive spectator of the \\"weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable\\" state of human existence. As Harold Bloom puts it, Hamlet is a hero too grandiose for his own play. And indeed, savoring Hamlet's excessive reasoning in retrospection, the reader is able to see how despite his many emotional outbursts, Hamlet gropes beyond the goal of revenge because he is ultimately concerned with the nature and source of evil rather than the means to combat it. Can we then say Hamlet the play is but a decorative device for Hamlet the hero? Why not, Shakespeare needed actions to let his own dark vision of the human psyche unfold through Hamlet, who develops an extremely pessimistic outlook on humanity that has endured over time. By letting the reader discover for himself the same transience prevalent in everything and everyone else, Hamlet shows the daunting immortality of thoughts. Read it for the \\"to be or not to be\\" speech if nothing else."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"We believe the Hamlet was an interesting book and was a very well organized version of the play. The act where Ophelia becomes insane was the best written part on the whole book. The book was difficult to read, but in the end it was well worth it. Also, the battle part of the book were well written. We did have a little trouble understanding most of the book, but after rereading it a couple times, it made sence. Our favorite characters in the book were Ophelia and Hamlet. They were the most well written parts in the whole play. Our overall opinion on the book was that it was well written and grabbed your attention."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"What makes Hamlet the most unforgettable of Shakespeare's plays ? I found out the very first time I read it. I was in the fifth grade and it was my first exposure to Shakespeare. After reading it through, I found out. The ghost, the swordfights, revenge, life and death, madness and human frailty. It was the play that made me enjoy Shakespeare. The biggest thing I remember was Hamlet himself- the mystery behind his nature and of course, the swordfight at the end. I recommend everyone to read Hamlet."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"There's an old joke about a woman who saw Hamlet performed for the first time. &quot;I don't know what anybody sees in that play,&quot; she said, &quot;it's just a bunch of cliches strung together.&quot; Whether Hamlet spawned or merely perpetuated cliches, the play abounds with phrases that have passed into the common speech. From beginning to end, from &quot;There's something rotten in Denmark&quot; to &quot;goodnight sweet prince&quot;, familiar language assaults the ear. The long life of these sayings attests to Shakespeare's powerful plotting and powerful language. Critics have hailed &quot;Hamlet&quot; as Shakespeare's masterpiece, prompting Oscar Wilde to ask &quot;Are the critics mad or merely pretending to be?&quot; It is a complex and paradoxical play, with complex, paradoxical protagonists engaging in complex, illogical behavior. Whether the play is a masterpiece or a disasterpiece, good or bad, is fairly debatable. But good or bad, it commands our attention and entertains us.The Dover Thrift Edition provides quality reading at a rock bottom price.

Hamlet as a tragic heroe"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet was a diffucult book, and should really be read in a group, to be able to express your personal reactions and understanding. Much of the book was incomprehendable due to our modern ebonics, but with a little group discussion, the understanding of Hamlet became much clearer. Discussion is a must to fully appreciate the clarity, objectives of the characters, and the upcoming actions of characters. Unless you're an avid reader of Shakespeare's work, the &quot;lingo&quot; is rather difficult. Among the better parts of Hamlet, we enjoyed the scene with Ophelia, where she was handing out flowers to the special people that she felt close to. The symbolism of these flowers was a powerful touch to the scene, which would commonly make any sentimental reader feel touched. Also, the fact that she was so lost in the head contributed to the personal feelings one gets while reading this most potent of scenes. The set-up of characters is most intriguing. Claudius had the modivation of an incestuious lunatic, which created a sense of needed tension between him and Hamlet. The Ghost was a wealthy attribute, in which his short scenes scarcely do the play justice. The Gravedigger added a glimpes into the happy childhood that Hamlet once had. All in all, Hamlet was a very interesting book, although, the everyday person might become bored due to the lack of comprehension of Shakespeare's language."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"what fire-spells lie in hamlet's mind! here is not some two-dimensional action figure whose only purpose is to enflame the audience with wonder with his sword-slash and his martial agility. here is not some cheap revenge drama where the hero eventually magno-triumphs in glory and thus satiates the spec-tators rage-lust for justice. asymmetrical! here is a man spider-entangled with enigma, here is man truly bewildered by life's perplexo. here is a man who fails to overcome his own interior twists and banish the fog that grips him in paraly-scourge. this drama causes us to ponder life's rattle of chaotica more acutely, it compels us into the prison of inquiry, baffles us and leaves perhaps wiser than before. for what intrigues we humans most is mystery, the unknown, the irresolvable and thus this scholar of wittenberg, armed with a formidible array of proofs, evidences, theories and conjectures, nevertheless, despite all his bookish wisdom, finds himself helplessly at the mercy of rage-orcs when he is challenged to confront the world's unjustice, become a man of action and right his uncle's wrongs! are we all not hamlet? do we all not shrink in the face of tyranno-blight? do we all not at some time or another complacently let injustice govern us, rule us, oppress us? do we all not occasionally become enwebbed by reality's night-shadows and cannot for the life of us rouse the tank-courage needed to banish the vipers? this is a man of emotion! this is a man who thinks! this is a man who contemplates the conundrums harrowing our sleep in constanto! he cannot help but arouse our sympathy and draw us into his sphere, cheering for him, rooting for him, praying for his eventual conquest of lechers for we all at one time or another have experienced similar ideas floating in our cosmos. and yet when he fails life's omnipresent hazard strikes us in greater prepondera thus causing us think more deeply on our existence.kyle foley, author of Lorelei Pursued, Wrestles with God"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I don't know, was this book \\" To good or not to good?\\" Somewhere in between I guess.

It contains all of the characteristics needed for a good story Such as murder, revenge, friendship, trust, life, and death. Hamlet also expresses how many different emotions people can have such as love, hate, anger, sadness, and much more. This story shows how important family and love are.In Hamlet a young boy, named Hamlet finds out that his father, the king, was murdered in his sleep and the king's brother wants to marry the queen. Soon after the wedding Hamlet is visited by the ghost of his dad. The ghost tells him that his brother, now the king, is the one that killed him with help from the queen. The ghost asks hamlet to avenge his death by killing the new king. Through most of the play hamlet has to decide what to believe. While he is doing that his girlfriend thinks he is going crazy because he has been acting so strangely. All of the other people in the castle also start to believe that he is insane.Is the middle of the play Hamlet says the most famous lines ever written and most people have probably heard them somewhere. What he says is, \\"To be or not to be, that is the question, for is it nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous misfortune of to take arms against the sea of troubles in by opposing in them. To die, to sleep, no more.\\" Hamlet is the longest play ever written but it is very good.

You have to take the time and want to be able to understand this before you can say whether or not you like or dislike anything written by Shakespeare. To fully understand this play you have to understand the way it was written and take the time to look up what words that you do not fully understand.

It is a great learning experience and a way to appreciate a great piece of literary work.

However, the translation was good enough to transport myself to Shakespeare's wonderful drama.Hamlet is so human, so well depicted that all the things said about this drama is true.I would have loved to read it in English, but it's not my native language, but I'm sure might lost many of the word meanings.This is book is very interesting to start reading Shakepeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"what can i say about hamlet that hasn't already been said. nothing, no doubt. but that apparently doesn't deter anyone else, so why should it stop me? yes, hamlet is a great play. yes/maybe, it's shakespeare's best play. yes, it's one of the great works of english literature. but the thing that intrigues me is why hamlet hesitates to kill claudius. standard theory, and my own interpretation the first time i read it a full score year ago, is that hamlet thinks too much. and indeed, this fellow DOTH brood too much. but this begs the question, what does he think about? what so absorbs his thoughts that his will is so arrested? is it the tactical problem of how to kill the king? no. this he never mentions. is it doubt over the ghost's authenticity? maybe. yet, this only comes up after the players happen to come to court and he suddenly sees an opportunity to smoke out the king - ie, it wasn't premeditated. so is it really cowardice, then? maybe. hamlet certainly accuses himself of being \\"pidgeon-livered\\" and of \\"lacking gall\\". yet the first thing we see hamlet do is fearlessly follow the ghost where he bids him. and all agree he is a \\"soldier\\". doesn't sound like a coward to me. so so much for that charge.so what does hamlet think about? two things. one is how wretched the world is, and in particular, how unfaithful his mother has been. and the second is of death, suicide. hamlet's soliloquies are all on these subjects. even in the last act, when he has returned to denmark finally to act on his father's commission, his thoughts are still on death. think of the graveyard scene and his discovery of yorick's skull; or of his fatalistic retort to horatio when his faithful friend suggests that maybe he'd better not fight laertes.so, is hamlet's problem that he \\"thinks too much\\"? or is it really that he's depressed, and, being depressed, he broods? in other words, is brooding the problem, or is it only the symptom of what really ails him? i think it's the latter. i think hamlet's obsession with his mother's actions and with death show that he is deeply shocked by his father's murder and his mother's betrayal, and that he is completely disillusioned with the world and with life. shock and disillusionment are perfectly natural reactions, but in hamlet they are felt in a degree that is not found in most people. but hamlet is not like most people. he is a particularly intelligent and sensitive young man. a noble young man. the kind of man who recoils when confronted with evil, and rather than live in such a world, resigns, because such a life is not worth the candle.hamlet's actions prove this inclination to death. to a man in his position, the wisest course of action is to avoid attracting suspicion to himself. instead, hamlet does everything to draw the king's attention. he mopes and broods. he acts like a madman. he puts on a play before the king in which the murder is re-enacted. he does everything to make the king suspect that hamlet is up to something. and surprise, surprise! it works! hamlet is exiled and nearly murdered. and even when he returns to denmark, rather than hide himself and wait for the right opportunity to strike, he shows up at the castle and agrees to fight laertes in the king's own wager! what does all this point to except that hamlet is asking for it?! he wants the king to put him out of his misery. he wants to incite the confrontation that he can't bring himself to initiate. he wants to get out of this world, albeit, on the most honorable terms possible.believe it or not, there ARE people like this who just cannot reconcile themselves to the ugliness of the world. most of us are not nearly so sensitive, and we make compromises. indeed, most of us eargerly join the fray and contribute our fair share of sin and all that bad stuff. some zealots even add more than their alotted share. but not hamlet. he represents the purity of noble youth. and the tragedy of his death is really the tragedy of that part of us which dies every time we acquiesce in evil; that part of us which died when we cast away our ideals and agreed to take the world on ITS terms, and not our own.a wonderful play. i especially recommend the bantam edition. it's edited by david bevington and includes original source material, in other words, the actual stories or plays that shakespeare probably based his plays on."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"It comes with the complete play, plus side-by-side definitions of the more obscure English words used and illustrations.

It also gave more detail than the movie that stars Mel Gibson, which is also good but they speak in the Shakespearean language so it takes some brain power to understand it. This book was very long too. It was very hard to understand in some parts. And like all tradgedy every body dies which is no fun.

I would definately recommend it to some one who likes Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"I thought that this book was interesting. I had never read the story Hamlet before I read this, and I was able to understand it because it had both English and Shakespeare version.

But as well-known as the storyline is, the play itself is what deserves the attention, both for Shakespeare's shadowy plot filled with uncertainty and treachery -- and for his brilliant, immortal writing, which takes on a new dimension when read on the page.Prince Hamlet of Denmark is understandably upset when, only a short time after his father's death, his mother Gertrude marries his uncle Claudius, who is now the new king. Who wouldn't be unhappy? But when Hamlet encounters the tormented ghost of his father (\\"I am thy father's spirit/Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night\\"), he learns that his dad was murdered by his uncle -- but he's plagued by indecision, since he's unsure if the spirit was truly his dad.In response to this vision, Hamlet's behavior becomes more bizarre and erratic -- he dumps his girlfriend Ophelia, arranges a play that mimics real life a little too closely, and generally acts like a loon. But when an argument with his mother ends in tragedy -- and the death of one of Ophelia's loved ones -- Hamlet's fate is sealed as Claudius begins plotting to get rid of him too.Small warning: like all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read \\"Hamlet\\" after you've seen a good performance, because the entire thing was intended to be acted out. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to.But if you HAVE seen a good performance of \\"Hamlet,\\" then the play will just jump off the page. The plot is a relatively simple one, but it's tangled up in all sorts of moral dilemmas, personal doubts, deteriorating personal relationships, and a creeping undercurrent of darkness. The best part is that Shakespeare leaves you with all sorts of questions that are left up in the air -- is Hamlet crazy or just faking it? Is the ghost really his dad?And, of course, it contains some of the most intense, powerful examples of Shakespeare's work here -- vivid, nasty imagery (\\"In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed/Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love/Over the nasty sty\\"), some bleak humor (\\"you're a fishmonger\\"), and Hamlet's immortal soliloquies. It's also one of Shakespeare's most quotable plays -- obviously you've got bits like \\"Alas, poor Yorick,\\" \\"to be or not to be\\" and \\"Something is rotten in the state of Denmark,\\" but there are countless other familiar phrases littered through the text.On the page, Hamlet is basically an embittered young man who is torn between his doubts and convictions, but is still determined to fix things (\\"O cursed spite,/That ever I was born to set it right!\\"). A lot of the supporting cast are hard to follow, but there are some brilliant and enduring roles here -- the incestuous queen Gertrude, the subtle menace of Claudius, the windbag Laertes, and Ophelia, whose uncertainties spiral into madness after her ex-boyfriend kills her dad.It's best to get a grip on this classic tragedy by watching an actual performance, but reading \\"Hamlet's\\" text is a vivid experience on its own.

The sad truth is I am one of those who have come, through some application, to feel real appreciation for the play, yet never loved it. The fault is mine and not Shakespeare's, but it is an honest fault worth exploring.The story is pretty straightforward on its face. The king of Denmark has died, and as his son Hamlet fights overwhelming grief, he comes to discover the father died at the hand of his successor, Hamlet's uncle Claudius. As he contemplates the enormity of this knowledge, he wrestles with the fact his friends and court advisors are in league with the uncle. Even Hamlet's mother has compromised her connection with him by marrying Claudius soon after being widowed. Through all this turmoil a cosmic consciousness slowly emerges in young Hamlet.\\"There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio/Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\\"It's that cosmic consciousness that's at the heart of why \\"Hamlet\\" sticks out so. At the same time, it's a revenge play, and in the end one of Shakespeare's bloodiest this side of \\"Titus Andronicus\\". \\"Hamlet's\\" murky origins are explored in an essay, \\"A Note On The Sources\\", included in the Signet edition. This discusses evidence for an earlier text of the play, before the version we have, possibly written by Thomas Kyd who penned a popular bloodbath called \\"The Spanish Tragedy\\".Our \\"Hamlet\\" has at times a two-headed aspect; if it were a movie, it might have been co-directed by Quentin Tarantino and Ingmar Bergman. A lot of soul-searching dominates the first three acts; monologues abound, some more gripping than others. The story is kicked off very dramatically by a pair of soldiers who have spotted the ghost of Hamlet's father, but slows up to accommodate one of Shakespeare's overdone devices, the play-within-the-play. Hamlet's madness is a topic of much discussion, but is he even acting mad? It's hard to tell from the text, which has our hero going off in several directions at once. His love for the waifish Ophelia is said to be a great motivator, but all we see him do with her is blow her off.\\"This is the story of a man who could not make up his mind.\\" The 1948 film by Laurence Olivier began with that statement, but this question of Hamlet's indecision, like the madness thing, is unsatisfying reductivist. Olivier's film is terrific, in part for some judicious trims that do away with the subplot about a Norwegian invasion and focus more attention on Hamlet himself. One wonders if Shakespeare's longest play is a little too, well, long.Who is Hamlet? I don't think Shakespeare tries to answer that. What he did was build something so enigmatic that civilization stepped in to fill and refill the blanks.What we have from Shakespeare is an underbaked or rebaked story, many of the best lines of dialogue in English, a few puns that haven't aged as well, and achingly deep thoughts about the nature of man; alternately nihilist, existentialist, and Christian in tone - sometimes all three at once. Is man just \\"food for worms\\" in the end, or is there indeed \\"a divinity that shapes our ends/Rough-hew them how we will\\"? Shakespeare was too great an artist to attempt a definitive answer, and that's the glory of \\"Hamlet\\". But there's frustration also in the open-ended nature of its characters and narrative. Sometimes you're better off not trying to cram too much into a simple revenge story."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Not only does this book make understanding Shakespeare much easier, but it came WAY earlier than expected and was in time for me to use in my class."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"The description of the book said that it was used, but in near-new condition with no markings.

This book has Opera-like simplicity (similar to Othello) but has enough captivating emotional scenes that can really sweep one off his feet. I first picked up this book while on the treadmill in gym class at my school. In the beginning, I thought I should whip out my Shakespeare dictionary and begin to translate every word, but alas this was not the case. Instead, Shakespeare managed to make this book oddly understandable. Sure, it's sprinkled with Shakespeare's traditional tongue, but the context clues are frequent enough so that the book can be easily read. Definately a must for beginner Shakespeare readers. This particular edition is also the best due to the fact that it has pages dedicated to the history of Hamlet's time. ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Hamlet was a masterpiece of a play. It included many different aspects of a good play. Hamlet had inspiring characters that were involved in many different activities to give each one of them depth.

Hamlet was well written and well thoght out. The plot would draw you in and capativate you, involving totally in the play. You almost felt the same pain as the characters within the play.Hamlet is quite possibally one of the best play's ever written. The story of Hamlet was a great tragedy that affects us all in the representation of our everyday lives. The emoation Hamlet brings out is unexplainable and a feeling of tragedy. This is a good example of a good play because our emotions go out, as if it really happened."},{"Title":"Hamlet","review":"Overall, I believe that this version was pretty easy to follow. As far as I can tell, it pretty closely followed other versions I looked at. The notes on every page greatly contributed to my understanding of the play. Hamlet kept my interest throughout the whole play. The only other tragedy that I've read of Shakespeare's is Romeo and Juliet. I liked Romeo and Juliet better than I liked Hamlet but I still thought that it was a good play. I think that I understood this version as well as could be suspected, considering that Shakespeare can be very difficult to read. My favorite character in Hamlet was Ophelia. I think that she best represented any person in the world today. She had qualities that almost anyone could relate to.

Yea, He will keep thee in all thy way.\\" What a comforting promise. He will perfect what concerns me. He will perfect what concerns you.

It is also a very good reference that puts together a lot of the stories that many people have heard of and are now in danger of being forgotten.For me, it even served as a historical reference.

In the first place the use of language was excellent and the story was entertaining too."},{"Title":"Legal foundations of capitalism","review":"I read this book back in law school, intrigued by the title. Initially I was confused by Commons's very strange analytical style (he is quite sui generis in his analytical framework) but the final product is an excellent education in the role courts and judges in UK and USA played in the emergence of the US economy pre-WWII. Within the right frame of mind, this book can be a very valuable opportunity for coming to appreciate the law-economics nexus in a way that gets clouded or obscured by the presuppositions of neoinstitutional economics and the Law & Economics movement. Commons' empirical data in this book consisted of 500 years of court cases involving litigation of commercial questions. From these court cases, Commons extracts a frame of analysis. Commons' method often involves on the one hand, finding analogies and connections between concepts that in our daily and professional lives we treat as separate and synthesizing them into new analytical tools (such as \\"Working Rules\\" and \\"Transactions\\"), and on the other hand, taking concepts we take for granted as reflecting a certain unity, and busting them open to reveal the internal diversity of different kinds of ideas/events/phenomena that get subsumed and supressed by such a unifying concept (this is done with particularly good result with the concepts of \\"value\\", \\"property\\" and \\"liberty\\" although one is left wishing Commons had not limited himself to judges' opinions in constructing his historical studies.I think that recognizing this methodology is a key to understanding what Commons was attempting to accomplish in this and in his later works. Commons' technique results in a polyphonic argument that moves in multiple directions at once, sometimes coming together harmoniously into brilliant insights of synthesis. The final framework of analysis that emerges is summarized in Commons' final book - the Economics of Collective Action - which one might want to read as a good sort of introduction to this and to his magnum opus, Institutional Economics.One of the implications of Commons' analysis is the idea of collective action - it seems to become a logical, defensible, necessary next step in American capitalism from Commons' 1924 point of view. And for many years, the idea gained momentum, but was ultimately gutted and destroyed by the Wagner Act and by a massive ideological campaign launched by the economics profession about the supposed inefficiencies of collective protection and bargaining.But perhaps one of the richer take-aways of this book for contemporary readers is that, despite the title, one gets a sense that \\"capitalism\\" is a rather meaningless word. Commons' framework serves, more than anything, to drive home the fact that our current economic, political, legal, social context - or anyone's context - is really a set of particulars, each with its own history and baggage. Lawyers, I think, understand this since a single change in law, a shift in the allocation of liabilities, or a change in the interpretation of a word, can, slowly but surely, change the entire direction of a society and its economy. In fact, \\"capitalism\\" is a rather troublesome word whose role in our language and society seems to gloss over a vast internal diversity of economic practices, institutional frameworks, and social values over time and from place to place, subsuming it all under a catch-all phrase that doesn't really stand on its own two feet in the end. The value of using such a code word is that it allows people like Thatcher to cry \\"TINA\\" to shut down opposition to the status quo. A certain popular - though misguided - branch of progressive critical thought spends a lot of effort constructing critiques of capitalism, a tradition started by Marx and the social theorists and just as strong today, as if to confront Thatcher and the rest of the TINA contingent front-on. After reading Commons, I would hope that it would be as apparent to others as it is to me that such a project is futile. We would probably be better off banishing the word from our language. Frankly, I don't think there is any such thing as \\"capitalism.\\" Capitalism is always used as a sort of placeholder for the any given speaker's internalized conception of the economic, political, and social context in which the speaker finds him- or herself, but rare - if non-existent - is the critic who is able to separate the contingent, local, temporal from some underlying, enduring, constant presence that we can point to and say \\"ah, here is the core of 'capitalism', whether in 1855 Paris or 1990 Bangkok, or 2007 Toronto\\". For example, a book I just started reading, by a prominent Italian-American sociologist begins with the claim that \\"over the lastst quarter of a century something fundamental seems to have changed in the way in which capitalism works. In the 1970s, many spoke of crisis.\\" What crisis? Whose capitalism? Author and reader all seem to take for granted that they all know what capitalism is. I don't think for a minute that Mexican \\"capitalism\\" is really that similar to American \\"capitalism\\" or to Korean \\"capitalism\\" or any other country's capitalism. A thorough reading of Commons will dispell such delusions. Even if we could identify some common demoniminator among countries and over time, it would have to be such a minor element of the overall economy that it wouldn't make sense to frame the debate around such. After Commons, it doesn't make sense to talk in the abstract about grandiose systems, whose internal content is presuppsosed and allegedly comes predefined. Rather, all we are left with are specific policies, practices, institutions, and behaviors, all of which are subject to forces of change and inertias - in other words, all we can meaningfully talk about is the particulars, the subtle changes in \\"Working Rules,\\" the meaning of \\"Property\\", the different kinds of \\"Bargains\\" that are available to different participants with respect tot different resources in a given context - in short, who has power to do what and with what consequences. Any grandiose discourse of \\"Capitalism\\" seems naive and senseless. It would be refreshing for us progressives if we could get out of the \\"No Alternative to Capitalism\\" debates so that we can role our sleaves up and start talking about real issues, rather than discussing the how to replace Capitalism over an espresso in a coffee shop."},{"Title":"Legal foundations of capitalism","review":"I need to know all about John R.

First of all, this is the story not of a flag officer or pilot but rather of an enlisted aircrewman. This alone makes it somewhat unique. Secondly, this is not simply a collection of anecdotes and &quot;war stories.&quot; Rather, this is the poignant story of the author's journey through the war from his blue-collar neighborhood in Philadelphia to the farthest reaches of the vast Pacific and back. It also chronicles his transition from adolescence to manhood. At each stage of these dual journeys we are treated to evocative word pictures of his experiences and feelings. He has an uncommon talent for conveying the gestalt of a situation-the smells and sounds of a Liberator bomber in flight, the enervating feeling of the steaming and fetid jungle, the dark loneliness of a remote hospital ward. Going Back is a far deeper book than one would expect. This is truly a case of not judging a book by its cover. As we accompany the author on his journey, we are treated to his vivid recollections of life as an aircrewman with its adventures, dangers, hardships, and camaraderie. We are treated in even greater measure to his remarkable perception and introspection. With easy language and painful honesty, he tells us a compelling tale, one well worth the reading."},{"Title":"Going Back: A Navy Airman in the Pacific War","review":"This book brought back poignant memories of the reader's World War II experiences which related in many incidences to those of the author.

A gifted story-teller and a story worth telling."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The second installment of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles is even more masterful then Interview With the Vampire! Though it is a difficult decision this novel is my favorite in the series. I loved getting Lestat's perspective on the story and found myself far more intrigued by Lestat than Louis--though I do love Louis. Lestat's charm is in his contradictory and rebellious nature as well as his astounding self confidence. Interview With the Vampire painted Lestat the villain and somewhat of a pathetic figure but as the story of his life unfolds it becomes clear that he is so much more than Louis made him out to be. I loved every aspect of this story but as always with Rice, I think I fell most in love with her lyric and vivid prose. If you read only one book from The Vampire Chronicles read this one!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Not one of my favorites by Anne Rice. Wasn't as interesting to me as her other books. Lestat seems to be a lot different than in the book Interview with the Vampire, he's almost...kind. I guess it depends who the story is told from. I disliked Gabrielle very much in this novel, that might of been why this story wasn't as intersting as the others."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is a book that is beyond any words of praise. Much, much better than &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot;. With its setting in the 1984, Lestat spins an enrapturing tale of his mortal life and escapades as a vampire. While Louis's story leaves you with a depressing emptiness, Lestat enchants and enraptures you by the very first page. When reading &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot; , it makes Lestat out to be paticularly cold and menacing, not a very accurate picture. Although it described Lestat's arrogance, spite, cruelty and vengfulness, it left out important parts of his personality such as his passion, sensuality, charm, and the courage to endure a cursed immortality that was layed before him. This book, on the other hand gives a whole new perspective as the author tells things from Lestat's point of view while at the same time analyzing his true character and motives. After reading it I was completely enamored and hungry for more. This is the true essence of the vampire chronicles and the very reason why I love Anne Rice even today. Even though her creativity is slowly depleting, I still remain a loyal fan for the simple fact that I believe she will one day produce another masterpeice equal to the likes of this one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is, in my opinion, the BEST BOOK EVER WRITTEN. It's the life story of a 250-year-old vampire, Lestat de Lioncourt, who becomes a rock star. His life begins in France, where he is a mortal aristocrat, and he runs away from home to become an actor. Then a crazy vampire, Magnus, turns him into a vampire. Along the course of the book, he meets a coven of backward vampires living under a cemetery, and eventually, the Queen of all vampires. Lestat is an amazing character. He's adventurous, fun, interesting, and sexy as hell. I love the scene at the end where he meets Louis again, the part with Akasha, and, umm...THE WHOLE DAMN BOOK. This is Anne Rice in peak form. Her language is vivid and beautiful and the characters are fascinating. I've read this book maybe 10 times. I would give it a six if I could. READ INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, THIS BOOK, AND QUEEN OF THE DAMNED. STOP THERE. I look at my copy of Merrick and I cry. Why, Anne, why? Why couldn't you write another book like the Vampire Lestat? And now you're writing the life story of MARIUS?!!... I think I'll read The Vampire Lestat again."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I've read this book three times and it never gets boring. I enjoy the plot line so much. I enjoyed the fact that in this book Lestat is a way more likable character than Louis. The book is a bit long but every page is worth it. This book can keep you entertained for hours. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Well.. when I started reading it I was looking quite forward to it, thinking that i would finish it in a week or soo... wasn't like that. The book starts up quite nicely but then it slows down, we become involved with Lestat's feelings a bit too much, then Armand comes along. That's when the fun starts, it took me a week to get there and as soon as i started reading that, in 2 or 3 days i was finished. I the plot is awesome from then on. How Lestat looses everyone and then gets them back, how the Enkil is jealous of the Akasha and Lestat and how Marius plays them. It's also fun to listen as vampires speak about the children of the millenia and other myths like that and then pick up a book(i.e. Pandora) and learn about them... We also get some insight on what is happening to Louis in the present as he goes with Lestat to his concert. If it wasn't for the slowness in the start/middle i would have given it 5 stars. But 4 is good. Otherwise, it's quite a nice read"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Vampires and humans are plagued by the same questions: Where did we come from, where are we going and what is our purpose. Anne Rice gives us some exsistential philosophy from a vampire's point of view. Can you live forever without going mad? It is a worthy sequel to Interview if not even better. The reason I don't give it five stars is because Anne divulges to us the origin of vampires, which in my opinion would be a good thing to leave unresolved. What is left there for the sequels? But up to that point an air of mystery pervades her rich but not too lenghty writing."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews! A good book is supposed to make you forget that you are physically reading - this only happens once in this book, and it takes place in the first few pages. I kept wishing that certain characters would die so that the plot could move along. Yeeesh- you die hard Rice fans will accept anything."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I came to read this book long after the whole Anne Rice craze and long after the movie &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;, but I am certainly glad that I did.While a very lengthy compositon that had a tendency to drag on sometimes, Lestat still managed to capture my attention on almost every page. You realise after a while that the author is educating you for a reason. I now see her master plan and embrace it.From the streets of France to Cairo to New Orleans, this book takes you on a journey of discovery. The discovery of what it means to be the great Vampire Lestat.But I am ramble on to much. Just read the book and you won't regret it. Yes, it's rather long but worth every page."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Next to &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot;, &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is my other all-time favorite book in the vampire chronicles. In the first book &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; Louis tells his side of the story which was his life with Lestat and Claudia. In &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; the ultimate and the most consumate vampire in the vampire chronicles tells his story.What I really enjoy about the Anne Rice's vampire chronicles is that the vampires aren't cartoonish caricatures like Dracula or Nosferatu. Anne delves deep into her characters' souls and brings out both the best and the worst in them and makes them come to life. What really draws me to &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is that Anne really goes into details about Lestat and describes him not as the demon that Louis portrayed him as in the first book. I also enjoyed the underlining homosexuality subtext in Louis and Lestat's relationship. She doesn't come right out and say that her characters are gay or not, she makes the reader read between the lines.The work that Anne puts into her books really shows. Obviously she puts in a lot of research for her books. How else could she know about the legends of Osiris and Isis in &quot;Queen of the Damned&quot; and the religious theme of &quot;Memnoch the Devil&quot;? In &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; I believe she had to research to understand the time periods of when Lestat, Louis and Claudia existed as a coven as well as give Marius a thorough past. &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is definitely one of Anne Rice's finest literary works."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lestat continues his adventures from the first book (Interview With The Vampire).I've read the entire 'Vampire Chronicles' and can't remember what happened in each volume, specifically, now but, you will be drawn in as Lestat goes from rising to international fame and back into obscurity and finally to self-destruction and self-redemption over the course of the series.In this series, Lestat becomes the rock star he's always wanted to be. It continues in \\"The Queen of the Damned\\"."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Really good book. This is Lestats version of Interview with a Vampire, and a much easier read!

I admit I was hestitant in the beginning because with Interview with a Vampire I did not like the character of Lestat in the least. This book painted the characted in a different light and made the character of Lestat extremely likeable."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I recently re-read The Vampire Lestat by Anne Rice, about 15 years after having read it the first time. As a junior in high school, I could only appreciate the viscous killing, the bloodlust, and the fascination with the vampires themselves. Now, as an adult, I can still adore the storyline itself, but I see past the superficial elements. The history, the beauty, the description, and the emotion are what separate Anne Rice's vampire novels from the current generation's stories.Like the rest of the world, I'm drawn to modern vampire stories of the Twilight and Sookie Stackhouse series. One of these novels can be finished in a few days, and they leave you wanting to move right onto the next one. The films and television series developed out of those series are equally as captivating. But somewhere along the way, I started to remember that vampires are not the romantic heartthrobs they are portrayed to be in these modern series. Edward Cullen, of the Twilight series, is weak and frail, falling in love with a human girl he feels compelled to protect while refusing to give her immortality. Anne Rice's vampires would crush him, once they stopped laughing at him. Bill Compton, of the Sookie Stackhouse (\\"True Blood\\") series, is equally as pathetic a character, living in the middle of a run-down Louisiana town when his powers would allow him to see the world. Please don't misunderstand. These modern series are captivating, and I will continue to follow the stories as new books are written. But along the way, I felt compelled to return to the more classic interpretation of a vampire, and Anne Rice's vampires are second-to-none.The Vampire Lestat recounts the life and creation of the vampire made famous in Rice's first novel, Interview With The Vampire. Told in the first person, Lestat recounts his last years as a human being, living with his family in rural France, and eventually moving to Paris with his close friend. Lestat is in love with the theater and becomes a performer in the Paris stage, a foreshadowing of the modern-era rock star he becomes later in life. Lestat is made a vampire against his will by Magnus, just before Magnus hurls himself into a massive blaze. Lestat is left with a fortune in jewels and an elaborate tower in which to reside, and he is forced to explore being a vampire all alone.To quench his loneliness, he makes vampires of his mother, Gabrielle, and his best friend, Nicholas. Both vampires enhance the story as their conflict with Lestat deepens, and their own desires and inner conflicts force them to part ways. Lestat and Gabrielle encounter the Children of Darkness, a coven of vampires serving Satan under the leadership of the vampire Armand, first introduced in Interview With The Vampire. The reader learns how the Theatre of the Vampires was started, with the financial and emotional support of Lestat.As the story progresses, Lestat and Gabrielle travel the world before they part ways in Egypt, and Lestat takes up a short residence with the ancient vampire, Marius, who exposes Lestat to the origins of vampire legend. Marius is the keeper of Akasha and Enkil, the female and male thought to be the first vampires ever created when demons entered their bodies through knife wounds.The entire story is fascinating and spans centuries as Lestat grows from a fledgling vampire into the emotional, angry, and finally carefree vampire he is upon setting foot on a San Francisco stage to perform his first rock concert in front of 15,000 screaming fans. Anne Rice reminds us that vampires are monsters, driven by a thirst for blood and a desire to hunt. While they struggle with their human side and often ponder religion, spirituality, and their own origins, it is ultimately their inherent demonic nature that wins out. Like most of her novels, The Vampire Lestat is at times entirely too descriptive, especially when mentioning clothing, music, and artwork. The novel is not one that can or should be read over the course of a few days. To truly appreciate the story, the timeline it spans, the description, and the many characters, take the time to read the novel slowly. Enjoy it, and then think about it before moving on. All of Rice's novels should be read slowly, without distraction, not only for storylines, but for a great appreciation of her amazing ability to craft the English language."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat was the first Anne Rice book I ever read. I did read a few others afterward to follow the characters, but this one stole my heart. Lestat is the reason why.Lestat enjoyed being a vampire. He did not loathe his lot in life but embraced it. Yes, that is immoral and disgustingly psychopathic, but hey--that's fiction. And frankly, that's escapism at its best. Who wants to slip into the world of the complaining and whining vampire when you can mentally walk in the shoes of the cunning and self-loving vampire Lestat? Then there's the history. I enjoyed learning of Lestat's past just as much as his present. Such richness and detail that could never be translated to a satisfactory film because I have the perfect *movie* already in my mind.Good book, great read...Ellen C Mazeauthor~"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book has so many reviews of praise, so I can't say much that hasn't been said by everybody else here.

Bravo to Ms. Rice for writing this book! 4.5/5 stars for one of the best books in the Vampire Chronicles."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice tells the story of Lestat de Lioncourt, an eighteenth-century French aristocrat who becomes a vampire. We follow Lestat's early years on the dark side as he struggles and inevitably fails to stay connected with his family, friends and former life. Most of the book traces Lestat's quest to understand his dark nature and come to terms with it. This involves meeting and hearing the stories of several older vampires. And finally deciding how he will exist in the world of humans.The book offers a sophisticated view of vampires and their history. It is more similar to historical fiction than to most vampire tales. In the spirit of carefully researched nonfiction, it presents history as a series of oral biographies delivered by its main characters. As their stories contradict each other, the reader sees the layers of history pealed back and learns more than most of the characters themselves are aware of. Lestat retells the story of Louis, the protagonist of Rice's previous book in the series,Interview with the Vampire, and corrects his errors, sometimes self-servingly. Having readjusted our perspective as readers, we do it twice more as Lestat tells what he learned from the older vampires Armand and Marius. These interlocking and contradictory tales are well-written and well-worth reading.Lestat's tale can be read independently of the first Vampire Chronicles book, but is necessary to understanding the events ofThe Queen of the Damned,The Tale of the Body Thiefand subsequent books in the series. This book is easily the best of the series and a reasonable place to begin reading it.

I immediately fell in love with the characters. Rice is so vivid in her description and detail. You almost feel you are there with the characters. I have since read The Vampire Lestat multiple times and it is by far my favorite in the series.This book begins with Lestat waking up in present times. He falls in love with rock music and forms a band. Sounds cheesy, but that isn't the direction the book takes. This is the biography of Lestat. We are taken back to 16th century France and are introduced to young Lestat and his family, including his beautiful mother, Gabrielle. Lestat is troubled by his attraction to Nicolas, and runs away and joins a comedy troupe. This is when he is noticed by a vampire and becomes one himself. We travel with Lestat as he meets other vampires and learns the history of his kind, and struggles with who he is. Lestat must let go of his ties to family, and the reader sees the turmoil he goes through.There is always something sexy and alluring about a vampire. Rice portrays this throughout the entire book. Her description is unbeatable. Lestat is one of the most memorable vampires in literature, and this book is riveting."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice, in my opinion is one of the top 5 authors in history. She is definetely the best interesting descriptive author ever, by that I mean all the detail she provides makes you want to learn more rather than being bored. This is a biography of a vampire that plays a key part in her \\"Vampire Chronicles\\". It is beyond a doubt on the most interesting reads and everyone should read it, even if they don't like vampires."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is very beautiful. The writing is fluent and charming. Anne Rice is able to put such powerful emotions into writing that it's nearly shocking to read her books. This book is able to take you from the depths of hell to the beauty of a starry night in Egypt, or tropical jungles of wonder and mystery. The deal of the vampires and who they are and what they do is a bit too mysterious and it can get a bit confusing UNTIL Lestat meets Marius and Marius explains everything quite well. I believe in her first book, (Interview w/vampire) she had a more defined plot, but The Vampire Lestat is still a great book. :) It's much more \\"adventure\\" style and Lestat is a less \\"tragic\\" character than Louis."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is one of the greatest books I have read. After the first one I didn't think it could get any better but she surely topped herself with this one. Lestat seemed to be watching over my shoulder while I read it. It ws very exciting and it was one of those books I couldn't put down. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Horror/Fantasy."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I thought this was an extreamly good book, this is definently one of my favorite books. their is alot of detail. I enjoyed reading this book because it made me feel like i was there with him. If you like horror and suspencful books then this is the book for you."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The second in the series, this book goes in-depth into the life (and afterlife) of Lestat de Lioncourt. This book is Lestat's defence against Louis portrayal of him as a selfish, cruel creator in Interview. Anne carefully builds on her precious world, and continues to weave the intricate details that she's come to be known for. So... read 'interview with the vampire' first, then this book and you'll be well on your way to Anne Rice's dark, but beautiful world."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot. I think it really cleared up some of the answers from the first book like &quot;what happened to Lestat before he was a vampire?&quot;The chronicals would still make sence if you read this one before Interveiw with the Vampire. I think it is one of Anne's best books, and I recomend it to vampire fans.The thing I don't really like about it is the detail that takes up page after page. But I still give it 5 stars because of the beautiful story and the way it was written."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In this book you really get to learn about Rice's dashing, charming, yet violent character, Lestat deLioncourt.

You saw his story and how a rogue vampire named Lestat, a monster in Louis' eyes, brought him to Hell's door and called it home. Lestat was a monster. Cruel, arrogent, vindictive and didn't care about anyone but himself. Well true as some may be, Louis didn't know Lestat one bit.Here is the story of Anne Rice's most beloved Vampire, Lestat. The Brat Prince he may be as a vampire, but as a human in the late 1700's, he was a prince in his own right as the son of a well known Lord in the proverbs of France as a young man of just past 20. Lively yet over shadowed by his ignorant older brothers Lestat ventures off on his own with his best friend to Paris. There he becomes what he's only dreamed, an actor. An actor who had hence forth caught the sight of an ancient vampire to make his own. Lestat is \\"born into darkness\\" as he so eloquently puts it and it all begins. Left alone as what he is and no teacher to help he fends for himself and becomes who he is.Louis never knew the side to Lestat this book uncovers. You meet him through his eyes. The strength, the arrogence, the under-lying uncertainty which is so subtle, you barely see it. His life from human, to vampire, traveling the world with a companion vampire, to meeting Akasha, mother of all vampires, to Louis and Claudia, to how Lestat really thought of Armand once they'd met and then him becoming a rock star in the dawn on the MTV era in the 1980's. Becoming a rock star and getting his face everywhere is his biggest dream realized and in turn, if he pisses a few vampires off, well bring it on, like he'd care, if anything, he'd think it fun.If you plan on reading any of the other Vampire Chronicles, you'd better get to liking Lestat somewhat, he is the eyes you see through during most of the books. Lestat is one those guys you're gonna hate to love and love to hate, but you will."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Love this book! This is the heart of the Vampire Chronicles. I love all of the books in the Chronicles, but this is my favorite. Lestat is my favorite Character of all time."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is probably the best book after Interview with the vampire. Like the previous book \\"Interview with the vampire\\" Anne Rice has sucessfully been creative in The Vampire Lestat. Lestat has become a rockstar, sold 4 million albums, and owns a band. He strives for fame and wanted to freely express his vampiric nature. Like most vampires He longs to reveal his nature and his story by writing an autobiography. In his life you'll find many things you didn't know before he met Louis from the previous book. You'll have a different view of him than how he is being percieved by Louis. He'll meet a famous vampire, before he met Louis, Armand. He'll also meet a mysterious vampire who turns out to be 2000 years old. You'll finally discover how Lestat became a vampire and how he lived as a vampire. However for those who read Interview with the vampire, Lestat doesn't talk much about the book and sometimes can seem to be an unreliable narator such as when he said he loved Claudia. However the book is well connected, every events are connected to another and it is also well connected to the book Interview with the vampire. The plot is always different, and never solid, but remember it's reading a life of another being so don't expect there to be a solid plot (for life can change it's course constantly). For those who firmly dislike a story with a weak-plot I don't reccomend you to read this book but you can try if you wish to. As for me I don't mind reading a story with a weak plot when it comes to knowing a life of another being personally."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Remember when Anne Rice was a great writer? No? Then read this, Interview with the Vampire and then Queen of the Damned and stop there and you will see how good she was. Seemed to go down hill after that. Now with the Musical Lestat on stage (awesome btw I saw it) maybe it will get people reading this and crying out...ANNE WHAT HAPPENED!!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an amazingly written book. Extremely interesting in the way that it tells of the vampire lifestyle, their powers and the way that they speak to each other. The book starts off beautifully with Lestat digging his way out of the ground after \\"dying\\" coming up into the 1980's to be a part of a rock band when he starts to tell his story about his life as a vampire, how it all started, and years before his fateful visit with Magnus. the book is so well written that even though the whole second part of the book, almost 75 pages, is not even about vampires at all, no awesome bloodsucking action or dismemberment, but the great thing is that Anne Rice still keeps you interested, drawing you into the story to feel what Lestat is feeling, what Gabrielle is feeling, what Nicholas De Lefant is feeling as they become vampires, as they come into their powers, and how they cope with the idea of imortality.This book is good for anyone who likes good writing, as i said, this book will take you into a whole new dimension of life, and possibly change your entire outlook on living and your own mortality."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is one of Anne Rice's best works. The Vampire Lestat, using the same character carried over from 'Interview With The Vampire,' tells the tale of his life, and it's a great one. Lestat is pretty much the main focal character in the Vampire Chronicles, and you get to know the 'guy' quite well. Lestat, I think, is the most entertaining book because of its wide range of storytelling. Told in first person and beginning with Lestat's younger, mortal, days, the story takes us through his transformation of a young man to a powerful member of the undead, and how he learns to use his powers to his advantage. He even deals with the tale of 'Interview' as a book that was published and how he reacts to Louis' telling of the story. Absolutely fabulous work!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice's 'The Vampire Lestat' is, in name, the sequel to her earlier novel 'Interview With The Vampire' published almost a decade before. However it feels more like a retelling of the same tale, as if Anne Rice was dissatisfied with her first vampire novel, and its protagonist Louis and decided to start over again with Lestat as the hero. So it chronicles the life of Lestat, who like Louis before him struggles to understand what it all means. And like the previous book there are lengthy discussions concerning Ehtics, Morality and Philosophy. However Lestat's mentor, Marius, is, fortunately, a little more knowledgeable than anyone was in 'Interview with a Vampire', and many of the reader's questions concerning the nature of Vampires is explained.I enjoyed this book more than the first; it wasn't quite as dry, and Lestat isn't the whiner Louis was. There is a little bit of discontinuity between the two stories; notably the character of Lestat has completely changed from the first novel (as has Armand), which an epilogue to the story doesn't quite fix."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Thought I enjoyed \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" I found the colorful beauty in \\"Lestat\\" more to my liking.Don't get me wrong, I enjoy both books, but as \\"Interview\\" was somber, dark, poignant, \\"Lestat\\" though feeling all the ravages of internal anguish, is a far more actively passionate creature.It seemed in the first book Louis was always the moper, seeking to blame everything around him for life's tragedies. (I'm generalizing; there is more depth there) But Lestat never blamed. No matter what betrayal or tragedy he always \`forgave' often time setting himself up for the next round, but with vibrant mix of rage and compassion that no matter what happens, you wanted to ride along an see what's to happen next--never blaming Lestat for wading right into the thick of it again.Beyond the old world of Europe, France and finally to Louisiana, \\"Lestat\\" was a vampire book that took us to roam the ancient splendors of Egypt as seen through the brightly painted and gold-gilded walls of the ancient vampire master painter Marius. You could see the sand crusting the torn linen wrapping of Akasha, the Mother of the vampires; felt repulsed as lamp oil splashed and burned greasily across the pulped and still pulsating 'body' of the old vampire she had ground to paste beneath her cold, unyielding feet.All done with the empty eyes of an unfeeling, porcelain doll.\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" gives us a refreshing view of vampires. And more, an insightful look into an existence beyond the societal, religious and affectation-al morals of western human beliefs.Good story, good characters --I highly recommend you get this book so you can hear the claxon call of \\"Hell's Bells\\" yourself."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"All the Vampire Chronicles are excellent pieces of literature but the second in the series is still the best one. It breaks down just about everything regarding Lestat de Lioncourt who all these novels are about for the most part. The first time I read this I could not put it down and there was a reason the story just flows so beautifully. Lestat is a hero/villian that everybody can identify with in someway and that is what makes him great. This book tells of how Lestat was made and what Vampires mentored him. Also it sheds light on Louis's story (Interview) so you can get Lestat's side. After reading this book I was hooked on the series and now own all the Vampire Chronicles in Hardback. Any book lover will want these novels for their collection"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I could not get enough of this book. It is so intricately and beautifully written that you almost feel like you know Lestat. He is portrayed to be a heartless monster in Interview with the Vampire, and we all get used to it. Then Anne Rice pulls out the sequel, showing more depth and character than we ever thought Lestat was capable of. Also, after reading Interview with the Vampire, we know Lestat from the beginning, and later know Claudia, and we see all of the actions through Louis' eyes. While reading The Vampire Lestat, I constantly thought of the time in the book when all of that starts happening, when I start remembering things from the last book, when I can finally find out the reasons for the things Lestat did. Anne Rice introduces characters, old and new, in a new and different way, giving descriptions that are so exact, that anyone could picture the characters. Vampires seem to be the newest way to explain all of life's mysteries, in the eternity that they live. It is not possible for this book to have been done any better!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"A great read... the words seem to come to life and allow you to &quot;live the story&quot; as it were. Anne Rice has a way with putting the reader &quot;into&quot; the story (truthfully I thought it was a fluke of sorts with 'Interview...', I quickly learned the error in that way)- allowing the the reader to &quot;see&quot; the events that happen AS they happen, all through the eyes of Lestat.The story of Armand is expanded (a little), the story of Lestat's creator, and many more (not in any way less important)characters dance through the mind as the reader is captured by printed words.I put the novel down only to sleep (even read as I cooked dinner, changed the baby's diaper,etc.: which is hard to do :) and the longer I was away from it, the more I longed to pick it up again."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I loved Interview with the Vampire so I went out and got this book. I absolutly loved it. I thought Louis and Lestat were the most interesting characters in the first book so I was dying to read more about Lestat. In this book, you get a different picture of Lestat. You learn what he was like before he became a vampire, how he became one, and his adventures afterword. There is unfortunatly not much on his life with Louis and Claudia, but it's still a wonderful book. The ending is marvelous!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Waking up from fifty years of sleep and unleashed on a world unlike the one he was born in, Lestat hits the fast paced world of the twentieth century. His goal is to reveal the secrets of the vampires to the mortal world and to awaken the ancient ones from their sleep. After becoming a famous rock star, Lestat writes his auto-biography the night before his first live concert. In it he tells of his creation by the Vampire Magnus, and of his encounters with Les Innocents. He lives through the age of Marie Antoinette and the French Revolution and travels the world in search of the meaning to the existance of vampires. In his search he comes across Marius, a millenium child and Armand's creator, who shares his knowledge and his secrets. The Vampire Lestat is a wonderfully told tale of a creature you want to hate, but can't help falling in love with. In the words of Marius, &quot;Lestat, you are the damndest creature,&quot;"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The book, Vampire Lestat changed my perception on life. As a writer, I was blown away by the dark underworld of the pysche portrayed in this novel. I read it over 17 times and it always fascinates me! I use it as a literary course in what a great novel contains: suspense, passion for the characters, a need, an addicting need to get to the next chapter. To write a novel such as this would be one of my ultimate dreams. If you have read the book, you'll know that one deserves another. If you have not, then by all means, let Ms. Rice take you to a fantasy world like no other. An escapist's dream..."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"My main advice before picking up a copy of The Vampire Lestat is to pick up a copy of Interview with the Vampire first! If you read the second before the first, you miss half the fun. I loved how Lestat started out saying essentially that everything you knew from the first book -- if not perhaps &quot;wrong&quot; -- was certainly biased by Louis' guilt and self hate. It was fun to read how Lestat's view of events differed from Louis' as Lestat &quot;set the record straight.&quot; Still there is so much more to The Vampire Lestat than a simple rebuttal of Interview. I consider Lestat the superior book as it ponders the nature of evil and free will. A great read."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This was a very good book. However, I did have a few issues. First: If Lestat loved Louis so much -Why did he treat him so horribly in Interview? He was condescending, called him names, laughed at him etc. - what was his reasons for this behavior? He didn't act like he loved him or even liked him. I hope the rest of the Chronicles explain his neurosis. Second: I cannot see Armand as a boy. I do wish he was older (Like Banderas in the movie). On the otherhand - I did like how Rice focused more on the story this time around than on metaphors and environmental discriptions. With the right script and actors (Cruise and Pitt of course and maybe DiCaprio as Armand (since he is a boy)- this would make a great movie."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book had brief moments of greatness but all in all the book was dull. Anne Rice trudges on endlessly it seemed at times, trying hard to make an exciting novel, but in the end fails miserably. The best part of the book was when it ended. This book has extinguished any desires I had to read the rest of the vampire chronicles."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"One could make a very strong case against Anne Rice's &quot;The Vampire Lestat.&quot; It's very flawed book: It's rather messy, much of the dialog is ridiculously flowery, and what's with All The Capitalization? Although this is not by far Rice's best book it is my personal favorite and has been for many years because cause of its incredibly brilliant and optimistic tone, it's absolute celebrations of life and youth and adventure, and it's enduring theme of the outsider who is damned by destiny forever struggling to make a life and identity and a purpose for himself in a world is not his own. This book is incredibly inspiring and I would even go as far as to say it is life-affirming.One thing that many critics and the media in general don't understand about the work of Anne Rice is it's amazing optimism and humanism. She may write often dark novels, about characters who are tainted with evil, but never does she celebrate evil, I would go as far from her books to say that Anne Rice hates evil, this is clear in &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot; if nowhere else. It's easy for people to look at a novel like &quot;Lestat,&quot; written from the vampire's point-of-view and say that it is glamorizing an evil charactor. This is a simplification. I accept Lestat, I love his spirit, his relentlessness, his courage but I do not celebrate his nature. I hate evil. I hate death and injustice. And so does Lestat. Maybe that's the glamor. The glamor of good in evil. Evil in good. If you think about it, it's something all priviledged Westerners can relate to. Like Lestat we are stuck in an evil system that is responsible for death and suffering throughout the world. Technically speaking all Westerners, all the priviledged of the world, are damned. Yet not necessarily evil. We are all vampires. We have only to choose what kind of vampires we are going to be. Good vampires or evil vampires.This to me is what &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is about. The creation of meaning and goodness in an evil world."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"When I saw the movie, &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot;, I expected an idiot history, like Bran Stocker's Dracula. When it finishes, I was astonished. I never saw a film that I loved so much like this. So I discovered Lestat and The Vampire's Chronicles. I looked for the books of it. And I bought &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. What I think of ? Well, I finished the book almost in one day... I could say that the book is simply the best that I ever read; that it's fabulous; unsociable; I could fill pages and pages about it, about all the incomparable saga that Anne Rice created, different of all that I saw. But is unseless. It's necessary to read the book to understand the magic that it means. I bought the other books. But it'll be hard Anne to surpass herself the deep atmosphere and intensity of &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot; and &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;. These two books are singular and rare pleasures that we still have on life. If you don't read, do it now, and you'll understand what about I talked. In one word? amazing.

If you read Interview with the Vampire and dismissed Lestat as nothing but a cruel killer, as I did, then you HAVE to read this book. In it, Lestat tells his version of what Louis told the interviewer, and the reader discovers that Louis did not always interpret things correctly. You're bound to fall in love with the Brat Prince, in love with his optimism and selfishness and vanity and curiosity about the world. He describes himself so vividly that you can see him clearly in your mind; his luxurious long blond curls, gray-blue eyes, and slender elegant body. He describes everything else vividly as well; after reading some scenes, you find yourself longing for blood! Not only that, but you come to understand Armand better as well. Lestat also introduces you to fascinating new characters: his friend Nicholas, his mother Gabrielle, and the ancient vampires Marius, Akasha and Enkil. His style of writing is beautiful, lush, evocative, and he captures your interest right from the very beginning. He'll leave you longing for him to appear and give you the Dark Gift, ushering you into his darkly beautiful world. You'll be so fascinated by him that you won't rest until you've read his three other books, too. Anyone who likes vampires absolutely must read this wonderful book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is in my opinion a finer example of Anne Rice's talent and imagination than most any other work she's written. Lestat, once the poor country lord of a small French province, is transformed into the Prince of Vampires. A creature like no other of his kind, he travels the world in search of the children of the millenia. Vampires as old as humankind, who would be able to share the reasons behind their existence. Anne Rice takes her reader on a trip through history. Her story deliciously wicked, wonderfully touching and always fascinating. She expertly mixes true history with her fictitious world of the undead. Folklore from around the world is blended with world history which would be taught in any college history course. I recommend this book to anyone who loves drama, art, and life. This is a story of a soul who has no wish to die, but strives to discover the meaning behind life as he has come to know it. Let Lestat take you on a journey of! discovery. Just like all of us, he finds plenty of road blocks and makes plenty of mistakes along the way, but that doesn't stop this reader from finding him the most compelling and charming character in Rice's novels."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The reason I gave this a 6 is not for the content, but for the lack there of. The Vampire Lestat is an excellant book, in fact I would probably say that it is my favorite Anne Rice novel. However, I don't think that the tapes do the book justice. To really appreciate this novel you would have to read the whole book. The tapes lack all the beautiful details of Lestat's trip to find Marius and it skips sections that give you insight into Lestat. To fully understand the other novels you must read this whole novel. DON'T TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT. Read the book, because if you don't you will be missing an extraordinary novel."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice's best book EVER!!!!!!

Lestat purposely kept him in the dark (no pun intended!) about the history and the meaning of being &quot;undead.&quot; This book is written not only from Lestat's point of view, but by Lestat himself! (Ms. Rice would have the reader believe, anyway). It adds amazing depth to the tale started in &quot;Interview&quot;, and takes the reader through centuries of richness and beauty (and blood of course) in Paris, Egypt, New Orleans, and London, answering &quot;unanswered&quot; questions and creating a vivid, complex, dark world of vampires.

Two thumbs up. - Felix Lim"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat begins with a bang, ends with a bang, but has some long dull stretches in between. This is the second book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. To read this book, one must first read Interview with the Vampire. However, once one has read Interview, one finds this book covering a lot of the same ground - at least thematically. Rice packs her novels to the brim with a lot of preachy, pop-existentialism, which gets very boring after a while; \\"life is meaningless...\\" yadda, yadda, yadda. It's a bit tiresome to hear this point expounded again and again - especially if one is not suffering from clinical depression and comes to realize that, difficult to accept as it may be, life isn't meaningless. We have not, as Nietzche said, moved \\"beyond good and evil.\\" Good still exists, morality still exists, and - recent events notwithstanding - God is still in His Heaven.One of the main gimmicks that Rice uses in her tails that is original is to tell her stories from the Vampire's perspective. This has advantages and disadvantages. She has rightly picked up on the fact that the heroes of Vampire tales are the vampires and not the \\"good guys.\\" However, part of the charm of Dracula (who is ridiculed in this book) is that he is unapologetically bad - he simply is what he is, and does not make excuses for it. Therein, we have the central flaw of The Vampire Chronicles. By making excuses for their actions and blatantly asking us to sympathize with them, we actually lose sympathy with the vampires. They are living in \\"bad faith\\", to use Sartre's phrase. They are living (is it un-living?) in denial. How can one actually love Lestat when he is so head-over-heals in love with himself that there is no room for anyone else's affections. Throughout the book, he is constantly uttering pretentious bits of teenage nonsense like, \\"I've always rebelled against everything,\\" and \\"I've always been good at everything.\\" I kept waiting for him to say, \\"I'm a loner Dottie - a rebel!\\" It is only fitting to find out that Lestat started out as an actor - he has all of the actor's flaws: selfishness, self-centeredness, narcissism, vanity, cruelty... If Lestat was a real person today, he'd be one of those waiters with streaked hair who judges his acting ability by the number of visible abdominal muscles he has.In the same vein, Rice is trying to pander to her audience. Past generations were \`bad' or \`ignorant' we are told, which is why Lestat took so long to rise from his grave. She is trying to kiss-up to young people by telling them they are so much wiser and more moral than their elders. As a member of the generation whose butt she is trying to kiss, I find this assessment to be laughable, and these passages sound like an older person trying to act young - sort of like when your parents try to act cool.Now, all that having been said, the novel picks up considerably towards the end. We finally get some of the answers that we'd been told we never would. In doing so, we are introduced to the best new character - Akasha, The Queen of The Damned. Then we jump forward in time - covering the events in Interview from Lestat's perspective, and then on to modern day with Lestat as a \\"rock star\\" (although I doubt his concerts could really compare to Ozzy's). Old friends are reunited and just when things really begin to get interesting - the book ends, leaving me thinking, \\"I can't believe I'm actually going to get suckered into another one!\\""},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I find Lestat to be an overrated character in the VC, not that I don't like him it's just that I loved him better in IWTV. AR changes alot of things around in this book just to build Lestat up, but she didn't have to do that at all, the whole Louis Lied thing is not explainable and very hard to believe, Lestat's story would have been more enduring and interesting if she had kept her original idea of him set in IWTV. There were parts in this book I couldn't read cause it was boring, his mortal life was boring, I found myself reading fragments of the story, around the time he met Marius I just skipped all the way to the end where talked about IWTV and when he was reunited with Louis etc, which was the best parts in the whole book. I realized a bit later that the main reason that part was better is because it had something to do with Louis.Lestat is a good character but I love Louis the most."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Most people say that Anne Rice completely changed her point of view when she wrote _The Vampire Lestat_ (1986).I read the whole _Vampire Chronicles_ and am not pretty sure about this judgement. All those who read _Interview with the Vampire_ may have been shocked and amazed by Lestat's cruelty. But this doesn't mean that the protagonist of _Vampire Lestat_ is a substantially different character.In _Interview_ we see a very strong comparison between Louis, a rich young man with some psychological problems, and Lestat, a strange, mysterious creature with a _lot_ of problems, both practical and affective (for example his old father). Louis supposes that Lestat is only an exploiter, but, as the story goes on, he must acknowledge that his perfidious companion is very useful, especially in the most critical situations.Unfortunately, there are only misunderstandings between the two characters, especially because of Louis' moralistic and inflexible position.So, when in the second book Lestat speaks about himself and his life, we get the impression that he is completely different from the former Lestat. As a matter of fact, only the point of view is different. All the positive aspects of Lestat's personality can be also identified in _Interview_, if the reading is deep and careful: he is generous, he cares for Louis and Claudia, he would do anything to conquer Louis' affection. And -most important of all- he forgives Louis and, in the final reel, even Claudia.This is the same Lestat who loves his mother and cares for his friend Nicholas. The same who travels all around the world until he becomes so famous that Louis, finally, can find him and fall into his arms."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"About a third of this book is a retelling of Interview With the Vampire from Lestat's point of view. This series of books has done something that I have not experienced in any other book series - it turned me completely against a character in the first book and then later explained to me his motivations and viewpoint on events. When I finished Interview With the Vampire, I thought Lestat was the biggest asshole that ever walked on the face of the earth, but after having him tell his account of the relationship with Louis as he went along telling his story of how he was made into a vampire by Armand, made me understand why he acted the way he did. By the end, I was cheering for Lestat.The story starts out in the late 1980's and Lestat is a rock star on MTV - everyone in the world thinks it is all an act - like Ozzy Ozbourne - so it is the perfect cover. We flash back to 18th century Paris - Lestat is a young French aristocrat, we then gradually move forward in time as Lestat's story unfolds to modern today. It is a facinating journey."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I've read a couple of Anne Rice novels now, and I think \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" may have to be the last one. Her writing is terribly uneven -- at one point, so dull and pointless that I could barely keep my eyes open, the next moment so gushingly full of hyperbolic excess, I was exhausted at the end of each paragraph. She also has this really irritating habit of delving into the esoteric thoughts of the characters and having them explain their mental meanderings to the reader in a way that is about as entertaining as listening to a co-worker describe her dreams to you every day while you're trying to toil through your inbox.And the phrase \\"the Brat Prince\\" just nauseates me.I've heard that Anne Rice claimed after writing \\"Blood Canticle\\" a couple of years ago (in a reader review here on Amazon, apparently) that she didn't need editing, but I have to wonder about \\"The Vampire Lestat,\\" which was written twenty years ago. Who was editing her then? And were they subsequently fired?I made it three quarters of the way through the thing and then finally just. Gave. Up."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This most wonderful of characters is well defined and excellent in his description. Anne Rice has a real talent for drawing in the reader with not only vivid description but the human and emotional aspects. In this book we learn of Lestat's rich past and mischievous present tales. A complicated character but certainly one that everyone loves to hate. Probably because he represents humanity in all its wonderful and dread realities. A must read for anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book grabbed me and kept me interested the whole time. If you have already read &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot;, I would not hesistate to read this. I stayed up late extra nights because I couldn't put it down. Dn't doubt, me. Read this book!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In the magical of Anne Rice's &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; she makes the reader feel aas if they have found a book of secrets. The novel os about Vampire Lestats enchanting life when he became a vampire. The story takes you to exotic places like France and Egypt. The story starts in modern day New York. As soon as you open the first page you are drawn in to his incredible life. Lestat's mission is to let the world know who he is. He is willing to go against all he's been taught. The cover of the book makes you feel as if Lestat is sharing his adventures while sitting in his own wise chair. One of the lines that captured me was &quot;The feeling of eternity is far to broad for one's mind, what is eternity? What is forever?&quot; This is so true. No one can grasp the meaning of eternity. I would definitly reccomend this book for someone who likes to think beyond their imagination."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Travel though the mytical times with Lestat. Journey though old France and encounter many immortal beings.This book was simply wonderful. Lestat is an enchanting character, with emotions, even though he is a vampire. This book is for anyone who loves history, fiction, mystery, and fantasy all rolled into one. This book is in a series so it won't end here. But before you read this book you should read the first book in the vampire chronicles, Interveiw with the Vampire. This was a great book, but very hard material to read. You can't put this book down. Lestat will keep you on guessing on what he is going to do next. You never know what wiil happen to him or what he will do. Even though this book was fiction , it also had historical facts in it too. This book was great I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is in my opinion, the best of the Vampire Chronicles. This book contains an aspect of mystery, which the others simply do not. This book is interesting from the very beginning, not like other books that don't become exciting until the very end. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I loved this book more than I can explain. Sensuous, enchanting and at times wonderfully erotic, you don't know wether to fall in love with Lestat or to loathe him. One of my favorites of Rice's works to date."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This world of Vampires has captured my soul. Anne Rices talent exceeds description. I have read the entire Vampire series so far and have found a connection to it. To say it has inspired me is an understatement,(I've even begun to write again, a passion i thought i'd lost). The beauty and LIFE decribed in those pages cannot be found else where. Those who hate it, (this is not an insult)but you must not truly get it. The whole Vampire Chronicles continues to become more real and exciting and you read each novel. Anne thank you for this gift and please keep writing."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lestat rules, plain and simple. He's my trickster vampire boy, a true bishonen. He's definetely my kind of guy, tearing around the modern world on a harley while listening to BACH? What can be cooler than that? The decriptions in this book are remarkable as well as the relationship between Louis and Lestat, lovely. Reading this book makes me want to run to Louisiana, to run off to Paris because the decriptions and characters are that beautiful and awesome."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"An amazing account of Lestat's life and travels told beautifully as only Ann Rice can.. The book brings him to life and leaves you desperate for the next story at the end of the book. You'll fall in love with all the characters and refuse to believe it isn't real. Quite inspiring to Fiction lovers everywhere."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is THE book of the vampire chronicles. I read Interview With The Vampire and I thought that it was OK. Then, I read this. WOW! I have subsequently read all of the other chronicles but this remains my favourite. Like her other books, Rice does describes the details but not as much as in The Queen of the Dammed and I love it for that reason. Unbelieveable."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Stylish, sexy, mysterious Lestat finally gets his say in this second &quot;Vampire Chronicles&quot; novel. Impossible that Rice could improve on her classic &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot; but she most definitely does so here. The history of the vampires is partially revealed and Lestat's odyssey into immortality is a must-read for horror and vamp fans alike."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is as amazing, epic, and unique as its predecessor &quot;Interview with the Vampire&quot; and deserves more praise than it gets. I personally like this book more than Book I because it is more unique. It deals with things that are more bizzare (as if Book I wasn't bizarre enough) and I think the narrator is much more interesting (I find Louis kind of annoying). It touches on the earlier, darker days of vampires, something on which I think Anne Rice should have elaborated (instead of writing a book on Marius, she should have written one on Magnus, a much more interesting character of whom we know nothing).This is the best book in the series. It is unique, the characters are intriguing, and it keeps the reader interested. My second favorite book of all time."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Ths is an eye-opener. In the first book of the series(Interview), we see through Louis's eyes. Lestat as an unfeeling and cruel monster feeding off of humans. Not so we find out in the second book here.Lestat sees the book Louis has written about him on the bookshelves and is shocked that his beloved Louis would see him as such a monster and even more stunned that he would dare print such a true account of a vampire's life with names attached. Such a thing is a sure ticket to destruction by the old ones of their kind.Wanting to set the record straight to Louis and us the readers, he has put together an account of his life in his own words. Braving the wrath of the old ones also and willing it to protect Louis.We see him as a mortal living as a marquis's son in pre-revolutionary France. No love from his father and a cool reception from his mother, he takes us through those hard years when he turned 21 and killed a pack of wolves and barely survived. The killing of the wolves set into motion what would happen to him a year later.Going out on his own in Paris to be in the theatre with his best friend Nick, fate steps in. Just a year later Lestat loving life and living his dream, yet scorned by his family is chosen by one of the old ones for the Dark Gift.Loving it at first, soon he realizes he cannot live as a mortal any longer and hatred soon eats at him. He longs to be one of the humans. He misses Nick. He misses his life. He feeds reluctantly at first, only on evildoers and the like, then becomes bored and lonely.Years pass and he becomes lonely and frightened of forever. Nearly 300 years and still he is lonely. Tragedy and heartbreak shape the life of a talented actor, now turned killer.He tells of those days with Louis and Claudia and her deception. His wanderings and run ins with other vampires like Armand, Marius, and Those Who Must be Kept. The oldest of all vampires. The story ends with Lestats fascination with The Queen of the Damned and waking her from her slumber of 4,000 years.He is a marquis's son, an actor, a vampire, a business man, a rockstar in the 1980's and in the end, a lonely soul looking for redemption.Well worth the time reading. Sometimes frightening and sometimes romantic, Lestat brings us a thrill ride through time and space.Tracy Talley~@"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is Anne Rice's excellent sequel/prequel to \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" that weaves the two novels together into one large story (later continued with \\"The Queen of the Damned\\"). It's 1984 and legendary vampire Lestat is a rock star. This book is his \\"autobiography\\"; frightening and mystical, it's a page-turner that houses a collection of moral questions. From the snows of Auvergne to the stage of New Orleans, it's Anne Rice's chilling look at the history of her vampires."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I gave this book 4 stars because there is always room for improvement but it deserves five. Anne Rice expresses a very different vantage point for the life of a vampire. She demonstrates several views on life itself in this book that make a person think in a good way. The book starts before Lestat is a vampire which is a plus as well because you get a chance to watch him transition from human to vampire. Rice describes vampires in a way very different from any other writing I've known. It was very intriguing, a great read."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book begins with Lestat waking up from along time asleep in the ground to the sound of the band called devil's night out and new noises that characterize the mtv era. He decides to take control of the band and become a rock star. He also decides to write an autobiography. Then the book seems to become that autobiography that he wrote.It tells us if his mortal childhood and vampire transformation. His dreams about becoming an actor and the dreams that he will never have . It tells about his erotic journey through life and how he befriended his best friend Nicolas. Magnus the vampire that bestowed the dark gift upon him and leaves him begging longing for answers that only he could tell him. It tells how he saves his mother with an immortal kiss. Lestat's encounter with a vampire coven that causes dilemmas for the vampire but through all the twists and turns of his story he realizes what a vampire truly is and what it takes to be one who thirsts for blood.Wow I cant tell you how much I liked this book. This book made my favorite genre change to horror, vampire books. This tale does show that Anne can be kind of wordy and overly descriptive but hey, it painted a very detail picture in my head. This book made you think. It questioned every moral I can think of. It made me think about my own principles and ethics. Though I like book I can see how people might think it was boring. The book did have its up and downs. At the beginning I had to struggle to keep reading it, but once I got in it a little bit further, I couldn't get away from it. What I thought was a little ironic though was that the first book showed Lestat as a vampire that I had come to hate but in this book I become to love him. The first book made you assume he just was a cruel hearted blood thirsty vampire but when I read this it made me see that he was completely different and had a story all his own"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The follow up to Interview With The Vampire is an excellent piece of work told with Ms. Rice's signature writing style, which is sometimes too pansexual and extravagant to allow a reader to take any of her work as serious pieces of literature art. Sorry, Anne, but you've got a problem there . . . Tone it down!The Vampire Lestat answers some of the questions the first novel posed. I think the underlying theme of the vampire series (which Ms. Rice unfortunately ruins after the third book) is the burning question we all ponder: How did we get here? These vampires question their lineage, and this book brings to light Lestat's knowledge.I especially enjoyed the part of the novel where Lestat makes his mother a vampire. The characters, in general, are much more interesting in this novel than the first, especially Lestat's mother. The first novel, while interesting, is low brow in comparison to this dynamic follow up. Not to take anything away from Interview but this novel is hands down the best in the series. Apparently, Anne Rice must have enjoyed writing the novel as well, since Lestat, not Louis, became her primary vampire creature.I was faithful to the Vampire Chronicles until they became ridiculous. Lestat didn't need to descend into Hell. Lestat didn't need to become human again. What's that got to do with the vampires' heritage? In my opinion, Anne Rice should have stopped the series with three novels. And, of those three, The Vampire Lestat is the one I most recommend!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Interview with the Vampire won't prepare you for this...Anne Rice's semi- follow-up to her first exploration into the world of vampires brings forth characters as real as the people next door. After this many readings of my copy [which is quite literally falling apart as I currently reread it!] I find myself experiencing what seems to be a personal conversation between Lestat and myself instead of simply a story about a character.A great read. You don't need to be a fan of gothic horror-type novels to enjoy this. Pick this one up and you won't be able to put it down until you've devoured it, and gone onto the later courses of Queen of the Damned, Tale of the Body Thief, and Memnoch the Devil, all of which are absolutly addictive."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This one read like a lead up to another book. With exception to the 150 pages of Gabrielle's creation and the 100 pages or so Of marius's story , the book dragged on and on about the past. Take out 300 pages and this would be a good book. This is the second book I've read of the Vampire Chronicles and to me it's No where near the first and I hope the rest are better."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"First of all, know that you'll have things from this book running through your head long after you are done reading it. Lestat's search for love and acceptance in a world of night is beautiful and wonderfully metaphorical. Marius and the great secrets he holds, but also the millenium of sadness and loneliness he feels is a wonderful add in. It's as though he and Lestat are two kindred souls. If you have read Interview With The Vampire, this is a must read. The great fiend he seemed in that book shines through in this one, but also explains why he is that way and that he isn't really quite so evil. Even if this is your first delving into the Vampire Chronicles, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice has really out done herself in all her vampire novels. She brings life and beauty to blend and balance with her characters making them charming and realistic. In The Vampire Lestat we have a deep insight of our favorite fiend and how he came to become the blood-draining vampire he is. The book is marvelously detailed as all her other novels and very enchanting. It is a long book, but because I myself love vampires, and had just started to go deep into my passion for the demonic and fiendish creatures this was a complete treat for me. The book and story itself made me long to finish it and go onto another story. I read through the book as if nothing could tire me and I ended up reading from 8 am till the next morning without even getting tired. I finished the book that afternoon, and went right to the nearest bookstore to buy her other vampire novels. I also read the book again about three more times after that and have recently read it again, and decided to write this review. Anne Rice has made me long to read more, and her stories and tales fascinate me...the books are amazing and no review or movie could explain the stories the way the books do."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is THE best book I have ever read. Don't ask me why; I cant tell you; discription was never my strong point. Very much Anne Rice's, apparently. After finishing _Interveiw_, I ahd thought Lestat was a total jerk. Then I read _Lestat_... and I *still* thought he was a total jerk, but I thought he was a *kewl* total jerk. And this book didn't scare me as much as the others in the series did... was *anyone* else scared half to death by _Queen of the Damned_, or was it just me? But, anyway, it was just so... oh, I don't know, so AMAZING. And on top of that, just this one book says, 'Savage Garden' (the best band ever!) 13 times.... *grin* Yeah, Lestat's a total jerk... but I think I've fallen for him."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"What can I say? This was a great book. I admit I did have to force myself the first few chapters but then I really got into it. I loved how she gave Lestat a personality...in Interview with the Vampire we don't see that...we only see a ravenous monster who thinks only of himself... (which I guess is something he does in this novel as well...but we actually get to see who he is) ...she goes indepth into his psyche and shows us what he is really like. Reading Interview is not necessary to enjoy this book...there is no confusion. Although reading the conclusion to this book (Queen of the Damned) is definately a must. I'd recommend thi to everyone. Good work Anne!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I saw the movie first, two days later I bought the book, a week later I bought the other three Vampire Chronicles. The Vampire Lestat is now my all time favorite book. It has been on the shelf for three years now, it may be time to read it again. What a beautiful enticing masterpiece. What a character! When I saw Lestat on the big screen (my compliments to Tom Cruise, he doesn't excite me at all in other movies, but in this movie he played a very convincing Lestat) I knew I wanted more. First IWTV, main character poor suffering Louis. Then the others, all featuring Lestat. I've never been in love with a fictional character before, but Lestat certainly caught my fancy. Delicious how he plays with the other characters, how we get to know his arrogance, sexuality, sensuality, intelligence and beauty. The best part is that he thrills men and women alike. My compliments to Anne Rice, for creating such a bi-sensual novel, I've read a lot of books, but never have I encountered a book that so fits my needs, grasping me, making me wish to be part of that world (though certainly not a vampire, rather a part of the talamasca)! Please more, feed my brains, this is the best of fantacy, horror, thriller, comedy, drama, and romance, all put into one genre, that of Anne Rice!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an incredible account of a powerful creature. Anne rice paints the readers a very clear picture of how Lestat became Lestat. After reading the history of one of the most profound vampires in history the reader leaves with a very clear understanding of Lestat as he was as a man and how he was IS as a vampire. Rice presents her audience with not only impressive literary structure but a compelling read that keeps readers in anticipation of what the next page has in store. READ THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone, even if you didn't like Interview with the Vampire. The new characters Anne Rice introduces are fascinating:Nicholas,Gabrielle,Marius. I loved the historical descriptions of Lestat's mortal life and his life as an actor in Paris. Ms. Rice has also further developed Armand from IWTV in this novel. And of course, the Louis/Lestat reunion at the end made me &quot;weep&quot;, as Lestat would say."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"i coudn't keep my eyes off this book. definetley the best of anne rice's books. the story is perfectly thought out and very compelling. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is the best book in the WORLD... There is no other book that has given me the any feeling as the Vampire Lestat has. To all out there that say that the book is not good, because it is boring. Read the whole book and then think about what you read and then and only then make a judgement on the novel. Anne Rice has written other novels to go along with the Vampire Lestat and they by no means have to be read also. To all out there, LONG LIVE LESTAT!!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Only Anne Rice could write a book as great and horrifyingly written as it was. It has a perfect storyline and it always makes perfect sense. The book [story] seems so real that it seems people actually live it! In my personal opinion, I would not mind being one of the characters or to have my life created in her book with the way Anne Rice places beauty and brilliance in her wonderful [almost realistic] characters inside of her book. It is too magical and perfect!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I could not put this book down. I loved the first one and would give it my highest rating, but this one was FAR better. After finishing it I could almost see blood dripping from the book. Not just that death was everywhere but all of her descriptions seemed to involve death and blood."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"First of all, know that you'll have things from this book running through your head long after you are done reading it.

'Is Anne Rice secretly a vampire?'"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Once upon a time author Anne Rice showed us some formidable talent with her &quot;Interview With A Vampire&quot; and the &quot;Vampire Lestat,&quot; her first two vampire novels. One could tell that she'd taken her time to craft two exceptional novels with beautiful prose that took you into her lush, homoerotic vampire worlds. Her later vampire novels lack these qualities. In &quot;Vampire Lestat,&quot; she takes a supporting character she created in &quot;Interview,&quot; Lestat, who you disliked, and consistently divides your opinion about just how evil Lestat is. In telling Lestat's story, she renders a very complex character, who continually draws you into him, much the way he does his victims! Lestat's entire history unfolds from when he was made a vampire, to making his mother a vampire, and to encountering the ancients of the vampire world. In the modern day, Lestat has become a rock singer who, of course, performs at night since he cannot survive the light of day. The novel shifts time periods frequently from this rock star present day Lestat to his origins and development as a vampire over the centuries, with all eras having their own fascination."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"If you liked interview with the vampire, you'll definitley like this book. It tells the story of Lestat's life which was never told in Interview. It also finally gives an origin of the dark gift. one thing that seems wrong though is that in Interview, Lestat was a bad guy, yet in this book he is a good guy. He says that Louis didn't notice that he only killed criminals, not innocent people as he said. Lestat also make Armand seem to be evil. Be prepared for a change of point-of-view in the book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is one of my favorite books of the series. Lestat embraces immortality and the night with the abbandon that we all wish. he has the courage to live the life of our dreams! No one will read this and not dream of becoming one of the night dwellers. Lestat makes it all look fun and like the adventure of a lifetime!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is a book that I've read over and over again. Rice develops the character Lestat that was introduced in Interview with the Vampire, and I'm so glad that she did! In Interview, we see Louis' view of Lestat, one that we discover was colored by his limited information on Lestat's past. This book gives us the Vampire history that us Anne Rice fans were longing for. It is not only the making of Lestat, it is the making of the Vampires as told to Lestat by Marius and Armand. Beautifully lush, sensual and compelling, this is a must read and a keeper for all true Anne Rice fans. Enjoy."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After I read &quot;Interview&quot; I thought that Lestat was a completely horrible personaity in the tracking of the vampires. However, after completing &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; I had an entirely different opinion of him. In this installment, the reader learns more about the blonde French devil's mortal life, and his recieving the &quot;Dark Blood&quot;, as well as his beginning adventures in the world of the immortal. My understanding of Lestat was deeply changed by this novel, making him my favorite vampire of the pack. His past experiences greatly explain his terrible actions in the first volume. A very good read! :) Tied as my favorite installment with &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After reading Interview with the Vampire, I could not wait to get to the second book in the series. It was better than I had hoped for.Of course I felt no sympathy for Lestat in the first book. I felt he got what he deserved. He was a very selfish and childish person in the first book. But when you read this story you realize there is more to him than meets the eye. (He still got what he deserved). But in this book he confesses his deep love Louis and even love for Claudia even after she lashed his throat ( I'll put you in your coffin father, forever).There is no doubt that you will feel a great deal of sympathy for Lestat in this book, but make no mistake he is still selfish, greedy and childish as you will see with future books. He complains that Louis described him vividly but poorly, but nothing could be further from the truth. He is all that Louis decribed and more. But you still can not help but love him. Read and enjoy. I garauntee you will want to continue the series."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Vampire Lestat is a fabulous book, which I've read 3 or 4 times. It's a book that you can't put down until you've finished it and when you do finish it, you want to read the next of the chronicles... The queen of the damned, the third of the series, id a very nice book too, I highly recomend it, but after that they keep getting worse and worse... But the first three books are absolutely great, don't miss them."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have read a good proportion of Anne Rice books including all of the Vampire Chronicles and Pandora. Pandora was also a great book though short in comparison to Rice's The Vampire Lestat. This was my favorite in the series if only a little slow to get into. I must say that the concert scene was the best and so believable that you could picture it completly. Soemtimes what I wouldn't give to have that happen in real life. I'm not going to spoil it for you but let me tell you that if you read this book first, which I did, you get very protective of Lestat and you grow to love him. In Interview with the Vampire I sincerly thought Louis was the biggest whiner I've ever listened to...Or maybe I just prefer &quot;bad boys&quot; to those with morals about the sanctity of life. (Read: Jean-Claude vs. Richard Zeeman in the Anit Blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton) I overall highly, highly, highly recommend this book if you're going to read any of Anne Rice's novels, except maybe Violin-it was a little compilcated for me, and it was by far the best in the Vampire Chronicles and beats Taltos by a nose overall her books."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Although I enjoyed Interview with the Vampire, I had to struggle through some parts; not so with The Vampire Lestat. There's never a dull moment when Lestat's around, and the lush narrative of his bizarre past and the equally amazing tales of his fellow undead make this one a page-turner. I did think the rock star stuff was a bit cheesy, but the historical passages (the bulk of the book) more than make up for it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; was, by far, the most enticing of all of the Chronicles. It will, without a doubt, leave you looking desperately into the sky everynight and praying that Lestat will come and give you the dark gift. In Interview, I was left longing for my Louis. Now I'm am left longing for my brat prince. It makes you wish there were only an endless supply of Chronicle books. They should, without a doubt again, make all of the Chronicles into movies. Tom Cruise was great as Lestat. Brad Pitt was heavenly as Louis. Akasha could be played by Glen Close. That, no Lestat fan could ever miss and forgive his or her self. Come on movie people. MAKE IT HAPPEN. As for Lestat... You are the damndest creature. I'll be waiting!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is my personal fav out of all the chronicles. Even though I'm on Memnoch The Devil right now, nothing can beat this book! I love how Anne Rice told the history of all the vampires, it makes you really question if there are vampires. Lestat tells us his story, and it makes me question why he had never told Louis all of this? Louis wanted to know how everything started and all along Lestat knew! I also love Armand from Interview and I loved how they put his story, along with Marius in here. It took me awhile to read, but that's because I can be a slow reader. This book really got me hooked and I wanted to read the rest, which I did. I finished the nest two in 2 months, and am almost done with the last one. I cannot wait till Pandora, and Armand come out on the bookshelfs. If you want to know more about those books, email me, or check Anne Rice's webpages. Anyhow, this book thrilled me and I loved it! The end just makes you want to read the next one, and I did. I completely recommend this book to EVERYONE"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"FROM THE SOB STORY OF LOUIS TO THE THRILLING AFTERLIFE OF LESTAT, ANNE RICE HAS COME FAR.

His ulterior motive is to get other vampires from around the world together, as they invariably will at such an outright violation of their secrecy, and then--who knows what? Will they accept him? Kill him? Or maybe, and a pretty exciting prospect at that to Lestat, mankind will believe him and the existence of his kind and wage open war on the undead!The night of the his big, debut rock concert comes, and the feeling he gets is that something big is going to happen. He couldn't have been more right. He also didn't expect THIS to happen. What happened? Read the book, my friend...and it's cliffhanger ending will leave you wanting to read the mind blowing, myth-shattering conclusion, Queen of the Damned.Anne Rice to me communicates brilliantly in this novel! In many scenes I felt the subtle insanity that indoubtedly plagues vampires worse than sunlight. I don't know if this was intentional on Rice's part or not, but there was definitely a common thread of madness woven into this tale that seemed to jump out at me more than anything else; the madness of one unwillingly plunged into a world of physical immortality. I have never read an author that could get that across as effectively as she did. There was one scene where Lestat was &quot;charmed&quot; by Armand that she executed perfectly. When one is charmed or hypnotized, they do not know what is happening. Once they do, the spell is instantly broken. She did this scene so well that I didn't know what was happening! I felt myself drifting from reality into a sort of dreamy confusion, no longer in touch with what was real...until the spell was broken! I was literally spellbound by this! I still don't know how she did it, but she did. This was just one example of sheer mastery of the written word as communication of ideas.Humor was well done; not too much as to make the novel a farce, but enough to give you a good laugh once in a while. (For example: the scene in the church when Lestat and Gabriel jumped out wailing in the middle of Mass! I was on the floor!)This book is great!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have always been a huge fan of the hypnotic world of vampires. Ever since I saw the move version of &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;, I have been a great admirer of Anne Rice's work. I first read &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; two years ago, and I have since read it twice more. I feel it is an extraordinary work of art that should be embraced by all fans of great horror novels.The story is the exact opposite of that told in &quot;Interview&quot;. This is Lestat's side of the story, the untold portion of what Louis described of his maker in the first novel. We learn who Lestat is, and what has made him the way that he is. We witness his unwilling birth as a vampire, and the insanity his &quot;dark gift&quot; brings upon his beloved friend, Nicolas. We see how he came to love Louis, and his child-vampire companion, Claudia. We watch him as he saves his own mother from her deathbed with his immortal kiss.We feel his love, his joy, his sorrow, his pain. The reader almost begins to believe that Lestat is a real person and not just a fictional character. That is the magic Anne Rice weaves with her poetic words of what torture and extacy it is to be eternally damned.Anyone who craves a good, dramatic, yet horrific, story should definitely read this book. Let yourselves be taken in by the dark, passionate world Anne Rice has created with her creatures of the night. And may you wake safely in the morning."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book covers the life and loves of the vampireLestat.

As I remember it, here is what transpires during this long saga, the second book in a trilogy:A young Frenchman, Lestat, the son of a provincial lord, finds himself one day surrounded in the woods by a pack of wolves, and kills them all. Soon thereafter, he and another disenchanted young provincial lord named Nicholas (Nicky) take off for Paris.In Paris, they both join a theater group, where Lestat is first merely a stagehand but works his way into a star performer. Nicky, meanwhile, plays the violin. Lestat and Nicky adore each other.Lestat then runs into an old vampire named Martus, who apparently has decided to \\"give up the ghost,\\" although he could live forever if he so desired. He gives Lestat a few pointers about living the good life, vampire style, gives him a blood transfusion, and then immolates himself.Now Lestat is a vampire, but he still wants to maintain his mortal ties, especially with Nicky, his boyfriend, and his mother, Gabrielle, who is dying. Well, just before she dies, Gabrielle meets Lestat again and he gives her a blood transfusion, so that she, too, can live forever.Now, instead of being his mother, although he still sometimes calls her \\"Mother,\\" Gabrielle is more like Lestat's \\"crime partner,\\" although not really his girlfriend.However, she is the closest Lestat will get to having a girlfriend, until, that is, he meets the real Mother of all Mothers, the Egyptian goddess, Akasha.Unfortunately for Lestat, Akasha already has a man of her own, her Egyptian god partner, Enkil, and he's jealous and powerful.However, that comes later.Okay, so now Lestat and Gabrielle are approached by a wayward vampire by the name of Armand, who is the de facto leader of a \\"coven\\" of several other vampires.Armand has kicked around the underworld a little more than Lestat. He teaches Lestat some things about said underworld. Yet, for some reason, Armand is not \\"hip\\" to passing as a human. Lestat suggests that he try it, passing as a mortal in the mortal world, and signs over the Vampire Theater (in Paris) to him.Nicky, meanwhile, is always on Lestat's mind, and Lestat finally manages to convert Nicky into a vampire.Unfortunately, for Lestat, Nicky has his own ideas about what vampire life should be like. Instead of going along with Lestat's ideas, he rebels against his \\"maker\\" and returns to the Theater. Nicky keeps having problems, however, and then gets burned up (I think).Meanwhile, Lestat and Gabrielle are feeding their way through Eastern Europe, Italy (she's of Italian descent), and finally Egypt.Lestat gets the notion (from Armand, I think), that he should call out for and write out (like graffiti) pleas to see Marius, a honcho vampire who knows about \\"Those Who Must be Kept.\\" \\"Those Who Must be Kept\\" turn out to be none other than Akasha and Enkil.Now, we are past the half-way point in the book. Marius does finally show himself to Lestat. He sits the younger vampire down and tells him the whole story of how he came to be the keeper of the old-school vampires, Akasha and Enkil, the Mother and Father of them all and how those two started out as innocent do-gooder gods, and ended up as underworld gods with a definite evil streak.Marius seems like a reasonably humanitarian vampire (an oxymoron?). He seems knowledgeable and charitable in his dealings with mortals and with other vampires. Marius really has been around the block, when it comes to the vampire world, and he finally tells Lestat that the younger vampire must take off and go to New Orleans, where Lestat's father has retired after the French Revolution.Lestat does go to New Orleans, and this, apparently, is the basic stomping ground for the first novel in this trilogy (Interview with the Vampire), which I did not read.Toward the end of this book, the two books, Lestat and Interview, are somewhat linked, when Lestat gives a rough synopsis of the story in Interview, his own fate in that book, and of his \\"making\\" Louis and a child vampire, Claudia.Now, at the end of Lestat's book, his autobiography told entirely in the first person, readers find themselves, along with Lestat, in the mid-twentieth century.By 1984, Lestat has become a rock star in a band with a vampire theme and three mortal band members.Louis reappears at this point and accompanies him to a rock concert in San Francisco, where a huge and raucous crowd of over 15,000 young people scream for the vampires to drink their blood.Of course, his mortal worshipers in the concert crowd do not suspect that Lestat, the band's lead singer, is a real vampire. They think he's another version of Alice Cooper, or someone similar.Now, the denouement to this whole long, drawn out story finally comes, when other, younger vampires, apparently jealous of Lestat's success in the mortal world, attempt to ambush him at the end of the rock concert. Instead, Gabrielle and Akasha (perhaps) come to his aid and save him. Marius never reappears, but Lestat thinks Marius is part of this salvation also.Soon thereafter, he falls asleep in his underground crypt, just as an eerie, marble-like white hand grips his. Whose hand is this? Read the sequel and maybe you will find out.That is the whole story. Do you get it now?It took Anne Rice 500 pages to tell readers all this. I know she is popular among, I think, mostly younger readers, so more power to her. I know she has now written her latest book about a young Christ in Egypt, and I would like to read that, maybe.However, I think, for the effort I put into this book, several weeks of intermittent reading, the investment in time and energy did not return that much enjoyment or new knowledge, for me.I was impressed with Ms. Rice's knowledge of mythology, but otherwise, this was a largely dry, boring book. It certainly was not frightening or emotion arousing, at least not for me.Diximus"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is the book where Anne turns from brilliant writer to mournful historian bored with her subject.This book is definitely worth the read. But dont expect more than overly wordy pulp fiction. Whereas interview was brilliant as are some of her other books this surely had to be one of those publishers fantasies come true. After all who didnt want to learn more about the exciting, evil, brilliant, foolish, kind, brutal Lestat?But Anne jumps the shark. With rockets. In this book anne hypersexualises Lestat while beating you over the head with the homosexual subtexts she so loves. And homosexual subtexts for physically nonsexual beings (read Interview) nontheless. But then she turns him into a superhero straight out of a marvel comic book. Evil vampires comign to get you? Why turn them to flame with your mind! Past history not exciting enough? Why turn him from a slightly old vampire into an \\"ancient\\" with super duper wonder ancientblood! Not enough of the backstory explained? Why somehow make lestat intricately important in it.. despite his not existing at the time.This book was a crime.

Leading into the night when he departed human existence and became a living dead. Lestat was the vampire that introduced him to the dark side. Being who Louis was he couldn't come to kill living people, trying to live he stayed alive on rats in the allies, and cocks on the plantation. Finding a young girl, Claudia. He tells how she turned into a vampire. As years went on her intelligence and passion is trapped in a child's body. Meeting Armand who bring's them into a vampire society. The story is danger and flight, loyalty and betrayal.Author Bio: Born in New Orleans, October 4th 1941. Anne Rice was the second of four daughters. Anne's real name was Howard Allen O'brien. Her mother passed away at age fourteen in 1956. She married to Stan Rice in 1961 on October 14th. Earning her bachelors degree in 1964 along with her BA in political Science, and Creative Writing in 1965. Anne published her first short story in transfer call \\"October 4, 1948.\\" 1973 Anne turned the Interview with the Vampire into a novel in a five week period. Anne wrote twenty five novels and four short story's.Evaluation: Interview with the Vampire is about a man named Louis who lives a horrible life. He is given the chance by another vampire by the name of Lestat to depart from all he knows and change over to a life of mysterious and Murder. Changing over made him seem as if he was a newborn infant, seeing the world as no man has ever seen it before. Lestat at his side to guide him and teach him what to do and what not to do. Being the kind person that Louis is he couldn't bring him self to drain the life out of the living. Knowing he has to survive he instead feeds on rats in allies and chickens on farms. Desiring the taste of young and innocent blood he comes across a young girl. Draining her right up to the point of death, he leaves her. Ashamed of what he did he throws the body on the bed and runs for hiding. Lestat followed the trail of dead rats he finds Louis. Brings him back to the little girl, Louis thinks that he killed her. Lestat reassures him that she in fact isn't dead. Lesate changes the little girl named Claudia into a vampire. Louis and Lestat guide Claudia trying to make her into a mature vampire, they take the role of fathers to her. Working side by side Claudia and Louis kill off hole family's, just for fun. They'd kill for fun, not for hungry. Years later Claudia's figured out that her intelligence and passion was trapped in side the body of one of a little girl forever. Claudia had told Louis about a plan she had to execute Lestat, and to free them from him forever. The plan slowly carried out. Claudia waked to Lestat asking for a truces, and offering him a present to make her word honest. Two blonde little boys, young blood. He agrees, finds the little boys and starts to drain the blood out of there body's. Vampires aren't supposed to drink the blood of the dead. Lestat drank the blood and slowly fell on the floor gasping for air, he was dying because of dead blood. The planned work or so they think. Claudia and Louis traveled around the world trying to find where they belong. Stumbling upon a vampire society in the theater called the Theatre des Vampires. The leader of this association went by the name Armand. The society didn't like the idea of a child vampire, that it could expose them. Lestat came back into the picture wanting to get revenge on the little girl and his old companion. Claudia could sence that Louis wanted to go separate way so she went out and found a women named Madeleine to take care of her. Madeleine agreed to be changed into a vampire so that her age wouldn't change and that she would always be around to tend to Claudia. Louis didn't like the idea of it, thinking about it he finally agreed. After she changed over the society captured the three and split them up. Madeleine and Claudia had a painful death in for them. Louis was to be put in a coffin for eternity. Armand found out about and freed Louis but it was so late for the girls. Wanting revenge he soaked the theater, the coffins in gas, ignited it and killed everyone who had to do with Claudia's death. Years later he was still friends with Armand, he visited Lestat and said goodbye forever. The boy recording didn't believe that that was the ending. Louis disappeared never to be hear from again.I loved the book. I have never enjoyed a book that was mandatory to read as much as I did this. I love the mystery, the murder, the wonder. I never wanted to put the book down. I love the way she Made you fall in love with the vampire's and see things how they saw them."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"As a long-time lover of Ms. Rice's vampire chronicals, and a fan of Michael York, I ordered this audio book with confidence. Don't you make the same mistake. Mr. York's performance is hectic, hysterical and strained, and the &quot;editing&quot; of this abridged version is criminal. The tale becomes nearly incoherent in this treatment, and Mr. York deserves to be thrown into the Louisiana bayou for his part in it. Three thumbs down. All the way down."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The story The Vampire Lestat is not a contradiction but an explaination of Interview with The Vampire.It wasn't changed at all really. Try reading the Interview with the vampire Epilogue in The Vampire Lestat. It all still is the same story, you're just seeing it from a different prespective. As for the part Lestat calls a 'lie.' Which is really just the final meeting with Louis at the end, I think Lestat's lying.He gave away that he's the one lying. Louis can't read thoughts. He'd have never known where Lestat was or what condition he as in if he hadn't gone to him, himself. Who was more likely to lie, Lestat or Louis?The fact that it switched angles so drastically and one said the other lied about certain things made it more realistic, made them more like real people.How would two real people react to that sort of story? One's been painted as a bad guy and the other a martyr. They go on 20/20 and what will you get? Contradictions. But it's still the same story. All that changed was the perspective. Also it filled in the gaps on the things Louis did not know- like how Armand knew Lestat, where the theatre des vampires came from, ect...The story wasn't changed, you just learned why Lestat picked the victims the way he did, who his victims really were- which Louis could never have known. The only contradiction is a realistic portrayal of a character being too humiliated to having begged the other to stay with him. If they told the same exact story it wouldn't have seemed real at all. If you have two people view a situation perspective will change what the situation was. Each set of eyes has a different concept of reality, that's the nature of being an individual. It would have been wholely unrealistic for them to share the same exact story. And it was still the same story, just different angles.Now The Vampire Armand, THAT was a contradiction, not only did Armnad contradict what Marius said about his making but he contradicted his own story that he told Lestat in The Vampire Lestat novel.I see several messages or ideas reflected in The Vampire Lestat. It's a very human story with a lot of angst without too much in the way of heavy emotion. There's the common and very obvious idea that our very up-bringing effects us and our actions and feelings later on in life.It also speaks of questioning and the very human search for answers (which is utterly denied in Blood Canticle). As I said, it's a very human story. It also reveals that everyone has a story. It shows you that the worst villains you see or judge at first glance from a bias perspective could have a side of things or a story to tell- a side of things or a point of view than the one you already have been given.It makes for a very forgiving story to tell you that everyone has their own side of things, nothing is quite how it appears on the surface. The story's under-tone contradicts Lestat's very superficial obsession with the aesthetic to the way it tells that there is more to things than the darkness of the surface, or the charm on the surface. Things beautiful can be made ugly and things horrible can be made forgivable once you look through someone else's eyes, as you do at least three times in this book.There's also the idea that perhaps the story tells you the possible rewards or consequences of acting on impulse. Almost all of Lestat's adventures and activities are the result of impulse. And sometimes he only survives by dumb luck. Sometimes it has it's rewards- such as his finding Marius, and sometimes it has it's tragedy- such as his making Claudia. Impulsiveness, to seize the day and take chances can have very positive or negative results but either way it gives you an adventure and this book tells you this very clearly.The story also goes into the intelligent idea that seeking answers does not mean the confirmation of any preconceived notion or the security of an illusion. It tells you that if you really want to know answers sometimes you have to forsake your old conceptions of reality or religion and perhaps the answer may be utterly different from what you expect or there could be none at all. But the important thing is to be open minded and prepared for anything and never seek out what you do not know or understand unless you're prepared to find something utterly different from the familiar.The mortal part of story, the part where Lestat's human, also tells how you should never give up, always persevere. It shows that if you struggle hard enough you can overcome adversity or an abusive family and still live your life as you wish. You should never give up on your dreams as Lestat dreamt of Paris with Nicki. And that happiness is not always wealth or the conventional idea of a proper lifestyle. That your happiness is doing whatever you view to be good and following through with your dreams and never give up on them.He wanted adventure and freedom and he he got it- ultimately.Lestat also seems to be forever, not just be on a quest for answers- which is obvious, but also on a quest for a parental figure that will not abandon him. We already know his father and brothers abused and oppressed him and his mother was not all that affectionate. Magnus abandoned him. And so he made his mother a vampire to save her life, and she abandons him too. Armand was older but certainly not wiser so he failed him from the start and Lestat could never love him. Lestat seeks Marius. And Marius eventually tells him he must leave the island, Lestat's abandoned again. Lestat tries to rouse the mother of all vampires but she's hopelessly deranged. As a result Lestat's forced to struggle through eternity being both student and teacher, parent and child, an orphan seeking a family but not a master or slave as Armand seeks.The book also reveals the progress of humanity's conception of goodness and it's increase of value in general from a very optimistic angle (unlike Blood Canticle). It implies to me that goodness has evolved from a code of conduct that has to be enforced with the fear of punishment and the promise of reward but into something strange, secular, yet innocent... A generalistic morality and a concept of goodness that isn't so much individualistic as it had been. A sort of social compassion that wishes not only to prevent suffering but to aide in it's elimination. By this I mean goodness in the world has evolved into a new form of goodness for the sake of goodness, a goodness that can exist without fear of punishment or want of reward, a true innocence. A goodness just for the sake of good and not out of fear punishment or want of reward- goodness returning to it's natural state, the innate moraltiy from the backbone of all concepts of good and evil- creation and destruction. Real goodness, without having to be enforced by threats or promises. A very possitive view of how society works in this modern age, viewing it as somethign new, good, and decent- a true age of innocence as Lestat puts it in song.There are a few symbols in the book such as The Devil's Road, which is the journey of a vampire for answers and a reason to survive but it also could mean an unavoidable disaster, a certainty that it'll end with Hell.The Savage Garden has a layer of meaning because you imagine it as a savage jungle of chaos where only the aesthetic principles matter but you see it's not called a savage waste land or savage jungle. There's an order to it or it would not be a garden. A garden implies the possibility of order- a possible gardener or gardeners. And it can look beautiful, or savage, or harsh but there may be a balance to things- an order.There's also the old Queen under Les Innocents. She advises Lestat and starts him on his journey and in that book the journey ends with another queen. There are little premonitions of Lestat's own future. Such as the threat that Nicki's hands might be broken by his father and then they were taken away by Armand. Perhaps it's to question if or not there is a destiny- a predetermined fate. The question is raised in the book. But I doubt Lestat could believe in that for very long. His free will is far too important to him. He'd rebel against it, he'd refuse to accept it. He'd deny it even if there is a destiny because he won't let anyone or anything be his master.Lestat always secretly ached for goodness, not evil justified for the sake of good. He said if a war broke out between vampires and mortals he would have fought for the sake of humanity. It was the innocence he valued, not justifying evil. He'll tell you this in the first chapter of The vampire Lestat. That evil has no place or value, that good does not need evil. He does not justify it. He views himself as evil because he's a vampire and because he takes lives- for Armand evil is something, somehow, even more sinister than that.Armand is painfully simple. And I don't mean the child-like innocent simplicity of Khayman. There's a difference in being childlike and innocent and the simplicity in the concept of pure evil and depthlessness, and that's Armand.Armand believed that in serving The Devil with his Satanic coven he was serving God because God created The Devil. Evil for the sake of goodness is just plain stupidity. And for the record this is not what Lestat did. Some people think it is but it's not. He wasn't evil for the sake of serving the devil. He was the image of evil in order to warn humanity about the evil that secretly walked among them. He wanted to be good. And when the war started against good and evil he tells us he'd have fought on the side of goodness. The only problem is he didn't account for how this would hurt those he loves. That's a huge difference from being a 'minion of Satan.'It's not the same paradox at all. Armand wanted to serve Satan because God created Satan, and so because God created Satan he thought he was serving God through Satan.I don't know how anyone could view it as the same thing. Anne Rice goes into an elaborate explanation for Lestat's agenda in The vampire Lestat. He wasn't evil because Good needs Evil. Lestat never believed that. Armand did. Lestat doesn't think evil should exist.Lestat tried to be good as a rock star. He even tried to pose as a Good man when he first became a vampire. He wanted to protect those he loved (including Nicki) from the evil he was. This infuriated Nicki later on, that even as a vampire, Lestat always tried to be a good man.Also, Lestat values goodness and inncoence, that's why he won't kill innocence. He doesn't kill evil doers in some misguided notion that he's doing good. Lestat feeds on evil doers because they're like himself. Lestat views the taking of any life as evil, that's why he sees himself as evil. But he will not kill good. It's not that he kills evil doers and pretends this is good, it's that he won't kill those he views as good because he values it, he thinks the world needs them. And he respects them. He doesn't think he's doing right, that he can save his soul by only feeding on evil. He just preseves that which has value to him, that's all. He just won't kill what he likes and respects and he likes and respects goodness.Also, Armand threw Lestat off the tower roof because Lestat had ruined his coven under Les Innocents. Well, Lestat had SAVED his life in ruining that coven. Paris was dismantling Les Innocents, shoving the bodies into the catacombs and paving over the land. What did Armand think the Parisians would do to their coven? They were on the brink of being un-Earthed in the day time, and potentially destroyed by people who didn't even know what the Hell they were uncovering. If Lestat hadn't come along Armand would have died very, very easily. But he takes revenge for Lestat doing this?Also there's the red velvet cloak that Lestat had, red velvet seems to be the fabric interpretation of blood. He wore a cloak of wolf fur and blood-velvet! Now that seems like an explicit metaphor if you ask me! The majority of serious events in Lestat's life happened in winter or late Autumn. Perhaps the darkest and coldest moments for us are the most meaningful?And of course there are the little rock song titles thrown in like Hell's bells, ect...The story was also about love. Lestat's love for Nicki, and Lestat's love for Gabrielle, and Lestat's love for Marius, and Lestat's love for his band and his audience, and of Akasha. And of course... Louis.I feel that Lestat loves Louis. That seemed obvious to me.In Interview with the Vampire the movie they made it very clear what Lestat felt for Louis. At risk to his own life Lestat returned to the plantation to pull him from the fire. He made Claudia as a foolish experiment, out of loneliness and as insurance to keep Louis- whim he was desperate to keep. And when Claudia had poisoned him, it was Louis that Lestat called out to for help, believing he would help him. And when Louis saw him at the end at the final confrontation Lestat asks him 'Have you come home to me then?' And he gives him this most desperate and pleading expression.I think Lestat always loved Louis. That's why he could forgive him for the story he told in Interview with The vampire and why he could forgive him again when he refused to help him and turned his back on him in Tale of the Body thief.Lestat always loved Louis. Now here's how I analyze it. The way Lestat grew up, his father and brothers abused him. And the only family member that showed him any affection at all was his own mildly autistic mother who shied away from human contact and the verbal expression of love as well as physical intimacy. Lestat was never taught how to express love for what it really was. He could express passion, want, need, desire, lust, and seduction but actual love- he did not know how to properly express. And so for the one he loved the most it would be hardest for him to express it. But they say actions speak louder than words.He also loved Louis because Louis didn't come easy for him the way most other things did. The way it's portrayed in the movie is this...Lestat: 'No one could refuse me.'Louis: 'I tried.'Lestat: 'Yes, you tried. And the more you tried. The more I wanted you.'Lestat might have mildly confused love with possession, but not on as great a scale as Armand could. I think this was actually a direct result of exposure to Armand and Armand's concept of Love. He went from a cold and barely readable love from only his mother, the passion of Nicki- which was misleading to his mortal mind, and then to Armand's idea of love which was a confused idea of domination and possession, of being dominated or of dominating, of being possessed, or possessing. Lestat was experimenting with his own under-developed sense of what it meant to love and be loved. He loved Louis and naturally thought that in spite of everything Louis must feel the same way deep down in side, which is why he expected more from Louis when Claudia attacked him. But he was always ready to forgive Louis. Now that is unconditional love right there!Lestat forgave him for setting fire to him, he forgave him for the story he told, he forgave him for refusing to help him when he most needed it in the mortal body in Tale of the body thief. He risked his own beauty to save Louis, after he slipped into that coma-like sleep, when he was supposedly enslaved by angels or angel-like beings (Blackwood Farm) he only came back because Louis attempted suicide. These beings tortured him, enslaved him, and threatened to take away his eye- to mar his phyiscal beauty, which seemed to be most precious to him. And he risked that because Louis meant to kill himself. (Merrick). He's always been protective of Louis. And in spite of Louis's mortalness he's always seen him as the stronger of the two because Louis could pass through time without being harmed by it. Louis had, what Lestat viewed as, a resilient soul. And he loved him for it. To him Louis was the essence of all beauty and Louis's denial of him made him all the more desirable to him. Absence makes the heart grow fonder.When Lestat became a rock star he wanted to do it as quickly as possible to get the attention off of Louis, who had broken the rules by telling the story, and shine it on to himself. You know. Give them a bigger fish to fry. He wanted to protect Louis. And I thought their reunion in The Vampire Lestat (especially the graphic novel version) was endearing.Not to mention that passionate kiss they shared before the rock concert.Now it seems like they're on and off lovers. Returning to one and other whenever loneliness takes hold, and parting again like the tide, only to return again. Constants for each other in an inconstant world of perpetual change, on through eternity- they have each other to love, to hold, and to cherish.I love this book with all my heart and let me just say I am really looking forward to the new Broadway musical by Sir Elton John.Edit: Be warned, the audio book narrated by Michael York is missing the entire climax of the story. It's badly edited (unlike the rest of the series).

It is filled with so much passion, and emotion. Every page is glowing with words. Simply a remarkable novel. Anne Rice takes on the world of vampires with full force, not just blood and evilness but a world with love and sorrow. Lestat is a remarkable characture. Anne Rice's novel &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; will live on through the Generations."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I must say I haven't read this book. However, I flipped through it and was so bored by what I read that I put it right back on the shelf. The first book was much better. Lestat is far, far overrated, and has a very common heart. The saying 'All that glitters is not gold' definitely applies to him. There has been too much written about him already. I don't understand why Anne Rice doesn't focus on some of her other characters for once. Actually none of her books are that good, excepting the first one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Excellent book - arrived in superb condition from seller - will definitely buy again from seller."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"While at first engrossing, I found that the rising action, not to mention climax and resolution of this story to be severely lacking. Characterization was intriguing at first, but lost its luster the farther into the story I progressed. I read this at school during Health class, and it took me almost two months to finish it! Anne Rice needs to learn how to write shorter books for people like me."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I first read the Vampire Chronicles when I was in high school. I immediately fell in love with the characters. Rice is so vivid in her description and detail. You almost feel you are there with the characters. I have since read the Vampire Lestat multiple times and it is by far my favorite in the series.This book begins with Lestat waking up in present times. He falls in love with rock music and forms a band. Sounds cheesy, but that isn't the direction the book takes. This is the biography of Lestat. We are taken back to 16th century France and are introduced to young Lestat and his family, including his beautiful mother, Gabrielle. Lestat is troubled by his attraction to Nicolas, and runs away and joins an acting troupe. This is when his is noticed by a vampire and becomes one himself. We travel with Lestat as he meets other vampires and learns the history of his kind.There is always something sexy and alluring about a vampire. Rice portrays this throughout the entire book. Her description is unbeatable. Lestat is one of the most memorable vampires in literature, and this book is riveting."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I came upon this book by luck! I had the original red cover look and how I found it was while I was walking a friend home from school. It was lying on the ground and the rest is history, lol.I read the book and loved it! I decided to by the more modern book cover look due to the fact that I had read the other book so much that it had started to come apart so I bought the other book. This possibly has to be my favorite book by Anne Rice, and if they ever did decide to make a movie out of this book...well the book would win hands down!Everyone should read this book, its great!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In this book, you get to learn of Lestat's past, and how he became a vampire. The writing style of this series (the first 3 anyway), is what makes them my favorite vampire novels."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Second in the Vampire Chronicles.Lestat, the misunderstood vampire who created Louis in Interview with the Vampire, tells his own story here. We see, from Lestat's perspective, many of the same events described by Louis in the first book.While recovering from Claudia's attack, Lestat rests underground for many years. He is finally drawn back into life in the 1980's. He is entranced by the music of a garage band named Satan's Night Out. He rises, introduces himself to the band, and promises them that they will soon be famous. He takes charge of the band and creates a barrage of music and videos while also writing a memoir. Lestat feels that Louis got many things wrong and he is determined to set the record straight. As Lestat recounts the story of his life, he also spills many secrets, his own as well as those of powerful vampires. Lestat's quest for fame might just bring him the recognition he deserves--and then some."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an enigmatic, gripping character iconic of the modern era: a man, however immortal, searching for not only a meaning that does not exist but an origin that defies everything anyone's ever said. A paradoxical being, he murders shamelessly but will only kill the villain. He rebels and yet is the iconoclast of many. He is everything Louis said about him in Interview with The Vampire, but he is so much more.Lestat is the most compelling antihero I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time, and his \\"autobiography\\" is a beautiful piece of literature."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I think I have read this book 4 times since discovering Anne Rice and it remains and will remain the best Vampire novel ever written. I know Interview With the Vampire came first, but we didn't really get a sense of who Lestat was in IWTV. In this, we get to live and breath Lestat. His character is intoxicating and everything you wish a character to be. He is evil, he is cruel and mischievous and he is also utterly charming. He plays the gentleman and kills without thought. There are no proper words to describe his character. But you will fall in love with him as soon as you read his 'autobiography'. I swear you will believe in vampires and you will believe that Lestat is really flesh and blood and writing his little heart out to all of us.Truly, this is not the cliched vampire novel that can be seen and read anywhere. It is utterly original and dramatic. The words will enthrall you from the very first sentence. It is a long book but never feels boring or dragging. It is very descriptive and I woudn't have it any other way. If you wish to read about a young man who was brutally turned into a vampire against his will and goes on an extroadinary journey, then you simply must read this book. Give Lestat a chance, I assure you, you will not be dissapointed."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Sequels are known for coming up short in comparison to their predesessors, but The Vampire Lestat does anything but! Anne Rice returns to the world of the dark creatures, this time from the view point of perhaps her most compelling of all Vampire characters... Lestat!If you enjoyed \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" than you will undoubtedly and wholeheartedly love this sequel. It is essentially the autobiographical prose from Lestat himself. It may start out somewhat in the future (in comparison to IWTV) but it backtracks into how exactly Lestat was born to darkness! On top of this, we learn from Lestat's perspective, how he felt being created, how he has ties to the Theater Of The Vampires, and Armand, how and why he created Louie, and we even meet his mortal mother Gabrielle.As always, Anne Rice does an amazing job with her descriptions and seems to literally paint the scene for you. You will become enthralled instantly with the world of Lestat and all vampires, and see as they see!Above all us however, this book does the character of Lestat some justice. If you have read or seen the movie \\"Interview wth the Vampire\\" than you may have found Lestat to be somewhat of a jerk. This novel gives you insight as to who Lestat really is, and why he acts the way he does. He says in the first book, \\"I'm going to give you the choice I never had,\\" and it is here, you find out how and why!A tremendous book that may surpass the first on some level, and again, Rice shows no signs of slowing down!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I loved this book. Rice writes in a way that is easy to follow, descriptive enough that you think you are there. There aren't any boring parts to this book. Highly recommened. A very entertaining read."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I don't know that I really have anything more meaningful to add to the list of reviews here, yet I will say that Anne Rice is a master of serial novels. I have found that one of the greatest pleasures of reading a series of novels is that you always think that you've heard so much story, that you have so much \\"pretty much figured out\\", yet (if written properly) the next volume completely blows you shatters all your assumptions and most of your hard earned knowledge. Anne does just that time and time again in this second installment of the Vampire Chronicles.I thought that I liked Interview with the Vampire the first time that I read it, I knew that I was in love by the time that I was on the first few chapters of the Vampire Lestat."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is strictly a sequel. What I mean is that it is an absolute MUST to read Interview with the Vampire first. Actually, not so much as a MUST, but more like a strong suggestions. The vampire Lestat portrayed in I.w.t.V. is so different from this. He's not the cruel blood thirsty villain we've come to know (and possibly to love) in the previous book, but a young vampire searching for his roots. I especially loved Marius, and his portrayal, who comes to be very important in Lestat's life. This is not a book to be read lightly, and probably will take a while to complete, but at the end, it's going to leave such a beautiful taste in your mouth, especially when, at the end, Lestat finds himself in the company of.. Well, shouldn't spoil it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is a book that has it all; a gripping plot, deep drawn characters, and real emotions and so many mortal questions mingled all together so magically in the midst of this mesmerizing universe of vampires. It is a book that stays with you forever as you remember breathtaking scenes or unforgettable moments. When I first read it and discovered the trick that Anne Rice played in making the book a sort of a reply from Lestat to Louis and his book \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", I laughed out loud at the cleverness and imagination of this writer.... Or Did Lestat really write the book under her name and make fool of us all! In writing this book, Anne has done what seems impossible. She has thrown the whole light on Lestat making us see him truly and at the same time she has managed skillfully not to make Lestat here appears to be a different being from the one introduced in her first book. No, he is the same creature; only Louis failed to completely understand him. By the end of the book, I was under the spell of this Brat prince of the vampires but at the same time Louis will always remain my most loved character for all that mesmerizing mixture of humanity and sensitiveness which he alone seems to possess (I really wish that Anne would use them again as her main characters in another gripping book ) Their final scene together is my most cherished scene. It seems at times magical in the way she was able to write such a highly emotional scene, that though normal, its strength is quite abnormal. But abnormality is a feature of this book. It is supernatural and abnormal in every way that one can't go for a long time without reading it again then again. Yes, It is one of my dream books and one I dream of being able to write something that matches its high standards one day."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After I read &quot;Interview&quot; I instantly fell in lovewith Anne's style of writing. Not only does she make the charactersmore &quot;lifelike&quot;,but she also gives them more of a personality than the earlier writers had. She makes them more charming,funnier,craftier,and certainly more sensous than any other vampires that I have read about in my life. I particularly love Lestat because of his charmingness,his cunningness,and most of all these two things: 1)his sense of cruel humor,and secondly,the way that he can convince anyone of anything,and then again are his devilshly good-looks. I feel that in a few ways that I connect with the character as I'm sre many of us do;the reason I say that is because I believe that we all have a dark side to us and only a few are willing to let it show through. For those of you who liked or even loved this book then I say to you &quot;you have great taste in authors&quot; and don't let anyone ever tell you differently or try to change your mind. MAY LESTAT LIVE ON FOR ALL ETERNITY ! END"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"While this second book in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles has a promising start, it soon falls apart and becomes a monotonous mess.Stop reading the Vampire Chronicles after you have read Interview with the Vampire."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lestat, this charming and fascinating character, had a difficult, troubled development. In &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot;, the story is very well constructed, the language is exceptionally beautiful, but the characters are not very well focused. Louis describes himself as a victim, but, as a matter of fact, he is selfish, calculator and hypocrite. On the other hand, Lestat appears to be the &quot;villain&quot;, but Louis should be grateful to him for saving so many times his life. And what is the return? Death, of course.But Lestat cannot really die: he is too steadily alive in the author's mind (and heart). In the second book, however, Anne Rice had to change a lot of details. At the beginning, Lestat was the son of a countryman: now he becomes a French nobleman, very disappointed for Louis' misunderstandings. The young Lestat is very devoted to his mother, the Marquise Gabrielle de lioncourt, so much that he changes her into a vampire when he sses her in the throes of death. So we learn something unexpected: vampires are able to love. Killing is only a cruel necessity, and in any case Lestat imposes himself to kill only evildoers.Will Lestat ever become human? Probably not, spite of &quot;The tale of the Body Thief&quot;.But a human counterpart of Lestat exists, at least in Italy. His name is Ephraim Levi, a Jewish, blond-haired piano player, and he is the hero of the novel &quot;Storie segrete&quot; by Eleonora Cavallini, published in 1998 by Edizioni del Girasole, Ravenna. He is loved by men and women indiscriminately. He appears to have no scruples, but shows a very deep respect towards his father's religion.On the other hand, Anne Rice's vampires are rigorously Christian (let us remember that the author is of Irish origin, just like Bram Stoker). But I suppose that vampires can be nothing but Christian, excepting Chagall, the famous Jewish vampire of Roman Polanski's &quot;Those brave vampire killers&quot;."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Just like I said in my review of Blood And Gold,I never seem to get sick of this book,I have probably read this a dozen times and still like to listen to the audio book as well"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is my MOST FAVORITE BOOK of all times since now. I read it maybe million times, I memorized my favorite scenes. What else I could say? It is my Bible. My biggest treasure in my library, my gold, my life. As all Anne Rice books- this made me shiver from interest to know what will be in next sentence. You all can imagine how scared I was when my enemy wanted to flush it in toilet next day I got it from shop. I was terrified! Now I save this book like my eyes. Maybe family thinks I'm crazy, but I cannot help myself if I fell in love with all characters in this book. Of course Lestat is only one that I love with ALL my heart. But Nicki has also my all love.

With trips into the ancient past to right into the now..we can examile different times, ways of life, countries and cities all in one novel...not to mention a little fright and mystery.

(Case in point: This is the only book ever for which I stood in line for hours to have the author inscribe her name.)I won't belabor the plot here; it is simply too baroque to try to put into simple words. Suffice to say that, in the first person, we meet Lestat, the teenaged son of an impoverished 18th-century nobleman, whose life is at best cold and harsh, at worst, a constant battle with cruelty of every sort for one's mere survival. One particularly dark and fiercely cold night, Lestat, a beautiful young man despite all his hardships, is out with his beloved dogs, hunting wolves. Into the strange fog he rides...and when he first hears the deep, surreal, and otherworldly voice calling him...\\"Wolf killer, wolf killer,\\" we are there with him. And we are by his side as he becomes, in a strangely but riveting erotic passage, one of the undead. A vampire unto eternity.All of Anne Rice's intensity, her eroticism, her love of history, her incredible sense of detail, and her dark view of the world is present in this book, much more so than \\"Interview with a Vampire.\\"It is my suggestion that, if you want to sample Anne Rice, and have never read any of her works, this may be the book you want to read. And if you know Rice's works but not this particular novel, I urge you not to deny yourself another minute. This is truly one of the must-reads of one's life."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is only my third Anne Rice novel though I have been a long time supporter of hers and a fan of her work. Having only recently read Interview with the Vampire, the first book in the Chronicles, I immediately wanted to read the next book, The Vampire Lestat. I'm so glad I did because it gave me a better understanding and a stronger admiration for Interview, of which I had somewhat mixed emotions about upon finishing it.In The Vampire Lestat, we learn more about Louis's maker and get to enjoy a nice long tale of his life story. We open in the 1980s with Lestat in New Orleans taking an interest in rock music and becoming a vocal celebrity. He has even sought out the book, Interview with the Vampire, to read and has determined much of it to be lies so he needs to set the record straight by writing his own book.From here, we spend a lot of time with Lestat as a human and get to study the close loving relationship he had with his mother. We meet his vampire maker, Magnus. We learn that Lestat loved the stage and we see the early development of what would become the Theatre of the Vampires which played such a crucial part in Interview. We witness Lestat's bond with Armand, the vampire who became the head of the theatre and learn a lot about his story and his creator Marius, who Lestat begins to obsess over. And Marius introduces Lestat to \\"those who must be kept,\\" who are the king and the queen of all vampires. This sets the reader up for the next book in the series, Queen of the Damned.Rice excels at classic story telling, but treats her readers to a historical saga of fine vampire literature. Unlike the vampires today's generation obsess over, who are either blood thirsty monsters or sparkling romantics, Rice suffers her protagonist with questions of existence, being, and soul. Hers truly are vampires that will live forever, both on the page and in the minds of her readers."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Published 9 years after \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", this sequel tells us the story of Lestat, the villain of the first book. Opening in 1985, we read that Lestat is now a \\"rock and roll\\" star. (Note to Anne Rice: people have not said \\"rock and roll\\" for quite some time...) This seems a strange change for the brooding vampire of the first book, and it's not entirely successful to me as a reader. It may have worked better in 1985, but by now, it seems a bit unnecessary and kind of silly. Thankfully, this plot is only a framing device for the life story of Lestat de Lioncourt (and that's why I insist on giving this book 5 stars.) \\"Lestat\\" is quite a different novel from the first in the series, but we are dealing with an entirely different vampire here than the depressed and vulnerable Louis (who remains my favorite vampire). Lestat's story goes throughout the centuries, and he meets other vampire's who tell their tales. This book is a fantastic pageant that goes back to Ancient Egyptian times, to classical Rome, to pagan Europe, to the times of the French Revolution, to an old, decaying Parisian cemetery and even up to the present time. \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a much denser novel than the first (which has now become a sort of prelude or teaser to the entire Vampire Chronicles) but it's just as enjoyable. This book seems to be the hands down favorite of most readers of the Vampire Chronicles, but this is not an incentive to read these books out of order. \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" contains some very important passages and character development that are important to your understand of the second (especially in one of the final sections of \\"Lestat\\"). Amazingly, Rice maintains the continuity between the two novels, and doesn't make any of the \\"revisionist history\\" in the second seem false or forced. (Of note is the explanation as to why Lestat's father but not mother was in the first book... that revelation is a shocking one.) Another fun aspect is Lestat's reaction to reading Stoker's \\"Dracula\\". And fear not, some of our favorite characters from the first book do appear again... in unexpected ways. One of my favorite characters to be introduced into this book was Akasha, who is the Queen of the Damned of the third novel.With The Vampire Lestat, Rice again does a wonderful job with her prose; it's a beautifully written, exciting and captivating book. I had no idea where the book was going from one moment to the next, and it never disappointed. Rice even successfully depicts twentieth century America as a fascinating place to be. I never thought a drugstore would seem so interesting. Read this book, but don't read it too fast... savor it, it's worth the time."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I read this book in English. I am Italiam, and it was not that simple for me. But _The Vampire Lestat_ is something you cannot restist. _Interview_ is a beautiful book, indeeed, but I think it's a substantial mistake. Why does Louis obstinately hate Lestat? Why does he not understand that Lestat loves him? Why does he prefer the treacherous Armand? Lestat's end in _Interview_ is terrible, unbeareble. You cannot let a creature die of depression. Even if he were much and much worse than he is descripted. So, thanks to _The Vampire Lestat_! Miss Rice understood what depression really is. Maybe she knows this terrible disease. She gives a chance to her bad boy, to her villain, to her horrible, enchanting and intriguing character. And besides, she writes so well!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have some mixed feelings about Anne Rice's \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", but all things considered, I truly believe it is a worthwhile read. In this follow-up to \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", we are told the life story of Lestat de Lioncourt, and I was bothered by the inconsistencies between the two books. Lestat tells us that Louis has lied about all kinds of things, and the cruel and cold-hearted villain we came to know and love in \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" becomes a moral, soft-hearted, and tortured soul, always trying to do the right thing and find the answers to life's mysteries. Hmmm. I think if I had not read \\"Interview with the Vampire\\", I would have found \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" far more enjoyable, because then I would have been blissfully unaware of the transformation of Lestat's character. With that said though, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a compelling, if lengthy and somewhat verbose, tale, and in the end I was glad I read it, because it has many redeeming qualities.The book purports to be Lestat's autobiography, and we are taken on a lush and erotic journey through Lestat's long and eventful life. From his youth as the son of a marquis in pre-Revolutionary France when Lestat befriends a troubled violinist named Nicolas, to the crowded streets of Paris where his life is changed forever by a solitary vampire named Magnus, who gives Lestat the dark gift before deserting him forever. Shocked and amazed by what has befallen him, Lestat, begins to learn what it is to be a vampire. Questions about the why and how of what he has become torment Lestat, but there is nobody for him to turn to. Lestat's story has many twists and turns; as he saves his mother from her deathbed with his immortal kiss, meets a hostile coven of Satan-worshipping vampires living under a cemetery, and ultimately goes off on a quest for a legendary ancient vampire named Marius in hopes of finding some answers to the questions that haunt him. And through it all we are treated to Rice's memorable and moving prose. However, the author's tendency to become overly descriptive is in evidence here, and there were some portions of the book that were a bit hard to get through.As I've already stated, my feelings about \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" are a bit ambiguous. But despite my criticisms of this book, I actually did like it a lot. Lestat's story is affecting, intriguing, and entertaining, and in the end I could honestly say that I enjoyed it. Many people adore this book, and it's easy to see why, and on the other hand quite a few people hate it, and I can understand their point of view too. I can't guarantee anything to anyone picking up this book, because Anne Rice's writing is hypnotic and beautiful to some, and deadly boring to others. Personally, I would have been sorry if I'd missed \\"The Vampire Lestat\\", since I really did become quite engrossed in Lestat's tale. So give this book a try and see what you think, you may just be pleasantly surprised!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was beyond anything that I have ever read before. I've always loved vampire novels, and Ann Rice is one of the best authors I've read. Like many people, I started to gain interest in Ann Rice's books after watching Interview with the Vampire. But I finally chose to read the books when I saw the most recent movie Queen of the Damned. As I was reading the book, it was easy to imagine exactly what kind of person (so to speak) Lestat really is. Lestat suffers from the one thing that almost all humans fear; loneliness. I guess that's what makes him different from most vampires. He still has some of his human moralities left. Nevertheless, Rice's descriptions in everything that is going on is so vivid, you'd swear that Lestat is real. However, some parts of the story made me loss interest and I just skimmed the pages. I guess you can be a little over descriptive. Overall, it was a great book to read and I plan on reading the next one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The above quote is from the short story LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD AS A DICTATOR WOULD TELL IT, wherein the wolf explains how he was the real victim, and Little Red and Granny had it coming. THE VAMPIRE LESTAT is a bit like an irony-free book-long version of the same thing.This is, of course, the sequel to INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE, which did not need or want a sequel. For fans of the first book, the opening pages of TVL will tell you right away what you are in for. Louis was lying. Lestat is really a lovely guy, he never kills anybody who doesn't deserve it. Heck, even when he is starving, he goes without blood until he can find a killer who shows no remorse. He is not a peasant named Valois, he is a nobleman named \\"de Lioncourt\\". Yeah, that's the ticket.You might reasonably assume that Lestat - the narrator -- is the one doing most of the lying, but the epilogue makes clear that this is not the case. Nor do we get a convincing Lestat's-eye portrait of Louis-As-Liar, or any decent (or even lame) reason why Louis would tell a pack of lies to a mortal anyway, so don't be like me and plow your way through the whole book if that is the part you are interested in. This is a lazy retcon, not RASHOMON.Pity. Ms. Rice has the beginnings of a very good story here. Lestat is the unhappy younger son of a backwoods nobleman in pre-Revolutionary France, and he finds solace in his friendship with Nicolas, a cultured but rebellious merchant's son with a dark streak. Their passionate attachment despite vast chasms of psychological difference provides an excellent beginning to the novel, and gives us characters and themes we can actually care about. This historical setting is well realized, and the wolves are cool, as is the Little Red Riding Hood motif.Unfortunately, even in this first and best part of the novel, the boy Lestat is overshadowed by his egomaniac alter ego. His mortal innocence has a hard time making an impression through the filter of modern-day narrator-Lestat's banality and self-absorption. Only occasionally, when young Lestat feels hurt by his brother's coldness, or moved by his friend's affection or pain, do we get a FEEL for his imperiled humanity. Most times, such as when he spends half a page describing how his own mouth looked, we only feel that he must have been a soulless prat from the cradle. Further, he becomes a vampire too soon, and adjusts too easily, leaving us no reason to like him at all.The pre-whitewashed monster from INTERVIEW was, ironically, far more human, in that his very cruelty was evidence of his desperate dependency. Compare him to THIS idiot, who constantly spouts glib and flowery declarations of \\"love\\" for anyone and anything he gets briefly enthusiastic about, including the people he murders. I spent INTERVIEW nursing a slow burning hatred for Lestat, and rooting for him to die a hideous death, but he was a genuinely tragic character in his own way. This guy isn't worth the effort of either hate or pity. I just wanted him put out of my misery.I agree with the reviewer who said that this would have been a much better book if it only had been about \\"The Vampire George\\" rather than Lestat. Not only does TVL trash classic characters from a better book, but since this is all just backstory to INTERVIEW, nothing interesting can actually GO anywhere. Lestat's friendship with Nicolas and feud with Armand, which signified so much about the spiritual trauma of that time, should have been the heart and soul of this novel. But both are neglected in favor of Lestat's dreary Oedipal relationship with his mother, and then dropped so we can have a search for the Origin of Vampires. The latter is a bit like reading a novel about an angst-ridden serial child-killer, only to have it end with him tracing his family tree back to Genghis Khan. Who cares? As Louis finally admitted at the end of INTERVIEW about his similar quest, it is just avoiding the point.But that attitude would only kill the opportunity for more sequels, I suppose. So eventually we meet a NEW Louis, who has clearly received a partial lobotomy, a spine-ectomy, and an all-expense-paid trip to Stepford since the ending of INTERVIEW, instead of killing himself like he said he would, the Rotten Stinking Liar. But he still looks ravishing, and that's what counts. So forget \\"You cannot have love and goodness when you do what you know to be evil\\" or \\"I knew the real answer to my quest . . . when I first took a human life to feed my craving. It was my death.\\" Instead we get a flock of swishy yet murderous fiends gazing lovingly upon one another and rhapsodizing at length about each other's mesmerizing beauty. \\"Locked together in hatred\\" looks darn good by comparison."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I would like to start out by saying that Anne Rice is the most sensual writer I have ever read. I urge you not to listen to those ignorant, unappreciative reviewers who say this book is &quot;boring.&quot; It is captivating, beautiful, and most importantly, human. In this story, we find out how complicated the wonderful character Lestat really is. He is charismatic, seemingly evil, and outgoing. But beneath it all, he is sensitive and maybe even caring. I think he is a very beautiful, well-written character, and anyone who cannot see that should stick with R.L. Stine. As a writer myself, I recognize extraordinary talent such as displayed by Anne Rice. I adore her and her characters, specifically Lestat. I have never read more sensuous and elegant work in my life. The ability she has to take fantasy, horror, drama, and even a little sci-fi and weave all the elements together into one astounding tapestry is amazing. There has never been a more breath-taking storyteller than Anne Rice. And never before has anything more extraordinary been written than her Vampire Chronicles. Her work is going to be studied for ages."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have not read Interview with a Vampire. I have seen the movie, I think I should read the book. This book is slow to start, but a marvelous history to vampires as it plays out. I have not researched vampires, but if Rice did not herself get the Vampire history info from another source, she is definitely a genius. Her imagination is mind boggling. Great book!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice, The Vampire Lestat - Book 2 of the Vampire ChroniclesIt's been some years since I read Interview With a Vampire (great!) and the movie of the same name (a bit watered down, but still frightening), so I thought I'd move onto the next book in Rice's Vampire Chronicles, about the vampire Lestat.In the first book, Louis decided to have a tell-all with a man regarding the life and suffering of a vampire. In that book he mentioned and described Lestat in great detail. The homoerotica was implied and the book paced well, with the requisite bits of horror left mostly to the imagination.The second book is very similar. Lestat rises from the earth somewhere in New Orleans (all is explained why he was buried in the first place) after a several-decade absence and creates a rock band and writes lyrics all about vampires - their history, origins and so on - which he knows is expressly forbidden by all. He knows he's probably in for it, and feels that he is up to the challenge. Lestat craves notoriety among his kind, as strongly as, I would say, his thirst for blood!Rice paints a picture of a sympathetic man with a rough childhood who beats the demons of his well-endowed family with an encounter with wolves - an exciting chapter that has the reader just as scared and feel the harsh breathe of the wolves as well as Lestat does! This changes him, and we see how this creates just the personality for a vampire.An ancient vampire who is also prone to break the rules, Magnus, gives Lestat the freedom he desires - the kidnapping sequence is a bit hard to follow - and though committing suicide via flame - gives Lestat enough information and enough gold to create his own world. What world would that be?Lestat has a relationship with his close friend Nicholas, the Theater in Paris, his disowned family (except his mother Gabrielle, who plays a strong female lead, especially in the last chapters) and the city of Paris. The development of Lestat and his attitudes are constant, are surprising, and delightfully morbid in their presentation.The book proceeds through much of the \\"origin of Lestat\\" (my words) and though a plot hole or two are apparent (what's up with Those Who Must Be Kept?), I did like the mystery. What happened to Armand? Where did his old mentor Marius go in the 20th Century? And what of the deliciously stolid Akasha and her jealous king-husband? Were they really the first of the line?Bottom Line: You really can't put this book down. Anne Rice mixes 18th century propriety and 20th century horror (complete with a rock concert at San Francisco's Cow Palace!) that to me was an improvement over \\"Interview With a Vampire\\" and made me crave \\"Queen of the Damned\\", the next Chronicle. Can't wait!Other Books on the Rice Shelf:Complete Vampire Chronicles (Interview with the Vampire, The Vampire Lestat, The Queen of the Damned, The Tale of the body Thief)Interview with the Vampire (Vampire Chronicles)"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I was put on to this book by my friend Alex after watching &quot;Interview wit the Vampire&quot; I must say that Anne Rice has out done her self. I mean the way she wrote Lastat was so defining and clear it was like I was a character while reading this book. This is surley one of the best books I've ever read and would definatly recomend it to everyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"There are two sides to every story, as the saying goes, and now it's Lestats's turn to share his tale. This book lets you know everything about Lestat as he tells us of his adventures as a young mortal, how he became a vampire, and then the story returns us to the first book as he talks about his life with Louis and Claudia. This is a thorough and enchanting tale of the history of Lestat, including all the imoprtant details about him that Interview kept a mystery to Louis, and the reader. It is the prequel, and the sequel to Interview. A great continuation of the vampire chronicles, with the introduction to some new interesting characters."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is my favorite of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. The book is narrated by the blonde haired, blue eyed, Lestat de Lioncourt. In the book Lestat takes you from present to past in the exciting and enchanting tale of his life before and after his becoming a vampire. The setting drifts from the French country side, to busy Paris, to New Orleans, to Los Angeles, and to many other wonderful places. Rich in detail, Anne Rice's descriptive writing draws the reader into the book and into the seductive and alluring world of the Vampire Lestat. This book is the perfect sequel to Interview with the Vampire because not only does it explain the missing details, it explains the character of Lestat and the reasoning behind his actions in the first book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After falling in love with the demon antagonist of Anne Rice's first vampire tale, Lestat, that is, I could not help but devour each of the following novels in her majestic Vampire Chronicles. I have read &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; more times than I can remember; and I re-read my favourite parts often.It has a glory and an openness about it that takes my breath away; it is tender and yet powerful; killing and sustaining. It is both a lovely story and a perdurable legend; and what more can be said of great literature than that?I cannot possibly recomend this book enough to anyone who loves the gothic novel or books in general...and especially to anyone who has always wondered why evil isn't always evil and why we must all face our own darkness and light in the end."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anyone who enjoys Rice's work will esteem this volume as one of her most riveting and mesmeric creations. I think, however, that the people who would benefit most from readng this novel are those who consider Rice's work as 'horror', and avoid it for that reason. This is not genre horror! It is literature, fantastical, dark, philosophical literature. It is a tale about a vampire, one of the living dead - someone who once was human but no longer is. Yet this novel actually conjures more questions and promotes more affection for our own humankind than the majority of modern 'realistic' fiction. Rice has a wonderful sense of what makes us humna, of the effect that the age we live in has upon us, and she uses the guise of an immortal to demonstrate this with great sensitivity. The differences between this work and &quot;Interview&quot; are manifold and although many fans of Rice became so enamoured of the remarkable Lestat that they couldn't stand 'Interview', I find that reading 'Interview' over again and then going back to Lestat makes one appreciate Rice's characters and writing skill even more."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"What a feast for my spirit! I read this masterpiece years ago, the 2nd Anne Rice book of my novel awakening - &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot; being the first - and, I must say, it was one of the rare satiating moments of my existence!Ah - this is the Vampire Lestat - Maker of the Vampire Louis of &quot;Interview With the Vampire.&quot; This is the 2nd book of Rice's Vampire Chronicles - in the brilliant, illuminating voice of Lestat, himself. This beautiful, dark tale flies high up there among my three favorite novels - masterworks that pulsate to the rhythm of my very soul - this, Lestat's tale, along with Tolstoy's &quot;Anna Karenina&quot; and Austen's &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot; I cannot write enough herein to be worthy of this wonderous novel. My dark soul doth indeed overflow - V~~~~V!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"As far as book sequels go, this one is quite readable. I enjoyed the charcter of Lestat. However, the pace went slow in some parts and some characters were so dull. A worthy sequel, but far from great."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"i have read all of the vampire chronicles and this is my hands down favorite one. It picks up where &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot; left off, with the story of the impossible Lestat and his early life/adventers. a very good read"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat was a thrilling novel that was considered to be one of the best books in the world. Reading this book has affected me with an undescribable feeling. This book kept me at the edge of my seat. Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down. The readson why I chose this book is becasue I love reading vampire stories. Anne Rice is a great author. No wonder why this book The Vampire Lestat is a #1 bestseller. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Here I am once again writing a review for one of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.Although this book can get a little slow at times, it is once again proof that Anne Rice has explored the minds of her readers through message of the Vampire Lestat.This book is, of course, about Lestat and his adventures through time. All the question you had about any of the characters in the first edition of the Vampire Chronicles are answered within the content of this marvelous piece of literature. There are so many unexpected things that occur in this story that it almost makes you jump when you read it, as if it were a very suspeseful movie. You may cry, you may laugh. But I gurantee you that you will love this book, especially if you are a fan of Ms. Rice.I recently went to a book-signing in Atlanta of Ms. Anne's. You could tell from the minute she opened her mouth to speak with you (and she DOES speak with everyone who approaches) that she is a truly genuine person.So...read the book....----JCB"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This story draws you into a wonderful world of fantasy. I loved hearing Lestat's version of Louis' interview. Lestat is a hero mainly because he knows what he is &amp; accepts his existence for what it is. He doesn't seek to justify his actions, but just presents them as fact. I love having him the hero instead of Louis."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is the sequel to Anne Rice's &quot;Interview With TheVampire.&quot; If you like Interview, you'll LOVE this book.It shows the life of Lestat, the evil vampire in Interview,and shows the reasons for his apathy towards life. It isover flowing with the beauty and horror that accustom manyof Anne Rice's novels. THREE thumbs up!!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I finished this book several days ago but wanted to take some time and let my mind relax a bit before I reviewed.Anne Rice, probably one of the master literary artists of all time. She definately belongs in a class with the masters of writing novels.The Vampire Lestat, part II, in the Vampire Chronicles tells the story of how the Vampire Lestat came to be a vampire. The story of his natural human life as well as his vampire life, his travels, encounters, lovers, family, and and in-depth encapulation of inside his head.Like Interview with a vampire, every single detail is told with such realism, you feel like you are in the mind of Lestat or in the mind of Louis, and Armond, and Marius. I took much greater time reading over each word of this novel as if deciphering it in my mind and envisioning every detail that I read.Like uncovering a diary of ancient times that told a real history and let me relive it through the words on the pages.It takes a very patient and enthusiastic mind to read liture like this, but oh what a pleasure it is to be witness to the words and stories that come to life upon a piece of paper."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This one was my absolute favorite of the Vampire Chronicles! It had me in tears more than once! It was very well done and beautifully written! Being able to see what Lestat's life was like was just... amazing! Even if you haven't read the first book you can easily pick this one up and read without being confused at all. In fact, it may be easier to understand if you read this one first!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"One of my favorite vampire novels. In my top three favorites, along with Charlaine Harris' \\"The Sookie Stackhouse Series\\" and PJ Dominicis' \\"Depraved Blood.\\""},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice is an amazing writer, she pulls you into the story and makes you feel like you're right there, a silent witness to the action. I catch my pulse racing sometimes as I read and its difficult to put her books down. I like how this one delves into Lestat's early life and shows why he is the way he is. But I have to say that it can be slow at times and while this is my second reading of it I now know why I had forgotten so much of it. The Tale of the Body Thief remains my favorite of the Vampire Chronicles."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I enjoyed this one a lot more that The Interview with the Vampire. Lestat's life story was intriguing and compelling. Though the \\"Rock Star\\" idea was a little weird for me I was glad to find that the story was based in his past rather than the rock star present. It was interesting to see what Lestat hid from Louis and why. I like his philosophy to \\"life\\". Armand is a prat, though I though Lestat was an ass after the first book so I'm sure Armand has redeeming qualities as well. Akasha and Enkhl are quite frightening to me so I am looking forward to the next book, I hope that Lestat is able to free Marius from wherever her is."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I'm a slow reader and this was a big read but the first had me in enough to go on. It bogged down a bit in comparison as the threads spread further and the world became more complex. I would still recommend it to those who like nineteenth century fiction. Rice's world will subsume you until the high archness of the vampire life begins to seem as much a satire on pre-WW1 life as any of the acclaimed novels of that period."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After reading interview with the vampire, my expectations coming into this were very low.That may have contributed to me enjoying this more, or it may have just been better.After the winjing in Interview, the humor and somtimes light-heartedness in Lestat was very welcome.There was still a measure of the tortured soul that you cant seem to avaoid in the vampire books, but there was also A LOT of good back stories about the various characters in this (at the time) ever expanding universe of hers.If you lived through Interview, you would be doing yourself a disservice to not give this the time to read."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I had just finished \\"Interview With the Vampire\\" the night and was craving for more (I had picked up both \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" and \\"The Queen of the Damned\\" the very next day).When I first picked up this novel, I was completely draw in.Having just completed the prior novel, I knew what to expect in terms of detail, for which Anne Rice is clearly adept to. Many however might be turned off by this, for it represents something we are clearly not accustomed to in this day and age (we are all idiots). I myself had an extremely hard time staying focused throughout much of the novel; finding myself skimming through sections as much as a handful of times simply trying to comprehend this cunning tale. However, in the end you will find the story quite simple, and perhaps overly drawn out in later sections. I do not blame the writer for this, as I can only assume she is paying her respects to many a classical Gothic epic of times far prior to what I have come to expect.The detail in this book is simply brilliant, but you, like me, may find your thoughts astray in many a section - in which a many number of pages could have simply been summed up to a mere sentence. A focused mind, ever so mature, may appreciate this more than I, as once more... I am an idiot.(spoilers)I would have been completely satisfied had this novel ended with the split and parting between Lestat and his mother, Gabrielle, about halfway through; for reasons stated above, I had trouble feeling encompassed with the rest of the novel venturing into the tale of Marius, in retrospect the one of two sections I could live on without (the other being the grand finale). Although this is perhaps necessary to continue on the chronicles; certainly an interesting prospect is the idea of \\"those who must be kept\\", but you may find yourself in a sudden suspension of disbelief as such magical and godlike relics intercept this novel which could have easily passed for a biography. I cringe at the idea of the ancient \\"Akasha\\" being awaken by music akin to \\"My Chemical Romance\\" (a decent band I will not argue, but not what I have come to expect in a classical tale), and can only hope the next novel I read, \\"Queen of the Damned\\", fares well. The ending, I found, came together all to quickly as well, with a sudden reunion that felt out of place (a car chase follows), with a seemingly forced reappearance of Gabrielle (which could have made an interesting story on it's own, in a novel dedicated to Lestat's quest for his lost mother), and of course Louis who now bears a complete re-vamp of personality, though this is to be somewhat expecting considering he has changed very much over the course of a century, and as he himself has come to read Lestat's memoir, one can only assume he would see his maker in a new light. On the contrary of my negative thoughts on the latter half, I enjoyed a quick look at the perspective of Lestat on \\"Interview with the Vampire\\".(end spoilers)Again, the novel has it's faults, and (in my opinion, at least)takes a turn for a cringe worthy ending, the first half or so is absolutely classic, and the later section involving Lestat's perspective on the span of \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" is an absolute necessity for building the character of Lestat.In the end, you must read this; I suspect you will at least enjoy it, if not love it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After knowing the novel &quot;Interview with the Vampire,&quot; reading book 2 of the Vampire Chronicles &quot;The Vampire Lestat,&quot; was amazing. It definetly explains a lot of Lestats actions and approaches he took with Louis. This novel is an autpbiograpghy of Lestat's life and is definetly filled with alot of unbelieveable and unexpected turns. He goes from the present to the past, and in full detailed steps, he gives you the life of the vampire Lestat. I am now a new found vampire lover due to this book. It has me on the edge of my seat everytime i pick up the book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I was a bit nervous about reading &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; because I got bored in the middle of &quot;Interview&quot; I still love that book, but I was afraid that this novel would be like it, but it's not...I love &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; it was a novel that kept me reading for three days straight... It talks about his life before Louis and Claudia and he talks about the present about he becoming a rock star who is on Mtv and is about to perform in San Francisco...Another reason I loved this novel is because it explained things that weren't mentioned in &quot;Interview&quot; like the Children of The Damned, and The &quot;Vampire Gods&quot; and so forth...It's an excellent novel... if you liked this book, you'll love &quot;The Queen of The Damned&quot;...."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is not her best work (I prefer Vittorio and Memnoch the Devil, but that is my personal preference), but it's not horrible either. It's a great tale that clarifies some of the misconceptions of the previous book.We first had the tale of Louis's life, but we never knew how Lestat came into being, or why he never died during the fire and the swamp and the second fire.... Some people don't realize that the only reason why Lestat was portrayed as evil in the book before was because it was written from Louis's perspective! The vampire Lestat was writen from Lestat's perspective, which basically clarifies everything. I didn't quite like the thought of him being a rock star, but it made verything tie in together in Rice's ingenious master plan for the characters. I hope she doesn't stop writing, and that there is a sequal to her latest book Vittorio!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In this sequel to &quot;Interview with the Vampire,&quot; the reader learns all about Anne Rice's most complex character in The Vampire Chrnicles, Lestat. All those things that Louis wanted to know, but never learned are here in this book. Furthermore, Anne Rice turns &quot;Interview's&quot; already complex tale into the beginnings of a new vampire mythology.First, we find out Lestat's origins. Forced into the dark gift by the maddened Vampire Magnus, Lestat must discover the secrets of vampirism on his own. We begin to understand Lestat's bitterness towards Loius's constant questioning of their history. Lestat finds it difficult leaving his friends and family, his very humanity behind, and we find that he was not always the playfully evil vampire he was in &quot;Interview.&quot;Over the course of the novel, the reader learns just how much Lestat does indeed know by the time the events of &quot;Interview&quot; take place. By then, he has become more powerful than &quot;Interview&quot; could have possibly let on. Lestat as a character becomes very complex, with a long history of intense pain, and shocking discovery. Others (not me particularly) will be happy to learn more about Armand in this book as well.Overall, this was an excellent sequel because it fills the reader in on Lestat's past, and answers many of the questions &quot;Interview&quot; left you with. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed Lestat's character in &quot;Interview.&quot; Further, if you enjoyed the mythology of the vampires introduced in &quot;Lestat,&quot; then by all means read the next installment &quot;Queen of the Damned.&quot;"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I thought The Vampire Lestat was a wonderful, beautifully written book"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lastat changes so much from book to book. It's clear that When Ann Rice first wrote Interview with the Vampire, she didn't have Lestat set as a hero. But as the book went on I found my self more intrigued with the other vampires, and more perplexed about Lestat."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I found this book very inspiring. I have been told that I am like Lestat, and I see myself in him. That is why I found him inspiring.

She's got a great sense of it and this book is likely the best of her writings."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The bottom line is that this book is entertaining; a real page-turner. It also brings up thought-provoking issues about the &quot;gift&quot; of immortality. It's worth reading especially for Rice's clever description of real vampires.

I loved it. The best of the Vampire Chronicles and way up there in all of Anne Rice's work, second, maybe, only to The Witching Hour. Surely this is one of the most memorable characters I've ever read. He is drawn so intricately and with such complexity that he practically bleeds onto the page. The descriptions of his becoming a Vampire are kind of wrenching as we go through Lestat's struggle with his new identity. It's so important to know these things about him when you read him in the other books as the cosmopolitan, suave, experienced Vampire who seems to love being one. I was VERY much reminded of &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; here. It rings that way."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"this book is absolutly wonderful. the characters are so realistic and i found myself falling in love with lestat himself despite the fact that he's fiction. the plot is very deep and i had a difficult time putting it down. it really made me think about humanity and what it is about because of the way it mocks society seeing that vampires are immune to almost anything. a must-read for anyone who wants a totally different view on life."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice I loved and hated but when all is said and done she wrights the way only a truely great wrighter can.

I adore all of anne rice's wrighting."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is still, I think my favourite book.

It introduces you to the 5 vampire rules (By the end of the series I think Lestat has broken all of them), and to Gabrielle, and Nicholas, and Marius, and most importantly Those Who Must Be Kept. So I strongly suggest reading this book considering it gives you a ton of answers to the questions you've been asking since the first book. -EH"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was well written and very believeable.

This is the best book in the series Lestat isn't like the other vamps, if something isn't going his way he does something about it.

Lestat is the ultimate vampire!I'd just like to point out to people who feel that Lestat has changed.. Interview with the Vampire was written by Louis who misjudges Lestat's character and his actions. After reading the Vampire Lestat, you begin to see where Louis made his misjudgments.

It was a pleasure to read, and I could hardly put it down, as clich&eacute; as that may sound.&quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is basically the &quot;autobiography&quot; of Lestat. At the first of part of the book, he tells about his new career as a rock star, and his craving for fame and adventure. Next, he tells the story of his life: some events in his mortal life, how he became a vampire, etc. Then the book ends with a cliffhanger set in the present (I can't tell you what it is though : p).It was enlightening because having read &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;, I still thought of Lestat as a greedy, nasty vampire; this book told me his side of things, and showed me that he really wasn't as bad as Louis portrayed him to be.This book, along with &quot;Interview&quot;, is one of my favorite of the Chronicles. It was so well-written that it felt like the author was Lestat de Lioncourt instead of Anne Rice."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice is a master of setting a scene, she makes you feel that you are truly in it. And when you add to that her sensual and engrossing characters, quite a potion is brewed. Very intoxicating..."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Interview with a Vampire is so far the best book I have read... ever. That sounds as though I am just trying to make this book sounds better than it is like some people so but believe me I am not. This book made me think it made me think up things that could happen to the characters such as; Lestat, Armand, Louise and Claudia. Ann Rice was very descriptive in the scenery, appearances and the way the characters spoke. Its seems as though she looked into things for the characters every detail was perfected every scene they were in. Louise (the main character) progressed and changed through out the book, first he was more human and loving and thoughtful, when he made Claudia a Vampire he became more quite dark, less talkative and more thoughtful (meaning he thought more into things) and then in the end he almost never talked he hated everything and argued a lot more with Armand.All and all this book rocked."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Oh My God!!! This is the best vampire book that I have ever read. Anne Rice describes everything magnificently. If you want a great read this is the book you need. Also, try reading the book Blood and Chocolate, that book is also wonderful."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This was the best book in the &quot;vampire&quot; series. It was well thought out and well written. It's slow at parts, but quickly picks up. It's very good."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Absolutely brilliant. A. Rice pulls you into perhaps her best novel. The character Lestat is absolutely one of the most interesting and complex. Granted there are many others but he is the most charming.One could go on and on about this book. Other than the Witching Hour no other book of hers completely pulled me into it's world.READ IT! LOVE IT!! You will read all the others afterwards. Truly."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The vampire Lestat by: Anne Rice 481 pages. New York 1985The vampire Lestat by Anne Rice is an intriguing book as you start you will be pulled into Rice's imaginary world. You will lose all track of reality and it will seem like you're in the reality of the dark life throughout the book. The book follows along with Lestat like you have been always been there. You might of notice your in a another existence.This book tells when about when (Lestat) was living with his parents as a hunter. When he and a friend leaves there town to follow their dreams, and they find a lot more.The world is so realistic. Anne Rice is a fantastic writer and she will bring you into the world of vampires on the first page. I would recommend it to all that like out of the world things. The reason I would recommend it is because the vampires seem so real!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"this is a great book,andi suggestreading this book 1st before you read anymore of Anne Rice&quot;s books, but htis is deffidently one of her best, and really depicts a great vampire legend. i've read tons of vampire books but htis is sertinaly the best, since most are based a tiny legends, but this really is a masterpiece"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was an excellent read. This was the first book I have read by Anne. After readng it though, I became upset with the film Queen of the Damned, and I know I will feel even more resentment once I read Queen of the Damned, just because of its inaccurate information. But that's hollywood for you I suppose. Either way, I thoroughly enjoyed Lestat and hated putting it down. I can't wait to read the rest of the Vampire Chronicles, which I plan to read the entire series by the end of my senior year of high school, May 2005. I have the feeling I'll finish the series long before that time, just through the way Anne's writing drew me in to the world of the Vampires the first time I entered it. I can hardly wait to be swept away into the lives of the Immortals."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an entralling story. Anne Rice writes in a sensual and poetic way that enraptures the reader into her dark and beautiful realm of the damned. This book is surprisingly philosphical, and in my opinion, just as good as Interview with the Vampire. The characters seem so real that your may find yourself becoming emotionally attached to them.I like how The Vampire Lestat, explores the character of Lestat on a much deeper level. Many questions that were not anwsered in Interview are anwsered in this book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice's book The Vampire Lestat is just as riveting as Interview with the Vampire. In this book Lestat is an arrogant vampire who loves pissing off the elder vampires, as well as the fledglings (young vampires); he just doesn't follow the rules. Now you would think that being a vampire means you would be free, that's not how Rice describes immortality, Lestat is the vamp we all loved in Interview with the Vampire and now there is a whole book about him. Can you imagine what that is like? Well you don't have to just read the book. Rice takes you all around the world. Her tale starts in the province of Auvernge, France then takes you on a wild journey through Paris, Cairo, and Rice goes back 1800 years to tell the story of Marius (one of the \\"Children of Millennia\\"), and Rice tells of Armand who was about 300 years old at the time. Lestat has some companions in this book. There is Gabrielle, Lestat's mortal mother, who was dying so Lestat gave Gabrielle the \\"Dark Trick\\", as Armand called it, by draining her almost to the point of death then told her to drink his blood which turns her into a \\"Child of Darkness\\" . Nicholas, who was Lestat's mortal friend, then Lestat turns Nicholas into a vampire because he was going to die anyway. Louis who was the protagonist in Interview with the Vampire that Lestat also gave the \\"Dark Trick\\" comes near the end of the tale which by the way Lestat is writing as he recalls it. Then he comes out of the book and becomes a rock star.I found this to be one of the best vampire books I have ever read. I found the past sections to be more interesting than the present sections. I found I was also partial to the sections that had Akasha and Enkil in them (the mother and father), because if any thing happens to them then it happens to all vampires. The only thing Rice could have done better was to go more in depth on the way that vampires were first created. That would be the only improvement area."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice, one the best-selling authors of our time, continues the vampire chronicles with a second novel, The Vampire Lestat. A branch-off of Interview with a Vampire, The Vampire Lestat more closely explores the character Lestat de Lioncourt, a 200 year old vampire from France. The beautifully written piece introduces readers to a man haunted by his past, present, and future. Each time the novel is read, the reader's understanding becomes clearer and the story is brought to life by Rice's extraordinary talent.The story starts in 1980's New Orleans. Lestat narrates from his own perspective. He has been asleep underground for years and awakens to a world filled with pain and noise. Rice weaves through time during the story, going from 1989 New Orleans to France in the 1700's. Lestat tells of his strange childhood and relationship with his mother, Gabrielle. Very close to death, she is later turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is suddenly struck by her beauty and cannot bring himself to call her \\"mother.\\" He also introduces the character, Nicholas, with whom he had a very strange relationship with homosexual undertones. Marius, an \\"ancient\\" and Lestat's maker, reveals to him all secrets of the vampires. Lestat becomes the only vampire younger than 500 years old to know where all vampires come from. He rebels against the \\"ancients\\" and begins to tell the vampire secrets in the form of songs and books. Lestat's rebellious spirit puts him in grave danger and he soon rouses the queen of all vampires, Akasha.Anne Rice uses colorful words and settings to deliver the feeling of being down south and the busy market-place of 18th century France. As the story changes pace, the reader is never left confused because of the smooth transitions between past and present. Rice links fiction and fact together with references to Bram Stoker, author of Dracula. Lestat's relationships with various people give insight on his still human-like persona. He loves with all of his being and experiences pain like other humans. To hold on to human emotions after one is turned into a vampire is both a blessing and a curse.Lestat shows a need to love and be loved. Rice sheds new light on the \\"regular\\" vampire. There are none of the old clich&eacute;s about vampires. Lestat knows the secret to vampires' existence and his knowledge seems to set him apart from others. I have read The Vampire Lestat at least six times, and each time is better than the last. There is something about vampire novels that catch my attention. I sometimes wonder why vampires drink from the neck and not some other location of a major vein. Rice's novels give me insight on many questions. She makes the marvelous world of vampires almost seem real.Science fiction, horror, and fantasy works let readers escape normal situations of normal life. Writers can create unimaginable worlds in which all problems evade us. For many, the vampire chronicles are not merely read for entertainment. They become a way for readers to delve into the mind of a truly wonderful,\\" artist,\\" Anne Rice."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In a 14 year old girl's opinion, this book is absolutely fantastic. Anne Rice expressed the character Lestat so vividly that one would be convinced that she IS the vampire Lestat and that she HAS entered the fascinating yet frightening world of vampires. Never have I ever read a book so enchanting... it literally brings you to a different world(and time)... a world of fantasy and horror. Awesome. I have to admit that the starting didin't so-called &quot;catch&quot; me at first, but as I descended deeper into the book, I was totally immersed in it. The description is, as I have described in the one- line summary above, wonderful. And the characters.. they are unique and different in their own way, standing out from the boring &amp; uninteresting &quot;personalities&quot; in other horror stories I have read. Anne Rice is truely a marvellous author. This book is like a drug- it works like nicotine, addicting you to it. One has to read to believe. Please believe me- &quot;! savour&quot; it !"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I struggled and forced myself to get through this one, yes for two years! I know of two others who put it down at least four years ago never to pick it back up The bad boy Lestat became so overly passionate I was hoping another character would put him out of his misery, soon! By the end I realized the whole book was setting up all those lovely characters to come in QOTD. If one choses to buy this book, I highly suggest to also buy Queen of the Damned at the same time. When I finished the book at 3a.m. I was immediately on-line ordering QOTD, and I can say that was a treacherous two weeks of waiting! If nothing else skip Lestat altogether and go right to QOTD."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat reads as a very slow philosophical autobiography. I've read lots of 1000 novels that move more quickly. This book is much more of a history than a story."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I first read &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; about seven or eight years ago. Since then, I have become a big fan of Anne Rice's novels, and this book in particular has become one of my favorites. &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; is an exquisitely worded novel about a mortal who becomes a vampire after killing a pack of wolves in the forests in pre-Revolutionary France. In the book, Lestat narrates his &quot;life&quot; after transformation. Those of you who are not familiar with Anne Rice's style of writing might be rolling your eyes right now and saying, &quot;Oh, brother! Not another cheesy vampire novel?&quot; Well, you would be wrong! Rice writes in a way that makes your mouth salivate for more of her juicy morsels. Her words drip with richness and clarity. When she describes Lestat feeding upon his victims, Magnus' leap into the fire, or Armand's underground coven, you can envision her images so clearly it is as if you are actually there. Her language is so lush and awash with beauty that it seduces you and blinds you to the atrocities of the events within this book. This is not a cheapie dime-store horror novel or even a romantic love story. It is a seduction of your imaginaiton. Succumb to it and read this book!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This was a pretty good read; however, I liked the first and third books of this series better."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I'm reviewing this book a bit late, seeing as how I read it first in 1997. But this is my favorite book of all time, along with Vampire Hunter D Volume 2: Raiser of Gales, and Bram Stoker's Dracula. Obviously I'm a vampire fan, right? So please, remember that when reading this review.But I'm reviewing this because I just re-read this book in anticipation to my first trip to New Orleans. Homo-eroticism aside, which this book has plenty, is my favorite fantasy story that I've read. Anne's take on the vampire folklore we all know seems as if she'd created the myth herself.I can go on and on about the intracasies of this novel, but what's the point? I simply love it, and I wanted to share that with you. Apparently I'm not that great of a reviewer, but the fact that this book has been apart of my life for so long should tell you that it's pretty magical. I've read all of the Vampire Chronicles books, save the last one, Blood Canticale. And I stopped there because, until recently, I was under the assumption that Anne was never going to write another vampire book again.But, I may be wrong. Lestat may live on in at least one more book. So start here, with The Vampire Lestat, like I did. Then, if you're still interested, pick up Interview with the Vampire. It's a wonderful universe she's designed."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I didn't know anything about Lestat besides what I had seen in the 'interview' movie with Tom Cruse playing Lestat. Now, when I read about Lestat, I see TC. anyway, this is for the ULTIMATE Vampyre fan that detests anything that has to do with SPARKLES!!!!!!!!You won't find an Edward here, thank god. I much prefer these over Twilight any day of the week. I much prefer Lestat and his flamboyant persona to any sparkling gay dude who THINKS he's a vamp.This is enjoyable. READ IT. Read it!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"'The Vampire Lestat' was the first Anne Rice I read (including 'Interview with the Vampire') and I thought it was fantastic!!!Really more of a prequel than a sequel to 'Interview' it's Lestat's story from the events that lead him to becoming a vampire, to the ones he made and the events that followed. Inside his own tale is that of other ancient vampires and their own lives. It gives a history to the myth and a voice to the characters. Towards the end Lestat briefly tells his own version of the events that occurred in 'Interview' which, along with the rest of the book, allow you to sympathise with him more than you'd ever believe you could.Although part of the horror genre I wouldn't say it's particularly scary. Instead it's full of depth and character. It had me gripped from the very beginning and wouldn't let me go until I'd finished it.A brilliant book, I only hope \`Queen of the Damned' can live up to it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Louis had him pegged all wrong in \\"Interview With A Vampire\\". To sum this novel up in the shortest way possible......blood, love and rock & roll.Let Lestat seduce you with his wicked tounge. See the story again, but from his side this time. Learn new faces and experience the thrill of the Dark Gift. Experience the broken hearts and the new mysteries that come into play.A damn good read!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Over half a century after retreating underground, the vampire Lestat emerges in 1984, and liking what he sees - motorcycles, black leather, and the embrace of sensuality - begins to plan his triumphant re-entrance into society by joining a rock band and writing his autobiography.In Interview With the Vampire, Lestat is portrayed by his fledgling Louis as a shallow dandy, yet hearing his own story goes a long way towards redeeming his character. We first learn of his origins as the angry, dissatisfied son of an ignorant country marquis, his escape to a Paris theatre with his cynical violinist friend Nicolas, and his birth as a vampire there. We learn that he is just as passionate and obsessed with love, art, beauty, and humanity as is Louis; he suffers much of the same moral suffering and questioning but handles them with the desperately indomitable panache that one grows to expect of the fiery Lestat.Much of the remainder of the book could almost be called \\"Interview with Several Other Vampires,\\" in which Lestat, searching Europe and finally Egypt for the origins of his race, hears the tales of his fellow vampires, including that of the beautiful, twisted Armand, who is far from the sorrowful angel that Louis sees him as. Finally, Lestat closes with his own account of Louis' story in IWTV, resolving many of the mysteries there, then rushes forward once more to the modern day with a cliff-hanging description of his first, triumphant rock concert.The Vampire Lestat is nothing less than a vampire saga, with excellent characterization and no shortage of lush historical detail. Rice's writing may be heavy on introspection, yet her fluid style reads easily, and epitomizes Gothic style without becoming excessive or pretentious. The only parts that bothered me, in fact, were the rather ostentatiously self-conscious modern parts, especially the opening pages, but once the narration moves into the actual story, it's impossible not to lose oneself in the elegant, seductive character that is Lestat."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I cannot praise this book enough! I love this book! This was the first Anne Rice book I read and it instantly made me a fan. I have read her other novels but TVL will always be my favorite. I also love the character of Lestat. Lestat will always be my favorite character. He's so human and so supernatural at the same time. I absolutely could not stop reading this book! This book takes you to another dimension. If I had a choice, I would rate this an infinite number of stars. It's that amazing! Please read this book!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After reading Rice's THE WITCHING HOUR, I have become one of her many fans. Honestly speaking, THE VAMPIRE LESTAT is a lot more interesting than her first novel. I really like the plot twists and the suspense parts. Rice usually gets carried away with her imageries, so for those who hate long, narrative imageries, then this is not the book for you. The author tends to describe every detail possible to help her readers understand the situation, however, sometimes she overdoes it. Overall, TVL is an interesting, work of art."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I found this book very inspiring. I have been told that I am like Lestat, and I see myself in him. That is why I found him inspiring. The only difference really is that he is a dark romantic and I am just a romantic and he is avampire and I am a mortal. I break rules too. I foolow my heart, and I would love to see a movie made on this book but get someone else other than Tome Cruise"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is the very best of all Anne Rice' writings of the supernatural. Again, here, she exercises her immense talent for empathy and expression of the inner thoughts and feelings of a character. Her language flows beautifully, and is loaded with sensory detail. Lestat lives on the pages; a sympathetic and poignant character.This is a fascinating and rich tale, loaded with historical detail, with the taste and feel of reality. I found this by far the best of the Vampire Chronicles, and, in all her supernatural works, approached only by The Witching Hour. It was surpassed only by Rice' historical fiction, Cry to Heaven and Feast of All Saints, to be precise."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is one of my favorite Anne Rice novels. The beginning seemed kinda slow, but overall, the book is good. I liked it. It picks up after Lestat is turned into a Vampire. &quot;THOSE WHO MUST BE KEPT&quot; was truly a wonder. This book completely won me over, and it is the reason why I read the rest of her Vampire Cronicles. Great book, slow beginning, but... still... I liked it.It's worth the buy, guys."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"What a fabulous book! This book is definitely worth buying- I've read it over twenty times. It's absolutely fabulous. I didn't truly like &quot;Interview&quot; (although that's probably because I saw the movie first) and it was my very first Anne Rice book, but I read TVL and I foumd it to be my favorite book ever. This book is most definitely one of the best! From his castle to Paris, to Cairo, to the Greek island of Marius, to New Orleans and finally to San Francisco, every adventure of Lestat's and every page in this book is enchanting and fabulously written. Definitely a favorite!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Admittedly, I didn't like Lestat after the first book, but my misgivings were rapidly dispelled with the pouring forth of sentimnets by the &quot;brat prince&quot;. Anne Rice effortlessly brings us into the world, not just of vampires, but of anyone who has wondered on the meaning of life. Afterall, like Lestat has termed the &quot;malady of mortality&quot; can besett us. We inherently believe in the goodness of man, that he seeks to live a full life in the best way he knows how. Only here, the supposedly evil nature of the vampire provides the contrast, and hence, the dilemma which huants the living days (or nights, in this case) of the vampires. A final comment for now, though I'd probably contribute more in future, this isn't just about vampires, but &quot;the human spirit put to the test of time to more fully become the person that you would be given infinite time&quot;, to paraphrase Anne Rice."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"One night, in 1996, I was looking through a carton of used books that my Grandmother sent me. She didn't want them any more, so whichever ones I wanted, I would keep and I would trade the rest for new books. Well, sandwiched between a cheesy romance novel and a book about detective cats, a very worn gold book caught my attention. It was an original copy if Interview with the Vampire. After devouring it in 2 nights I immediatly went out and bought The Vampire Lestat. I read that one even quicker. After having read all of Anne Rice's books, I have concluded that Lestat is the best one. I was completely transported into his world. When he was in the old castle in France, watching his creator destroying himself, I could feel the smoke from the fire burning my eyes. When he describes his thirst, my throat aches for relief. This book takes you away to another realm where Lestat is king and Gabrielle is his Queen, and Anne Rice is God."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have read this book at least 5 times and will probably read it again. Lestat is such a great character because he will do anything (and I mean anything!) Forget the movie that Tom Cruise ruined (who else here thinks that Julian Sands should have been Lestat?) and read this book. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is the best book I have ever read, and I have read a lot of books. It is so enthralling that putting it down is impossible! When I was reading it, I was completely seeing through the eyes of Lestat, feeling the pain and happiness, almost tasting the blood of mortals. I could perfectly picture being onstage, having all those eyes on me. It was almost as if I was there.....While I was taking a break, I found myself assuming the attitude of whatever character I was thinking of. When it was over, I was thrilled to find out that there was another book.....Queen of The Damned. You should read The Vampire Lestat, if you don't you are missing a lot."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I very much enjoyed reading this sequel to &quot;Interview With the Vampire&quot;. Anne Rice has a splendid literary voice and each passage in &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; has a sensual, dreamlike quality that more than makes up for a lack of realism in this novel. I appreciate how Rice attempts to write a complete history of Vampires with Lestat as the catalyist here. This novel is ambitious and Rice succeeds in creating her Vampire world while making it &quot;deep&quot; enough to revisit again and again. This is not your average &quot;vampire on the loose, let's put a stake in his heart&quot; story as everyone is familiar with; it is an examination of what might happen if immortals walked the earth and lived their conflicted lives as nearly-omnipotent beings in a world where they must remain hidden or face desruction. These Vampires are mostly egomaniacal, yet are forced by their very nature to &quot;cower and hide&quot; before the masses of &quot;inferior&quot; humans; an interesting paradox and Rice handles the concept well without becoming trite. I would reccomend this novel to anyone looking for the elusive creature that is &quot;fantasy-horror&quot;."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice, author of the Vampire Chronicles, is one of the most profound, heart felt authors ever. This being the second in the series, it directly follows INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE, and articulates on the life of the main character Lestat. This book is so well written from part to part, the detail, the mental images (sometimes a bit disturbng, and the very changing and involved storyline make this one of the best books you will ever read. I have read many of Rice's novels and this is truely her heavy hitter."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This was my second favorite in the 'Vampire Chronicles', 1st only by 'The Queen of the Damned'. It was well written so much different than the 1st book 'Interview with a Vampire'. Although well written it didn't pack the same punch that 'Lestat' had."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is where you first really get to know Lestat. I fell in love. There aren't any characters that I like as well as him."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I'm a bit wreary of sequels, this sounds exactly the type heading for disaster. First of all, it all sound too familiar to the 1st tale, to the point where some facts in the 1st was changed. Granted, Louis and Lestat had difference perspectives and would tell the same tale of the time they were together differently. But Lestat as a vampire with human qualities, searching for knowledge about their kind? That sounds a lot like Louis re-hashed. I liked the fact that Lestat was different, that all the characters were vampires with their own characteristics. I would have liked to hear the tale of Lestat, as he was.But, hearing all the rave reviews, I will give this book a try if it's at the library. If not, I can pass just as well."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I read this four times, it was the most fantastic book I never rea"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"IN THIS BOOK LESAT PURES OUT HIS LIFE AS A VAMPIRE AND HIS ROAD DOWN THE YEARS."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"THIS BOOK WAS TOTALY AMAZING!!! I LOVED INTERVIEW WITH THE VAMPIRE AND I LOVED THE VAMPIRE LESTAT EVEN MORE!!!!! IT RULES BABY!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"THE ONLY GOOD POINT ABOUT THIS BOOK IS THE FIRST 20 PAGES AND THE LAST 20 PAGES. ANN RICES DOES IT AGAIN, THAT IS RIGHT TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY A WASTED READ. I FIRST READ INTERVIEW AND ONE OF MY FRIENDS SAID THAT IS THE WORST ONE AND ALL OF THE OTHERS ARE OUTSTANDING BOOKS, BUT AFTER READING THE 2ND NOVEL IN THE VAMPIRE CHRONICLES I MUST SAY I WILL NOT READ ANOTHER. ANN RICE IS A VERY BORING WRITTER AND I DON'T SEE WHY SO MANY PEOPLE LOVE HER NOVELS. OBVIOUSLY YOU PEOPLE GIVING HER ALL OF THESE 5 STAR RATINGS HAVE NEVER READ A GOOD NOVEL."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"My girlfriend wanted me to read this, and i wanted to like it. Let me give the uninitiated a brief glimpse of the book; it goes something like this:-Start: Exciting, swift, entertaining........starts to go on a bit.......long periods of yawning and feeling guilty for skim reading page after page.......gets better again :EndThere it is, no more no less. Not a great masterpiece of literature as some believe (If you'd ever read one you'd probably know). Average, long winded. I could try and tell you why, but the book has left me so exhausted that i am not going to waste any more effort on it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I wasn't expecting to be so enthralled with this book. I was always more interested in the books that pertained to the Mayfair Witches than the Vampire Chronicles, but this book really drew me in. After reading Lestat's tale, I truly feel I have a better grasp of who he really is, or at least who he started out as. I must admit to being devastated when Nikki's character was \\"removed\\" from the story. I felt that Anne could have left him in and brought him back from time to time. The graphic description of the moments in the tower with Lestat just before Nikki was transformed leaves nothing to be desired, and leaves nothing but desire! I have to assume that they were lovers though she only hints at that. This book did not have the steamy erotic scenes other books are so famous for, but believe me, she gives plenty of illusion to it. Sometimes its better to imagine whats really happening than to just read it right out. You definately get that here. You will also gain a better understanding of Louis and his character than you get just by reading Interview. I must admit that I was somewhat surprised at the way Louis manipulated that story. I do feel differently about Lestat after reading this. I always had a really hard time loving Lestat's character, now I understand why he does what he does. Losing Nikki jaded him in a way that probably affected him more profoundly than anyting that happened after. This book would work perfectly as a stand alone because the story is just that good!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This second book of the Vampire Chronicles is by far superior to Interview. Each character that touches Lestat's life is beautifully fleshed out, and made as real as Lestat himself. It's wonderful to have this book turn your feelings for a character completely around, because in Interview, Lestat is made out to be such the bad guy, or at least someone who is not very nice. This story turns it around, and you learn who Lestat is, and why he did what he did to Louis in Interview. I can only strive to someday have a book written that is as wonderfully descriptive and full of every emotion possible as Anne Rice did with this book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I highly recommend this book, and the rest of the series, to anyone and everyone who likes drama and vampires.The Story of Marius and his relationships with Lestat stand out. A great book! A must read!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice is really just amazing. The way she writes, she really doesnt skip a beat. Every detail...it just pulls you in. You wont stop reading this book until you have finished. You really grow to love The Vampire Lestat...for me, more so then The Interview with the vampire. This is NOT a vampire love story. So if thats what youre looking for turn the other way. Its the story of Lestats life-and life after death. A classic."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"one of the greatest books ever written; i re-read it now and again, i forget how many times, now. it has it all: it has great writing, so vivid that you feel like you are \\"there\\", plus the descriptions are incredible, and the other characters-friends, enemies, loved ones- are each unique and deeply interesting. and of course, of all the characters anne rice has created, lestat is the greatest. he is so well described; through time you understand him more and more, thru so many layers- he seems very real....... well, that could just be me.lestat has a very detailed back story, a torrent of encounters, adventures, and interactions with other fascinating characters, and he narrates his own story. the story goes back and forth in time, never letting up for a minute- there is no down time in this book. although the book is a bit dated as far as technology, it is a real classic, and i can't recommend it highly enough.i have read all of the books anne rice has written, and this is my favorite (maybe you can tell). the tone, story, and the characters, are all different in the first book in the series, \\"interview with a vampire\\". \\" the vampire lestat\\", the second book, changes all that, the perspective is completely different. lestat is a different character all together. don't let that stop you. each can be appreciated in it's own way.....but i am much more a fan of the second book, tvl. i love the sarcastic, passionate, wildly adventerous, intelligent, sensuous, and just plain off the wall, lestat. you'll see, you'll fall under his spell, too......"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is one of my favorites. Lestat is one of the best characters I have ever read. This is a thrilling ride through the supernatural that will leave you wanting more... good thing there are MANY more."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"It has been said over and over that this was a dark story. I say there was nothing dark about it. Deep, maybe, but dark... only if one thinks so. \\"Drag Me to Hell\\" or \\"Let the Right Hand In\\"--paranormal psychological horror...that's dark and that is not \\"The Vampire Lestat\\". It is, however, a deep historical, mythological vampire fiction with homosexual, incestuous undertones (more frilly & fluffy). I'm not going to write any spoilers, but just to let you know, this is 70% mythological vampire history; 20% Lestat's past history and 10% present day Lestat... and let us not forget Lestat's rock band--the best part of the story (I pictured something in my imagination like Def Leppard (rock \`n roll forever)) . To me, the writing of this novel comes off as pretentious, but most reviews see it as elegant prose. I just didn't get it...I guess the climax was towards the end because most of it was fictional history being narrated until the last Act. The story line was not an easy-flowing-exciting story; I actually got bored (read 9 other novels within 2 weeks before I finished this book). Anne's descriptive writing was really good (but the story was all over the place and off track) and that's why it got 3 stars. I loved \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" and \\"The Queen of the Damned\\" but I was very disappointed with this book because the story was nothing like what the title alluded to."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is a great book. I just read Interview with a Vampire, and am planning on reading the entire series. I truly hope the entire series is as good as the first two books."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is my clear favorite of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles series. The book provides the history of Letstat as a pre-vampire youth in France and his eventual unforseen turn into a vampire. Rice captures the heart of the classic narcassist in Lestat - equal parts ego and self-loathing. It is a grand book and a must read for any vampire literature fan. Five Stars."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This Lestat bears very little resemblance to the creature we are introduced to in Interview with the Vampire. I wanted to kick that Lestat in the crotch. This Lestat, I want to offer my neck to. While the author does try to explain pieces of his behavior in her last novel as misunderstandings and ignorance on the part of Louis, I don't really buy it. I think it would have been more congruent to character to introduce an entirely different vampire and ascribe these experiences to him.I would have liked to have had more of this book take place in the present, as I feel the conception of his musical group and his reasons for wanting to reveal himself are not really explained. While I enjoyed very much the stories of Lestat's and Marius's pasts, I felt that they went on rather longer than necessary. I read this as an e-book and even in Microsoft Reader, it was 908 pages!I am enthralled with Akasha, however, and am very much looking forward to reading Queen of the Damned."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is another masterpiece, magnifying the fun of the first volume by adding to the mystery of these blood-sucking immortals. THe sense of passing life - this time from Roman times - is enthralling and wonderfully evocative. Lestat turns out to be not such a bad guy, but far more sympathetic once you learn of his anguished background as the rebel of a declining aristocratic family in pre-revolutionary France. It is so believable!And the amazing images and scenes continue: Lestat screaming so loudly in a theatre that the audience runs away; Lestat and his friend getting drunk and beating their heads at the realization of the meaningless of life; the oedipal kissing when he turn his mother into a vampire. The characters in this one are still changing, with facets still being revealed at multiple levels.It all adds up to a sense of wonder, which is Naipaul's definition of a succesful novel. Bravo!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Vampire Lestat had a lot more potential than realized by the author I feel. Unlike Interview With A Vampire, where we are allowed to see a wide range of things from one person's perspective in Lestate, we are more hindered by his arrogant blabberings. The story is powerful, moving and potent but so overshadowed by the main character's ego that all else pales and soffocates quickly. Characters who might prove rewarding in future tales or who might add more flavour had they been more investigated are actually down played or under exposed. Nothing outshines, out classes or out ranks Lestat which is painfully clear throughout the book. He seems to over power the entire story, even when he is not the subject at hand (which albeit is rare)."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I rate books three ways: it's a book 1)to forget about as quickly as possible 2)fine for a quick easy read, entertaining enough but not worth reading twice 3) amazing, unique, well written, worth reading again and again because each time the book becomes richer. Anne Rice's books are in general a 2. Her ideas are imaginative and unique, so it's unfortunate that her writing style is a little self indulgent. Interview with a Vampire was fine, but ,my God, I had to force myself to finish this second in the series. Furthermore, I find that her charcters have no depth and eventually become worn out. Plus, I have no sympathy for any of them, so it's hard to get involved with the book. However, if you don't expect a piece of literature or don't even want one, then it's fine. You won't be worse off for reading any of the Vampire Chronicals."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book will make you think differently about both Louis and Lestat. From Interview with the Vampire, we got Louis's story and saw Lestat through his eyes. But Louis' story was from his own perspective, colored by his own perception. And there was quite a lot that he failed to perceive and understand about Lestat. Louis, like so many, doesn't understand Lestat because they cannot see past his facade. Even Louis' ingenious and beautiful depth pales in comparison to Lestat's. Louis' sadness is there for all to see, while Lestat feels just as deeply as Louis, and can feel that same sorrow and despair, and does indeed feel lost, but he also has a charming, fun-loving, charismatic side as well. Lestat puts on his seemingly uncaring, charismatic, charming facade, and it hides all the pain, sorrow, loneliness, and melancholy he feels. In this book, that facade is lifted and we see the real, true Lestat, and delve deep into his character, his personality, his past, his psychology, his philosophy and self-discovery, and his feelings of alienation and being the outsider in a world that makes no sense.Lestat is aware of the absurdity and is apart and detached from it, yet he watches it keenly and knowingly participates in it too; he sees it all as a carnival of sorts. Lestat now gets a chance to tell his own story, and it makes us realize that he has suffered even more than Louis and shows that he is not a villain; he is the tragic hero. He is actually far more aware than Louis, something else that Louis doesn't see either. He is a gentle, innocent, young man who has suffered so much in his life, and then he is forced into becoming one of the living dead, who must walk on the dark side and kill to survive. It is explained to us why Lestat is the way he is and why he does the things he does, and the hints given about his character in Interview with the Vampire are all elucidated and brought together to make sense like pieces of a puzzle falling into place. After I read Interview with the Vampire, I could sympathize with Louis and understand his character and how he felt. Lestat, from Louis's perspective, is left as an enigma, someone who is intriguing and shrouded in mystery, and leaves you wanting to know more about him and make sense of the fragments and glimpses we see of him from someone else's eyes. It is obvious (though some readers entirely miss it) that there is much, much more than meets the eye about Lestat from the way Louis described him, yet Louis cannot see the whole picture.Therefore, Lestat is misunderstood by Louis, and therefore misunderstood by the reader, whom is seeing the story through Louis' eyes. The glimpses of Lestat we have in Interview with the Vampire, of his relationship with his father, of the way he acts, of his charm that Louis finds both fatally attractive and repulsive, of his love of bright artificial light and his desire to live luxuriously, of his friendship with a young musician, of his doting upon Claudia and showering her with gifts, of his fear to lose Louis, of him emotionally distraught and pleading with Louis to come back to him in Paris, and finally of the frail, broken, and pitiful shadow of a man he has become by the end of Louis's story, where Louis finds him again in New Orleans. All of these things are hints at the depth and complexity of the character of Lestat. In The Vampire Lestat, you will finally see the entire picture, and see the masterpiece of a character that Lestat is. The depth and the multi-dimensionality, and the humanity of Lestat. If you liked Louis before, you will still like him. But you will like Lestat even more because you will see how completely misunderstood he is and learn the story of the pain and sorrow he kept hidden in his heart, hidden underneath that charming facade that Louis encountered on his plantation in 1791.All the things Lestat never told Louis, about himself, about his life, about how he truly felt. There is far more to him than his charisma, ego, and pride, and seeming carelessness that Louis sees. We find out that Lestat not only cares, in fact, he cares too much. And you will realize how much Lestat loves Louis, and longs for Louis too love and understand him. Behind Lestat's seemingly charismatic, too-sure-of-himself facade, there is a gentle and afraid, lonely soul who longs to be loved and understood. It is not Louis's fault that there was a rift between him and Lestat, because Louis had his own troubles and his own pain, but perhaps he should have been more perceptive and given Lestat more of a chance, especially when Lestat pleaded with him to come back in Paris in the 1860s. Louis belonged with Lestat, not Armand. Lestat fears to lose Louis like he lost his first and only friend, Nicolas. His relationship with Nicki had a lot to do with shaping how he becomes later. You realize that before he met Nicki, Lestat was a complete anti-social loner. He lived with his oppressive family in Auvergne, always misunderstood, never belonging. He was never encouraged and always treated cruelly. He felt trapped, miserable, and all alone. With Nicki, he finally found someone who understood him, cared for him, and loved him. And that is really the only time in his life he's happy. Eventually, he will lose his life as he knows it and he will lose his only friend, and find himself alone again. But this time he does something different in creating the facade he creates. This time he hides his true feelings with charm and charisma and goes through his new vampire life surrounded by many yet all alone inside. You will realize that underneath that facade, Lestat is still that sensitive boy who longs to be loved and understood, who feels immense sadness and sorrow, who feels lost and once again, completely alone. You will realize that his relationship with Louis, and really everything he does after he loses Nicki, is a futile attempt to re-live and re-create in some way what he once had, the only time in his life he felt happy, those last few years of his mortal life.If you really came to understand and like, and feel for the character Louis (like I did), then you will feel for and understand Lestat just as much if not more. You will still like Louis and feel for him, but you will see all that he failed to perceive and failed to understand about Lestat. It is ironic how in later books, Louis berates Lestat about always being a monster. Lestat is even more human and has always been more human than Louis, and Louis fails to see and understand Lestat. Lestat is the hero whom perseveres despite everything that is thrown at him, despite his pain, his sorrow, his suffering. He always has the will and courage to go on and make the best of what cruel fate has given him. He is constantly making his way in the world and will not be defeated. He is the eternal warrior, with the intelligence and courage to laugh at the absurdity of this world, and see it for the savage garden it is. I think that is the way Anne Rice meant it to be, since Lestat is the main character of her Chronicles, and therefore he is the hero and the protagonist of her works in their entirety. This book will make you feel sympathy for him and empathize with him. You will feel for him, cry with him, laugh with him.Anne Rice is a literary genius, from my point of view, the best author of this era (second half of 20th century and after). In her books, you will find so much depth, so much meaning, so much philosophical, intellectual, and literary value. Her novels are on the level with classics such as Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. I use this example because Rice's vampires (just like the creature in Frankenstein) are symbols, an allegory for those who don't fit in, who feel apart from this world, for those who look around and struggle in this journey, trying to makes sense of a world that is often senseless and meaningless, feeling alienated and detached from society. Therefore I strongly recommend anyone who appreciates literature and thinks deeply to read her novels. And after reading this particular book, Lestat might just become one of your favorite literary/fictional characters of all time."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is a very crucial part of the Vampire Chronicles. If someone has already read one or more of the other books in the series and they are still curious about some things, this is the book they should read. Since it is the second book in the series, it will fill the reader in on a lot of unanswered questions they may have. It is like the reader is taking in all this valuable history about the tale, and so it is very hard to take breaks from reading it.In this absorbing novel, Anne Rice tells about the main character Lestat's past experiences, thoughts and personality in great detail. This book tells how Lestat became a vampire and about many of his early adventures. This helps the reader understand more about why Lestat acts the way that he does, and so the other books will make more sense. New characters are introduced, and old ones are brought back in a thrilling new setting. It is sometimes like a flashback that will go back to ancient Egypt or old France because the tale is being told by Lestat. Other times it is modern. For instance, towards the end, the setting changes to Lestat's band performing in the present. The relationships between each of the characters are deeply emphasized, which adds to the dramatic way the important facts of the tale are explained. More towards the beginning of the book, Lestat tells about his immense love for his mother, Gabrielle, and how he \\"saves\\" her from death of an illness. The Vampire Lestat is a chapter in the Vampire Chronicles which should not be left unread.Anne Rice uses insightful and understandable metaphors that make the reader really feel the mood of the story. The theme is strong, and all readers will be able to relate to the struggles of the characters. It makes the reader think about the meaning of life. The Vampire Lestat is an unforgettable read. It is well worth the seven dollars and ninety-nine cents one must pay to obtain it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is my favorite among the vampire chronicles.If you haven't read it well I definitely recommend that you should try to get hold of it quick.It will be an experience you will never forget.(a must for all Anne Rice fans) Lestat shines in this novel.You will fall in love with this immortal as he takes you to a journey back when he was still a boy killing a pack of wolves up to the present-day San Francisco where he is a rock star adored by millions of fans. This book has kept me poring over its pages till the very last chapters.It has kept me awake even in the wee hours of midnight.I just couldn't put it down !! I felt emotionally drawn to this book.The thoughts and emotions of Lestat are so bitterly raw and real.During the most tumultous times of his life,it was like I also felt part of his pain and sorrows.My heart cried out for him when Louis and Claudia left him to rot in the swamp and when he heard the news about Nicholas' death. There are many good parts in this book.Among my favorites are the ones when Lestat made her mother Gabrielle into another one of his kind,his mortal days as the actor Lelio in a theatre in Paris and when he played the violin in front of the shrine of the King and Queen. There are no dull moments in this book.It can mesmerize and captivate the minds and hearts of its readers in a way that only Anne Rice can. Lestat will truly live on through the pages of the preternatural world.Long live Lestat !

Can I exude an evil and yet sensuous aura if I do this with my lips and then hold out my hand as if recieving a diamond pineapple? Is Rice trying to frighten me or drive me nuts alltogether? I don't know...I find it all very silly. As for the story itself it does bear a certain romantic gravity. And she does draw some fantastic images and pose some interesting philosophy. At times it is entertaining but the grandiloquence overwhelms. Somehow I made it through the whole thing...whatever that tells you."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice is a writer with a brilliant command of language. The Vampire Lestat demonstrates her ability to control theme, mood, and setting through word choice and beautiful descriptors. It's a very introspective novel with a great detailing of Lestat's history and how his character developed.If you are looking for a fast-paced, high action novel, this is not for you. It is dark, gothic fantasy at its finest. Who Lestat is, the things he makes happen, and the history of vampire-kind are laid out in prose that reels you in and makes you love Lestat and hate him at times.

I think every son and daughter would apprecitae Lestats love for his mother, a risk to make her one of his kind, which was well worth it. Gabrielle was given another life to be who she wanted to be, this shows Lestat's kind heart. For anyone who has not read this bok, it is a must.

Here, Lestat is a different character - confident, proud and wealthy. Anne conveniently, explains away the contradictions as fabrications and lies from Louis.Lestat takes us on a journey through pre-revolution France and on the Devil's Road right through Europe and Egypt.Here we could see some thought going into the plot, introducing Armand, Marius, Gabrielle and Akasha for future sequels.This is the best of the Vampire Chronicles.

It was just a story. It could have been summed up in 100 pages but instead it dragged on and on. The biggest reason I give this 2 stars is because it is narrated the exact same way Louis narrated in Interview. And it's almost like Rice picked up on this as well because over half way through it's like, &quot;oh by the way, Im a loving emotional guy too.&quot; Huh? Its Louis writing as Lestat!Now I have the next book which continues the story and its twice as long. I only wish I could read as fast as Lestat, but then again I only had to read every other page in this book to know what was going on.

I loved Louis even if he did whine and it was a bit slow in descriptions. I also loved Claudia, but I have a habit of picking characters to love who end up dying. I also loved how evil, mad Lestat was.I loved the beginning of this book where Lestat wakes up and is healed from the events in Interview with the Vampire, but then... we found out that Louis is a complete liar? That Lestat, the evil insane vampire that I originally loved, is a nice guy? He only kills bad guys?So, what Anne Rice is telling us is that Louis is a liar and that the original story that I loved was false. I'm a writer and have learned a few things from readers, they don't like being lied to, or told that they viewed things horribly, horribly wrong. It's sort of like changing Star Wars' The Force from a religious, spiritual power to something biological in the blood. It just hurts and stings. And ticks off readers that liked the original story. Unlike Interview, we don't get any real strong female characters like Claudia. Lestat's mother...it's an interesting concept, but she didn't interest me in anyway. Armand is a child (not the image I saw in my head in Interview, but I'll go with it). Akasha is the queen of the damned, but I can't say I saw enough of her to figure out if I liked her or not.Then there's the whole Satan coven that Armand was leader of. I wanted to hit my head on a wall after hearing these people talked and I couldn't take it seriously. Satan this and satan that. They wouldn't go near a church. God forbid they walk around mortals like Lestat.The homosexuality didn't bother me. I think that's what makes Anne Rice interesting, but if Armand is a child and I'm guessing that his maker is not... I know it's a story, but, really? I'll take in a lot of unbelievable things, but that? Even Let The Right One In didn't turn that into a romantic notion. It kind of creeped me out, but I told myself that this was probably just because of the times. And Claudia does call Louis lover from time to time in Interview.I don't plan on reading any other of Anne Rice's books because this sort of feels like a betrayal for messing with a character that fascinated me because of the fact that he was cruel, sadistic vampire. Instead of evil, mad Lestat, we get this nice guy vampire who likes to be a super hero.I know I'm in the minority on this one, but I couldn't get into the series after being told that the story that I original loved was a lie. The only reason that I'm not giving The Vampire Lestat one star is because the beginning got me thinking that the book was going to get better."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In one sentence, the characters emotions tend to swing from one extreme to another leaving me, the reader, not only uncaring but bored. If I didn't have a life, perhaps it could keep my attention."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I hate to admit it, but when my husband gave me this book for Christmas after it was first published, I couldn't get myself to finish it! Lestat was such a liar in \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" that I just couldn't believe anything he said in this book. Completely irrational, I know. Although, it does go to show what a good book \\"Interview\\" is. Maybe now that I am 20+ years older, I will attempt to read \\"Lestat\\" again. It could be that with those 20+ years, I will be able to get into the book more easily and perhaps even be able to overlook Lestat's shortcomings!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was a nice change from the pervious novel, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". Don't get me wrong, that was a damn fine book! But \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is just so much better!In the book(as you've likely guessed) we're taken into the life(mortal and immortal) of Lestat de Lioncourt. His beginnings as a child to a poor family to his ultimate form as a deadly blood-drinker. From beginning to end this story captured my interests as well as my emotions. I jumped in all the right places and cried at others!The beauty of Anne's writing doesn't stop with this story. Her descriptions are sensuous and detailed. You can feel the velvet between your fingers and smell the laquer of fine French furniture. It's a treat for the mind as well as the senses.And honestly, this book is so well written one might be able to read it without having read its predisessor(although why one would deny themselves such a treat is nothing I can nor want to understand. Ha ha!). So spend the few dollars and enjoy this beautiful story!

Lestate is a beatifull creature full of life that imbodies many generations of learning."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I must say after reading this book I found that Anne Rice knew what she was doing. It gave off a rare sense of vampires actually being human in there vampiric state. That after all they were \\"only Human\\". We got a sense of dred and sourfulness from Lestat that we also got in Interview with a Vampire. WE also got to know Lestat on a very personal level, which most books can not portray with their characters. By the end of the book we are left with wanting more and to be ingrossed into the world of Lestat and vmpires that Anne Rice so beautifully wrote about in this book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Wow. I can't believe there are people who actually hate this book. Boring? Sure, if you have a five-year-old child's attention span. The Vampire Lestat can be somewhat tedious, but I personally enjoyed Lestat's take on the events Louis describes in the first book, Interview with the Vampire. Lestat is optimistic and confident, which is certainly a refreshing change from Louis' \\"blah blah blah I'm so saaaaad...\\" routine. Lestat is one person in the first book, one in this book, and he continues to transform himself in future Vampire Chronicles. That's what makes him a great character, and one of the most fascinating leading men in any movie or book. He is all things and none, he's gay and straight, he's loveable and despicable... but at least he's not simple. PS - It would be a mistake to read this book and never read the rest of the chronicles. Because Lestat keeps changing so much, from moment to moment, you could hate him in this book and love him in the next. And, what some people would call tedious in The Vampire Lestat dissappears in Queen of the Damned, Tale of the Body Thief, and Memnoch the Devil."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I really enjoyed this book. In honest truth I found Interview with the vampire a little boring and hard to read. All Louis does is complain.But in this one we discover a wonderful character. A very different Lestat. One that is not even a shadow of what was described in the 1st vampire cronicle. I cannot wait to read Queen of the dammed if its half as good as this one I shall enjoy it inmensely!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I've read most of the reviews on this book, and I just have to say that if you don't understand the change in Lestat's &quot;persona&quot; from Interview to Lestat, then you don't get it. Besides, don't we always see ourselves differently than others see us anyway? Duh. Would you expect anyone else to write the same biography of you as you'd write in your own autobiography? Long live Anne Rice, and may people be thrilled and captivated by the experience of reading The Vampire Lestat FOREVER."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is the second novel in \\"The Vampire Chronicles\\" exposing the life story of Lestat de Lioncourt from the world first revealed in the prior novel. The writing style is well done with a nice blend of environmental descriptions from several periods in history.Lestat reveals a tale divided into many of parts starting with a reflection on his 1780's human life and bizarre creation into a vampire and continuing shortly past Louis' tale to the publishing year of the novel. The rogue vampire defies tradition, behaving throughout the story in his flamboyant manner as previously described from Louis. He encounters many engaging vampires from all time periods, each with an individual story to help placate Lestat in his quest for knowledge.I was a little disappointed by all the main vampires repeatedly appearing to deeply love or fall deeply in love with everything and everybody. Then a following item or person was more loved and beautiful than the last. Having gone through this with Louis in \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" once was sufficient, however this tenderness was what brought Lestat's attraction to create Louis. What I found primarily disturbing was the incestualish segments relating to the compassionate nature in a vampire mentioned above.The author forgoes some of the traditional limitations found in the vampire genre such as the crucifix, holy water, and garlic, creating her own world where images on reflective surfaces are allowed and being welcomed into the household has no leverage for the residents. The vampires have telepathy and the eldest can perform telekinesis and spontaneous combustion on the younger vampires, abilities I've not encountered in other works. The creation of the original vampires is a distinctive tale, reinforcing the deviation from the customary vampire genre. I believe having certain restrictions on the undead brings some balance to the victims yet the novel isn't as much about the conflict between vampires and humans as it is about internal turmoil and the lifestyle of a vampire.I recommend this book in the series to any fan of the romantic vampire genre.Thank you."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice reveals the early life of Lestat, the vampire who seemed comfortable with his evil nature in \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" Newly arisen in the 1980s after half a century spent underground and contemplating a coming-out that may expose all vampires to the view of modern man, Lestat pens his own account of his early life: his abusive family, his creation as a vampire, his search for attachment and love, his investigation of the history and origins of all vampires. This fuller, more three-dimensional portrayal of Lestat seems revisionist and at odds with many aspects of his character as revealed in the previous novel. For example, I don't recall the Lestat of \\"Interview\\" being so preoccupied with goodness. Nevertheless, it is fascinating story, even though it ends on an inconclusive, unsatisfying note. Akasha and Enkil are truly creepy characters and I look forward to reading more about them in the next volume."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I think this is the best book anne rice has ver written Lestat is awesome character and to see his acount of things was great, to know how he became a vampire and his early life and how things were like they were in interview with the vampire is great it really explains many things we did not understand at first and it shows how a really great character lestat is, this is my favourite book"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lestat is one of the vampires you first meet in Interview With The Vampire. He made Louis a vampire. Since Louis told his story, and Lestat is not one to be out done, Lestat decides to write down his story. The beginning is a bit slow. You're shocked Lestat is a rocker now. You'd think Anne Rice would be out of touch with the world of music, but as you read on you find out it's not a bad choice for the attention craving Lestat.You start off in the present. As anyone who read Interview knows, at the end of that book Lestat could was barely alive and couldn't take care of himself. So, he goes underground. Here's where the tricky part comes. Lestat went to sleep for like 50 years. Meaning Louis couldn't have seen him. You don't think about it at first. You think about it after you've read the book. It really bothers you afterwards. That in my opinion, is the only problem with the book. By the way, even Rice herself admits she made a mistake with that.All throughout the book, you learn of Lestat's past. You learn that he was born into a poor noble family and was taken out of school at an early age. You learn about his early struggles with wanting to be good. I liked his relationship with Nicholas. Nicholas and Louis seem in my opinion very similar. Nicholas' story is sad. It's fascinating how he always wanted attention. That's why he became an actor. Lestat is very close to his mom. He even makes her a vampire.One of the things I really enjoyed about this book is when Lestat talks about what happened in Interview. He sets the record straight. Giving his side on what happened. Once you read his side, you'll never look at him or at Interview the same. Louis was upset and wrote him as a monster. Lestat tells what really happened and his reasoning. Siding that Louis never know his reasons for doing things. Lestat also feels bad for keeping secrets from Louis. Also, Lestat didn't like the way Louis protrated him in Interview...This was a great squel to Interw With The Vampire. You learn about the misunderstood character of Lestat. This is my all time favorite book. I doubt any book will ever take it's place as my favorite book. Why did I give it four stars instead of five? Well, when I first read it I thought it was the best book ever and still do, but that whole time mistake Anne made really upset. I couldn't stop thinking about it. Thinking about who lied? Was Louis about it, or was Lestat denying it? This was the only flaw with the book. Besides for the book being so damn addictive."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is the best book i have read, ever. Although I enjoy all of Anne's writing's more than any other author, this is the best so far. I absolutely love the chronicles. This book is very descriptive to the point you can feel the characters, as if you were them. It is like you know something no one else does, by knowing (Lestat's, for example)thoughts...which are very secretive and intriguing. This book will make you touch bases with a part of your mind you didn't know existed...you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The second book in Rice's vampire series is truly her masterwork. The book follows the mysterious Lestat from his birth into darkness into the life he leads as a creature of night in the most decadent society in history. Many wonderfully thought out characters appear and Rice avoids her earlier tendancies towards angst. The plot moves with alacrity through the years and does not leave you feeling the need to &quot;skip to the good parts&quot; that the previous book did.Rice originally wanted to stop writing the series at this book, but her fans would not allow it. The books after this one are uninteresting trite attemps to appease her fans and have none of the heart and work that this book does. Definitely read this book, but I would recomend you quit at this one. It literally doesn't get any better than this."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Reading Interview with the Vampire, I was intrigued by Lestat, the witty, funny(to me) vampire. I wanted to read more about him, so I waited and waited for it to come in at the library. I read it and couldn't put it down. If you like sleep, dont get this one, if you dont care about your health, get it and stay up till 3:40 am reading this great book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This second book in Anne Rice vampire serie is without a doubt the most important of them all for the vampire fan. However if you don't go crazy for vampire or if your just the average horror novel fan you might find this cult book a little bit hard to read. The main reason for that is that Ann Rice is a descriptive writer and not an action one. So about 90% of the book is pure description of her conception of the &quot;new vampire&quot;. Granted in this book she definetly redefined the vampire hence the popularity of this one on vampire maniacs, however other's might fine the endless description of of the different vampire traits and historic reference a little hard to bear. The best way (and maybe the only way) to read this important work is to take your time, only then will you fully understand the beauty and depth of this masterpiece. Now if you were planing on purchasing the usual action horror/novel that you can finish in a week, you should definetly not buy this one..."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I read this novel after re-reading Interview with the Vampire as part of a campaign to get into the right frame of mind for my first trip to New Orleans (along with novels such as The Moviegoer and A Confederacy of Dunces). I felt that the first novel was a very compelling depiction of the existential dilemmas faced by a vampire based on the assumption that a vampire really could exist in our world. It treated philosophical themes of alienation and isolation in a similar way to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein.The Vampire Lestat deals with many of the same issues from a distinctly different sensibility. Lestat is by no means the same kind of personality as Louis from the first novel. The impression he creates of himself in this first person narrative is also quite different from the way he was portrayed in the first novel. This novel is a very compelling account of how he became a vampire and his search for his ancestors and an explanation of who he really is as a vampire and how he can co-exist with his own kind and even with those who are no longer his kind.This novel deals with homosexuality (as in Lestat's infatuation with vampires Louis, Armand, Marius) and incest (Lestat's relationship with his mother in her vampiric state) in oblique ways because vampires do not engage in sexual activity. Satisfying their blood thirst is the equivalent for them of sexual pleasure.In the midst of Lestat's personal history we encounter other vampires (Armand, Magnus, Marius) and are immersed in their personal history which, for Marius, extends back to pre-Christian Celtic paganism and Egyptian mythology. I began to lose my place within all these background accounts within background accounts and, at times, it was difficult for me to really visualize or grasp conceptually what had happened to bring vampires into existence. Much of this difficulty is probably a weakness on my part rather than of Rice as a writer. I was impressed with the detail of the mythology that she creates, adding textures to a vast, complex tapestry. This kind of inventiveness extends far beyond anything Bram Stoker ever imagined.Despite the fact that I found passages in the novel to be very turgid to wade through I acknowledge that Rice is a very talented writer, both within and beyond her genre. It may be awhile before I resume her vampire series or read anything else that she's written because I have had my fill of vampiric lore for the time being but I do highly recommend the two vampire novels that I have read so far."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Once you start reading you can barely put it down! You can almost smell the incense, see the people, feel the ecstacy of blood. Anne Rice has every last detail in this book. You get lost in the world of Lestat de Lioncourt &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; and his companions. It is so easy to let your imagination go with this one! I can't wait to find out what happens in the next book!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Beautifully written, blending our love of vampires with a spiritual side that is to be highly commended, Anne has given us another treasure! Far from your run of the mill vampire tale, this is a masterpiece. Gripping and impossible to put down. Some people may not like Anne's attention to detail, but I myself love it. This, along with Interview with a Vampire and Memnoch the Devil, are my all time favorites in her Vamipire Chronicles."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is awesome.

The story is ever involving and superbly organized as to welcome our joys in reading. I will have to say that the 'interview with the vampire' film left me with the stale picture of tom as lestat. not a redeemable actor to envision as a vampire. 'How could he portray an age old fiend of suffering?' oh well non the less I cannot deny the high quality craftmanship that was this book and I will continue to read more of her works as this is the first one I endeavored apon.

As he acclimates himself to modern times, he reads the novel dictated by Louis. Partly because he was infuriated by his depiction in Louis's book, Lestat decided to make his own tale clear.As a young man of 20 years, he was a rebellious and frustrated youth, the youngest son of the Marquis d'Auvergne, and the sole provider of meat for his family's table.When despair from the knowledge of the triviality of his life nearly takes away his sanity, Lestat's mother, Gabrielle, urges him and his friend, Nicolas, to go to Paris in search of a new life. Lestat and Nicolas (Nicki) soon find work in a playhouse where the former becomes an actor and the latter, a violinist.Within a few months, Magnus, an elder vampire who seeks an heir, decides Lestat is perfectly eligible in becoming of his kin and brethren, inheriting his wealth.Lestat is kidnapped by Magnus and forcibly made a vampire in Magnus's tower. Magnus leaves Lestat an orphan fledgling and heir to a fortune, as the old vampire destroys himself by going into a huge bonfire on the night of Lestat's making. For the next several months, Lestat diguises his vampiric nature under the pretense of a wealthy gentleman in the courts and palaces of Paris, while discovering the basics of vampirism on his own.When Gabrielle (dying from tuberculosis), arrives at Paris to discover what has befallen him, Lestat grants her the \\"Dark Gift\\" to save her life. This and several other blasphemies lead him to a confrontation with Armand, and the coven vampires of Paris.Lestat scorns the absurdness of the coven's religious-driven ideas and rituals and shocks them with the sensibility of his new ideas. These actions leave the Parisian coven in disarray and Armand, disillusioned. After the coven dissolved, Nicolas, who was held captive by the coven was made by Lestat into a vampire. Armand sought to destroy his coven. The four vampires (Eleni, Laurent, F&eacute;lix, Eug&eacute;nie) who escaped and survived his killing spree went to Lestat for guidance on how they could live in the open and disguise themselves as mortals, something which they had never done before in their vampiric lives. Lestat suggested that they disguised themselves as mummers and gave them a Theatre which he owned, which became the Th&eacute;tre des Vampires. Nicolas joined the theatre as well, and contributed heavily to its success.Armand came to Lestat, lost without the frenzied beliefs of his coven, begging to join him and Gabrielle along their travels. Lestat refused. After learning the story of Armand's beginnings, Lestat leaves Paris in search of Marius, Armand's Maker. Meanwhile, Armand took part in the Theatre des Vampires.Despair once again threatens Lestat's existence. Gabrielle leaves Lestat to explore the world, and Nicolas was burned on stage, unwilling to continue \\"living\\". Lestat goes \\"down into the earth\\" in his misery.Marius rescues Lestat and brings him to his home on an island in the Aegean Sea. This is where Marius tells Lestat the story of his life and in doing so gives a brief and vague explanation on the origins of the vampires. He then offers Lestat an opportunity to drink from Akasha, the Mother of all vampires, which Lestat did. Lestat also managed to wake Akasha (by playing the violin) and drank from her while she drank from him. Enkil, Akasha's King when they were mortals, was greatly angered and moved in an attempt kill Lestat. Marius rescues Lestat from Enkil and was forced to send Lestat away to quell Enkil's rage.From Greece, Lestat travels to New Orleans, and after the events in Interview with the Vampire, he \\"goes into the earth\\" again in 1929. In 1984, Lestat emerges to become a rock star with a mortal band that consisted of Alex, Larry and Tough Cookie. With the eyes of the world on him, Lestat seeks to start a war between humanity and vampires.Just before the night of the concert, Lestat reunites with Louis who fills him in on the Vampire Connection.The book ends on a cliffhanger after Lestat's debut concert in San Francisco, and leads directly into the third volume, The Queen of the Damned.(So we see clearly how lestat becomes who he is.A vampire that rocks)Enjoy....................Nigel."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is Anne's Rice's second novel in the Vampire Chronicles. This book would be the sequel to her first novel, \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". In An Interview with the Vampire, Louis tells his life story as a vampire. While reliving his life as a vampire, he mentions Lestat as his maker and what they experienced together. In The Vampire Lestat, it's Lestat's turn to tell his side of the story. Lestat would probably be best described as Anne Rice's most popular character. In beginning of The Vampire Lestat, Lestat is introduced when being awakened in 1980'safter a century period of seclusion. Lestat awakes by rock music playing nearby. Shortly, Lestat recounts about his actual past to the audience and reveals to us about his mortal life as a French aristocrat. Follwing, Lestat enlightens the readers about his journey when morphing into a Vampire.Anne Rice's portrayal of Lestat is extremely beautiful in this novel. She created him to be kind-hearted, merciful, ambitious, loving, caring, and someone with such charisma!We find out that Lestat was born and raised in France with a family that barely noticed him. He became independent by age 14, always out feeding for his own. He befriends a violinist named Nikki and soon traveled to Paris together. There, Lestat was turned into a vampire without his will. As he struggles with his immortality, Lestat travels to Europe to find the origins of vampires. On his travels, he meets two very old vampires named Armand and Marius. Through Marius, Lestat learns something about the origin of his immortal ancestors and how the very first vampires still live.In the end, you learn of Lestat's plan to become the lead singer of a rock band. His plan is to unite all of the vampires from around the world. In this novel, the reader learns the history behind Lestat and what he hopes to accomplish as a vampire. The reader also learns his thoughts and his emotions as he struggles with the concept of immortality.Reader beware. The ending is a complete cliffhanger and will surely leave you in suspense, forcing you to run to the bookstore to purchase 3rd edition of the Vampire Chronicles, \\"Queen of the damned\\".Once again, Anne Rice does not disappoint me. Her enchanting words and beauty of descriptions are breathtaking. Whether she's painting a picture to her audience of an old building in France or just the portrayal of the love Lestat has for his mother, would blow your mind leaving your mind in awe. Her knowledge of history is a big influence to her novels and sets the scenery in such realism.I recommend this book to all Anne Rice fans. If you haven't read any of her novels yet, please give one of her books a chance and I assure you that your mind will get blown away with her stunning style of writing.Thanks."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is an absolute must read!

They just transition into the next book and I hardly even notice I have started the next book.I would like to to see more of this in other books that are part of a series.As for the vampire chronicles I love them. I read the Witch series first and it is exciting to know they are all going to come together in Merrick."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"People think the vampire craze just started with True Blood and Twilight. Little do many of these young'uns know that we were big fans of Anne Rice back in the middle 80s. I read \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" first and I was so entranced, I sucked it up in two days. Then I went back to the bookstore and bought \\"Lestat.\\" I knew I was hooked for life. Besides Lestat, I would say that Marius was my other favorite character in the book.Anne Rice was the first author to bestow human thoughts and emotions onto vampires, because at that time, I had known only Bela Lagosi and Christopher Lee as Dracula. I'd seen other films that showed off Dracula being a lover, but to read words where these humans are either by choice, unwittingly, or against their wills turned into vampires, Anne flawlessly handles how these creatures have to deal with spending their eternity. Everything from handling their religioius beliefs, moral ethics, and even a lawbreaker, was extremely well-written and thought-provoking. It was the first time I found myself sympathetic to the character who had always been classified as the \\"bad guy\\".However, be prepared for loads of detail. In this age of swiftness, people don't have a lot of patience for heavy details. If you're one of those people, then you're not going to enjoy the book, nor is the book a Romance, so don't expect any sex or love interests outside of them seeking companions."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This novel is probably the best of Anne Rice's work, and most certainly the jewel of the Vampire Chronicles.With poetic grandeur, Rice takes on a journey through the unflinchingly realistic death and borgeois carelessness of 18th century Paris... We follow young Lestat on his journey from the son of a French noble to a popular stage actor. And it is done with an eloquent, patient style that has personified Anne Rice and her novels. Here, her wrtiting is in top form!The book, although comnparitively long, is intenseley engrossing, and as we follow the life of the Vampire Lestat, we can't help but paint our own vampiric reality of this fictional biography in our own minds. Lestat is done in such a way that his author's voice (the book is an &quot;auto-biography&quot;) is genuine and believable...not only that, it is hypnotic and beguiling.We are shown the depravity of the wretched cult of vampires led by Armand underneath the &quot;Les Innocents&quot; cemetary...we follow Lestat and his companion (mother) Gabrielle on their journey through the VERY VIVID old world (Europe) of the 18th century.Perhaps the most compelling character in the story is Marius, a 2,000 year old vampire who recounts the tale of his own &quot;birth into darkness&quot; to Lestat. We are shown awesome sights in Marius' biography within a biography.It is a must-read for any vampire-fan, or fan of gothic literature. I will say this; the ending is a very artful cliff-hanger...you'll be compelled to read &quot;The Queen of the Damned&quot;..."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Let me just say that I have only completed half of the book so far. Though I am enjoying the book I must admit that I still prefer Interview With the Vampire much more. For one thing, I cannot shake the feeling that Anne Rice has transformed Lestat's character in an attempt to make him seem less cruel than he was first portrayed by Louis. Yes, according to Lestat Louis exaggerated and lied.. But I find that questionable. How could he have exaggerated to such a great extent?? I just don't like this new Lestat as much as I did the one Louis described. And I can't stand his mother. I am offended by the way both she and her son slay their victims. They both seem a bit callous though Lestat for the most part tries to target criminals only.. Another thing that bothered me was Lestat's creation. It seemed as if that whole scene Rice described with Magnus went by extremely fast. I just could not conceive the whole thing.. Nor could I believe Lestat's new found love for his creator. Even after Magnus abandons Lestat, who he has made his heir, Lestat has no trouble managing his powers nor has any qualms about killing.. This was so much unlike Louis whose first moments/kill as a vampire I found more realistic. It all seemed too easy for Lestat.. I think I loved Louis because of the lingering love he showed for his mortal victims.. And the fact that even as a vampire he still meditated on his relationship with God. Louis never went out of his exhibit his power as a vampire either. Meanwhile Lestat and his mother are climbing towers and traveling on rooftops.. In IWTV, Louis does not attempt to do such a thing until Armond urges to. Besides this, I am having a hard time reading this novel because I find some scenes to a tad bit boring and drawn out. This book progresses very slowly and I find reading it to an almost arduous task."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is not only one of the most engaging, remarkable, illuminating, and important horror novels ever written, it is a beautiful work of art that stands proudly among the ranks of what I define as great literature. The breadth and scope of this novel is almost staggering, as is the hypnotic language in which every word and phrase is uttered. Interview With the Vampire was provocative and soul-stirring, but its greatest achievement pale in comparison to the least of the many wonders worked into this second volume of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles.It was the story of Claudia the vampire child that touched my heart in the first novel, although the moral and philosophical questions asked by Louis opened the door for a new kind of vampire literature. Still, Lestat hovered and brooded over every page of Interview With the Vampire, leaving nothing but unanswered questions in the wake of his coldness and sometimes pathetic manifestations. One could not help but wonder about his origins and history, the heavy weights of his mysterious life having left him little more than a husk of a vampire at the end of Louis' story. Finding out in the opening pages of The Vampire Lestat that this inscrutable wanderer is not only thriving once again but that he has in fact become a rock star seems pretty strange. Yet all things are made clear in this novel, for this is Lestat's story, and he violates every vampire law by revealing secrets beyond the ken of mortal man. Lestat wants to embrace his true nature, show the world's population that vampires live amongst them, and incite a glorious war between man and the Children of the Night.This is much more than just Lestat's story, however. What Anne Rice has managed to do in this novel is to create a brand new history and legend of the vampire, taking this most beloved of horror themes and transcending the literature of Stoker, Le Fanu, and the greats of the past. The cold and inscrutable Lestat we saw in Interview With the Vampire is now revealed to be at one time the most human of vampires, an immortal whose love for humans exceeded even that of his creation Louis. We learn of his human childhood, his creation by the immensely old and powerful Magnus in the seventeenth century. The depth of his feelings for his mother and adolescent soul companion Nicholas are quite touching and beautiful, and we see how his first recipients of the Dark Trick come to bring him much pain and tragedy. We see his crazed outbursts and intensity of feeling revealed in the most telling of ways. We learn much more about the vampire Armand, a character I quite honestly despise for his weakness. He hides behind old traditions, betraying the very notions of his own creator Marius by embracing a pseudo-religion of evil, punishing those wretched creatures who dare disturb his antiquated way of existence. Marius, an ancient vampire of great power who links Armand and Lestat together in the most telling of ways, introduces Lestat and ourselves to the Mother and the Father, Those Who Must Be Kept, and it is through these individuals that the history of vampirism is delivered so originally and brilliantly here, drawing and touching upon ancient Egypt, religion, philosophy, and a myriad of other powerful subjects and inspirations. Through Lestat's daring and individualism, we learn much more than any other vampire teacher could tell us; he truly did have stories to tell, and now we learn why he refused to share his wisdom with Louis and Claudia.The introduction of the Mother and the Father, Akasha and Enkil, leads us directly into the next book in the series, The Queen of the Damned, and The Vampire Lestat actually ends on a note of new beginnings potentially more powerful than anything introduced and revealed in this book's 550 pages. I find Those Who Must Be Kept absolutely fascinating, the most ancient of vampires who live lives of immobility and seeming inactivity, staring open-eyed eternally, leaving open the possibility to Lestat in particular that they can be reawakened. Yet Lestat's active plans, his flagrant announcement to the world that he is a vampire (even though mortals may believe in the image rather than the reality of what he is saying) and his daring publication of the most secret of his kind's secrets leaves one spellbound and in wonder as to how things will play out in the end. His actions are rash and dangerous, yet the exuberance he feels in doing these things brings him to life ever more fully. I could go on and on about the wonder and power of this novel, but even then I could not begin to convey the beauty and force with which Anne Rice weaves her dark wonders. Anne Rice takes us inside the hearts and minds of these vampire characters, and that is a perspective that even Bram Stoker never provided. I thought nothing could possibly surpass the dark brilliance of Dracula, but I have to say that The Vampire Lestat is the greatest vampire novel I have ever read."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Artistically, the greatest mistake Anne Rice ever made was flogging her best book to death by churning out sequels it didn't want or need. But Lestat is admittedly at least a good read, even if it doesn't really go anywhere but sideways.Lestat awakens in the modern age to the new sound of rock music, and - vain creature that he is - can't resist the temptation to come out of the shadows and become a rock star, himself. Since he's up, he decides to tell us his story in some detail. And some more detail. And a whole lot more detail, after that.This book has no reason to exist. It's pointless. It isn't a real story with a beginning or end, just a number of vignettes from the central character's life. It reads like a Goth soap opera.But that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining. It's a wonderful read, if you just want to hear an immortal yack on (and on, and on) and give you a little perspective from the undead side of life.Rice is a splendid writer. But if she's ever heard of a plot, she doesn't let on."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"There are certain problems with this book. I loved the first novel in this series, &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot;, but Rice made a mistake I think, in making this book a continuation of her previous one. I think it would have been a much, much better book if she had started clean. For example, a great deal of what one had to believe about Louis and Lestat in the first book had to be not only suspended, but actually reversed in this one for the story to make any sense. In &quot;Interview&quot; Lestat is portrayed as a childish, vengeful, sadistic man with no feeling or depth whatsoever. Here he is shown as the &quot;vampire's vampire&quot; -- a man of unusual depth (which unfortunately doesn't stop his constant immaturity from getting the better of him), and Louis is shown to be a weak, vacillating, pathrtic creature -- far removed from the tragic figure that he was in the first novel. The series sort of loses its integrity after this. Also, many of the characterisations are hard to believe . . . Lestat (pre-vampiric) and his friend get drunk and spend the night in some sort of existential angst moaning about philosophy. Trust me, this is NOT what drunk teenage males think of! The vampire is also nearly elevated to the status of a god, being able to fly and being virtually indestructable, but still beins concerned with the pettiest of human problems. Lestat simply seems to waste his immortality. The invulnerability of the characters makes all of the shenannigans that they go through seem rather pointless. Instead of using his dark gift to elevate himself and understand life, Lestat prefers to waste his time in childish pursuits that are curiously pointless. So why the four stars? Well, Rice IS an excellent writer. The book does captivate one and draws a person into the drama. She writes with a lushness that any romantic writer would envy. The story is great, but the near hero-worship of Lestat seems absurd, and the inconsistencies with the first novel really did take away from the book's value."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"First off, I want to apoligize for only giving this book three stars. But I had to take one away because Ann Rice decided that she wanted to change the lestat character.This is not the same evil and crazy Lestat from the first book. Unless Louis was a total moron, why would he describe Lestat in such a way if that was not the way he really was.I just think that what the auther did was a bit cheap. In order for her to write the book from Lestat's point of view she decided to modify his character in order for him to be the hero and not the villian. I liked the old lestat more. But this is still a very good book. It has a few boring moments but overall it is still very good.I just wish that the old Lestat was not changed."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is another masterpiece, magnifying the fun of the first volume by adding to the mystery of these blood-sucking immortals. THe sense of passing life - this time from Roman times - is enthralling and wonderfully evocative. Lestat turns out to be not such a bad guy, but far more sympathetic once you learn of his anguished background as the rebel of a declining aristocratic family in pre-revolutionary France. It is so believable!And the amazing images and scenes continue: Lestat screaming so loudly in a theatre that the audience runs away; Lestat and his friend getting drunk and beating their heads at the realization of the meaningless of life; the oedipal kissing when he turn his mother into a vampire. The characters in this one are still changing, with facets still being revealed at multiple levels.It all adds up to a sense of wonder, which is Naipaul's definition of a succesful novel. Bravo!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In many respects, \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a rock-solid sequel to \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" Anne Rice does a good job here of building up her characters and her unique vampire mythology - but, in my view, she ultimately gets too bogged down in exposition. Indeed, like J.K. Rowling in the later Harry Potter books, Rice provides so much backstory that she ends up neglecting the more urgent present-day action.Still, most of this book is great. The opening segments, involving Lestat as a young nobleman (but a poor one), are especially good. Early on, he develops an emotionally and intellectually charged relationship with Nicholas, a depressed musician, which leads the book into Rice's familiar philosophical territory. Later in the book, an even more interesting (and distinctly Oedipal) relationship develops between Lestat and his mother. The strange dynamics between these characters keep the book cooking for quite a while.Then Rice takes on an ambitious (and to me only semi-interesting) task; she provides a long, detailed history of vampires in her universe, beginning with the origin of vampire-kind in really-quite-ancient Egypt. Some of this is compelling, some of it falls flat. I was certainly a little bored by the King and Queen of the vampires, who have apparently lived for so long that they have stiffened into near-lifeless dolls. The other old vampires in the book, like Armand and Marius, are also depicted as rather stiff, probably to provide a contrast to the more passionate Lestat. I can understand this approach, but it's a little frustrating; must Lestat really be the only interesting example of the undead race in the whole book?Another slight problem with the book - if you're strict about your continuity - is that Rice liberally rewrites parts of \\"Interview with the Vampire.\\" In Interview, Lestat is clearly depicted as a savage killer and a not-very-thoughtful person. In this book, Lestat tries not to kill innocent people, and he is very philosophical. Rice explains this apparent transformation by claiming that Louis, the narrator of Interview, had a narrow and inaccurate view of Lestat. But I don't quite buy that. Louis lived with Lestat for decades; if Lestat is really a tortured-but-nice guy, how did that side of his personality never manifest itself to Louis?So, you have to somehow accept the trashing of Louis' perspective in this book. On the one hand, that's annoying, and on the other hand I appreciate that Rice wanted to break new ground and totally escape from the confines of her original book. Still, I can't help feeling that Interview is more consistently paced, and a little better, than this good-but-not-great sequel."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have to say I do not find Lestat as compelling as Louis (I realize I'm the total minority here!). Lestat is a complex, well thought out and deep character but something about him doesn't attract me like Louis did. So needless to say it was a little harder to get through his story. I did love the history of Rice's vampires and Akasha. How creepy was that they are alive but don't move except when someone is out of the room? Super scary. A little too long and a little too wordy but I expected that."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Interview with a Vampire was one of my fave reads of all time despite the obsessive amorality of the characters and despite a lot of mumbo-jumbo psychobabble endeavoring to spruce up what is essentially a long series of sociopathic murders. But the idea and execution was accomplished so well that I was willing to give it a pass. For some reason, Louis was very appealing in all his sensuous evil and self-doubt.Rice has obviously fallen for Lestat as witness the apparently endless tomes to him that bestow an almost supernatural quality. She has chosen to make the self-doubting Lestat her eternal wandering and wondering hero. He is much too effete for my taste but Rice specializes in that genre, adding a touch of lushness. She has done something else very cleverly by introducing material for future books. The stories of Marius, Armand and all the hints and unsolved puzzles strewn throughout the story are good for at least three more novels.The historical presentation was absolutely terrifying in its authenticity and mood. France, New Orleans, Catholicism, fine wine - these are the things familiary to the author. She is an expert at deep dialogue and thoughts though she has a tendency to blather on too long. Then there is the matter or all that self-justification for murder of which she implies all vampires are entitled. So read it for the story and give some literary license."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"THIS BOOK TOTALLY RULED. THE DAY I GOT IT I COULDN'T STOP READING IT BECAUSE IT WAS SO ADDICTIVE.

I'm sorry, but I wouldn't mind a little passion there between a woman and a vampire.....Sorry Ann, but you've written about men lusting for each other enough for a lifetime....."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book, to say the least, is the best work of fiction I have ever read. I'm not the most avid reader in the world, but Anne Rice's imagination is absolutely brilliant. So brilliant, she makes you want to be a vampire.A friend of mine actually introduced me to the Vampire Chronicles through the movie, &quot;Interview with a Vampire&quot;. After the movie I jumped right into this book, immediately followed by the rest of the Chronicles. They're all very good, but none meet the standard set by &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot;.This book is truly a bible or chronicled history of vampires straight from the mind of Anne Rice. A totally awesome, gripping, mesmerizing page turner."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was the first of Anne Rice's books I have read, and I absolutely LOVE Lestat. I have watched the movie every day for almost a week now. I watched it last week for the first time. Yet the book surpasses it by far. I don't think any movie on it could touch the emotion or depth conveyed in the novel. I can only wish it could. I am nearly finished reading &quot;Interview...&quot; and I am a bit bothered by how Louis conveys Lestat. I believe Lestat is truly misunderstood by Louis and Claudia. Yet I can sympathize with them. I hope that the rest in the series are just as awe inspiring and I hope that Anne Rice doesn't end their story for a long time to come. I would highly recommend &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; to anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"We now meet Lestat, the infamous vampire from &quot;Interview With The Vampire&quot;. Now, we see that he is not the evil-blood thristy creature of the night that Louis believed him to be, but a misunderstood vampire with somewhat of a soul(although sometimes I wonder about him). The opening is slow, especially with Lestat's homosexual relashonship with Nicholas as a mortal(I don't understand why she must make every male vampire in her stories gay or bi.. Why Anne, Why?), but it does get better when Lestat changes his mother to vampirism, and meets the Theatre Of The Vampires. All in all, this book is not the best in the series, but it is not the worst."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I wonder if Anne Rice has actually read Interview With A Vampire. There were so many inconsistencies between the two books that I sincerely doubt it! Vampire Lestat was a tedious waste of my time. I skipped ahead many chapters and wasn't lost. I was wholeheartedly disappointed, since after reading Interview with a Vampire, I was looking forward to the series. Like a bad relationship, I'm glad it's over."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"If you liked Interview with the Vampire and want to know about the events after the novel, The Vampire Lestat is the first one to read. It's ok, but sometimes extensive and boring. Sometimes it's hard to keep your interest in the storyline."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I loved Interview With the Vampire and I really liked Lestats character a lot so I was surprised by how Anne Rice potrays him in this book.He goes from being a complex evil character to a whiney, childesh idiot! Am I the only one that winces when he is called the &quot;brat prince?&quot; She made him cute, cuddley and mischievius in a little boy sort of way, a major difference from the Lestat in Interview. That lestat was more mysterious, although he loved being a vampire and accepted it(unlike Louis) you get the feeling that there is more going on in his mind than Louis can see. His character in The Vampire Lestat on the other hand is silly and can really got on your nerves.There is nothing at all disturbing or dark about him, you know he will never really do anything totally evil, hes too sweet and adorable too. Its not really that this book is so bad(compared to Menoch its a masterpiece)its just that if she wanted to write a book about a charming,charismatic vampire why did she use Lestat?"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After his earlier conflict, Lestat awakes in the 1980s.

The King is not happy, and Marius has to get Lestat away to save him.This leads him to his hibernation, his eighties awakening, and decision to write a book and become a rockstar."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Rice creates a beautiful, sad story that runs deep into emotional and religious territory.

I read the Mayfair witches, and I fell asleep halfway through each single one of them. The Vampire Lestat, however, is another kettle of fish entirely. Lestat is as far apart from the passive, boring Louis as possible.. his sense of humour, energy and sheer vital force make him the vampire that never stopped living. Through his eyes, the vampire world is transformed, and the quality of the writing is by far the best Anne Rice ever came up with. Buy this book, read it, and treasure it. It's a gem, and one you'll want to gaze upon more than one time."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book captures Lestat as you never seen him.

But just to see if this could possibly be close to being as good as Interview with the Vampire, I read it anyway. Well this book is even better, suprisingly enough! I loved the movie and I think that they should make a new movie about Lestat. Tom Cruise is a movie wonder by the way! I can't wait to crack open the next book, Queen of the Damned I hope it will be as exellent as the other two!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I LOVE THIS BOOK! It is an excellent follow-up to Anne Rice's earlier work, &quot;Interview with the Vampire.&quot; &quot;Lestat&quot; gives a great new depth to the title character, who was protrayed as a villain in the first book. I was enthralled from the beginning, from Lestat's mortal boyhood in the French countryside, to his descent into the world of the Undead. The changes he made to the vampiric culture of Paris in the late eighteenth century were astonishing, as was his rise to superstardom as a rock star in the mid-1980s. The character interaction and the great secrets Lestat has revealed to him are page-turning. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice shows us that a woman can scare the devil out of us even better than Stephen King or Dean Koontz can.

It was wonderful, so naturally, I searched for the others, and found them better still, (amazingly enough, I didn't think they could get any better!)

If you're a big Lestat fan, he is absolutely wonderful in this book. Not only that, but there's hints of homosexuality between him and his best friend, Nicki. Rice chronicles Lestat's life from BEFORE he was a vampire, which I found facinating. You also get to see the making of the Theater des Vampires, and the roots of Armand. I recommend it, for anyone who is a gothic or Anne Rice fan."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is a book that is beyond any words of praise. Much, much better than &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot;. With its setting in the 1984, Lestat spins an enrapturing tale of his mortal life and escapades as a vampire. While Louis's story leaves you with a depressing emptiness, Lestat enchants and enraptures you by the very first page. When reading &quot;Interview with the vampire&quot; , it makes Lestat out to be paticularly cold and menacing, not a very accurate picture. Although it described Lestat's arrogance, spite, cruelty and vengfulness, it left out important parts of his personality such as his passion, sensuality, charm, and the courage to endure a cursed immortality that was layed before him. This book, on the other hand gives a whole new perspective as the author tells things from Lestat's point of view while at the same time analyzing his true character and motives. After reading it I was completely enamored and hungry for more. This is the true essence of the vampire chronicles and the very reason why I love Anne Rice even today. Even though her creativity is slowly depleting, I still remain a loyal fan for the simple fact that I believe she will one day produce another masterpeice equal to the likes of this one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"\\"If you surrender and go with her, you have surrendered to enchantment, as if in a voluptuous dream,\\" said the Boston Globe of Anne Rice's Interview with the Vampire. Now, returning to the hypnotic world she so brilliantly created, she demonstrates once again her power to enthrall. With the same richness of drama, atmosphere and incident, she tells the fantastic story of the Vampire Lestat, whom we first perceived as the seductive devil-vampire of Interview with the Vampire and whom we now follow through the ages as he searches for the origin and meaning of his own dark immortality. And who, more and more, engages our sympathy until he stands revealed as a questing romantic, a vampire-hero with his own strange and passionate courage and morality.As the novel opens, Lestat, having risen from the earth after a fifty-five years' sleep, and infatuated with the modern world, presents himself in all his vampire brilliance as a rock star, a superstar, a seducer of millions. And, in this blaze of adulation, daring to break the vampire oath of silence, he determines to tell his story, to rouse the generations of the living dead from their slumbers and to penetrate the riddle of his own existence.As he speaks we are plunged back into eighteenth-century France, into the castle where we see the young Lestat: child of impoverished aristocrats, heroic hunter of wolves, at odds with his tyrannical father, running away to join a traveling troupe of actors. We see him in the licentious Paris of the day, first an apprentice at a boulevard theater, then its most celebrated actor, idolized, adored by many and--night after night--watched by one...until, in a sleep filled with dreams of the wolves he killed as a boy, he is shocked awake by a dark figure and suddenly, horribly, eternally joined to the unholy brotherhood.We follow Lestat as he searches for others like him--in churches and brothels, in gambling houses, huts and palaces--sometimes joined by the vampire-angel Gabrielle, who is bound to him both by blood and by passion; sometimes traveling with his adored Nicolas, the violinist whose music and beauty are equally transcendent. We follow Lestat as he travels from the snowcapped mountains of the Auvergne and the primeval forest of Gaul to Sicily, Istanbul, Venice, and Cairo, searching for his origins, sometimes finding clues to the birth of the vampire race, knowing always that the central truth eludes him.But all the while, throughout his travels, through many lands and many times, Lestat has made enemies among his brethren--vampires who are in terror of his questions, who fear he will disturb the uneasy balance in which they exist with the mortal world, and who suspect in him a desire to rule. And when, in the caves below a craggy Greek island, in a sanctuary whose walls are covered with gold-flecked murals, the very first of the living dead awake, the truth at the heart of his quest is at least revealed. Ancient forces held immobile through the ages are irreversibly set in motion, and as the novel rushes to its stunning climax, Lestat's vampire foes converge in pursuit of him on the demonic freeways of the twentieth century.Rice is a born story-teller. I sometimes suspect she's a born vampire too, as she keeps my imagination constantly flowing through and sometimes I literally feel fangs growing under my lips. The second book in this wonderful series continues with her great style of presenting her character, and her constant use of spicy phrases and descriptive style. Must read for any vampire lover!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I don't read very many books, because I don't seem to enjoy it. After I started reading &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; it seemed that I couldn't put it down.Anne Rice does a wonderful job of showing and explaining all the features and characters of the story without making it seem boring or too indepth. The stories that are told by many numerous characters, especially Lestat, catch your attention and leave the action, adventure, and mystery for anyone to want to explore.I never thought that I could enjoy reading a book so much. To anyone that enjoys the mystery and art of vampires should read this book"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"An awesome sequel to Interveiw with the Vampire- a bit boring in parts though..."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In my opinion, this is the best of the Vampire Chronicles. It has a gripping story and great characters. You find out a lot about Lestat and how he wasn't nearly as cold-hearted as he was played out in Interview with the Vampire. If you didn't like Louis's brooding attitude and were slightly turned off from the series by reading it, you ought to give this book a chance. It's totally different. Lestat is modest, yet full of himself. He is not the monstrosity that everything thinks, including himself, he is. The story isn't only about Lestat either. The book takes you through some of the brief histories of the vampires he meets. It is truly a great book. Best one in the Chronicles."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat a thrilling piece of writing by Anne Rice, she never fails to tell a tale of greatness.I found myself utterly overwhelmed by the darkened sensuous atmosphere amidst the pages i read, the Vampire is such a sexual creature and Rice reveals this reverently.An enjoyable read and hopefully more to come...."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I'm not a big Lestat fan, but I do love this book. I like how he is a bit more like Louis in this book, only a little less depressed (not that there was anything wrong with Louis being depressing, I like that in a character.) The plot is pretty good, even if some parts were a bit slow. However, the thing that makes me love this book is Armand. He's a villan here, but he's so intense, so perfectly written he makes the whole book worthwhile. I love the insights into his charcter, and the part about what his life was like before he became the leader of the Paris coven. I also like Nicolas, who is as dark and cynical and wonderful as Louis. All in all, it's a great book, I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is definetly not like the Queen of the Damned, Interview W/The Vampire, or Pandora. It was definetly a weird read, but still comes recommended."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book was as amazing as Anne Rices first book Interview With The Vampire. it is great at explaining the otherwise mystierious character Lestat. how he came about and other reasons for how he acted in the previous book.i have read this book twice already and hope to read it many more times. i have read other vampire books (buffy) and this one was way better. i am only 14 and this book has helped me leave the world of little whimpy kid books. it has opened new doors for me and i am glad to have read such a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The reader is entranced and captivated by the story, as it plunges into the lush world of the immortals, with their provocative beauty and eternal guilt and passion. It forces you to examine the world in a new way, to see it through the eyes of an immortal, to ponder their dilemma of murder or life. It examines society in a new light - the dark side of humanity is exposed, one which hungers for the touch of these savage, yet emotional drinkers of blood. The characters are vivid and magnetic, torn between loving and loathing themselves and each other. Full of shadowy beauty.."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"It's been years since I read \\"Interview With the Vampire,\\" and I thought it was sort of a snoozer. \\"The Vampire Lestat\\" is a much better-paced story, and I found Lestat to be a flawed but likeable character. He's a bit of a rebel, constantly doing things he's been specifically advised not to do and suffering the inevitable but entertaining, at least from the reader's perspective, consequences. Anne Rice has developed an imaginary world of vampires that's very vivid without being horrific. As with most series, I think there's merit in not waiting too long between volumes, to preserve some continuity. My memory of the first book is basically nil, and, although it didn't hamper my enjoyment of the second, I was a little disappointed that I couldn't compare Lestat's and Louis's versions of what happened while they were together. Still, the vast majority of Lestat's story is pre-Louis. I yawned through a few parts that could have been whittled down, but now I'm looking forward to reading the third Vampire Chronicle, \\"The Queen of the Damned.\\""},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat book by Anne Rice was the first book i ever read that was more then 200 pages. After the mesmerizing tale, i could not help but love Lestat. After that book, i collected all the chronicles that was ever written by anne rice!! i loved each and everyone of them, from blood and gold to blackwood farm and tale of the body thief.These books gave me a world to escape into. A world that i envy very much because i want it. The book was written in such a way, that no one can distinguish whether it is real or not. that is how i feel. The books gave me a new way of thinking. i am certainly one of Lestat's biggest fans! i have his pictures every where in my room and i drive my friends crazy about how i want a guy like him. The character Lestat is someone whom every one will grow to love no matter what because he is someone a person can look upto, to be inspired by, to love without getting hurt. that is what is so special about him and the books. they are so real that after a few days you will be thinking in such a way as if they do exist. well, i wish they did!! i could read this book over and over again without getting tired or bored of it. These books are truely the work of a talent and great personality. A big thumbs up to anne rice and lestat along with Marius,Quinn, and Armand."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"the story starts the same as the last one with lestat talking to the reader and this is one of my favorite parts of the way Anne Rice writes. I liked most off the book it only some things unansered. Hopefully the next one answers them. I had agreat time becomeing the chareters. The story is so is to get into. When i read it i realy felt like i was there. The story makes me feel good. Iliked comming home from school and reading it. I think anyone that is looking to read something that is a little twisted this is for them."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"'The Vampire Lestat' is a wonderful work of fiction that takes the reader through centuries of undead history. The story revolves around the adventures of the newly-created Vampire Lestat and his quest to understand his demonic origins. His quest takes him around the world and back through time as other, older Vampires share with him their secrets. In 'Lestat' we see a much different being than was presented to us in 'Interview with a Vampire.' Rather than the cocky, vain, unfeeling Vampire that we had known Lestat tells his story with humility and an almost human fraility. Rice's sensual writing style and her unwavering ability to probe the darker sides of the human condition make her an entertaining and thought-provoking author. The Vampire Chronicles are truly great works of fiction and 'The Vampire Lestat' may be the best of the series."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I agree with some of the reviews where it's said that Lestat is like 'Louis rehashed', it's true! But I don't care, this book is BRILLIANT, I love the writing of Anne Rice, she's incredibly talented. There is beauty, melancholia, greed , lust, philosophy EVERYTHING in this book. I have just finished 'Queen of the Damned' but I enjoyed '..Lestat' more. I just don't understand why there is no continuity in Lestat's character. OK, at first he wasn't even the main character [obviously, because it was Louis' story] and he was a complete bastard [according to Louis, but the facts are there] he acted like he never thought about anything, didn't care about being 'good' didn't care about the philosophy behind being a vampire [in 'Interview...'} now suddenly he changed and he became like Louis. Maybe he grew spiritually if that's possible for vampires. but it's like Rice wrote the first novel and then decided to make a continuation out of that and she grabbed Lestat and developed him but, well maybe it doesn't work really but I don't mind. I enjoyed this one better than 'Interview...' I really like Armand in this one, but again there are discrepancies between what Louis said about Armand's character and what Lestat says...aaaaaahhh it's getting a bit confusing."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"It really could have been a masterpiece... if only it wasn't called The Vampire Lestat and settled for The Vampire Marcus or The Vampire John or The Vampire George or whatever...The person we follow in this story is simply not Lestat. It is a beefed up version of Louis. Rice goes to great distances to make us believe that it is the same Lestat, but fails miserably. She even takes a puke on Interview With The Vampire by saying that Louis was utterly wrong on at least three important points and that all those innocent people Lestat killed for fun were actualy murderers, thiefs and scoundrels.And why? So that it could say The Vampire Lestat on the book cover? I truly don't know and don't care if it is a cash in or not. I just wanted the real Lestat back.It is still a good, fun book with lots of great characters and an above-average plot. But it is all clouded by the fact our narrator is not an egoistical, stupid, vain and utterly evil person he was in Interview With The Vampire, but some miserable copy of Louis. If he was the person he was in Interview, it would've truly made for an unique experience. Unfortunately, it took away a huge chunk of fun and interest and turned a great book into a merely above-average one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is my absolute favorite modern novel. Everything about it is genius, and several times I was moved to tears. I'd recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I used to have this book in hardcover back when the cover was yellow and had only the title on the front and my brother borrowed it and lost it. I was excited to see that I could order it in hardback once again but was a bit disappointed when I arrived. I was expecting a larger than paperback hard cover book, but what I got was a paperback size book with hardcovers. Anyway, I thought I would put this type of review for those out there who were looking to replace this book rather than it being a first time read. I am a huge Anne Rice fan, especially of the Witch and Vampire Chronicles and was hoping to replace a favorite book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice's second vampire novel is both a prequel and a sequel to her original story \\"Interview with the Vampire\\". A sequel because it is framed by a sequence of events in contemporary times, and a prequel because it recounts the history of the vampire Lestat, the sire of the protagonist Louis in \\"Interview\\". After waking from centuries-sleep in 1980's New Orleans, Lestat discovers the \\"Interview\\" manuscript and goes about setting the story straight, recounting his mortal life as a young French aristocrat, his transformation into a vampire, and his ongoing quest to find the answers behind his new condition. Stretching from the French Revolution to Egyptian myth to the modern day world, his journey is one that only an immortal could take, and we're lucky enough to be taken along for the ride.Lestat is perhaps Rice's most popular creation, and it's easy enough to see why: he is charismatic, merciful, deep-thinking and tormented; in other words a truly three-dimensional character and possibly the most relatable member of the undead in the huge vampiric canon of books and movies (well, with the possible exception of Angel and Spike). His moral crisis on becoming a vampire is especially intriguing, with his reluctance to destroy innocent mortals.More than this however, is Rice's (and consequently Lestat's) exploration into the mythos of the vampire and the search for the origins of the vampire. She ingeniously melds the legends of ancient Britain, Greece and Egypt to tell the complete history of the vampire creatures, making especially good use of the myth of Osiris and Isis, whose existence bears a fascinating similarity to the making of a vampire. Finally Lestat gets to the heart of the matter after tracking down different vampires of increasing age, and the full truth behind the vampire and the creation of the first vampires. It is one of the most interesting and thought-provoking theories on the subject that I have ever read, and yields further revelations and connections on each re-reading.As well as this, Rice includes Lestat's complex relationships with his mother and best friend who become privy to his vampiric secret, and toward the end Louis and Claudia are mentioned also (so make sure you've read \\"Interview\\" as Lestat gives away the details of their life together). Fellow vampires such as Armand, Marius and Magnus make prominent appearances, all of whom had later novels dedicated to their characters and serve as \\"stepping stones\\" to Lestat's journey of discovery, each yielding more clues and information to the intellectual path that he takes.Rice's language is gorgeous to read, rich and poetic and full of sublime passages and descriptions. Sometimes she can go a little overboard: on more than one occasion I found myself reading a passage and realising I had no idea what was going on, but her rich detail and extensive knowledge of history sets her vampires in an utterly realistic and mysterious world. Concepts such as \\"the conversation\\", the Savage Garden and the wolf killer echo through the novel, adding resonance and extra meaning to the unfolding story where the smallest detail can hold the greatest importance.All in all, an immensely rich and rewarding read at times scary, beautiful, intriguing, and exceptionally clever. Rice has created a new breed of vampires that are both similar and extremely different from those of traditional folklore. Usually I dislike books that make vampires \\"good guys\\" and thereby strip them of any potency or menace whatsoever, but Rice is the only author that I know of (with the exception of Angel and Spike of course) who makes this work. I can't wait to read more."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I had the opportunity to read through all three of the Vampire Chronicles recently in the Kindle Format. I was overall very pleased with the series and it proved to be entertaining and enjoyable.To her credit, Anne Rice deserves the praise she has received for her writing style. She is descriptive, she does her research and she knows, for the most part, the locations and histories she writes about. She gives just enough fact to tie the reader to the story, but injects some very imaginable fiction that puts her out in front of the pack of vampire writers.The Vampire Lestat plays upon Lestat's constant need for attention; the more the merrier. After being asleep for a long time, he rises in New Orleans to the sound of heavy rock. He hears a rock and roll band and he is drawn from his sleep to enter back into 20th century America. And, as his nature would lend itself to, he wants to be a rock star. He also provides us with his autobiography, to offset Louis' story. We are introduced to Lestat's maker Magnus, his mother Gabrielle, and Marius, who made Armand. Yes, Armand is back as well. And we have Those Who Must Be Kept, which introduces Akasha and Enkil. Lestat is also introduced to them, and he stirs Akasha to life, much to the upset of her King.We are drawn deeper into Lestat's world of wanting to be out in the open, to be known as a Vampire, and his forever love affair with the stage.Again, the characters are brilliant. The plots thicken; the book leads us through the centuries to the present day, following the histories of each of these characters as told by Lestat. And we are left with a cliffhanger for the final installment - There is the concert in San Francisco where Lestat invites the Vampires to join him and he is to prove that Vampires do exist.This book was quite good, though not as good as the first. Maybe because I liked the history in the first novel and found it to be a great place to weave the stories of the Vampires. I was not all that enthralled with the way they were brought into the current century. A rock star? Well, Lestat, the character, does have a huge ego.The Kindle version on this is much better than the first. At least, I did not notice the usual errors.Its a great novel, but I think the first one is better."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Length:: 2:42 MinsVIdeo Book Review made for class"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is a likable villian to many. After reading this book, Anne Rice conveys his hardship and pain so well I think that he is more like an \\"homme fatale\\" (newly coined term, huh?). Rice's ability to leap back and forth in time to tell the story as if it is a movie is very obvious. And the story is very engaging, and Lestat is very human. His life in France before becoming a vampire is interesting indeed. And his reasons for coming to America are too. He seems, from the author's description, to be a natural born actor. I certainly hope that any band he now created makes it. I hope it's not Satanic to Anne Rice any more. Just \\"fatale\\". This book makes me wonder how many fictional vampires are real. So Anne Rice has snagged my imagination. The book is entertaining and provocative."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat was a good, but exhausting read. At times I found myself dosing off to sleep, but at other times, this author kept me that interested that I couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. Overall, I give it 4 stars, I really like how it explored each characters' story, but the cliffhanger ending didn't really seal the deal for me."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat is the second of Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles and tells the story of Lestat, the maker of Louis from Interview with the Vampire.Lestat was born the third son of a once grand, now poor aristocratic family in pre-revolutionary France. He does not fit in with the rest of his family and has always had a questioning nature and ponders frequently over good and evil and what happens after death. He is also subject to bouts of deep depression. On becoming a vampire, his basic nature remains unchanged and he continues to question everything including his own existence.This is a dark book, not a vampire action novel, focussing instead more on Lestat's philosophical searches to find meaning. It is also apparent, especially if you have read Anne Rice's later works such as Called Out of Darkness about her own religious journey, that this book is more about the questioning of good and evil as well as the existence of God and Satan than actual vampires. But of course, we cannot forget about the vampires as they are still a major focal point!The novel contains some good old horror sections with vampires wreaking havoc and causing terror with mortals and amongst themselves. A perfect combination of philosophy, fantasy, and horror."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"He does not follow any rules. In IWTV Louis potrayed Lestat as being cruel but that was not the real Lestat. Louis' hatred was so strong that I disliked Lestat for some time. Now, I think that he's a great vampire. To me his mother is so insignificant I dislike her almost as much as I dislike Louis. Lestat is strong and will not allow anything to keep him down unlike Louis who is a hypocrite, vindictive, selfish and weak (among other things). He completely misunderstood Lestat."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I actually enjoyed this quite a bit - mostly because I grew to like the characters of the first book and the material was all new. As much as I didn't care for Lestat in the film, he was surprisingly charming in the book. This book had a more immediate feel thanInterview with the Vampire (Vampire Chronicles)and that made it more enjoyable. Her husband's poetry makes annoying chapter openers and I'm rather tired of the dragging nature of her writing and the way she skips over parts that I would like to hear more about. Still, I did enjoy it quite a bit - more than I thought I would."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"How i wish all novels were written like this. I've read many Anne Rice novels, and this one is by far my favorire.The Hero Lestat. the book is broken up into parts. The first part takes him from his childhood home in the mountains of France to Paris. We see his deep need to stand out, to be noticed. We geet to know his mother,Gabrielle, in this section as well. While young, he strikes up a friendship with Nicholas De Lenfent, another young man from his village. Together, they run away to Paris. Once there,Lestat(always rising above) becomes a stagehand at a nearby theater, and eventually goes onstage. His eventual fame attracts the eyes of a vampire, who takes Lestat and creates the hero we know today.I could go on, about Lestats strugglew with his new state of being, and his many adventures, but then you wouldnt read the book!This is truly one of Anne Rices best books."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is the second book of the Vampire Chronicles by Anne Rice. After Interview with a Vampire, the first book is told from Louis' viewpoint, but in the Vampire Lestat, we find Lestat's story from the beginning and many gaps in the first story are filled. It is a wonderful tale, and opens the door for the third story, Queen of the Damned. It is very difficult to read any other book in the series without reading this second book, because here we find the story of many of the characters we find again throughout the series.I enjoyed it thouroughly and recommend it, of course, if you like vampire stories."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Loved this book, especially the whole not-yet-vampire-Lestat part. Lestat's the only fictional character who ever came really fully to live to me, and he's wonderful and very funny here (and not even that different from who he is in Interview with the Vampire, no matter what he wants you to believe). Truly na amazing book, I wish she would have stayed this good."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The bottom line is that this book is entertaining; a real page-turner. It also brings up thought-provoking issues about the &quot;gift&quot; of immortality. It's worth reading especially for Rice's clever description of real vampires. My only fuss is that sometimes Lestat sounds a bit too feminine. All in all though, a grand novel."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I started out a complete Louis sympathizer, but then I read this book. Lestat takes us on a journey that completly fills the senses; you see the world through his eyes, you taste the night air, you are on his quest with him, all the while taking the world in as you have never before seen it. Few authors can put that kind of feeling into a book, but Anne Rice does it, and then some. It is a true blend of horror and romance, with a bit of the odd and erotic thrown in for good measure. A must read for book lovers of all types."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I really loved reading the second book in the Vampire Chonicles. I could not put it down from the moment I brought it home from the store. I love the way Anne brought in characters from IwtV and new ones. They all were interesting in their own ways and I loved each and every one of them. I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading, even if your not into that undead thing."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"i loved this book, i think anne rice is pure genius, she writes as if shes really a vampire, which would be pretty tight, but virtually impossible. but i thought she was very detalled and imaginative."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"When we fell in love with the first book of the chronicles, we never thought that a second part would be so motivating, opening spaces unknown to all of us, creating universes that otherwise we wouldn't know and letting our soul feast upon a story that spoke by itself. Here Lestat narrates the story of his life from his teen years to his rising from out of his slumber under the earth in the mid-80's when he chooses to be part of a band. Adding a new cast of vampires and mortal characters, this autobiography shows us that even vampires can become rock stars and release a book telling their lives. Kudos to Anne Rice for a new story that is going to keep you from sleeping all night long."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is probably my favorite vampire book in the vampire chronicles. I was so hooked from the very beginning. There was just so much in this book!! I didn't want it to end!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"It was a wonderful book you should read it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Lestat is crzy but always willing to try everthing. What admirable is he loves living. He needs love and he never concealed that. He is a warrior. Challenging things others don't have courage to do. It seems that iust following him, we will got surprising forever."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After reading Interveiw with the Vampire I was thrilled to learn that there were about 5 sequels to it. The Vampire Lestat is totally believable and is written with Lestat's humor and not Louis's depression. (don't get me wrong, I loved Interveiw with the Vampire, but you have to admit, it was rather depressing!) There is no part that drags and it is action all the way through. The ending is a cliffhanger and you don't want to read it without Queen of the Damned on hand. (It's torture to wait for the library to order it specially!) Even if you aren't into vampires and 'goth' stuff, you really ought to read this book. I have read every book in the series and I can tell you it is one of the best books I've read- and I read a LOT so that really means something. PS- Armand is my favorite and I can't wait for the new book on him!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I first saw the movie Interview with the Vampire and I loved it so I went in search of the book well I read it and loved it. But then I read The vampire Lestat. I did not like Lestat to much when I Interview with the vampire. But when I read the Vampire Lestat I fell in love with him. He gives you a whole new veiw of him. You grow to care for him. The book takes you through his life from when he was mortal to when he becomes a immortal and through some of his adventures. You began to understand why he is the way that he is. Now I can not wait to read the Queen Of The Damned. I would say that Anne Rice is the QUEEN of fiction"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Vampire Lestat was perhaps the most enchanting book I have read from Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. It seemed so real, that you were almost there with Lestat every step of the way. You grow an inseparable bond to Lestat and feel that he knows just how you feel. I LOVED THIS NOVEL! I suggest all people who love Anne Rice, her chronicles, or Lestat, read this book."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This is Anne Rices best book yet. At the end it leaves you wanting to know what happened next and every page brings something new and exciting. I strongly recommend this book to any on 12 and up. To find out what happens next you have to read the rest of the books. The next book is the Queen of the Damned. Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Before I start let me say that I love Anne Rice. She is a wonderful author with an individual style. The Vampire Lestat is my favorite book from the Vampire Chronicals. Lestat is a humorous and sensual character. His traits are not your usual vampires traits. Rice developed him very well and in depth in this novel. It was enthralling and I couldn't put it down. I recommend this book to all Rice fans and vampire fans."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This most wonderful of characters is well defined and excellent in his description. Anne Rice has a real talent for drawing in the reader with not only vivid description but the human and emotional aspects. In this book we learn of Lestat's rich past and mischievous present tales. A complicated character but certainly one that everyone loves to hate. Probably because he represents humanity in all its wonderful and dread realities. A must read for anyone."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"In the magical of Anne Rice's &quot;The Vampire Lestat&quot; she makes the reader feel aas if they have found a book of secrets. The novel os about Vampire Lestats enchanting life when he became a vampire. The story takes you to exotic places like France and Egypt. The story starts in modern day New York. As soon as you open the first page you are drawn in to his incredible life. Lestat's mission is to let the world know who he is. He is willing to go against all he's been taught. The cover of the book makes you feel as if Lestat is sharing his adventures while sitting in his own wise chair. One of the lines that captured me was &quot;The feeling of eternity is far to broad for one's mind, what is eternity? What is forever?&quot; This is so true. No one can grasp the meaning of eternity. I would definitly reccomend this book for someone who likes to think beyond their imagination."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"It is an excellent story. Gripping from beginning to end. Fills in a lot of holes from Interview and promotes further understanding of the vampire's of Anne Rice. Much better than the first and set to change your mind about Lestat forever. It is fantasy that is very closely rlated to the real world. Reading this book could change your mind about the existence of vampires on this planet forever. Extraordinary!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I have read almost all the books in Anne Rice's The Vampire Chronicles, but this one is by far my favorite. In this book me learn about Lestat's past and how he came to be what he is. In Interview, Lestat was so dark and mysterious, it made you wonder if he cared about anything at all. In this book you really get to know that dark, golden haired vampire Lestat and i LOVE him even more now. Lestat is definetly my favorite character and in this book you get to meet some other interesting members of the un-dead as well. I could not put this book down. I finished this book and I simply couldn't wait to get to the store to get the next book in the chronicle. This is probably one of the best books I have ever read. I highly suggest it for anyone who read Interview with the Vampire and loved it like me."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I first read Interview With the Vampire and I was amazied.ThenI got The Vampire Lestat and I liked it even better.The atmosphere and the dark,gothic setting just pulled me in even more.I'm only 12 yers old and I think it's one of her best.Anne Rice is my favoriate author!!!Highly recomended!!!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Can a book be any more entertaining? Anne Rice has blown me away with the second book. The story completely took off and delivered me to another world that is so seemingly real I truly believe Lestat exists. The passion and lust for life and love between the vampires is so tantalizing to read that you understand what vampires feel when they drink. Anne knows how to write &quot;real&quot; romance."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I cannot praise this book enough! I love this book! This was the first Anne Rice book I read and it instantly made me a fan. I have read her other novels but TVL will always be my favorite. I also love the character of Lestat. Lestat will always be my favorite character. He's so human and so supernatural at the same time. I absolutely could not stop reading this book! This book takes you to another dimension. If I had a choice, I would rate this an infinite number of stars. It's that amazing! Please read this book!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"If, like me, after finishing 'Interview with the Vampire' you are looking forward to reading more about the indiscriminate killing monster known as Lestat then forget it. In an abrupt change of style, Anne Rice portrays him as a big softy, who loves his mummy and cries alot. So, any memories you have from the the last book, for example of when he killed the child slave or danced with Claudias' rotting carcass of a mother, you can forget them right now. From page one he's set up as a goody-goody vampire who only chooses nasty people as victims. And as if this is not enough, the Author goes further in her hatchet job of destroying the imagery of the previous book, with her portrayal of Armand. Forget Antonio Banderas, or anything you read before, he's a child, and he's got an angel face. Can you believe this? Its almost like the book was written by someone else who had forgotten to read the first book, and the difference in writing style between the two books certainly shows. No, Vampire Lestat is a big disappointment. It steals classic characters from a previous book, then makes you lose all respect for them with page upon page of silly nonsense."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I loved this book, it was just as good as Interview with the Vampire but I did read them in the wrong order.So when I read interview with the vampire I was very defensive over Lestat because in this book he explains why he couldn't teach Louis everything because his own maker (Magnus)died before he taught Lestat anything about being a vampire so he went looking for answers and finally found a vampire called Marius (the oldest vampire in the world and Armands maker who Armand fought to be dead.) who answered some of Lestats un-answered questions. (just like when Louis and Claudia went looking for anwsers and found Armand.)Also we find out why he hated his father so much and what his father meant in interview with the vampire when he said 'sorry, please forgive me' before he died.The book is writen from Lestats point of view and is kind of like his biography.My favourate part must be the ending when Louis comes back to Lestat after reading Lestats book and understanding Lestat was like he was."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"_The Vampire Lestat_ is a big step up from _Interview with the Vamprire_. Where the first book was overlong and self-indulgent, this one is much more sleek (though it is actually a longer book) and believable, if you can really use that word to describe a book like this. Though too dense in some spots, and provoking incredulity periodically, the book is mostly fun and doesn't take itself too seriously. The philosophy it offers is light. It can basically be summed up in a few words: Even though life is meaningless, people still fear death and will do anything to avoid it; as well as: If you had eternity to live, you'd make a lot of mistakes and be miserable much of the time, but you still wouldn't want to give it up.The writing style of the novel is similar to _Interview_ but more disciplined. The prose is less flowery and tends to get in the way less often. The historical settings, where most of the scenes are staged, are reasonably compelling. In fact, the beginning and end of the book, which occur in the present day, are the weakest parts. Though I have not read part three, I fear that much of the magic may be lost when Rice is no longer writing about the &quot;olden days&quot; when it feels like these sorts of events could have happened. At any rate, this book is not a complete waste of time, though it won't reinvent anybody's worldview or really make any statements at all of much importance. But there are worse novels to bring to the beach."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Anne Rice boldly takes on the task of sanctifying the villain of her &quot;Interview with the Vampire.&quot; In this novel, Rice, through a tedious plot, tries to paint her hero Lestat human. This book moves slower than the other novel but it deals more with the inner workings of one character moreso than the other did. The psychological snapshot of Louis in the last novel does not compare to the intricate portait of Lestat in this novel. Lestat is a character who has been confronted with so many problems one wonders why he hasn't ended his vampiric life. By the end of the novel, I actually found myself feeling some sort of sympathy for the character but still found myself incredulous of his sensitive side after Louis' butchering of him in the last novel.The immersion into the beautiful world of eighteenth and nineteenth century France was a definite departure from what I was used to reading everyday pop fiction. I think this book was a good afterthought to Interview with the Vampire and a beautiful introduction to her next installment Queen of the Damned. Who said that a bridge can't be beautiful?"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Travel though the mytical times with Lestat. Journey though old France and encounter many immortal beings.This book was simply wonderful. Lestat is an enchanting character, with emotions, even though he is a vampire. This book is for anyone who loves history, fiction, mystery, and fantasy all rolled into one. This book is in a series so it won't end here. But before you read this book you should read the first book in the vampire chronicles, Interveiw with the Vampire. This was a great book, but very hard material to read. You can't put this book down. Lestat will keep you on guessing on what he is going to do next. You never know what wiil happen to him or what he will do. Even though this book was fiction , it also had historical facts in it too. This book was great I strongly suggest you read it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"This book is the most fabulos thing with vampires in it I have ever seen! Anne describes them with more warmth than I thought possible. I cried for Nicholas and Claudia. When our favourite brat got up stage, I roared of happiness. And when he went underground after the Great Trip through the world, and Marius found him... The gentlest of vamires lifted him up and took him under his wing. Marius. The name reminds me of the sea."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"in first pages a young male has a grizzled beard. huh? VD is under control in mid 80s. right. either lestat is a moron or author is delusional about reality. Even fiction needs some basis in facts. I read this once...meh."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I agree with most, if not all, of the 2-3 star reviews regarding this book. Lestat is simply not Lestat. He is turned into a shell of Louis. By that, I mean, he is turned into the emo, depressed, nice yet troubled vampire. However, he lacks the depth and true love that Louis possesses. Louis truly loves Claudia and even, in a way, Lestat. Lestat \\"loves\\" so many people in this story it is hard to keep track. There's Nicki, Gabrielle, Armand, the coven, Magnus, Marius, and so on. It's too much! Also, this Lestat only apparently kills bad people. That Freniere boy? Really a \\"wanton killer\\". Those two prostitutes? They drugged and killed men. Anne Rice twists the events of IWTV so much that it becomes ridiculous. And why? So Lestat could be the main character of the series from here on out. Makes no sense. Many people, like me, loved Lestat because he was evil. He was the antagonist, the opposite of Louis.I find it very very hard to believe that Louis was lying the entire time while telling his story to Daniel in IWTV. But that appears to be the case. Lestat is the good guy! Louis got the wrong idea and lied and exaggerated. Why would Louis do that? Lestat never says, which is weird in itself... So yes, in this book you read that everything you thought was true in IWTV was really lies... Lestat is the good guy!The whole rock star story was incredibly lame and seemed like a desperate attempt to move the 18th century vampires to the 20th century. It did not work yet luckily it wasn't a huge part of the story. The story quickly became amazing. Lestat and Nicki were pure magic. Their \\"conversations\\" made me question the existence of nature, humans, animals, and ultimately of the entire world. Is there a heaven or simply oblivion? Those moments in the story are the reason why I gave it 3 stars as opposed to 2. His life with Nicki, at Renaud's, and his talks to Roget were fabulous.When Lestat becomes a vampire, the story gets weird. Firstly, the writing becomes scattered and hard to keep track of. It's confusing and no matter how many times I reread it it did not make much sense. Secondly, his sudden and random love of Magnus did not make sense either. However, Lestat would have many \\"sudden and random\\" loves in TVL. Also, he adjusted to being a vampire too quickly to care about the process (unlike Louis). The reader needed more time to mourn Lestat's death. The reader did not need to read on for thirty pages about the night sky or whatever else was described in way too much detail.Lestat's mother, where to start... Gabrielle is one of the most annoying, constantly yet there but distant, characters you will ever see. She does nothing, there is no point in her being in the story. She takes away the magical moments of the series and suddenly it turns into his Oedipal issues. Armand and his coven are a weak point as well. How many times was the word Devil used? Too many. By the 50th time someone said \\"...devil\\" I was laughing. Seriously. For a second, I thought I was reading TVA because you get his whole biography here too. Lestat dropped off so we could learn about Armand's human life, Marius, how Armand became a vampire, etc.Anne Rice's writing style became a drag. I loved IWTV immensely and was disappointed as this book went on...and on...and on. As another reviewer noted, how can I look childish, old, intense, mystical, sad, spiritual, sensual, and evil all at once? Furthermore, how can I talk about that look for pages? That's pretty much the tone of this book. It's a lot of looks, and a lot of feelings. Too many if you ask me.I can't help but feel like this book would have been much better if it were not about Lestat; because, frankly, this is not the Lestat we know and love from IWTV. This guy is a whining brat. Our play loving, charming, walking stick using, manic, evil Lestat is gone and replaced with this loving, caring, adorable, little guy. If it were called The Vampire Brad or a different name it would have been better because then Lestat's character could have still survived. Even if it was not about Lestat, I could only knock my review up to 4 stars. As the book dragged on, it became tedious and hard to endure.Also, Claudia is not mentioned as much as one would hope. Lestat only had one daughter, and it was this daughter that had tried to kill him not once but twice. She is only mentioned for a few minutes in the epilogue to IWTV that Lestat writes; in which he contradicts Louis and says he lied. However, when he flat out says \\"Claudia broke my heart\\" you feel true emotion in him. Considering this book, that says something...I think making Lestat the main character was a mistake. Louis, along with Claudia, are not only my personal favorites but are more relatable characters who have deeper feelings. Even though Anne Rice tries to give Lestat deep emotions, she fails when he falls in love with everything and everyone. He loses his magic, which, when considering the old manic Lestat, is truly a shame.As some other reviews have mentioned, why do all the characters need to be gay? It doesn't bother me, but I would like to see some other types of relationships happen. That is why I was hoping for some more Claudia mentions since they were together for 70 years - which Lestat says is a remarkable amount of time for vampires to be together. Even his mother-turned-girlfriend becomes a sort of transsexual and identifies as a male (she dresses in men's clothes, tries to cut all her hair off, and, when it grows back says she will cut it daily and burn it but ultimately wears a braid).I also think that Anne Rice in TVL is trying to target the lost gothic teenager. As a teenager who is not lost or goth, it's not working. She's trying too hard to be deep in the later parts of the book. Like I said, the whole \\"The Vampire Armand\\" section left me bored and confused. She comes off as a stiff person out of touch with the generation (ironically, much like Armand). Before I finish, I also want to mention that Armand in this is a god fearing devil worshiping man. Unlike in IWTV where he doesn't believe in much of anything.Like I started to say, Lestat is turned into a shadow of Louis. The love us readers have for Louis stems from the love Louis has for life, for philosophy, and for Claudia. He is deep and sad and his curse lies in the fact that he knows the best moments of his life (the moments with Claudia) are over and he is doomed to a bleak and depressing eternity without her because he doesn't have the courage to end it. Lestat, on the hand, is now being turned into a mushy kind of guy. He's now supposed to have this same respect for life and death like Louis has but without anything to support it.Overall, read this book if you can separate this Lestat from the old (and better) Lestat. Think of him as a new and different character. It's not a terrible book, just when thought of as a sequel to IWTV it pales in comparison. IWTV did not need nor want a sequal; especially one that ruined our dear characters from the first. Not terrible in its own right, terrible for the series. Some good parts, some great parts regarding philosophy, life, and oblivion, then a bleak mess."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I must admit that \\"Interview with the Vampire\\" had left me somewhat indifference, whether that feeling was influenced by the fact that I had seen the movie and already knew the story, I cannot tell. But this second book in the Chronicles is definitely a good surprise; I didn't expect to be this interested in it, and frankly, the books that made me want to go back to them and keep reading have been quite seldom as of late.If you've read the first book of the Chronicles and weren't convinced, then I recommend you give this one a try."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Interview with a Vampire is so far the best book I have read... ever. That sounds as though I am just trying to make this book sounds better than it is like some people so but believe me I am not. This book made me think it made me think up things that could happen to the characters such as; Lestat, Armand, Louise and Claudia. Ann Rice was very descriptive in the scenery, appearances and the way the characters spoke. Its seems as though she looked into things for the characters every detail was perfected every scene they were in. Louise (the main character) progressed and changed through out the book, first he was more human and loving and thoughtful, when he made Claudia a Vampire he became more quite dark, less talkative and more thoughtful (meaning he thought more into things) and then in the end he almost never talked he hated everything and argued a lot more with Armand.All and all this book rocked."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"My girlfriend wanted me to read this, and i wanted to like it. Let me give the uninitiated a brief glimpse of the book; it goes something like this:-Start: Exciting, swift, entertaining........starts to go on a bit.......long periods of yawning and feeling guilty for skim reading page after page.......gets better again :EndThere it is, no more no less. Not a great masterpiece of literature as some believe (If you'd ever read one you'd probably know). Average, long winded. I could try and tell you why, but the book has left me so exhausted that i am not going to waste any more effort on it."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"Read \\"Interview with the vampire\\" first and than try to change the perspective and see it from Lestat's point of view. First you'll get to know Lestat and than you change your mind if in the first book Louis described him as quite evil, you'll like him. Also you discover some amazing things about Armand, who you get to love even more. I really think that this is the best one. I wish I could give it 10 stars!"},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"After rereading Interview with the Vampire, I decided to give The Vampire Lestat a whirl again as well. I have always marveled at how different this novel is from the first installment of the Vampire Chronicles. This one has a more interesting edge, a gothic feel that is more contemporary than its predecessor. The one big similarity between the first two installments, however, is that they are both stories within another story. After almost a whole century's sleep, Lestat rises in the mid 1980s -- where the people have more freedom and there is such a thing as pop culture. Rock music and its dark messages intrigue him to the point of approaching a struggling band and offering to help with their music careers. After reading Louis's confessions in the fictionalized Interview with the Vampire (no one would have believed the story was real), Lestat decides it is his turn to tell his life story -- becoming a famous underground rock star in the process. There are various twists throughout the novel.Lestat's story is fascinating as he goes from being an unloved son of a marquis and hunter in France (before the Revolution) to becoming a vampire in the hands of Magnus and seeking other immortals to relate. I remember wanting to know how Lestat became a vampire when I first read this series and his side of the story is as compelling as it was to me the first time around. His perspective is different from Louis's and far more complex as well. He is my favorite character in the series -- dark, compelling, sensual. And I love how Anne Rice switches time periods from pre-Revolutionary France to the MTV generation in late twentieth century America. The one thing I found strange was that Lestat wanted to feed off of criminals and not of innocents in this installment. He was far more sinister in the first novel, but I suppose that Louis exaggerated things -- or is Lestat the liar? I suggest the Vampire Chronicles to those who haven't read it yet. Interview with the Vampire is great, but the series takes off with The Vampire Lestat, though I suggest you read this series from the very beginning."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The Vampire Lestat has conquered me and others around the world I have never imagined it could hook me so. I am only 14 years of age and I love vampires and when I read this story I knew I fell in love with the Vampire Lestat and for a while I felt sorry for the poor creature and sometimes bored but I kept reading on so I can hear his voice come out of the words.This story is set back in the 1780's before the French revolution was about to start. Lestat De Lioncourt was born into a noble family, but he loved the stage and he couldn't stand to be away from it. So after awhile his friend,Nikki, who is a violinst, comes up with the idea to runaway to Paris and join the theatre.Lestat is the talk of the town and is infamous very where even to a vampire. When the vampire makes him one he leaves the world by fire. Lestat must learn and live without this Vampire.Althrough lestat's life he makes the vampire world go upside down with his lifestyle. In this tale he searches for answers from an ancient named Marius and then in modern times he awakens to the sounds of music of our time called rock. Lestat joins a band and becomes a rockstar. Now he has betrayed the rules of being a vampire. He is living his life in the open among motals.This book and the rest of the series are works of art. I can see the pictures in my head as she describes it in words. This book is the best vampire book I have read besides the first book of the Vampire chonicles. I hope people will agree with me when they read this book that this is one book you will fall in love with and believe me I couldn't put it down.Let the Vampire enter your mind and soul though his words and eyes."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"The book I read was Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat. This is the 2nd book in the vampire chronicles, for those of you who don't know what the Vampire Chronicles are; it's the stories that go with Interview with a Vampire. This book that tells the whole story of the vampire Lestat. From what lead him to France, which lead him to be \\"born into darkness\\" and where he turned out in 1985. It tells about how he met Armand and his vampire coven, how he made his own Vampire offspring, how he met Marius and learned about \\"Those Who Must be Kept\\" and how he later became a rock star. In one of the scenes he and one of his vampire offspring. Gabrielle, were held prisoner by Armand's coven; well Lestat, disproves all of the old ways and beliefs wrong to the coven, then the coven turns on Armand. Later Armand deals with the coven in his own way. Since I was so obsessed with Interview with the Vampire (the book and movie) I just absolutely loved this book. I recommend this book for skilled readers because of its length, and I recommend it to anyone who loved Interview with a Vampire and wish to know the whole story behind it. The book I read was Anne Rice's The Vampire Lestat. This is the 2nd book in the vampire chronicles, for those of you who don't know what the Vampire Chronicles are; it's the stories that go with Interview with a Vampire."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I cannot believe how many people love this book. The first paragraph was excellent! The last 20 pages were awesome!!! The rest of the book was so tedious to get through. I am actually celebrating that I survived it!!! OK, this is a little sarcastic, sorry Anne. When she does dialog between people, her writing is fantastic. When she goes into telling background situations, I've never read anything more borring. It's like writing about some guy walking over to a tree and taking five pages to describe every detail and every thought that went through his mind. Geeze, I'm really bummed. I thought I'd love this series. Interview With the Vampire was fabulous. I love Lestat. He is a great character. I just wish The Vampire Lestat, was more about Lestat. For some reason the way she wrote the other characters, I could not have cared less about them. Sorry, I have to disagree with the majority on this one."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I LOVE to read everything and anything and I have this weird thing about finishing books no matter how bad they are. Well in this case I couldn't even finsish no matter how hard I tried (and at that point I just wanted to finish to get it over with).I read Interview with the Vampire and I struggled with it. I gave it the benefit of the doubt since I saw the movie first and figured that is probably why I didn't like it. So I decided to give Lestat a chance and I am sorry I ever did. I found this book to be very boring. It moved at a very slow pace and I gave up waiting for it to get good. I'm sure how so many people can love this book and consider it a great piece of literature?!

I think that it is one of the new classics. So naturally, I picked up this one. I wasn't impressed.The book basically tells the same story that we heard in Interview with the Vampire except it is longer and more boring. I always liked Louis a lot more than Lestat anyway. Like Louis, Lestat was created by a vampire who told him nothing about their kind so Lestat goes out to find more like him. I've heard this somewhere before.Some things I thought were very hard to follow. For example, The Story of Armand portion confused the heck out of me and the very long Marius's Story bored me to tears. I think that it also lacked the horror of Interview with the Vampire.The reason I have it three stars is because after Marius's Story I think that the book is good cause it FINALLY picked up steam. Changing his dying mother into a vampire was interesting to read also. Oh yeah, and the prolouge was pretty good too. But other than that, I thought it was a boring, longer copy of Interview."},{"Title":"THE VAMPIRE LESTAT","review":"I made the mistake of reading the reviews on all on Anne Rice before reading any of her work.

It was a major disapointment to read The Vampire Lestat which drones on and on but, for the most part, has no point.

The \\"Hilda\\" Dutch ring fell in August 1942, and the German ring of Harro Schulze-Boysen 'Choro\\" was exterminated at about the same period and just before the \\"Arwid\\" group of Arvid Harnak. The Swiss Dora group of Sandor Rado, ALexander Foote, and Rudof Roessler was stopped for some time as from 1943 by Masson the head of Swiss Intelligencce Service.Nowadays the incredible history of the Red Orchestra, which surpasses fiction, is twisted by politics (communists, ex-nazis, democrats...), by nationalistic aspects (Russians, French, Swiss, Belgians, Germans) and by the Allied victors. There are accounts by surviving actors (Trepper, Rado, Roeder, Foote, Puenter, Sudoplatov...) There are however, to this day, only three serious purely historical relations: the CIA report, V. E. Tarrant's book and Heinz Hoehne's account. The German historian has supplied the most accurate and exhaustive account on this incredible spy ring.Pierre Accoce and Pierre Quet's book made romantic assumptions which were demonstrated ot be false and the author had to admit their fabrications. K. Bienal and L. Krausher focused on the German branch of the spy ring. Louis Kilzer's work is fascinating but it makes an assumption it doesn't succeed sustaining. Gilles Perrault is too focused on the Franco-Belgium part of the Orchestra. Anthony Read and David Fisher are trying to recuperate the Red Orchestra for Ultra which for some British writers was the second world war \\"deus ex machina\\". Some other interesting books are written in German or in French and are not translated.Heinz HOEHNE'S book is the most accurate of the books on the Red Orchestra. Read it first, and then read some books by the actors: first Leopold Treper, then Sandor Rado, then Alexander Foote and then Otto Puenter.After that, if you still have question, you can go for details in the CIA and Tarrant books. We are taught that this the network illustrates a great victory for the allies, but reading through these books tend to show that it was a drama for us and a great victory for Walter Schellenberg's Nazi counter-espionage, and Heinrich Mueller's Gestapo boutchers.With Kilzer and Perrault's books, this is the most pleasant book to read on the subject. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"The Colour of Canada","review":"Originally published in 1967 to celebrate the Centennial Year and Expo, this 1983 3rd edition is the latest.This book divides up pictures of Canada into five regional chapters:The Maritimes;Into Quebec;Ontario;The Prairies;British Columbia.At first sight the book is a picture book with text pages limited to 10%. However the text pages and the captions to the pictures are so well written that they make the book a lasting treasure. Geographic and historic facts are beautifully mixed with descriptive images and phrases of poetic grace in brief but powerful captions to photographs that are so vast they often require more than one page.Here is a caption for a picture of the Canadian Rockies:The prairie begins its transformation into foothill and then to mountain once you have passed the 110th meridian of longitude. Farther south, in Colorado, the moment arrives some eight meridians of longitude farther east, the Canadian prairie being wider than the American because the Rockies swerve easterly south of the border. After the swells of the foothills come the waves of the rockies, grey, minaretted, the earth in tempest all the way to the Pacific. Yet, in the troughs of these waves are the absolute stillness of the valleys and the perfect reflection of the mighty rocks in placid, glacier-fed lakes.What is lacking from the book are the people of Canada. Most of the pictures are landscapes with a few architectural photos added. Where there are people in the pictures they arepart of the background. The only portrait is one of the author at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Ring Companion","review":"More appropriately, this book should be titled \\"Ring Companion\\", in reference to the title of the original film... not out of any fanboy sense of correctness, but rather out of the author's definite bias which colours the book. This wouldn't be an issue, except that the book is marketed as a companion to \\"The Ring\\" (especially via the cover graphic, which is an allusion to the American remake), while the author clearly hates that film. Thus, fans of the American version are likely to be disappointed in Meikle's coverage of that film. Meikle gives over far too often to his own critical reviews of the installments of the franchise, with the result that those items he enjoyed receive loving and detailed coverage (especially Suzuki's original book and Nakata's first movie), while all others get buried under his diatribes on the faults he found with them. This is especially evident in his treatment on the American adaptation \\"The Ring\\", where Meikle constantly adds his own snide comments and conclusions to the details he presents on the development and making of the film. His final, parting shot, \\"The Ring is dead. Long live Ring.\\", emphasizes that this really isn't a Ring \\"companion\\", but rather Denis Meikle's personal review of the franchise."},{"Title":"Ring Companion","review":"The Ring Companion is much more than about The Ring books, and movies. It is a history of horror films and writing both in the East and in the West. At times it reads like film theory and is extremely well researched. Where it falls apart is the personal opinion of the author about The Ring films (Japanese, American and Korean), and the surge of Asian horror films afterward. The second to last chapter that describes a large amount of these films seems to flame everyone instead of just describing them. The author becomes a critic at that point instead of a neutral observer. Having seen many of the films in question I found the flames unwarranted and petty."},{"Title":"Ring Companion","review":"The most excellent look at the whole Ring series. Fabulous pictures and excellent writing. If you are a ring fan there are still more things to know. Get this book!!!"},{"Title":"Song, Dance, and Customs of Peasant Poland.","review":"I was really impressed by this book. Frankly, I liked it better than \\"Polish Customs and Tradition\\" book by Hodorowicz, which is the most known book on the subject of Polish tradition.The author has not only a deep and comprehensive knowledge of Polish peasant culture (since she was born in Poland) but she also writes about it in a very interesting way. She is a great observer and she is in love with Polish culture. I could feel it!The book is divided into four major parts. It starts with the general information about Polish peasants and their culture, then it goes through the \\"Cycle of the Seasons\\" which describes life and festivities connected with different holidays through the year. The next part \\"The parts of the whole\\" explains regional differences, talks briefly about all Polish regions. The final fourth part \\"The home circle\\" talks about the events and celebrations which are not necessarily related to the seasons - like the birth, marriage, funerals etc.The book deals with Poland before and after World War II when the majority of Poles lived still in villages. This makes it even more interesting since it relates to this time in the history where the peasants were still not spoiled by modern civilization!I really recommend it!!!"},{"Title":"Song, Dance, and Customs of Peasant Poland.","review":"My cousin and I share a genealogical interest in Poland as we are of Polish descent. She recommended this book to me, and while I have not yet competed it, I am impressed by the author's observations. Although our family, like so many others, came to the United States in the 1800s, our generation follows many of the traditions, language and customs of our grandparents. Much, of course, has been lost in the past 100 years in this country, but some of the sayings remain in nearly daily use (for example: \\"starosc nie radosc, smierc nie pocieha\\" is one of them and the author gives a fair translation early on in the book). This book, for me, will be a reference book in my library and a welcome edition it will be."},{"Title":"Song, Dance, and Customs of Peasant Poland.","review":"I was nicely surprised at the level of detail about Polish songs and customs.I recall parents, grandparents and inlaws relating various customs and this book provided the detail I hadn't been told. It is interesting how Poles were attuned to the various Saints, and some of the customs and superstitions had their roots in pagan times. Because I am studying my family genealogy, I read it from front to back without 'skimming' through. Quite absorbing!"},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Full color photographs and beautiful artwork adorn each and every page of this massive collection. This book covers nearly every religous culture of the ancient world including: Sumerian, Egyptian, Greek, Celtic, Nordic, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Native American, Mesoamerican, South American, African, Aboriginal, and Polynesian. Worth far more than what Amazon is selling it for. A terrific reference for all those studying ancient history or comparitive religion."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"Yes, this is a &quot;coffee table book.&quot; And yes, it is huge and heavy. But then, it would have to be to cover so much material and to include so many beautiful illustrations.Before I get into the &quot;meat&quot; of the book, I'd like to discuss the illustrations. It is difficult to imagine the amount of study and research it must have taken to find these illustrations. They range from thousand year old papyrus illustrations to frescoes to ancient pottery, to antique stone and jade carvings to statuary and on and on. They come from a myriad of ancient cultures and sources. If there were no text in MYTHOLOGY, it would be worth owning just for the art work.But text there is! The text is broken down by geographical area, and by culture within that area. Also included, are maps where appropriate. For instance, the locations of the labors of Herakles (Hercules to the Romans) which I will discuss further later.From the standpoint of depth of detail, this is not a scholarly reference. Rather, it is the work of good story tellers, for, after all, the ancient myths were good stories. By this I mean that the book is aimed at the layman (like me), and wherever you open it at random, you will find a great tale of ancient gods, monsters, giants, heroes, and just plain humans. These tales have come down through time, some predating the advent of writing.MYTHOLOGY opens with a general discussion of mythology, comparing myths with magic mirrors which reflect the hopes and fears of ancient civilizations, and often, those of our civilization, today. Mythological tales, we are told, form the basis of much of the world's literature, philosophy and religion.As I mentioned, MYTHOLOGY makes wonderful reading, last night I opened it randomly to the section on Herakles and spent a wonderful half an hour or so reading about Herakles and his labors, the lustiness of some gods, the pettiness of others, and the good and the deceitful sides of men. All that in thirty minutes.Pick a mythological character be he god or monster, hero or human, and the chances are good that you will find him here."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This massive coffee-table style book gives a good overview of some of the major mythologies in the world. Overall, it has both good and bad points, with the good generally outweighing the bad.The good points include the wide range of mythological stories that are related. While Greek mythology - certainly the most well-known and influential in Western culture - gets more space than any other culture (over one hundred pages), there is plenty of space dedicated to the whole world of mythology: Egyptian, Babylonian, Norse, Chinese, Indian and Japanese amongst them. A wide range of illustrations and photos help tell the stories.Although wide-ranging, I think there are some noticeable gaps, both within specific sections (for example, no story of Eros and Psyche in the Greek myths) and significant types of myths that are neglected. It would have been interesting to see a little about the Arthurian legends, which are a big part of British mythology. The other thing that is missing is any sort of comparisons. While many cultures had creation and flood stories, there is little direct commentary on the similarities or differences. It would have also been interesting to see some discussion on parallels between myths and the stories of the Bible.Of course, this book is big enough as it is, and editing decisions needed to be made. While this book suffers from the flaw of incompleteness, it does not have flawed writing, which makes it a good book although (literally) not a light read."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"A reference book of this quality is an excellent addition to your reference library... especially if you are the type of person who likes to understand other's at a deep level. Whatever your subject, students of many different topics would also find this an indispensable title to have in your library. With more than 700 colour photographs and nearly 700 pages of information-packed pages to look through, \`Mythology' is an excellent value reference book to add to your collection.Even though there is a lot of information presented in this book, it is set out in a way that makes it easy to find the information you are looking for. The chapters are set out in the following structure:1. Meaning of Myth2. Cradles of CivilisationEgypt's Divine KingshipAncient MesopotamiaThe Glories of Greece and Rome3.

I bought it primarily for the art; brilliant color photographs and original drawings are included to illustrate most of the stories.This book is also remarkable for its inclusion of often-marginalized cultures. I've seen many a &quot;world mythology&quot; book that doesn't seem to notice that Africa or the Americas exist. This is not one of them.It does seem to generalize a little--nobody can be a complete expert on every mythology in the world. For example, the Celtic section emphasizes the role of male sky and sun gods, like those of Greek myth, when in fact there were many non-sky gods (both male and female) who were just as popular, and when there are many solar-related goddesses to be found in that mythology. But this is definitely a beautiful and useful reference if you are looking for general information."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"this anthology collects a broad overview of myths from around the world... it is great as a reference book, and for readers who want to familiarize themselves with the central myths of various cultures. the illustrations are excellent, and the format makes for easy reading- within the longer myths, smaller boxes contain snippets and short stories that introduce the god/esses and other characters.the way the book is written in interesting- half of the myths are told in story or fable style, while the other half are moreso theoretical overviews and analyses (really very basic and introductory, nothing tooooo deep here).the trouble i have with this book, for my purposes (collecitng myths to use in high school English classes) is that the retelling and style of myths is inconsistent throughout the anthology. i gather that different writers produced the different sections, and it is sometimes obvious (some sections are much better than others, more clear and comprehensible).ultimately this book is an overview, and is great for what it is."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This big book with an excellent selection of illustrations from historical artworks is marvelous in scope and scholarship. It may not include every myth, but it covers an awesome range of stories--many with alternative versions--and gives informative cultural and contextual background.I bought one copy for myself and just ordered two more for gifts. It's a real treasure."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"\\"Mythology\\" by Littleton is a rather large and picture-heavy tome of mythologies from all over the world. It covers Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Greek, Roman, Celtic, Viking, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, Native American, Mesoamerican, South American, African, and Oceanic pantheons and myth-cycles. Each section provides a neat and concise summary of the major mythological features, elements, and characters of each culture.It really is a great tome for anyone interested in keeping a mythology book on their coffee table - the pictures, photos, and information are accurate and concise in presentation.The two drawbacks I see with this book are: 1.) A lack of pronunciation guides, and 2.) An almost complete lack of information concerning Biblical/Judeo-Christian mythology.If you're looking for a nice coffee table book or have a causal interest in mythology, this is a nice find."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"It's impossible to fit every myth from every part of the world into one book, but the editors did an admirable job in collecting various myths and organizing them in this book. The myths are concise and the book is easy to read due to its excellent organization and its lovely pictures. For anyone wishing to learn about world mythology or just one country's tales, this is a wonderful introduction. This book has a treasured place on my bookshelf, and for good reason."},{"Title":"Mythology","review":"This book is the best thing I have bought in a long time!! It gives great overviews of most of the non-christian religions and mythologies from all over the world. It is easy to read and very enjoyable to read.

Most impressively, they have returned to the 1920s, when the contemporary notion of \\"European Union\\" began. They note that an element of deception has been present since the very earliest years of the project, demonstrating that the idea's early exponents believed that their utopian ideals, whilst admirable, ought to be realized without the knowledge or participation of the member countries' peoples. In fact, Booker and North reveal that a strong tendency of the strain of Unionists which created the present Brussels regime has been to shun democracy by creating a supranational authority with no meaningful accountability to the people, whilst simultaneously subverting individual states' national sovereignty. A thoroughly absorbing and fascinating read, one essential for anyone interested in contemporary European politics. The defeat in France and the Netherlands of the EU constitution has not rendered this book irrelevant; indeed, it provides a warning about the accumulated power of a body still very much in being and still very zealous to reach the consummation of its endeavors."},{"Title":"Great Deception: The Secret History of the European Union","review":"Excellent book - explains fully and in clear terms the political deception made by politicians over the years.

A gem of suspense, it was first published in the early nineteen seventies and went on to become a popular movie of the same name, starring Katherine Ross. There is now a remake of the film version, starring Nicole Kidman in the lead role with Bette Midler in a supporting role and Christopher Walken as head of the sinister Men's Association described in the book. So, interest is now renewed in this very readable book, which, despite its simplicity and brevity, is a thinly disguised social commentary on the reaction of men to the early women's liberation movement.The story is very simple but gripping and well written in clear, straightforward prose. Joanna Eberhart moves to the seemingly bucolic town of Stepford with her husband, Walter, and two children, leaving behind the dangers of big city living. An independent, assertive, intelligent, and creative woman, Joanna epitomizes the newly liberated women of the nineteen seventies. Looking for like souls with whom to become friends, she seeks out some of the other married women of the town, only to find that they are all uniformly addicted to housework, give their husbands complete obeisance, are made up to the gills, and have figures courtesy of maidenform.Joanna manages to find several like-minded women such as her. Yet, when they, too, become addicted to housework after having a romantic weekend alone with their respective husbands, Joanna becomes convinced that the town's Men's Association has hatched a nefarious plot to change all the wives of Stepford into submissive Barbie dolls. Will Joanna manage to escape the fate of the rest of the Stepford wives? Read the book and find out. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"SQL: Practical Guide for Developers (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"The content of the book lives up to the title - clear and concise, right to the point. It is tightly written, not too much and not too less - just enough for the intended target audience (students and/or beginner software developers). In my opinion the main strength of the book is there are plenty examples to illustrate the concepts, and the examples are very well written and structured throughout the book. The only weakness preventing it from getting a 5-out-of-5 is that the book does not have answers to the review questions and tests listed at the end of the chapters, kind of defeating the purpose of having these well thought-out tests in the book in the first place. However, if you are looking for a quick refresher or introductory to SQL, this book will do the job well."},{"Title":"SQL: Practical Guide for Developers (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"I am using this book in my \\"Intro. to SQL Database Programming\\" college course. I'm sorry, but I cannot recommend this book - it was obviously rushed to print before the bugs had been worked out; figures are missing important details (e.g., the Schema in Fig 1.4); and the index is laughably deficient. Not enough examples are given. This book should not have been printed in its present form. Numerous typos exist. It needs a lot of work. NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"SQL: Practical Guide for Developers (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)","review":"This would have been a fair book for a developer's quick reference. It covers many of the broad topics (select, update, nested queries, joins) and does so in a decent fashion. I originally bought this book so that I could have a quick reference nearby that I could look up UNION or other statements that are not used as much.I was pretty happy with the book as I read through it... that is until the day that I actually had to find a statement in it. I have quite a large collection of computer books and I have never seen anything like it. If you turn to the index page to look up SELECT (I mean... really?) there is no entry there. In fact.. all you see is one page with three columns that have about 20 items per column. And all of this fills about half of the page. Oh wait! There is a little sticker up at the top of this ridiculous page that says \\"See such and such a webpage for full index\\".The worst thing about this index is that it doesn't even have useful entries. It is as if some typesetter had about five minutes before the presses started up and someone said \\"Hey!!! Billy! We don't have an index! Why don't you randomly look up about 50 words in the book and make a real quick index! No one will know!\\" Well.. sadly.. Billy didn't have any idea what SQL was except that it starts with an 'S'.The only reason I give two stars instead of -1 is that it seems that the author made a decent effort to make a simple introduction to SQL for a poor developer who needs a quick source for answers. The only problem is the index will not help someone find that quick answer.So... I would stay away from this book unless you know that the index which has been posted on the publishers website is actually part of the book.Bah to MK publishers! All they needed to do was spend two days making an index instead of scrambling and they would have had 4 stars and I wouldn't have tossed this book into the corner behind all of the other disappointing books I have."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters","review":"Very good book, many of the reviewers have already stated what I would say as well.

Sometimes it's hard to find a book to keep my attention when it comes to the topic of being awake. I understand what to look for on the subject, in my young 20's I woke up. For some reason I did not understand why I began to fell the way I now felt about people. My thoughts were I love all of God's children regardless because he loves them (and because I love him) but being young and with all the blessings that were comming to me my heart became greedy and harden. As I've stated not understanding why these good deeds were happening, this book tells you who what where when why and how. What is happening, why it is happening in life, how to understand and combat the situation so it ends. That is not all, it touches on some topics that one would find in a book about the craft, religion (does not go into detail) also personal development.

Ignore the usual publisher's advertising hype written to buy the book - quick fame and fortune. The exercises in the book provide a good starting point for students wanting to experience more about meditation, and mystical exercises, and understand the cyclical effects in their lives. If you closely examine the 52-day cycles and arrange the beginning/ending periods to fit your personal date of birth, you will have an insight into the real cyclical effects of your past successes and failures.

Detailed steps to progress in your relationship to the divine permeates the book. ...Don't sound like the Devil to me!To be fair, if I wasn't already on a mystical path, I would assume from the surface of it all, that the title was an overstatement. Not true. But as the Rosicrucians say, some people may not be ready for this. My best endorsement is that I own three copies of it now. While the book does NOT do tirades, it is clear from what IS inferred, that we have been lied to grossly at every turn. This is a good place to start that turnaround.

His \\"A Rosicrucian Speaks\\" is very different & IMHO far less valuable than this masterwork. I believe Mr. Weed was strongly criticized by AMORC for publishing this book which succinctly reveals much private information that Rosicrucian students receive over years of study & practice--it was felt that people were not ready to receive this information in such a condensed format-- p. 167: \\"The unknown is always discovered through the known. This is the way we learn.\\" In accordance with Mr. Weed's several warnings, beware of delving too swiftly into these practices. As he states, p. 123: \\"Energy that is built up demands release, & if we do not open doors for it & guide it in the proper direction it is likely to break out in an undesirable way.\\" Patience & a step-by-step approach is strongly recommended. Some of the teachings in this book, though based on Rosicrucian principles, are specific to Mr. Weed, but this does not detract from them as he was an accomplished Rosicrucian. Topics in the book include: harmonium, karma, reincarnation, types of energy, thought, healing, the cycles of life, prayer, telepathy, developing psychic ability, & psychic projection. I agree that many people could be successful in such practices. Whether people are ready is another story. Still, if you find this book & really practice these techniques as given, you are probably ready. I would also recommend reading the works of H. Spencer Lewis, former Imperator of AMORC, for further information, esp. on \\"The Cycles of Life.\\" For more on Rosicrucian philosophy, see the works of his son, Ralph M. Lewis.This book is written in a concise, yet easily readable style with many experiments/exercises. I notice many parallels with Tibetan Buddhism herein. For example: p. 6: \\"From the very beginning you must learn to be more aware, not less so\\" & p. 168: \\"Energy flows from you to whatever you direct your attention [kavvanah]. We can also turn our attention to Great Beings that do not ordinarily manifest in physical form & from them receive a corresponding return of high grade energy which will stimulate & rejuvenate us in every way, physical, mental, & spiritual.\\" This reminds me of Kabbalistic kavvanah (intention) as well as Tibetan Buddhist guru/deity yoga. For the right student, this is a great book. Even for an accomplished Rosicrucian, it's a wonderful refresher. It is NOT a new age book, but is, rather, based on old, tested, efficacious principles."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters","review":"What a wonderful book. Filled with esoteric insight that took the author decades to learn. Here it is in print, narrowed down to the core,the heart of information that opens up a portal to metaphysical and spiritual understanding.

I recommend it to all who want to cut to the chase learning to raise their vibrational freqency,increase psychic energy and abilities, and resonate with a higher awareness. I am glad this book FOUND ME."},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters","review":"Being a neophyte myself, it takes a leap of faith to fully embrace the ideas Weed presents in his book. For instance, he talks about using the power of thought to control your destiny and sending/ receiving telephathic messages. Such ideas defy reasoned thinking, so in a way its almost delusional to accept everything at face value. I've tried to keep and open mind yet proceed with caution.Believe me, I would love to surrender my skepticism. But, instead I have chosen the hypothesize, test, and evaluate what Weed has to say.With that said, I am entirely fascinated by the idea of studying one's own thinking process in the techniques he has provided.The writing style is concise and easily understandable. Well written!The only thing that could have made this book more enjoyable was if it listed an index of all the meditation techniques. This is because Weed includes them within his writing. As you begin reading you may want to jot down a list of all the practical techniques as you go (at least the page numbers).Its hard to describe but the meditation techniqes Weed provides for releasing positive and negative energy really worked (for me). Also, they were easy to do. I really feel its a strategy that will help one control his/her emotions and bring them to a steady equilibrium (harmonium). I have to give Mr. Weed credit here. Chapter 1, How to Understand Yourself and Attain Harmonium really worked! Though, I suggest you decide for yourself.The Amazon testimonial for this book is gimmicky and the same one that appears on the back cover of this book. It promises wealth, power and happiness! Weed's own writing doesn't quite match that tone. Instead he provides compelling techniques that are easy and enjoyable to work on. Wealth, power and happiness ends up being more of a side-benifit Weed mentions. You don't have to worry that Weed is giving you a sales pitch the whole book. He doesn't.(You will not find a history of the AMORC or other Rosicrucian orders in this book. This book really is a self-study guide.)In a way, I almost suspected a slight sales campaign for the AMORC in this book. To paraphrase, he often makes the comment \\"only students of the AMORC will have full access to the monographs that teach this [or that] lesson.\\" What I mean, is there is a bit of an enticement for the reader to explore more about the AMORC. However, this may simply be my perception.My hope here is that my review tells the skeptic \\"Don't worry, its ok to be skeptical and keep an open mind too.\\" I hope what I've said is helpful.Weeds book deserves 5 stars. Its earnest, sincere and well written.Good Luck finding your path in life!-AO"},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters","review":"I could say so many things... and the other reviewers have said plenty.Instead, let me tell you how this book makes me feel, and please let me use this words: I WISH I COULD TAKE THIS BOOK WITH ME WHEN I DIE AND BRING IT BACK TO MY NEXT LIFE, I MEAN, TO BE BORN WITH THIS BOOK IN MY HANDS (LITERALY) ALONG SIDE MY OTHER FAVORITE BOOK \\"THE YOGAS AND OTHER WORKS\\" BY SWAMI VIVEKANANDA.If the information that this books has is taken to the heart, then, you will become the \\"master of your own destiny\\".Here is a glimpse, but, do not read lightly... furthermore, is you don't read slowly, you will miss the \\"in between words\\" enlightenment. One sentence is the equivalent of pages, if not entire volumes! How I wish I could have read these books (Vivekananda's and Weed's) as soon as I learned how to read when I was a child!! (Inside brackets is mine):****************************************What is the difference between good and evil and how may I distinguish it? ...A good thought, wish or act is one which conforms to the law of nature; evil is that which is at variance with nature's law. As to know the law-this requires the application of intelligence and good judgment. In the ultimate you will only know the law, really know it, through your own experience. However, you can learn it much more quickly and save yourself grief if you will accept and act on advice from more advanced souls who have already traveled along the road through life and encountered the same problems that beset you.It is very difficult for us to see ourselves as we really are. We have been conditioned from earliest childhood to ignore all but the most vigorous and solid impacts upon our consciousness. We are trained by life and by our elders to be materialists. Small wonder, therefore, we give so little value to the spiritual and attach so much importance to the physical and its correlative emotions. Since that is true for all of us, it is foolhardy to ignore the physical or, worse still, try to pretend it does not exist. Far better, give it full recognition and use it as the foundation upon which a higher awareness is built. This deliberate expansion of consciousness is a step-by-step progression along a path for which this book serves as a guide.So this book deals in facts and offers instruction only in those skills and abilities that have been successfully demonstrated by men and women like yourself.Every man, woman and child in the world is advancing and developing, whether he or she realizes it or not. For some the rate of progress is slow; others go along at an average pace, a few are far out ahead. Each person is different. There are no carbon copies. Some strive to improve and others care for nothing but their own physical satisfactions. Those who want to develop and really try soon outdistance their fellows and come earlier to a true understanding of life. Their open minds, their intellectual curiosity and their persistent efforts bring them eventually to a Teacher who can lead them on the path to illumination and Cosmic Consciousness.No one is contacted by such a Teacher until he has trained himself and is ready for the disciplines involved. You have often heard, \\"When the student is ready, the Master will appear.\\" The important word in this promise is \`ready.' No one is ready by accident or by gift of Divine Providence. You get ready by training yourself, by study, by practicing certain exercises and by becoming skilled in the prescribed mental techniques. Along with this must go better understanding of who and what you are and why you do the things you do. All this, plus discipline and self-control, is part of the process of \\"getting ready.\\" [all contained in this book]We learn by doing-so waste no time. If you would discover your hidden abilities and put them to work, start now. Thoughtful experiment and persistent striving are the keys. You must do. The techniques have been given [in this book]. Your rate of progress is now up to you.Chapters:1-The human body: How to understand yourself and attain harmonium2-The principle of Karma: How you can make and remake your future3-Birth, Death and Reincarnation4-The power of thought: First steps to the control of your destiny5-The power of thought: Physical-Etheric and emotional energy6-The power of thought: Controlling mental and psychic energy7-Healing through the power of psychic energy8-Understanding the Law of Cycles9-The power of prayer10-How to understand and use telepathy11-How to generate and apply psychic energy12-Achieving psychic development13-The secret of psychic projection14-The Rosicrucian way of life****************************************Here, I will remind you of what Buddha said (extracted from Karma Yoga by Swami Vivekananda and The Secret Doctrine by H.P. Blavatsky): \\"Believe not because some old manuscripts are produced, believe not because it is your national belief, because you have been made to believe it from your childhood; believe not because a holy man preaches you; believe not because of holy books; but reason it all out, and after you have analyzed it, then, if you find that it will do good to one and all, believe it, live up to it, and help others to live up to it.\\"Now, the fact that you are reading this review, and probably you will read this book, means that you want to advance faster by trusting others; otherwise you will be learning by your own experience and would not care to do this (read reviews, books, and follow someone else's advise), so, I'll say this: read the book and put it into practice, just like Buddha suggested. Take what is useful to you, leave what it is not... no matter what, I assure you, this book will help you change and shape your destiny immediately!Again, a word of advice: don't read it lightly... read it and re-read it, and then, read it again, and again. Every time, you will discover something new!! Don't forget to read in between the lines.It is well known that H.P. Blavatsky made only two books of the \\"Secret Doctrine\\", and she said that the third one was almost ready but never got published. She did hint that it was going to deal with the psychological (in a very esoteric yet practical way) aspect of man. I don't know what she wrote in that third book (I have an idea though, and it has nothing to do with the \\"third book\\" of the Secret Doctrine that has been published by Annie Besant) but this book \\"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters\\" and \\"The Yogas and other Works\\" by Swami Vivekananda (both books) can very well take its place.For those who want to start on the mystic path and would like to save years of hard search and \\"trial-and-error\\"... this is your book.Here you have a little more from the same writer... and it is free (write together everything inside quotations):\\"www\\" period and then \\"arosicrucianspeaks\\" period and then \\"com\\" and \\"/index\\" and finally \\".html\\""},{"Title":"Wisdom of the Mystic Masters","review":"This book, along with &quot;Phychic Energy&quot;, also by Joseph J. Weed, were first purchased and read by me in 1974. Throughout the years, I have consulted, and re-read them, time and time again. With simple, easy to do experiments, you can track your progress, and prove once and for all that you are a part of something greater. A few of the references are dated, but the main truths and contents are just as valid now as when my copy of the 1968 edition was published. You owe it to yourself, to be equipped with the tools, and to prove it once and for all time, that the mystical path is the true path.

Period. I have read several dozen Rosicrucian books and this is by far the best. Keep in mind, I am biased towards the Beverly Hall side of Rosicrucianism (founded by my great, great grandfather) so me giving this praise towards Mr. Weed, a student of AMORC, is REALLY saying something!Perhaps the only \\"down\\" side to this book, is that it is TOO informative. By Weed's own admission, he is revealing things that took him 30+ years of study and practice in just 200 pages! For the \\"average\\" person, I fear it could be overwhelming and therefor one may not take the practices seriously. One could not make a more serious mistake. Again, I have not found a better book on the subject of astral projection, levitation, teleportation, telepathy, etc. The very best so far!For someone seeking an introduction to the Rosicrucian mind set, one should try to obtain a copy of \\"The Way to Happiness\\" by R. S. Clymer. A much better \\"introduction\\" as this book is NOT! This book is filled with nothing but the most advanced abilities, if not concepts.

Unfortunately I loaned the book to a friend and could never get it back. I soon thereafter made contact with the Rosicrucians.

I mourned the loss of this book for twentyfive years, and just happened across it here in Amazon. I am now reading it again, and I am amazed at how much I have progressed....and how much more there is to do.

In the latter 1910s the Cardinals with Branch Rickey as General Manager were building an immense farm system where Darwinism on the baseball field was practiced almost as a religion. The Cardinals offered my grandfather and his friend contracts, and with them chances to rise through the farm system to the parent ball team. The friend signed the contract, but my grandfather acceded to the wishes of his Baptist parents who did not want him to play baseball on the Sabbath and declined the offer. He always regretted that decision, because he said he was just as good a player as his friend, Ray Blades. Blades played for the Cardinals between 1922 and 1932 and managed them in 1939 and 1940.The career of Ray Blades, a solid but certainly not a hall of fame player for the Cardinals, as well as a lot of other Cardinal careers, is told in this well illustrated and shallowly written book by Donald Honig. The Cardinals have been one of the most successful major league baseball franchises in the United States, only the legendary New York Yankees have won more pennants, and this book is largely a celebration of that tradition of excellence. We learn much about the on-field activities of the various teams of Cardinals over the years. The great Cardinal players are profiled here as the author develops a chronological narrative of the team's history. We learn about the taciturn manner of Rogers Hornsby in the 1920s, the antics of Dizzy Dean and the Gas House Gang in the 1930s, the formidable team of the 1940s led by Stan Musial and Enos Slaughter, the determination of Bob Gibson pitching for the Cardinals in the 1960s, and the slick defense of Ozzie Smith and the three-time pennant winning Cardinals of the 1980s.\\"The St. Louis Cardinals: An Illustrated Historv\\" is an enjoyable reading assignment and any fan of the game will appreciate it as a good description of the team's evolution over the years. The emphasis is clearly on the popular aspects of baseball, play by play commentary of World Series games and the like, it is just a buff book.While enjoyable this book is flawed as a work of serious history. Let pass that it contains no scholarly apparatus and makes no attempt to develop a thesis. My biggest complaint is its handling (or in most cases, non-handling) of important issues which should have been discussed in detail. As an example, a most important part of baseball history is the manner in which the game has handled issues of race. The Cardinals had numerous racial difficulties in the 1960s, and probably before and since, yet there is little here to indicate that Bob Gibson was a justifiably angry man on many occasions over these matters. There is also little attempt to deal seriously with the issue of contracts, especially the dismantling of the infamous reserve clause tying a player to a team indefinitely which Cardinal player Curt Flood assaulted in the 1960s and opened the door for its eventual demise. It paved the way for free agency and the multi-million dollar contracts that even mediocre baseball players enjoy today. There is also little explanation of the attraction of baseball to the people of St. Louis. Why do they love the Cardinals so much and why do the Cardinals consistently draw more than 2 million fans every year regardless of the quality of the team on the field? Contrast that with Washington, D.C., which has lost two major league baseball teams because of lack of attendance. A social and cultural analysis of the relationship of the Cardinals with St. Louis would have been valuable and uniquely illuminating."},{"Title":"Meditation: The Light from Within : Edgar Cayce's Approach to Life's Challenges","review":"I found this book interesting seeing as that I never really knew anything about meditation. Mr. Glover gives a pattern to follow without necessarily telling you directly what you need to meditate about. At times, the book was a little confusing with the readings from Cayce intertwined in between. However, the real life stories that Mr. Glover included and the afterword tied everything together for me as far as reaching for light, the power, the energy within and learning how to communicate on a different level with my Creator."},{"Title":"Table Chic","review":"Very disappointed.

The only reason that I didn't rate this 5 star is because you will need more than this course to feel confident. The additional lessons from PIMSLEUR are extremely expensive. I recommend PORTUGUESE IN 10 MINUTES a day (less than $20) and a basic Brazilian Portuguese course(often inexpensive or free). If you wish to go deeper into the language, get \\"501 Portuguese verbs\\" and \\"Essential Portuguese Grammer\\".

It uses repetitive short conversations and sentences to intuitively learn grammar and structure without formally \\"thinking\\" about the grammar and structure. This approach is slow, but very effective. Each lesson is 30 minutes in length and gradually adds to the previous lesson. Other language CDs often just have you mimic and repeat different words or sentences over and over, which gets old fast. Pimsleur has you repeat the words a few times, but then asks you to recall them on your own, and puts them in context using short conversations where you ask and answer questions with an imaginary Brazilian woman sitting next to you (presumably at a bar). The Conversational series are just an introduction to PImsleur Level I courses, so you won't know much by the end of them, and will need to buy the full set (over $300). But if you aren't interested in learing formal grammar, then give the Conversational Brazilian Portuguese CDs a try before you invest in the full level I course."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I am using this in conjunction with other sources. I listen to it to get a better grasp on pronunciation. However, I also purchased a good book (Portuguese in 10 minutes a day) as well. I tend to like underlining things and making notes etc, so for me a good book was a necessity; as well as reference material, such as a book of verbs, and a dictionary. I am close to halfway through the CDs and it is excellent for teaching you how to say certain phrases competently. But I want to learn more than canned questions and answers. Besides, if one has memorized the phrases and responses by rote, they would probably not be able to carry on a conversation if the subject matter changes. I intend to get a good grasp on the basics to begin with, and then proceed to an intermediary level, so I am using this CD series as well as some written material too."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I am fluent in both Spanish and English.

Like they teach you a very veeeery limited vocabulary and they make phrases out of those words.Anyway, I'm buying another one.

Currently, I'm taking a Portuguese class to learn how to read and write in Portuguese and my teacher told me that I should have registered for the 2nd level class!

Each 30 minute lesson incorporates critical vocabulary, important grammatical rules as well as ample review material, all presented in a straightforward, lucid manner. The interactive dialog with native speakers conversing at a normal pace builds confidence in speaking and helps develop an ear for the language. This is the best feature of the course. The biggest drawback is the absence of a workbook. I understand the argument that looking at the words can detract from learning the speech, especially in a language like Portuguese with its unusual spellings. But not knowing how the words are spelled leaves a big gap. I highly recommend it as an \\"introduction\\", but you'll need to buy something else even just to get a basic overview.

It is a great and inexpensive way to see if Pimsleur is the correct choice for you to learn the language.It is easy to use since it requires no books and each lesson is only about thirty minutes long. It definitely helps to listen to each lesson at least twice a day. I suggest once in the morning and once in the evening.It is a bit slow (boring) but the constant repetition really helps you remember. You are not memorizing but actively participating in a thirty minute conversation.The course sparked enough interest for me that I then bought the full program. You can purchase the additional programs, five lessons at a time for your MP3/iPod off the companion website to Amazon.com, Audible.com.You will speak without much of an accent and sound like you are from Rio.The vocabulary is small but the structure of the language is there so you can insert new words as you learn them.The hardest part of learning a language is speaking it and this programs works well on that part.I went on to learn all of Phase 2 and I am currently working on Phase 3."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I teach Spanish and I wanted to review my Portuguese.

It may be useful even if you are planning to continue on with more advanced study. I recently was asked by a friend to recommend a phrasebook, etc. for Mexico.

The method used to teach language is very effective. Just when you're ready to throw in the towel because you feel like you'll never remember how to say, \\"I want to go to the restaurant,\\" you get to revisit the teachings in the next lesson. Before you know it, you realize you have quite the Portuguese vocabulary. You quickly learn how to pronounce words like a native, which helps immeasurably. I was complimented several times in Brazil on my speaking ability. Additionally, with a male and female speaker, you are able to hear pronunciations of words by two different people. Since, Portuguese has some language rules dependent on gender, it's important to be able to hear how different words are pronounced depending on the gender of the speaker e.g., obrigado vs. obrigada.What this system was missing were more conversations specifically related to travel in a foreign country. It's great to be able to say \\"I want to eat\\" in Portuguese, but that's not useful at a restaurant. The waiter already knows you want to eat, the question is WHAT do you want to eat and HOW do you order it? Likewise, it's great to be able to say \\"Where is hotel ___?\\" But, once you get to the hotel, how do you say, \\"I'd like to check-in?\\", or \\"I'd like to find the business center to use the internet.\\" I ran into the same problem at the train station - I had no idea how to say, \\"I'd like to buy a one-way ticket.\\" Similarly, it would have been helpful to know how to say, \\"I'd like change please,\\" or \\"Should we tip?\\" Since Portuguese is pronounced so differently from the French and Spanish I'm used to, the translation book I had with me didn't help at all. People understood me best when I spoke using words I'd learned thanks to Pimsleur. Perhaps more travel-related language is available on the larger set? But, I survived, between my Pimsleur learning and some sign language, we Americanas got along just fine.Overall, I really enjoyed the Pimsleur system and will pick it up when I need to learn a new language for my next trip."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I think this product is very useful.

They build on the words introduced in previous lessons and are a very effective introduction. The one thing I missed was a written lesson plan or list of the words used, so I could see the spelling. This was especially significant with Brazilian Portuguese, which pronounces letters very differently from English. (D is pronounced as a J, Rs sound like Ds, etc.)That said, there is quite a bit of variety in usage demonstrated (and requested,) so you do get to (just) start thinking in the language. It's an introduction, probably ok for vacation trips, etc., so plan on something deeper if you are going to stay longer (or have a deeper relationship!)"},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"I am planning a trip to Brazil next summer to see friends so I thought I would brush up on my Portuguese to surprise them. I spent some time there as a foreign exchange student in high school a million years ago and already spoke a little (very little after so many years) so this course was a bit of a review for me. I found it very helpful and easy to follow. The lessons did hold my interest and covered a good bit of ground with a lot of emphasis on proper pronunciation. I agree with other reviewers that for some just learning Portuguese it would be helpful to see the words in their written form since Portuguese doesn't always sound like it looks. A vocabulary list would be nice.

This is a must-buy for Brazilian Portuguese (but you also need more):1. You need to hear the language - I would have been hopeless without hearing the spoken words in real phrases (when you know the exact phrase that means \\"I would like to buy two beers please\\" then you're much more likely to say it correctly and clearly. Every Brazilian seemed to understand the (few) words I spoke... though understanding their reply was not always easy.)2. This course is excellent in slowly giving you many new words in context - I learned as much as I could handle (though far from fluent), but... (a) use the pause button (they give little time for response), and (b) the audio downloads are much cheaper than the expensive CDs (still not cheap, but worth it).3. Absolutely buy another 1-2 books to SEE the words and learn more words (especially nouns, verbs). I would love this with a full transcript, but the Pimsleur method is speaking/hearing only. I learn better when I \\"see\\" the word while speaking, plus the written and spoken words can be surprisingly different. I think you really need both.I am absolutely not anywhere near fluent (ask me 5 years from now), but this quickly gave me a working knowledge of basic Portuguese for travel in Brazil."},{"Title":"Portuguese (Brazilian), Conversational: Learn to Speak and Understand Brazilian Portuguese with Pimsleur Language Programs (Pimsleur Instant Conversation)","review":"More formal language than what Brazilians actually use.

I have used the first four CDs in the set (I believe there are six) and I am able to have a simple conversation with my Brazilian girlfriend. She has been very complimentary regarding my precise pronounciation, which I believe is a result of hearing the tutiledge audibly with several opportunities to hear and repeat the terms.I had no previous exposure to Portuguese, and I find the progression of the teaching is at just the right pace. There are frequent rests in the CDs for the student to practice the pronounciation and phrases. As new terms are introduced, older ones are repeatedly incorporated or resurrected to drive them into memory. For me it has been an effective approach.There is some content regarding the genderization of terms, but this set does not get into the conjugation of verbs.

One man in our group had been studying Portuguese for a year and a half using Rosetta Stone, averaging 2 hours a night...though of course he could speak better than I could, I was amazed at how close I was to him in overall comfort level. I didn't have near the extent of vocabulary yet, but I could usually pick out the words that I did know even as the Brazilians were speaking at their normal speed, and I could communicate the essentials at restaurants and in most of our typical conversations.I highly recommend this program as a starting point for learning Portuguese. As others have said, it is not a complete program at all, but it gets you started with basic conversational phrases and an intuitive understanding of Portuguese sentence structure.

Professors Hawkins and Pingree explain that &quot;the messages that lead to cultivation are aggregate patterns of action and characterization across many programs or even seasons of entertainment television.&quot;Other chapters view media influence as other factors enter the mix.

However it is of more use as a reference book than as something to read for entertainment, or to inspire one with the possibilities.

Also, many of the illustrations are very fuzzy and of poor quality, as though scanned in with a cheap scanner at the lowest resolution."},{"Title":"Government in America: People, Politics, and Policy (Brief Seventh 7th Edition)","review":"In fairness, I have not yet finished the book. Yet I am already disappointed that so little was included about the European ideological and theological heritage that went into the Articles and the Constitution. Also, very little was said about the motivations and concerns of the Anti-Federalists.The layout is attractive and easy to read. At times, the information content per paragraph is low. Some of the incidents are interesting or good cocktail party fodder, but they seem to shy away from presenting thought provoking material without accompanying commentary. In other words, I feel they don't trust the reader to think for him/herself.The authors manifest their views everywhere but do not admit that they are opinions or discuss how the presentation is crafted around those opinions. As with any book, it is important to recognize the authors' goals and rationale."},{"Title":"Male Femaling: A grounded theory approach to cross-dressing and sex-changing","review":"The term \\"male femaling\\" refers to one variant of \\"transgendering,\\" wherein people adopt aspects of roles (as in appearances, interests, dispositions, and life-styles) associated with people of another gender. Although the topic of males endeavoring to \\"be female\\" in one or other respects is one that some people are apt to find disconcerting, this is a unique and valuable study of people's experiences in \\"gendering\\" or assuming roles as males and females.Building on a set of contacts that extend over seventeen years, Richard Ekins has provided a very careful, thoughtful, and insightful account of people's involvements in cross-dressing and sex-changing activities. For people interested in the processes of socialization, identity, relationships, solitary and subcultural involvements, and the like, this is a very worthwhile study. Likewise, those interested in \\"gender theory\\" and \\"the body\\" as realms of sociological investigation could learn much from this inquiry.In contrast, too, to those who might approach this subject matter in more prurient manners or with the objective of entertaining others, Ekins approaches this subject matter in academic terms. Thus, he neither promotes nor condemns people's gendering practices, but rather attempts to indicate in direct and open terms just how people actually experience and manage their identities and activities in the process of transgendering. Likewise, while sorting through a variety of medical and psychiatric definitions of transgendering activities, Ekins explicitly adopts a symbolic interactionist (Mead, Blumer) viewpoint. Thus, the emphasis is directly on examining the ways in which people engage particular situations, from their viewpoints. While focusing on those involved in an assortment of transgendering (male femaling) practices, the objective is to learn more about the ways in which human group life is accomplished more generally.In addition to a careful accounting of people's careers of participation in male femaling activities more specifically, Ekins uses \\"grounded theory\\" wherein the emphasis is on comparative analysis (using a method of similarities and differences) to see to what extent and in what ways people's experiences in one setting compares with studies of similar processes (such as developing relationships, acquiring identity, and so forth) in other social arenas. The result is some very astute sociological analysis that addresses matters pertinent to the works of Mead, Blumer, Strauss, Goffman, Lemert, and others in the interactionist community.This is a clear, very well written book, and an important contribution to the literature. It merits considerable attention on the part of social scientists and others interested in the human condition in all of its manifestations."},{"Title":"Male Femaling: A grounded theory approach to cross-dressing and sex-changing","review":"This book is hard-core psychoanalysis stuff.

Fortunately, because the author says virtually nothing the entire book, I was able to move through it with enough speed to keep me from drifting off into the land of Nod.There is more of the Biblical texts (RSV) than there is the author's actual exegesis thereof, and his \\"exegesis\\" is little more than a bare-bones restatement of the obvious. When he does go into the rare interpretation, he tends to ignore the possibility that there might be other scholars who disagree with him: he will generally state what he believes the text means without offering either a defense or alternative views. He leans towards the \\"idealist\\" interpretive approach of the texts and includes reflective questions at the end of each section which might be useful for generating discussion in the context of a group study (e.g. \\"What kinds of situations can you think of that are in some ways comparable to the plight of the three youths depicted in this story [Dan. 3]?\\").The only thing good I can think about this approach is that it shows the reader what exactly the authors wrote and not what theologians have said about it, which is often difficult for the average reader with preconceptions from the Left Behind series or other such works to see on his own. However, the careful and perceptive reader should be able to do this on his own. Efird really offers little more than what one can find in most decent study Bibles. For Revelation I recommend instead Bruce M Metzger's Breaking the Code. I am unaware of a good recent commentary on Daniel, but one would be hard pressed to find that does not offer more."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This extraordinary work in her earlier, lighter style is more accessible than &quot;A Change of Climate.&quot; Its eponynous character is a priest -- or is he? Sent to assist a priest in a northern English parish, Fludd engages the Catholic community in unusual ways. The author's signature clarity and dark humor are consistently evident, both in the limning of parish personalities and in the ways in which Fludd brings about his transformations. There is an episode that is perhaps the closest Mantel has ever come to a sex scene, handled with utter delicacy. &quot;Fludd&quot; is a bravura performance and resoundingly satisfying, and it's a pity it has never been released on this side of the pond."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"The doleful, English, mill town of Fetherhoughton is the stage for this short, delightful novel, FLUDD, by Hilary Mantel. There are four principal players. Father Angwin, pastor of the Roman Catholic church of St. Thomas Aquinas, has lost his belief in God's existence, but determinedly continues to serve his flock while suffering the oversight of his idiot diocesan bishop. Miss Dempsey, his spinster housekeeper, lives in terror of a small wart above her upper lip, thinking it a portent of cancer. Sister Philomena, a nun teaching in the parish school, is an Irish girl forced by her family into the convent, where she endures the petty tyranny of its Mother Superior. Then there's FLUDD, a curate ostensibly sent by the obnoxious bishop to help Angwin modernize his pastoral approach. Or is he? Once Fludd is in residence, people begin to ... transform.The engaging aspect of this story is that the reader never understands the nature of the being called Fludd, a mystery also grazing Angwin's perception during his first meal with Fludd, when the former observed:\\"Whenever (he) looked up at (Fludd), it seemed that his whiskey glass was raised to his lips, but the level of what was in it did not seem to go down; and yet from time to time the young man reached out for the bottle, and topped himself up. It had been the same with their late dinner, there were three sausages on Father Fludd's plate, and he was always cutting into one or other, and spearing a bit on his fork; he was always chewing in an unobtrusive, polite way, with his mouth shut tight. And yet there were always three sausages on his plate, until at last, quite suddenly, there were none.\\"Is Fludd a man, or something ... else. He can tell fortunes by looking at the palm of one's hand. He alludes to having once been the practitioner of another profession that sounds a lot like alchemy. Odd talents for a Catholic priest. In any case, by the satisfying end of the tale, you, the reader, is left to decide for yourself - if you can."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This is a most unusual story, and I hardly know how todescribe what I've read. It reminds me of so manyBritish films that I've seen over the years where younever know exactly what's going on, but you like itanyway.In FLUDD we're presented with an obscure town in Englandcalled Fetherhoughton. This is not your lovely littleEnglish village where the characters of Rosamund Pilcherlive. No, this seems to be a dark and depressing placewhich is surrounded by moors. Within this town there isa church located next to a convent of nuns. The parishpriest, Father Angwin is a seemingly kind man who has aproblem with faith: he has lost his. His verydisagreeable Bishop is always after Father Angwin tomake changes and modernize his church. In fact,the Bishop makes some ridiculous demands which theparish fulfills and then insinuates that Father Angwinneeds assistance. Enter Father Fludd who apparently isthe new curate and has come to rescue the church andthe people of Fetherhoughton.Father Angwin, his housekeeper, Agnes Dempsey, and theyoung Irish nun, Sister Philomena all need help in one wayor other. Then, there is the very sinister Judd McEvoywho runs the town's tobacco shop. He appears to cast adark cloud over everything. Father Fludd definitelymakes a difference, but who is he and where does hecome from? None of the other characters seem ableto describe the mysterious Fludd.A story unlike any other. An excellent read!"},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"I was so impressed by Hilary Mantel's \\"Wolf Hall\\" and \\"Bring Up the Bodies\\" that I became curious about her previous career and chose this 1989 novel to sample. It is full of the author's mordant black humor, her gimlet eye for the telling phrase, her talent for sharp dialogue and beautiful descriptions, her sharp insight into her characters -- but it remains a minor work. Perhaps she was practicing for a challenge worthy of her tremendous talents and eventually found it in \\"Wolf Hall.\\" For I am convinced that Mantel is one of the major literary figures of our time -- which makes even her minor works very much worth reading.We are somewhere in northern England in the mid-1950s in Fetherhoughton, a grimy village peopled by ignorant and superstitious mill workers. Their spiritual needs are met by Father Angwin, a strictly traditional Catholic priest who long ago lost his faith in God but holds his life together through orthodox adherence to the traditional religious forms. \\"Faith is dead,\\" the father says. \\"And faith being dead, if we are not to become automatons we must hang on to our superstitions as hard as we may.\\"The villagers send their ill-shod children to be educated in a school staffed by sadistic nuns with names like Mother Perpetua and Sister Polycarp. Father Angwin says of his parishioners, \\"These people aren't Christians. These people are heathens and Catholics.\\" He himself is lost in weighty theological questions such as whether meat drippings may be used to fry fish on Fridays.One day, the local Bishop visits Father Angwin and tells him he must bring his church and his practices up to date. That means getting rid of the array of statues of minor saints all except three. To Father Angwin's horror, he even suggests saying mass in the vernacular -- and he promises to send an assistant to help the venerable Father look after his flock. Some time later, the curate Fludd arrives.From the first, there is something strange about him. Nobody can ever remember quite what he looks like. Father Anwin sits drinking whiskey with him long hours and yet the bottle is never empty. Nobody ever sees him eat; food simply disappears from his plate. Is Fludd the Devil -- or at least a devil?If he is, his intent seems benign. It is to rescue from the drudgery of the convent a young Catholic girl Sister Philomena. Mantel provides a harrowing account of convent life, from the tasteless food to the unending prayers to the clumsy garments (and she knows exactly how they must be put on and taken off.) Rescuing this sweet, young girl from such a meaningless and miserable life would be like liberating an entire people from tyranny.This book is a notable entry in the annals of black humor and deserves to be read as a kind of \\"amuse bouche\\" ahead of the author's really significant later novels."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Hilary Mantel has written a small, delightful little book in the novel, Fludd. The title character, Fludd, arrives in the village of Fetherhoughton and , both subtly and drastically, changes things at a crucial time for the local priest, Father Angwin, and the Catholic Church. This is background for a wonderfully eccentric group of characters that charm their way through the book. I initially picked up the book because of an interest in the historical Robert Fludd, the alchemist, but discovered that it was the quirky denizens of this village that captured my heart and were the driving force behind the book."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Do you ever get that feeling when reading a book that you're a part of something special and very important, but you aren't entirely sure that you can grasp the entirety of what the author is presenting to you? That is the feeling I had with Fludd. It didn't seem as though there was much plot to the book until the very end, and then all at once I was finished and was left feeling as though I had read everything closely but had somehow missed The Big Picture.The book is about religion and faith and the positive and negative effects the two can have on people. But there is so much more to it. Symbolism, I might say, up the wazoo. There are statues and nuns and obscure questions of faith (\\"If one uses dripping to cook on a Friday during Lent, is that considered eating meat?\\"). A never-ending carafe of whiskey. A priest who claims disbelief in God to Fludd, but who then says that the devil lives in Netherhoughton. (Can you believe in the devil but not in God? Is that not depressing?) And then, the biggest enigma of them all, there is Fludd.He arrives and miracles happen. No one can really describe what his face looks like. He appears to finish the food on his plate, but no one ever sees him put food in his mouth. He doesn't seem to do much of anything, but he comes and he goes and things are different. His name, at the least, suggests a great deal about him.I realize that I haven't so much reviewed this book as made oblique references to how much it has remained in my mind after I finished reading it. Isn't that a stellar review in and of itself? I should think most authors want readers to continue chewing over their stories after reading the last word. I am still chewing (much as Fludd spent much of the book chewing without seeming to eat anything). But I think I know enough about my reaction to recommend the book- it is a misleading slim volume, but it will stay with you after you're done."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Fludd was my first Hilary Mantel book, and I'm thrilled there are a half-dozen or so for me to read. I hope they're equally funny and creative. Mantel offers a vivid portrait of the dismal little town of Fetherhoughton, its spiritually troubled residents and the mysterious stranger who shakes things up for everyone. Although the scope of the story is small, I was completely caught up in the world of the atheist Father Angwin, the confused young Sister Philomena and, of course, the enigmatic Fludd. As an added bonus, the book is occasionally laugh-out-loud funny."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"I read this in paperback about 10 years ago and tho' I had forgotten details, I still remember it as one of my favorite books. I cannot find my copy for a reread and I'm glad to see it's available for Kindle. To keep it short: I can definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This brief novel is a fun way to spend a few hours. It's centered around a church in the periphery of a Catholic diocese in the 1950's and peopled by a number of odd characters with a connection to the church--a gaggle of nuns, the parish priest whose the worse for drink and faith, a nosy rectory housekeeper, a progressive bishop with a secret. And, of course, there's Fludd himself, who shows up at the rectory one night and becomes the pastor's assistant. Who (and what) Fludd really is is the core of this novel's interest.For the Catholics who read it, this book brings out a lot of things to think about but doesn't bang you over the head with them. It's always a fun novel and never a philosphical lecture. For the time it takes, it's certainly worth a read."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"There were bits and pieces in the story that I liked. I enjoyed the character of Miss Dempsey, the housekeeper. She seemed the most human to me - even with her little eccentricities. But I was very disappointed with how the story went with Sister Philomena. Everything in the village - including the convent - was purposely dark, but I was hoping for growth of some sort with at least some of the characters. But the only one who seemed to grow at all was Miss Dempsey. Other characters might have moved on, but they did not necessarily grow in the process."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Mantel's descriptions of people and events are allow the reader to fully experience situations presented. Fludd brings harmony and growth to the community."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"With Fludd, Mantel reveals a kinship with Muriel Spark - the ability to crawl under the skin of an isolated community (in this case an entwined collection of isolated communities) and investigate its innards with a sharp wit and an understanding heart. Here we have a Lancashire mill-town populated with Irish Catholic mill-workers who, according to their priest, would no more understand the Mass given in English than in Latin, locked in mutual misunderstanding and enmity with the heathens of the neighboring hamlet, a convent of miserable nuns condemned to daily sufferance of weak tea and soups made of vegetable peelings, and a rectory housing the priest, who believes the local tobacconist is the devil, and his ever helpful housekeeper. It is 1956 and in walk the change-makers: the Bishop who wants the priest to succumb to modernity and Father Fludd who brings with him a different kind of alchemy.The world and characters of Fludd are so vividly created that we cannot help but accept whatever happens here, no matter how miraculous or absurd."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"A very engaging plot. I liked all the characters and the writing was superb. I would recommend this without hesitation."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"A well written window into another time and place. Well developed characters and a plot that warms the heart of anyone who didn't always follow all the rules."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Mantel uses her sardonic wit and clever storytelling to create a parable on modern life. Set in the 1950's, the story and characters are driven by the (as yet incomplete) modernization of the Roman Catholic church. But like the author's other work (e.g. Wolf Hall), the story is only a vehicle for explorations of more universal issues: the definition of good and evil, power and subjugation, and the conflicting human desire for both stability and change."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"One of my favorite books from a favorite author. Mysterious, deep, and subtle... like a sand dune shifting beneath you until suddenly you're under."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This is one of the funniest novels I have read in a while - but with black, black humour, which does seem to dilute as the story unfolds. The first half is marvellous as Mantel cuttingly describes the primitive village. Fludd remains enigmatic but perhaps that is the point and I didn't think deeper about the alchemy implied."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"I like this book much better than the better-known &quot;The Giant, O'Brien.&quot; It's a well-written fable in the whimsical, Muriel Spark tradition. It has flashes - though only a few - of real profundity. I especially like the parts featuring the tobacconist, and I think the author does a wise thing when she makes him A Demon, instead of THE Demon. She isn't Muriel Spark (who is?), but this is a spirited effort in that direction."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"An odd little novel by the winner of this year's Booker prize. It was one of those books I'd always known about -- who knows why? -- and was determined to read one day. The story centers on a Roman Catholic parish in a provincial English town in the 1950s. Fludd is the name the young curate whose arrival upsets their little world."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fludd. It was very entertaining due to its descriptions of a small, backwater town in 1950's England, life as a nun or priest in the Catholic Church at the time, and its unexpected story line. The book was funny while retaining an element of mystery right to the end."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Did you ever look at a priest during mass and wonder if he believes it all? Here is a wonderful old priest who does not, and a story of how he handles that, a &quot;reformer&quot; bishop, a mysterious curate, a type-A housekeeper, and the usual collection of nuns. I honestly could not put the book down, and I recommend it highly to all my friends."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This book starts out like gang-busters. It's wicked, it's witty, it's nasty... but about halfway in it starts meandering and ultimately gets lost. I wish the author had kept her sharp tongue.. instead she gets fuzzy and a bit obscure. The writing starts out crisp and ends up blunted, at best. Too bad, because the early parts of the book are wonderful."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Hilary Mantel has a remarkable sense for the rhythm and shape of words. I imagine that reading anything she wrote would give the sensory pleasures of a unique and artistic voice. This little book does give that but it is not compelling. It promises to be, but then none of the characters seem to develop in a way that does much to progress the story. Later books such as A Place of Greater Safety and Wolf Hall are so stirring and satisfying that one hopes Ms. Mantel is just getting going. Generally I'd say authors create a great first or second book and then lose the touch, but in some cases (such as Philip Roth I think) they may grow even as they age. I can imagine Mantel might be one of those writers. I certainly hope so as I look forward to more from her."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"If Fludd were a movie, it would be 'Michael' (the one with John Travolta). I have not decided for myself whether Fludd is an angel - and I do not have the sense, as another reviewer has, that Fludd is somehow the real alchemist Fludd reincarnated - but there is unquestionably something supernatural about him. There is a Christ-likeness about him, turning water into whiskey, a tiny bit of food into generous portions, giving the (spiritually) dead back their lives, their hopes, their souls. Freeing them. How does the line in 'Michael' go? \\"It is a hard thing to give a man back his soul.\\" Michael wasn't there to help the old lady....he showed up 6 months in advance, to set up the situation that would bring the real target to him. And Fludd? Who is Fludd there to help? I still don't know. He certainly does seem to help people, though. I quote this paragraph that jumped out at me and made my throat constrict:\\"When people complain of their lot, their sneering enemies gloat and tell them, to make them afraid, \\"Life's not fair.\\" But then again, taking the long view, and barring flood, fire, brain damage, and usual run of bad luck, people do get what they want in life. There is a hidden principle of equity in operation. The frightening thing is that life *is* fair; but what we need, as someone has already observed, is not justice but mercy.\\"I am haunted by the images in this book. By the people given back their souls. Fludd has done something Michael himself has not: he has served out justice. And mercy."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"My wife and I read Fludd and enjoyed it thoroughly. It was very entertaining--but not quite as strong as some of her other work (e.g. Wolf Hall).The mysterious elements in the story added to the book's charm, but the characters and subplots were strong enough to carry the novel on their own."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Brilliant brilliant brilliant. I just wished it was longer. It's like Black Books crossed with Jane Eyre. Gothic and hilarious."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"This book was actually a disappointment to me, I had high hopes, but those hopes were not met, this was the first Hilary Mantel novel I had read, and I expected more &#34;supernatural&#34; than was delivered."},{"Title":"Fludd","review":"Hilary Mantel has a way of writing that catches the readers attention, and if like me.needs to be read again to fully grasp the meaning and innuendo of.what she says.She brings out her characters with tremendous realism.

Good for beginners I suppose."},{"Title":"Exploring fabulous beasts (Explorer books)","review":"The book being reviewed is a hard cover edition from Ray Rourke Publishing Company. The author is Christopher Fagg, the Illustrator Steven Weston and the book was edited by Hannah E. Glease. First published in 1980, this little 24 page book has gone through several reprinting, both in hardcover and paper back. And this is rightfully so. There are better books out there on the subject of mythological beasts but this one is a short read, does not require a long attention span, but is difficult enough to challenge the younger set while still holding their interest.This little work is packed with simply interesting information. This little book begins with Pan and discusses various Wood nymphs, Water Nymphs, Satyrs and their ilk. It explains the concept of \\"fable\\" quite nicely. From there we are taken to The Minotaur, The Centaurs, Dragons, Unicorns, the Sphinx Family which includes Typhons, Chimaeras, Cerberus and Hydras. Next come Scylla and Charybdis which is closely followed by The Sirens and we get a peek at Mermaids and Men, Fake Mermaids and the legends surrounding them. The author devotes two pages to Sea Monsters. Lake Monsters (Yes, he talks about old Nessie), and then is thoughtful enough to throw in The Abominable Snowman, Bigfoot and for good measure, gives King Kong his just due. As an added bonus we get a paragraph each on the Fenris wolf, Gorgon, Harpy, Pegasus, Phoenix, Roc and the ever popular Werewolf. Sorry young readers...no Vampires in this one!Each subject is given a brief introduction and given their place in myth, history and legend. While this is certainly not an in-depth study, it does act as an introduction for the younger reader and is surprisingly accurate.This is only half of the charm of this book though. The entire work is plentifully illustrated with very well executed color drawings and paintings of these critters and creatures. All of the illustrations are quite pleasing to the eye and go perfectly with the text.This is one that you may find tucked away in the library or in the back corner of a used books shop. It is well worth the time to dig it out and give it a read. I have noted that kids love pictures and stories of things that are different and this gives them a good helping of that along with useful and accurate information...sort of painless learning, if you will.This is a neat old book (almost thirty years old now) and is well worth preserving. This one is probably good for kids grade one though five.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"Janet Allen has shown us how to break out of our outdated teaching methods and reach at-risk students. This book provides the middle school and secondary teacher with a detailed description of how to set up and implement a reading program for aliterate youth. Her methods allow the teacher to begin working with a student at any reading level and improve. The heart of her teaching concept relates to allowing each student to read what they are interested in reading and slowly become self-motivated learners. The teacher guides the students through teacher oral reading, a large in-class library, interesting class projects and most important of all &quot;time to read&quot;. What I enjoyed most about the book were her detailed descriptions of classroom procedures and stories of student success and failure. A great book for any middle school or secondary teacher that has students that know how to read but will not."},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"I discovered Janet Allen's &quot;It's Never Too Late&quot; while studying as an undergrad at University of Maine. I used her techniques offerred in this book while student teaching and I am still using this book as an excellent literacy reference today! Absolutely wonderful resource for all reading and writing teachers who do believe in their students."},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"This captivating book gives thoughtful and creative strategies for working with struggling readers. The forward done by Tom Roman, boosts the validity of the issues presented by the author and justifies the title, It's Never too Late (to mend?). Romano, who was a teacher, left teaching for a graduate program, quits and went back to teaching, and later on quits teaching again to resume his graduate program thereby graduating at 42 year old. The author is also seen to have failed initially as a teacher and researcher, but later on entered into a more methodological and ambitious qualitative research plan which led her to success and thus this book.The book offers inspiration on how growth can occur over a long period of time so long one is willing to invest intellect and spirit. The author uses an analogy of a fertile garden with occasional weeds. Fertile garden here means the potentiality of all students especially those categorized as at-risk students. The weeds are the struggles, regrets, finding resources with limited means, dealing with reluctant and rebellious students and most of all rekindling the teacher's own interest for teaching. I do agree that these are the challenges a teacher faces everyday and such encouragement is very important to keep the spirit burning otherwise it very easy to despair.In her book, she argues that the teacher's role is to create a literate environment for all students to learn. She offers her own personal experiences in teaching to help practicing and future teachers. She advises separation of oneself and personal teaching from the trappings of curriculum guides, the canon of literature, the anthologies and the tradition. I guess what she wants the teachers to identify is the foundation of their personal teaching beliefs and philosophies without following the tradition blindly. I agree with her because one is able to figure out the world of perfectionism from an individual perception. She argues that in her days, the norm was to keep the students in classrooms for survival purposes. Her main strategy is to wait, listen and be patient. How many teachers are willing to be patience that long? I remember rushing ahead to judge the student and labeling before trying all the available options, or just waiting for the results. She also says that consulting widely through reading, talking to experts and attending conferences is rewarding. She found out that persuasion, compassion and attraction could win young learners heart but I do think only when used with a lot of care. The author encourages her students to collaborate with her in creating the curriculum. Most of her students had problems in reading and writing and she found that reading aloud and taping texts played major roles towards their success. The other contributing factor was careful choice of texts which are relevant to student's lives (horror and suspense stories) and creating interesting activities around them. The author learnt that literacy can not be taught in isolation from life. She also found out that involving students in classroom activities made them feel part of the class which helped them to work together in harmony and meeting their needs where they were, employing relevant tools like intellectual software programs, games etc. She made her students write responses to texts, field trips and their personal lives which greatly enhanced her knowledge of her learners. The book proposes keeping of reading materials in every public place.She acknowledges that these strategies do not work overnight on students, but through sacrifice, determination and consistency, there is a possibility of succeeding. For example, Rachel who initially looked at books as evils, through constructive support, makes steady, exciting progress in reading and writing. Candy, an overweight, tough student with her swearing, fights, explosions, suicide attempts, pregnancies, her broken glass held together with tape, always wore jeans and anger written on her face and was ignored by other students, changed slowly but steadily towards the better. No words, no instructions and no pressure. Carla was at first swearing, fighting, scowling, undermining the author's class structure until she discovers the power of language, her own and others'. The above students made slow but steady improvements in reading young adult texts, writing personal stories, publishing anthologies and eventually graduating. Tony however landed in jail but appreciated good reading even prison.I wish the author would have indicated how she differentiated instructions to her students and how collaboration with other teachers and parents' involvement played apart in student's success. Otherwise her book is an easy read, common sense and very interesting. So please never give-up on them before trying the available options!"},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"Janet Allen wrote this story as a researcher, teacher, learner, friend...the list could go on and on. It chronicles a year in her life as a teacher/researcher as a secondary teacher in a rural Maine high school. Through her experiences, she hopes that other teachers can gleam some insight from her trials, struggles, and successes in the classroom. She has the ability to make her classroom a reality in the mind of the reader and to truly pass along all of the abilities that lifelong learners and readers need to possess. In teaching her remedial Reading and Writing Workshop classes, she emphasizes the importance of believing that all students have the ability to learn, read, and write successfully if they are given the right tools and modeling from a teacher who believes in them. Through her research she found that many of her struggling students had not been given the ability to select reading material that they could relate to, really interested them, or allowed them the time to simply read. The underlying message evident throughout this book is that if we want children to become successful readers and writers, then we need to give them multiple opportunities to read and write in our classrooms. This is a must read for any teacher, as the message it resonates can be applied to any grade level, and that is the importance of creating a literacy rich environment to promote a lifelong love of reading."},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"Although this was a school textbook for a Masters class in literacy, it read like a narrative text. I finished the entire book in 3 hours. That said, it was a bit unrealistic sometimes because current administration would never allow a teacher to run her classroom the way Allen describes. A good theory, but not easily applied."},{"Title":"It's Never Too Late: Leading Adolescents to Lifelong Literacy","review":"Janet Allen is fast becoming one of our best researchers/practioners in the area of language arts for at-risk students.

It is astonishing that Moritz has devised a style which melds theword-spewing proclivities of the Elizabethans with the paradoxical subtleties of a Kafka. The poems love theirlanguage; they sound, when read aloud, like disquieting rhapsodies. Memorable lines are everywhere. At times the poems seem like incantations where comprehension is not the immediate first object:\\"You that I loved all my life long,you are not the one.You that I followed, my line or path or way,that I followed singing, and youearth and air of the world the way went through,and you who stood around it so it could bethe way, you forests and cities,you deer and opposums struck by the lonely hunterand left decaying; you paralyzed obese oneswho sat on a falling porch in a deep green hollerand observed me, your bald dog barkingas I stumbled past in a hurry along my line,you are not the one. But you arethe one....\\"This is aria-like in its control of breath and incantory with its repetition of the line \\" You are not the one \\"which finds its resolution when the poet transitions to its responsorial: \\" You are the one.\\"Poem after poem has opening lines which issue dangerous invitations to Moritz's world:\\"Through the infinite limits of the night in ruinsthe mumbler goes with his sounds but they're all one.\\" ( Dandelion )\\"You'll lose the power to believe your dreamsyou said when you were leaving, and they'll decayfrom heart-made worlds to fear of this one.\\" ( Cassandra )\\"It is the moment when something must be doneand in this it is like every other momentand one is ignoring itand in this it is like any other moment....\\" ( The Moment )\\"I woke up in a place familiar and alien,like someone forgotten, someone that I loved,even coupled with years ago, or last nightin a dream that won't come back.\\" ( Place )Moritz constructs parables which disturb an easy tolerance of our daily condition. Poems such as\\" The Sentinel \\", \\" Arrogance \\" and \\" The Tidal Wave \\" are disturbing ruminations on poetry, aging andannihilation. \\" The Titanic \\" brings us on board a unique ghost ship: we only think the ship sunk due to asuccessful ruse but it is still circling the seas with its passengers and crew augmented by those from the MarieCeleste, tha abandoned cities of the Maya, Amelia Earhart, Ambrose Bierce, and B.Traven-- among others. This wrythought experiment concludes with the statement that \\" fate and death are unreal. \\"Moritz has a lyric gift too. \\" The Source \\" a four sentence, four question poem asks \\" What would silence be? \\" andlinks the sun to the poet's central power to become \\" a song as soft as nothingness \\". \\" Better Days \\" opens withthe following breath-taking sentence:\\" Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awedoes the summer I was seventeen come backto my mind against my will, like a bird crossingmy vision.\\"While the poem provides the details of the summoned memories of the poet when he was seventeen, the poetdistinguishes between those and the unsummoned memories of his later self. We can control our rummaging inthe past but the issue here is what the mind returns to us unbidden, unsearched for-- its spontaneousprovisions.We can suppose that the carefully retrieved memory of his being seventeen was once a memory of spontaneousapparition to the poet's mind. We are provided enough detail to understand its intrinsic force. But thisforce has waned, it no longer possesses a mysterious urgency. Its position as an overwhelming emanationhas been supplanted by another memory which had its origins in the poet's early manhood when he sat in a dinernight after night watching the same old man ordering his tea and opening his drawing pad. Not \\" holy drunkennessand violation \\" but the \\" artist always in the same worn-out suit \\" are his nostalgia now.\\" Though he calls the old man friend, he tells us he \\" never spoke with him \\" nor looked at his drawing pad. His reason for not speaking with him is that the poet wanted to disappear from there.\\" Presumably, speaking with the old man would have committedthe poet to being more than a passing figure in that diner-world. That the poet did escape that world has its retribution: that world has not left him. It is the director of his unbidden memory. Though he now resides in\\" the heaven of better days \\", that heaven is perpetually subject to the unsummoned intrusion of a memorywhich blots \\" out any other thought and image.\\"This collection has many instances of illumination.

I bought this book three years ago, and the best thing I've learned from it is the Rule of 72. (What is that? Read the book.)I've since learned that there's more to picking investment vehicles than finding one you like and feeding it. If a person already has their &quot;dignity money&quot; built up and want to maintain it, that's the only time bonds and bond funds should be considered. If a person is still in the process of building assets, then use safe savings vehicles like money markets until enough is attained to start investing, after that only consider stocks and stock funds to invest in for growth. And watch out picking mutual funds! It involves more than choosing no-loads over loaded funds. For more information on this, I highly recommend another book, Eight Steps to Seven Figures by Charles B. Carlson.I disagree with not waiting until credit debts are paid off before investing. A person must have something to invest WITH, after all! If a person has such serious cash flow problems that any cash they have must go to pay off these bills, it would to me be fooling to be sending off that money to an investment firm at the risk of losing a house or a vehicle. That person needs help, most of all they need discipline and less dependence on material things. I say clear the debt or at least bring it way down; then work on a savings plan, then work on an investment plan, in that order.A girl does need cash, but in order to have that cash she's simply got to quit spending it. She needs discipline and faith in herself to meet her financial goals. Part of that discipline is not relying on others to take care of her financially, whether it's a man or other lover or the Federal Government or even the stock market. This book doesn't really tell the whole story in that regard, but I think it's a good start toward self-education."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"I live in the same town as Joan Perry and know her personally and was (past tense) a client. The advice she gives in this book is taken from seminars put on by Tony Robbins and his like. There is not an original idea in this other than the literary device of telling it like a series of stories about individual women. Worse yet Ms. Perry does not follow her own counsel. She overspends, depends on men for investment decisions, and still believes in the \\"white knight\\" herself. In fact she does not really play a significant role in managing money at Take Charge Financial at all, she hires that function out to a professional money manager, a man! Nothing inherently wrong with that except her premise is that women should learn to make their own decisions. In short this whole book is a fraud! Reads nice but if you think about it she is talking down to us women who really put our money where our mouth is."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"&quot;A Girl Needs Cash&quot; is an interesting story aimed directly at changing the female mindset towards money and investing. The author, Joan Perry, lends her financial expertise to the reader through the lives of six very different women. Perry makes it easy for women of all ages to relate to atleast one of her characters. She explains the myths that keep women from reaching their financial potential and poses easy to understand solutions to go about breaking them. I recommended this book to my mom, and do so for all &quot;girls&quot; looking to take charge of their purses!"},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"Perry's &quot;A Girl Needs Cash&quot; is a great motivator. I was especially happy to hear here opinion that an investor shouldn't wait before credit card balances are zero before saving/investing. The book also encourages self-reliance when it comes to money matters, which is a terrific goal for any financial planner trying to help a client.I was dissapointed that Perry several times in her book referred to home ownership as having no ability to provide future income. A reverse annuity mortgage may provide needed income to a retiree. She also refers to variable life insurance products as &quot;private pension plans&quot;. Despite being marketed as such, referring to insurance as a pension plan borders on the unethical.Despite these minor problems, I certainly recommend this book as one of the several men and women should read while trying to organize there personal finances."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"Finally, women, not girls.. gather up your scraps of paper and receipts and straighten out your financial matters, yourself! You likely will not find a better way to begin then Joan Perry's &quot; A girl needs Cash&quot;. You may, Like I, find yourself quoting passages to your female friends, sometimes in anger, often in great frustration, as the book deals with the many social and economic reasons women of ALL ages have not dealt with their money. the fac tthat it deals with women of all backgrounds and ages is part of its great appeal and accesibility. It is truly a bare bones, no holds barred approach to finance that will take you thru sunshine savings accounts to muny bonds, increasing your savvy and, therefore, your confidence in revamping your own financial future without the age-old dependence on the male figures in your life. This includes fathers, brothers, by the way). Simultaneously dispelling the white knight myth while providing much-appreciated advice for women battling the social challenges they face in the workplace AND outside, it neither paints women in the 'victim' role, nor tells them to jump on a feminist bandwagon. Joan Perry, like I, was raised with good financial advice and lived feminism before the word was created. Whatever your age or current status, this delightful gem will provide you with a simplified and very TARGETED approach to improving your lifestyle while regaining great discipline. We roar and applaud this book for all ages."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"I was pleasantly surprised to read this book as if it were a mystery novel. I loved following the financial lives of the working and non working women she presents in her book so brilliantly. I actually read over 100 pages at my daughters volleyball practice and was able to enjoy it despite the noise surrounding me. I had and have many ongoing questions of our families finances and our future. I wish I had read this book when I was working in a higher paying job and jet setting around for a company with an apartment on the Marina Green in San Francisco! Joan thank you for this great book and I highly recommend it to any girl that needs cash! And let's face we all do."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"This book should be read by every women, young and old.

The cases presented should teach young women to be responsible for their own financial destiny. This is a great gift book or a book that a mother or father should read and share with a daughter. The lessons learned will last a young woman a lifetime."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"For the first time in my life, I feel in control of my finances -- and what a great feeling it is! As a professional woman with feminist leanings, I've long perceived myself as being in charge of my career and my love life. But economically speaking, I've always been more or less out to lunch. For some reason, I zoned out when the topic turned to finances...I let my father -- and then my husband -- handle my money. Well, no more. After reading this book, I feel more than capable of managing my money myself. I dare say I now know more than either my husband or dad, both of whom now defer to my judgment. I've bought copies of this wonderful book for my sister, my best friend, and my niece. And I'll continue to give copies of &quot;A Girl Needs Cash&quot; to my nearest and dearest female friends -- anyone who would benefit from this one-of-a-kind gift of financial independence."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"I just wish it had been a little more &quot;condensed&quot;, if you will. I'm extremely busy with not a lot of time to just sit around reading a book, and this book in particular could have been a bit quicker to read without all the personal anecdotes and individual examples. BUT...this is a good book if you want to learn about taking charge of your financial future. For the most part, her strategies sound very accessible. For example, she recommends paying your mortgage plus the next month's principle, which is highly do-able. Most financial gurus admonish us to pay no less than double our mortage payment (yeah, right). And, I love the fact that the author advises readers to NOT wait until credit cards are paid off to begin saving. Another refrain of financial gurus: &quot;it's absolutely ridiculous to put money in a 3% savings account when you could be paying it on your 20% interest credit cards.&quot; Granted, theoretically that is sound advice, but it's just not logical for most of us, including me. I for one do not want to wait until my credit card is paid off before I start building a savings account. After all, the only way to prevent more debt is by having cash available, and how will you have any if you're paying every nickel and dime on your card? I also love how the author describes credit cards as &quot;the Draculas of the financial world, draining assets out of our lives&quot;, how true! A great and very insightful book. It wasn't entirely easy to understand (unless you're already a financially-minded person) but the more I read it, the more I get out of it. The author also encourages readers to sit down and map out their financial future, for instance, if they want to have $1,000,000 to retire on, they need to actually write out how much that will require per month and how they will get it. I did that for the first time after reading this book, it's something I've never done before, and it has given me a more tangible goal to shoot for. I love this book and others like it for encouraging women to take active control in their financial future, not just mindlessly float around expecting someone else to take care of them."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"This book belongs in every woman's library. It is entertaining and easy to read, but makes finances and saving for retirement easy. Honest, even if you &quot;aren't good at math.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"The way in which Joan used real life characters to describe the book was very helpful. There were so many characters to relate to that anyone who reads this book is given the opportunity to see themself through the thoughts of the characters in the book.Joan made the book very personable. She told many stories about her life and made the reader feel important enough to learn more about her. Throughout the book you get the feeling that she is truly writing to make you more educated about money.The book has a totally &quot;girl power&quot; attitude. She talks about how we as women should take more control of our financial life. Joan's goal is to prove to women that we really are capable of feeling better about our financial life if we partake in it. If we stand back and let someone else take care of it for us then we are afraid of it and feel that it is out of our power. Our financial life should be just as important to us as our career life, family life, social life, etc.This book can easily be understood and makes women of today's world more motivated to take part in their financial life."},{"Title":"A Girl Needs Cash: How to Take Charge of Your Financial Life","review":"For my economics class, I had to chose and read a book involving some form of economics. I read &quot;A Girl Needs Cash&quot; and was pleasantly surprised because I found the book to be very interesting. I enjoyed how the author was able to turn the book into an acutal story instead of just writng facts about enconomics like an encyclopedia would. Not only did the author show us the lives of other people and how their financial lives were going, but she also put herself and her experiences in the book which made it much more interesting to know that even people like her at one point stuggled with money. My favorite part of the book was the section on &quot;The White Knight Myth&quot;. The &quot;Money Machine&quot; was also a very helpful tip. This book contained some very good advice and was motivating. I do belive that this book will help me with my own financial life."},{"Title":"The Light the Dead See: The Selected Poems of Frank Standford","review":"Unique in form and subject matter, Frank Stanford was a poet of great vision and power. While his verse may seem random and vulgar at first glance, The Light the Dead See stunned me with its familiarity with Death as a companion and friend. With this in mind, it seems no wonder that Stanford eventually felt compelled to take his own life.Stanford's poetry is without bounds. The imagery he puts forth concerning the backwaters of rural America gave me chills, not because it was frightening, but because it illustrated the truth about the often violent and arbitrary turns of chance rule the lives of many of us.This book is not to be missed. It could very well change the way you look at poetry."},{"Title":"The Light the Dead See: The Selected Poems of Frank Standford","review":"Frank Stanford died a suicide at a young age, yet managed to create a body of work that deserves to be read despite his youth and nearly 20 years of obscurity. His poems, both subject and meter, are of great beauty. It's too bad that most of his work is out of print but, despite this, the University of Arkansas Press manages to keep the best of his poems alive. They do deserve to be read, and a good part of Stanford's work merits a wider audience. Check out The Light the Dead See for a great example of what this guy managed to create in his short life."},{"Title":"The Light the Dead See: The Selected Poems of Frank Standford","review":"Frank Stanford's \\"The Light The Dead See\\" is a compilation from 5 of his other collections: \\"The Singing Knives\\", \\"Crib Death\\", \\"You\\", \\"Arkansas Bench Stone\\", \\"Field Talk\\" and a brief excerpt from his epic \\"The Battlefield Where The Moon Says I Love You\\". There are also some previously unpublished poems.Stanford's poetry is really like nothing I've ever read, death obsessed or not. His condensed surrealistic imagery which brings one face to face with a kind of Lovecraftian secret of human behavior is Stanfordesque: there's no other way to process it. He owns every line.This is the kind of verse that as Archibald MacLeish put so beautifully, \\"does not mean but BE\\". \\"The Snake Doctors\\" makes it clear through the use of quietly violent imagery and the appearance and reappearance of carnival freaks that a monstrous apocalypse is on the horizon. A magical doom encircles the varied masks Stanford wears.At times he reminds one of Bacovia.\\"I woke up in a boat/It was full of blood/My feet were dragging through the water/A knife was sticking in the prow/And the sun was black/It was dark/But I saw the snake doctors riding each other..\\"Irresistible. This is the real thing, and it's a shame Stanford is known not primarily for his work as the horrible way he died. A must read for those who adore poetry in the ether."},{"Title":"The Light the Dead See: The Selected Poems of Frank Standford","review":"I had not heard of Frank Stanford until my dear friend Bill gave me this little book. He explained that he was on a mission to introduce people he cared about to Stanford's poems. I can see why I missed it, since his work does not fit into any of the clean boxes that some of my early poetry influences favored. All the same, I am sorry that I missed it for so long. The jumpy dream-like quality was a lot of what I was trying to work for, back when I was writing poetry.Oddly enough, once I started reading this, all kinds of other connections appeared. For instance, my favorite Lucinda Williams song, Pineola, was written for Stanford.I like the rural focus that the poems have, and the way that the diction feels familiar even when I do not know exactly what Stanford is saying. He clearly has a taste for tall tales and dreams, and tells the truth of his world through these beautiful fantasies. It is a sad truth, and often a broken truth. Even if the introduction had not told me that Stanford killed himself, I might have guessed it after reading his work.Stokesbury wrote a good introduction, by the way. It is informative, short and not irritating. A mark that many other poetry collections miss.Anyhow, there are times when I feel as though I can review poetry, and other times that I am left at a loss for words. All I can say about this book is that I think it is a good thing that Bill is on his mission-- more people should read this work. I may just join him in it this Christmas."},{"Title":"The Light the Dead See: The Selected Poems of Frank Standford","review":"If you're thinking about buying this book go for it. It is worth it.

Just make sure the movie comes along quickly, right? Poetry? Well, that's just sophomoric. No.But Frank Stanford, damn it all, given the slightest introduction to your world might change your worldview. Sensuality- he brings it. A genuine setting and a vibrant milieu? Check. Robust emotion? It's there, in droves. After all, the man killed himself with three (3!) pistol shots to the heart. Poetry, by all rights may well be dead in 21st century America, and that's as despicable as your Dan Brown reading habits, but Frank made the words righteous. Try it. You'll not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Polyrhythms: The Musician's Guide","review":"The author has the idea of polyrhythms right, and he explains it very well, and gives great audio examples. He also has right the idea of how to thoroughly teach polyrhythmic abilities, and enhance rhythmic dexterity. The book is lacking, however, when it comes to practice exercises. While the instructions say practice these exercises at all tempos, the accompanying CD has them only at one tempo per exercise (which is, surprise, close to the easiest tempo for that particular exercise)... of course, you're expected to do different tempos on your own, but since you're counting two rhythms at once, it is very difficult to objectively hear each of them, to know if you're not \\"cheating\\" one to make it fit into the correct rhythmic space provided by the other.The book provides the musician with some great new ways to think about rhythm. The problem is that the book advances too quickly to some really difficult stuff. If you sit with it for hours, and practice on your own (drumming on a desk, as I have done), you can ascend its steep slope and help your rhythmic abilities. (In the end, I didn't get very far along in the book). This takes a hell of a lot of patience, discipline, and work, and It would've been much easier if there were more exercises, which slowly increased in difficulty, rather than the few exercises which demand a leap in difficulty from one to the next."},{"Title":"Polyrhythms: The Musician's Guide","review":"This book is a wonderful tool for those who are serious about musicianship. However, unlike most books which spend their lengthy breadth trying to lead you along \\"12 stupid-simple steps,\\" this book spends its pages with application. You will not get anything from this book if you just want to read about polyrhythms. This book is for those who want specific practice on the subject, and \\"Polyrhythms: A Musician's Guide\\" does that very well."},{"Title":"Polyrhythms: The Musician's Guide","review":"Voted #6 in Modern Drummer Magazine survey &quot;The 25 Greatest Drumbooks&quot; The original books were in two volumes.

I give it three stars, but for the opposite reasons Mr. Gindi gave. I found extremely LITTLE explanations in the book. Actually there are minimal written words. Personally, I would like more of a written explanation to better understand what the author is thinking. Instead, the author keeps adding on without explanation, leaving it up to the reader and the CD. If this book didn't come with a CD to hear the examples, it would be a complete waste of money. For me, there are plenty of playing examples in the book. Working with a metronome at different tempos is all I needed. Additionally, the author recommends using scales once the rhythms are better understood. I would recommend this book to anyone who has already mastered basic rhythms meaning everything up to triplets and 16th notes of all sorts, especially since these are the rhythms the book starts off with."},{"Title":"Polyrhythms: The Musician's Guide","review":"I am an amateur with 40 plus years on the drums and this guide is easy to understand even though I do not play professionally.

It is challenging but that is something I look for when purchasing a book.I think I have an issue with the \\"best book\\" annotation on the back cover.So here is my advice: Find a copy of this book before you buy it and look through it. If you can't find it at least click on the review and look at some of the pages. This book is defiantly not for all drummers but I can't say who would benefit and who would not. Normally, I could do that with other books that I have reviewed, but not this one.The only way to know If this book is right for you is to do some research on the topic of Polyrhythms and click on the book review and look at a few of the pages.

Nasar brings a rich store of empirical research from the visual assessment field to this work, particularly as it tests the relationship between environmental processes and human spatial behavior . . . Overall, the book is extremely helpful, not only in providing thoughtful interpretaitons of prevailing tastes and brends, but in its wealth of suggestions for new research techniques and new methods of visual presentiation, both derived from his own work and the work of associates. I was informed by Nasar's suggestions for ways to refine and diversify evaluation methods, to make fruitful comparisons between cities, to identify successful city traits for emulation elsewhere, to predicte neighborhood needs from census data, and to research wihtin a low budget.

Thus, the book gives us all clues to what is important to the user helping us to make design decisions that are meaningful.Nasar also makes a case for effective empirical research in urban design, a subject that is often ignored by urban designers. He provides designers with a useful set of tools to evaluate perceptions of specific environments and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each giving hints to developing appropriate design research strategies.The book blends theory, empirical methods with practical advice.

This is a very informative and useful book and I would encourage anyone interested in the visual quality of our cities to read it. I haven't seen any other book that so clearly answers the questions posed by Kevin Lynch in The Image of the City - What does the city's form actually mean to the people living there? What can the city planners do to make the city's image more vivid and memorable to the city dwellers?This book is one that will appeal to a broad spectrum of people - e.g., informed citizenry, city councils, city planners, urban designers, urban geographers, landscape architects, architects, as well as other academics/researchers. In fact, anyone interested in the visual form of our cities should read this book. It will give you a new perspective on how the visual form of the city impacts our enjoyment of cities. It also provides some clearly delineated methods for both assessing the image and modifying it. These techniques can be easily utilized by governmental or non-governmental agencies as well as interested citizens groups to better understand the evaluative image of their city, town, village or neighborhood and do something about it.The author - Jack Nasar - has built upon the seminal work by Kevin Lynch in The Image of the City. However, whereas Lynch placed the emphasis of his study on two key aspects of the image - identity and structure - Nasar has taken on the more difficult task of assessing the meaning (or evaluative aspect) of the image. Nasar has been able to go beyond identity and structure to present a very convincing argument that people have a shared evaluative image (which is equated with the likability of the city's visual form) and has made clear the importance of that image for city design.Through the analysis of the shared evaluative images of two cities - Knoxville and Chattanooga - the author has been able to identify many of the key elements of urban likability - i.e., naturalness, upkeep/civilities, openness, historical significance, and order. But he doesn't merely leave this an academic exercise, he attempts to show how we can shape the evaluative image. He presents possible guidelines for desired outcomes, such as creating a(n) pleasant appearance, exciting appearance, relaxing appearance, or high-status appearance. Furthermore, he suggests how the methods and guidelines can be easily linked into local planning processes and policy.What a contribution this readable and well-researched book is to the field of urban studies. Nasar has not only answered the questions posed by Lynch, but has also shown us how important our shared evaluative image is to the quality of our everyday life and how we can, not only, take responsibility for the visual quality of our cities, but, more importantly, take action."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"I loved this book!

Yesterday's Child stayed interesting and kept me interested the whole time. Every time I\`d pick this book up I hated putting it back down. The way that Sonia Levitin wrote this book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. A great thing about this book is that it did not drag on. Levitin left you confused and interested all the time, therefore causing you to keep reading as the suspense continued. I enjoyed it so much because of the way the story was told with a mystery plot but also how it added the other details of a teenage girl's life. By doing that, it gave me something to relate to in this book. A young teenage girl as the main character showed the determination and bravery of a young woman's journey through life's sticky situations.

While her class goes to attractions Laura secretly travels to her mother's hometown just a couple of hours away. Soon more and more questions start to unfold. Why is her mother in the yearbook under a different name and how come Jasmine's class reunion claims they've never heard of her before? Stricken on figuring out the puzzle Laura travels to Canada to meet Megan where she hears the whole story. On a last time trip back to the small town Laura finds out that Megan was lying. Now, the terrible truth is unwrapped and someone is going to make sure that Laura can never tell anyone about it...There were two main settings in this book. The first one was in her mother's old hometown. Laura came here numerous times throughout the story and each visit brought up new questions and then the once buried truth. The second setting was in Washington D.C because here she stayed there with her classmates on the trip.This book was excellent! I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone. Yesterday's Child is full of so many twists and turns that just keep coming again and again. The story though is somewhat sad in some parts and the truth about her mother will shock you. If you like mysteries this is a must read.I would rate this book a 10 because it was so good and captivating. I absolutely loved the story line and plot. The end just left me speechless and I couldn't believe what had happened. Once you get into this book you won't was to put it and it is an easy read. The author is very good at just making it all flow together and blowing your mind away."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"Yesterday's Child is my favorite book. I never really enjoyed reading that much, but after reading this book I've been enjoying reading much more. Sonia Levitin is a great writer. She kept my interests during the whole book. She also ended the story nicely. I didn't have any unanswered questions at the end. Holes used to be my favorite book, but not anymore. I would definitely recommend Yesterday's Child."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"I read this book for a 9th grade english report. I loved this book it kept me on edge and guessing what happened next. I don't really get into books much but this one was great i couldn't put it down.Yesterday's Child is about a girl searching for her dead mothers old best friend from school. But the thing is she has trouble finding her and when she does there is trouble when she meets her. The ending is great. You should check it out."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"The book had a pretty good story to it. I loved the part where she was looking at the newspapers and discovering her mothers past. At one point I was thinking, 'wow, this book is really, really good'. Right after that, though, it wasn't. The whole chapter was her thinking about how awful her mother was. Very annoying! The ending was okay, but not the best. And it was obvious an older person wrote this book. A pretty okay book overall."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"This was a very good book. I enjoied reading it because it was something that I can relate to. At the end of each chapter, you always want to keep reading so you can never put it down. Books try to trigger at that but they never really achieve it. I suggest you to read it."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"This book captivated me from beginning to end! It was written in a way that let me into the minds of the characters. It is full of suspense, and unlike several books, the ending is satisfactory, seeming like it belongs. I'd definately recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"Laura has always been in the dark about her mother's past for all of her life, now she has to face the reality of the gaps her mother and she were not able to fill before her sudden death. When a class trip to Washington D.C. brings her near her mother's hometown, she can't resist the chance of being at peace with her mother's past, so she visits the town her mother hated so much, finding the hard truth about her mother and herself. But, will she keep the secrets of her findings away from those who don't want it in the open?? Sonia Levintin tells a thrilling story and I hope many will find that too when they read her books."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"Please don't read the Horn Books review of this book which gives away half the mystery! Even if you have, though, this is a great book that shouldn't be missed. The characters are utterly believable, which makes their struggles intense, and every surprising twist is both unpredictable and logical. Don't start this book unless you have time to finish it -- I started it late at night and ended up going to sleep early in the morning."},{"Title":"Yesterday's Child","review":"How far shoulr one gilr go to reveal the truth of her mother's unknown and horrific past?

The suspense is heightened when Laura, the daughter, finds and mails a letter addressed to her mother's childhood friend, and it is returned, &quot;address unknown.&quot; However, early on in the novel, the plot unravels as coincidences abound to help Laura in her quest. She is conveniently about to embark on a trip to Washington, D. C., which is only an hour's bus ride away from her mother's hometown of Birch Bend. She arrives to find her mother's peers in the town park, conveniently attending a class reunion. Her trip to Canada to find Megan is conveniently helped along by a beleagured young mother who inadvertently gives her a way to cross the border without benefit of a passport, birth certificate, or other identifying papers. She then conveniently meets (and falls in love with) Megan's teenage son who conveniently gives her a clue to solve the mystery. Nancy Drew should have been so lucky! While the main character has surprising depth, it is rather implausible that Laura would experience the &quot;inner memories&quot; of her mother and Megan and &quot;see&quot; events as they happened so long ago. Laura also slips dangerously into her mother's strange world throughout the book. Though understandably Laura is having psychological issues to deal with upon discovering that her mother was a murderer, Levitin tries too hard to draw parallels between mother and daughter. The love story subplot between Laura and Thomas is too hurried and too ridiculous to lend credence to the story. In fact, it neither adds nor detracts from the main plot, except to serve as a setup for the rather unbelievable ending. I felt a bit cheated by the easy answers and lack of subtlety of the novel, and wouldn't recommend it to my students."},{"Title":"Rashi,","review":"Ok I have published Rashi andMerely Mary Annat the same time, because I'll be publishing Michael Boatman's horror anthology and The Big Bow Mystery later this year and I want to devote as much time as possible to promotion of those books.In writing a review, I know that I have essentially two audience members - those who know Rashi quite well and those that have never heard of Rashi before.For those of you unfamiliar with Rashi, he was an 11th century rabbi who wrote responsa, Torah commentary, Talmud commentary and died in 1205. Maurice Liber has many chapters devoted to his Torah commentary and discussion thereof. If you are Jewish, this can give you a taste of Rashi before studying further. If you are not Jewish, this makes for a fascinating study in medieval philosophy as well as the tensions between Christian and Jewish communities. Maurice Liber notes many instances where Rashi purposefully comments on a psalm or a passage in a way that illegitimizes the Xian viewpoint. In other places, he's merely commenting as a commentator without the tensions.If you are familiar with Rashi, this is still a fascinating book. Written in 1905 with a completely different set of biases (Liber praises Rashi for inspiring Mendelssohn for example), this book at times feels like the antithesis of those Artscroll biographies that make you suspect that the great sages never went to the bathroom much less read the secular newspapers of their days. Liber places Rashi in a particular time and place before Christian Jewish relations went to hell (the Crusades and the Black Death were either not happening or much less vicious in Rashi's time) and he also discusses the ways that later commentators would disagree with Rashi. Ibn Ezra was particularly vicious towards the Rashi commentaries. Rather than lower Rashi in one's estimation, Liber manages to make Rashi into a more respectable figure as he's human and some of his commentaries are not without problems for the modern reader. Liber also publishes some of Rashi's selichot which are fascinating in their own right.So if you are at all interested in medeival history or Rashi as a person in a particular time, please buy this book."},{"Title":"Rashi,","review":"I am sorry to say that this book on Rashi, by the eminent Maurice Liber is simply to dated, both in its written style, and with a lack of information on Rashi's Milieu."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"Full score is clear and reasonably accurate and easy to read. Words for vocal parts don't always line up clearly, and the choice to place German on top, with Italian below and italicized was a poor one. Reading the original language musically is thus a challenge, and non-German or Italian speakers won't have a meaningful translation close at hand either as there is no english through the score."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"This complete musical score to one of the greatest works of art by mankind comes in quality paper and print that I find quite satisfying. The lack of an English translation is no problem for me personally, because I have separate libretti with translations I can refer to when needed, and I use this book when I want to follow the musical score and sing along with the original Italian verses. One disappointment is that the German verses are in normal print, directly underneath the musical score, while the original Italian is in italics and under the German (therefore harder to read and follow), almost as if the book is intended more for people who want to follow the German, not the Italian. Since the opera is originally in Italian, it makes more sense to me that the German text and Italian text should be switched in terms of location and font. Nevertheless, I'm highly satisfied with the overall quality of this book, and it is definitely one of my favorite books within my music-related library."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's comic masterpiece &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; has always been one of the best loved and studied operas today. With a bubbling plot and beautiful music, this opera is sure to delight classical and opera music lovers whether you are just a beginner or a die hard classical fan. However, full orchestral scores, particularly opera scores, have always hard to come by and when they do, the price is often too steep. Now Dover publications makes available the COMPLETE orchestral score of this fabulous opera with an affordable price. As with other Dover scores, this one is a reprint of an older publishing house, Carl Frederich Peters of Leipzig, which means that other than the contents, which Dover translated into English, everything in this score is German and /or Italian ( libretto and stage directions ). However, the beautiful, neat and clear engraving of the score more than makes up for this. The full score would probably be too bulky for opera singers, but it is an indispensable tool for classical music enthusiasts to study and appreciate all the aspects that make up this wonderful comic opera. Buy it! It will make your listening experience all the more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"I suggest this highly for singers who plan on making a career on a \\"festvertrag\\" house singers' contract in Germany, Austria or Switzerland. In these countries, popular operas are sung in either German or the original language, in this case; Italian! To have both will save you time and money!"},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"Far to many \\"Full Scores\\" consist of only portions of the selected work. In Opera, that often means just some selected Arias, and perhaps the Overture. In this case, the term \\"full score\\" truly means Full Score. Every note is there, from the Overture to the final chord. Every line of recit is included, even those that are most often spoken rather than sung. In addition, the full libretto is given...in both Italian and German.This version was completed by Georg Sch&uuml;nemann in Berlin in 1941! He cited the numerous \\"original\\" versions he used as references, even to the point of acknowledging that the sole copy of a particular printing was in Washington, and, sadly, not available to him at the time. He also supplies several pages of notes, identifying things that were \\"missing\\" from various versions or explaining which version he chose for a particular passage and why. As a study guide, for students of Mozart, students of opera, or students of orchestration this is an outstanding book, well made and certain to last a long time. It is unlikely anyone will produce anything \\"better.\\"For serious students it provides a good look at what Mozart wrote, and allows easy comparisons with versions produced today where some directors seem to feel that they can make \\"changes\\" and bill them as \\"improvements.\\" In my opinion, Mozart knew exactly what he was doing, and \\"improvements\\" are seldom as good as the original...usually much worst.

The problem lies in the fact that the &quot;recitativi&quot; are missing. As a result, you are not actually listening to the opera, but rather a series of highlights from the opera. It is very difficult to follow the opera as it develops, since the recitativi provide the opportunity to develop the plot line.If you are interested in hearing highlights from this opera, then you will be pleased with this CD and booklet. However, if you would like to listen to the complete opera as composed by Mozart, please look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"Le nozze di Figaro is one of Mozart's comic opera masterpieces which helped combine the two genres of Italian opera, buffa (comic) and seria (serious) through superb characterization and well-crafted ensemble pieces. This score is great to have if you, like me, love Mozart and his work, and wish to study in depth. Dover Scores are sturdy, so they are good for the music student who will need to use them frequently. They always reprint the music clearly and it is very easy to follow. This particular edition also provides a helpful plot synopsis and background information to Figaro. However, for those who like to have a translation, beware. The libretto is in Italian and German, but not in English. I like the idea of including German, as this opera enjoyed immense popularity in this translation, not to mention the fact that it is the mother tongue of the composer. Looking for a great opera score? You won't go wrong with Le nozze di Figaro."},{"Title":"The marriage of Figaro;","review":"The score is very clear printed and contains reherasl numbers.

I also have Tosca and that is great."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"My sister fought for two years to get me to read this novel. I fought against reading it for a long time, primarily because of its length and subject matter that I've heard about a bit too much in my life (I've grown up within two hours of the Alamo). Anyway, I'm glad I finally read The Gates of the Alamo. The story is almost always engaging and is more historically accurate than the other retellings of the battle. That was refreshing to see some real characters with flaws and sometimes less-than-honorable motivations. This was a worthwile read.The strength and weakness of the novel come it its multitude of characters. The many characters give different points of view of the battle, and that's a real plus. You get to see the different motivations and emotions that the battle brings out. Mary Mott shows the mother's perspective, Joe gives the slave viewpoint, Terrell the young patriot's, and Blas and Telesforo tell the Mexicans' side of it. Edmund is my favorite character throughout because he takes on a little more substance than the others. The many characters is also a flaw, though, because some of the characters aren't developed as well as other, or their story isn't overly important. I liked the idea of telling the stories of the Mexican soldiers, but neither Blas nor Telesforo were really a success. Blas is likeable, but he isn't connected with any of the other characters, and his story's end is abrupt and inconclusive. Telesforo is probably the most unlikeable of the primary characters, and it's such a drag to come to a chapter about him and know that you have to wade through ten more pages about him.There are certainly strong reasons to read the novel. It is, at least largely, historically accurate, something hard to find with all of the myth surrounding the Alamo. The Texians weren't exactly the good guys as my Texas History class would have you believe, and Harrigan tells the truth of it. I think he also gets a sense of the battle pretty well. The little side stories are also pretty engaging (though he could have ended them a little sooner). Overall, The Gates of the Alamo is a fine read. History lovers, particularly Texas history lovers, will find a lot to like."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Brilliant handling of detail, without the taste of a text book. You'll be amazed at what you will learn. Harrigan is absolutely expert at weaving historical fact with the handful of fictitious characters and their lives. Historical participants are not deified -- but I am an even PROUDER Texan from this reading experience. Note also that the Texas Independence movement is given a very fair analysis -- but this is not an &quot;in your face revision&quot; of history -- you will definitely ponder some issues. Rate it R for very graphic descriptions of battle and non-battle wounds and suffering, as well as some sexual encounters. In fact Harrigan's literature is an excercise in contrast: portions are almost poetic, while other portions are painfully explicit and rough. Surprising passion among some of the main characters. You will experience emotion on several levels, unless you are made of stone. And believe it or not, the story's ending is quite unpredictable...I promise. My favorite Texas History story until now was &quot;Come to the Bower&quot; which spanned more years."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I love history, and being from Texas, I loved this book. It brought the characters to life as they really were, not as we know them in myth, such as General Sam Houston who spent most of the book drunk. In fact, I don't see how the officers could plan any battle at all as they all drank excessively almost every night and had hangovers in the morning. It made you a soldier in the battle from both sides. War is hell as you see when you fight the battle, smell the smell, hear the agony of both sides. It gave one a sense of what it was like to try to find things to eat, water to drink, ways to cure injuries in the horror of battle, to feel love in the midst of war, and to believe in fighting for what they thought was right for their countrymen. It also showed how people tried to live and not take sides and how hard that was as the war formed around your land, your livelihood and your family and friends. It was a fast read as I didn't want to put the book down and think readers who are not from Texas (we have Texas History in the 7th grade) would just enjoy the sense of how early settlers and pioneers lived as well as learning about the lives of the soldiers in the Mexican army. Lots of action!!!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I read this book about a year ago and just came across this link, so I can't be too detailed.What I remember liking a lot about this book was that it told the very familiar Alamo story from the point of view of the not-famous characters. I thought that gave it a more accessible feel and the experiences (although fictional) of the characters added depth to the historical event. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I judge a good read based on how much I miss the characters after I'm finished. I just finished THE GATES OF THE ALAMO and for the past couple of days, I've been struck by how much I miss having them all around me. An excellent historical novel, made more personal by a recent trip to San Antonio. I only wish I had read this before I visited. Wonderfully rich."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Here we have 500+ pages of great entertainment. I'm not an expert on fiction but the label \\"epic\\" might fit THE GATES OF THE ALAMO as our botanist protagonist finds himself in Texas and Mexico and the Yucatan, on the Gulf Coast and, finally, at the Alamo in an historic battle. The book's prose uses the third person so viewpoints from all sides are given, including such historic icons as Santa Anna and James Bowie. Reading the last few pages, I had to wipe away the tears and I'm not someone who blubbers like that so easily. The author doesn't romanticize life in early-1800's Texas so we read about how hard life was then. The pages describing the long march made by the Mexican army from Mexico into Texas during winter is particularly disturbing. I remember only one or maybe two sex scenes in 500 pages so I don't understand the problem there. The Alamo fight is given plenty of attention and is thrilling and tragic with some interesting new ideas about how the battle took place. While my interest in botany is near zero and I sometimes found the native plant information to be a little much, on reflection it gave me a deeper feeling for what Texas was like by being exposed to the botanical dimension of the area. Plus this was at a time when amateur science was getting very popular and so it fits the times and the character. I'd like to see a movie made of this novel. I give it 5 and a half native fauna out of 5."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"One of the most compelling (sorry I can't come up with a better word) historical novels I've had the good fortune to read.

The author has spent his time, resources, and energy very well to bring us a superbly researched story of a most important time in our nation's history. He paints a picture from both the Texian view and the Mexican. Showing us the political climate of the time and the many reasons for this conflict. He delves into the human condition of the frontier people and their daily, simple wants and desires. I was very moved by reading this book. I highly reccomend it to those who appreciate the struggle of the early American spirit."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"How do you keep a reader interested in a story about the Alamo when you already know who's going to win the battle? With great historical detail and finely-fleshed out characters you care about. This novel has the historical accuracy of Michener's &quot;Texas&quot; and colorful characters as in McMurtry's &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; This book is a must for all Texans; read it before your next visit to San Antonio."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I really enjoy reading history books, but even the best non-fiction author cannot make the people about whom he is writing really come alive. It's not the fault of the author, it's just that he's constrained by the facts of what happened. This author has taken an event about which a lot is known, and added his own unique take on the historical people involved. He has created fictional folks also, and used them as the &quot;hook&quot; upon which to hang the story line. I enjoyed his characterization of David Crockett, a much different person from the one portrayed by Fess Parker, coonskin cap and all. You can really get involved in this story, and even though you know how it will end, the author involves you in his tale so much that you keep hoping everything will be different. That's the mark of great writing."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is a great read. Mr. Harrigan spent a lot of ime researching this event from both sides of the battle. It is an historic novel based on fact. All the original people surrounding this event are in the book, along with the proper amount of fictitional characters intertwined to make an interesting story. A lot of well researched information from both the Mexican side, and the American side is presented in this book. Much can be learned of life in general in the early 1800's in Texas. One of those books that is hard to put down, yet much is learned while enjoying a good novel. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in early American frontier history."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"After a recent visit to San Antonio and a tour of the Alamo, I became interested in learning more about it. This historical novel provides history within a compelling and fast-paced story.

Highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Gates of the Alamo is a great historical fiction novel about the Alamo. The book has historical characters like Jim Bowie, David Crockett and William Travis. It also has fictional characters like Terrell and Mary Mott and Edmund McGowan that are affected by the war. Mary who is the mother of Terrell who is only 16, ends up in the Alamo when she went after her son after he runs away and joins the army. Edmund is a botanist who doesn't believe in the war for Texas. However, helping Mary find Terrell Edmund finds himself fighting for the Alamo. The book isn't just about the Americans fighting at the Alamo, it is also about what the Mexicans went through. The book explains what the Mexicans went through during their march to the Alamo.

The vocabulary makes you feel like a grown-up. The descriptions are poignant. You will feel such emotion you must put the book down - even though you do not want to... the characters are so real, you like some and greatly dislike others for you come to know their inner spirits; there are many separate scenarios, both Texian and Mexican; you cannot wait for the book to end, but truly don't want it to. The slaughter is horrifying. One will more easily understand the Alamo's participants and their sacrifices. This is a book I would recommend to every lover of books, and this book is one to read again next year."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Harrigan offers a haunting painting, depicting the effect the historical events leading up to, and surrounding the fall of the Alamo had on the inhabitants of Texas during that time. This work is obviously well researched, and presented in a setting of glittering historical accuracy."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This historical novel tells the harrowing events of the 1836 battle of the Alamo; and it does so with admirable objectivity, showing the Mexican as well as the American side. Americans tend to improvise a one-sided epic and glorify Jim Bowie, William Travis, and David Crockett as noble heroes, whom Webster's Dictionary misnames &quot;US soldiers&quot;. This is a misnomer because these characters were rebels and insurrectionists, not fighting for the U.S., but for grabbing land from the legitimate state of Mexico. &quot;Land pirates&quot; would be a more correct term. No wonder then that Santa Anna, the off-and-on-again &quot;el presidente&quot; and commander-in-chief, hoisted the red flag over the town of Bexar. Harrigan's story abhors stereotypes, depicts American and Mexican cruelty alike, and shows an objectivity some might rightly call raw realism. Certainly, this isn't a book for queasy stomachs. Still, there is a margin of love and beauty: the dedication of a mother to her strong-minded son, the care extended to the hurt and dying, and the splendor of nature - if and when she's in the mood, which is not too frequently. In any case, omnipotent nature assigns human action its trivial place in the universe and its ephemeral span in history. Apparently Harrigan knows a good deal about botany, and through the character of Edmund McGowan, sprinkles interesting information about Texan flora. These and other tibits of information,(ie. the raiding Comanches), enrich the novel and give it the texture of reality. Rarely has historical fiction been so well written and suspensefully presented. A masterpiece!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I recently moved to Texas and picked up Gates of the Alamo with the hope of learning a bit of Texas history in a fictional work. What I discovered was a wonderful work of historical fiction. I think I may have learned more of the true spirit of the Alamo in this fictional work than some of the non-fiction I've read."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Texas, like Israel, is reexamining its founding myths, and this novel is a constructive contribution to that process. It brings an epic down to earth in an unsparing yet wholly engaging manner. The historical characters are rendered as accurately as contemporary scholarship can manage; the fictitious characters are fully-realized and not out of place to the least degree. In particular the author humanizes the Mexicans -- from Santa Anna on down -- and tells their side of the story with rare sympathy."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I'm an avid reader. It's in the same vein as &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; - another of my favorite books. This really just made me want for Stephen Harrigan to write more!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is one of the best historical novels I have read, ranking right up there with the finest works of Gary Jennings or James Michener. Unlike Michener, though, Harrigan is a master of characterization. Mary Mott is one of the most intriguing characters in American fiction, and when she is in the story the novel soars. The characters' interrelations are so well done, in fact, that the actual siege of the Alamo is almost subtext. There are many aspects of this novel that you will enjoy, from the smooth narrative to the sometimes thriller pace (and sometimes not) to the botany lessons to the symbolism of the birds and the sawfish. This is the book Mr. Harrigan was born to write, and it's a great gift to the readers of the world."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"\\"Gates of the Alamo\\" is an entriguing novel about that infamous time in Texas history. Although it is a novel the facts it incorporates make it seem like nonfiction. If the film versions of the Alamo had incorporated more of the personal narratives as experienced in this novel, they would have had a major block buster on their hands. There is more to tell about this historical event than just the Mexicans over-running the small stronghold of the Alamo and \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" fills in the blanks for us."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I've always had an interest in the Alamo, and when I was a kid I read at least three other books on it, Davy Crockett &amp; Jim Bowie, and I saw the John Wayne movie with my dad the week it came to the local movie theatre. I was really looking forward to reading this book. Contrary to the info I had when I went looking for it, the book is actually a 736 page paperback with relatively small print. Remember, this is Historical FICTION, and while the author even cites some of his authorities to keep to the true historical perspective, it is too drawn out. I did like the fact that he created interesting characters that were interacting with the major players on both sides of the battle, in fact he even slyly included what appears to be a younger, later to be General William T. Sherman, in part of the aftermath of the Alamo. Edmund, however, was too blind and wooden a character, intended as it may have been to portray him as such. While Edmund, despite his occupation, started out with some real action, and he got into, and out of, some really tough spots, he was also really boring in several portions of the book. His character slowed down the flow of the book too much, and too often, and some of the time and pages used on him could have been better spent elsewhere, or just been cut to shorten the book. I thought &quot;pay by the word&quot; was over. I also would like to think that Jim Bowie did have more of a role at the Alamo, sick or not, than what was portrayed. Finally, I got the impression that the very end of the book seemed somewhat contrite and forced on the author. Otherwise, it was a very good, but long read. Overall, I still give it a FOUR STAR rating for the impartial perspective, numerous interesting major and minor characters, links to history and the detailed study the author made to write it."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Best book of the year and quite possibly the last decade. Nothing this rich has hit the literary landscape since Lonesome Dove."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Buy this book. You won't be able to put it down. Harrigan is a very talented writer. The characters in this novel are wonderful. I can't say enough good things about it."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is an intriguing and somewhat revisionist novel about the battle of the Alamo and the tensions which led up to it. It takes three fictional characters (a mother, her son, and a botanist) and uses their personalities and vantage points to develop a human size story within the saga of Texas Independence. It also deftly portrays both Mexican and Texan viewpoints and emotions. A worthwhile novel for those interested in history as seen through fiction."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigan's \\"The Gates of the Alamo\\" is an incredibly well written dramatization of the events that occurred at the Alamo and elsewhere in Texas during the Texas Revolution in 1836. Harrigan deftly combines fictional and historical characters into a compelling narrative that intersects and culminates in the Battle of the Alamo. The characters are skillfully brought to life in a tangible \\"flesh and blood\\" manner that is wholly believable. This is the antithesis of pulp, one-dimensional caricatures. Harrigan's crafting of female characters is as strong and nuanced as Larry McMurty's writing............impressive indeed! Additionally, the historical details, and other details, bespeak prodigious research that the author did in preparation for this fine work. The combat sequences are graphic and nothing is left to the imagination. While this may seem gratuitous to some, it is so well rendered that it adds to the drama and overall emotional impact of the novel......rather than detracting from it. Comparisons have been made to other novels including \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and \\"The Killer Angels\\", both Pulitzer Prize winners. \\"The Gates of the Alamo\\" is fully the equal of those great novels and was clearly robbed of a Pulitzer in 2000, the year that it was first published. \\"The Gates of the Alamo\\" is to be kept on the uppermost shelf with the very finest in literary historical fiction.........think Patrick O'Brian. Hopefully, in years to come it will acquire the readership of O'Brian's work..........because it so clearly is deserving of it!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I thought I knew almost all there was to know about the Alamo until now. I really enjoyed hearing the story from both the Texas and Mexican side and learned a great deal about the battle and the reasons for it. Very exciting."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"A superb read! The characters in this book are unforgetable. I can't recommend it highly enough. Get it. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I'm an avid reader. It's in the same vein as &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; - another of my favorite books. This really just made me want for Stephen Harrigan to write more!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I now know why someone with very little free time like President Bush chooses to read Stephan Harrigan, he writes very well. I really enjoyed his book and look forward to read more of his titles."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I just finished reading this book, and went back re-reading several chapters in the book, to etch it in my mind forever. I did not want to finish this book, as it stirred my feelings so much. The inter-character plot was more interesting than any of the historical context that was portrayed .I loved this work, reading it and especially the part where Edmund McGowan returns to Mary Mott's to share his last days on earth with her, after fleeing from the Alamo. It showed us,that no matter what we think, we still need love and kindness to have a place in life.ps.....To read that Professor was still alive warmed my heart too.I liked this work....simple as that."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I really like this book. Unlike most historical novels, this book doesn't waste time on recounting all the details of a major historical event. Instead of impressing the readers with his vast knowledge of Texas history, Mr. Harrigan places us back in time with no guide.We see the Texas Revolution as ordinary citizens saw it; without the benefit of TV news or telephones. We hear rumors and see the aftermath of battles. In the Alamo, we see only that which is before our eyes, oblivious to what's going on just ten feet away. That is how the citizens of Tejas saw things. That is REAL history.If you want facts about the Texas Revolution, then go buy a history book. If you want a time machine to transport you to the Battle of The Alamo, the you must buy this book."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"While I felt the book was bit too long, it was however filled with interesting and colorful characters, great descriptions of the lonely vastness of Texas and the hardy folk who peopled that region. Mr. Harrigan did a good job of blending in fact, lore and some good dialog between the characters. His viewpoint from the Mexican side of events was well done and well researched and with some terrific character cross over meetings. The march of Santa Anna's army during their northern advance was excellently told. The growing unrest between the Texians and the Mexicans was captured in such a fashion as to make both side clearly understood. I did find the main character of Mary a tad boring at times, her broken nose was a nice touch, but she seemed to be propelled by guilt through the entire book. The botonist was pretty colorless and flat in my viewpoint. He just didn't seem to fit the role but maybe that was the intent. When the storyline is directed into the events at the Alamo, the book excels. The chapters about the actual battle and the aftermath were superbly written, drawing the reader into the darkness and misery and fear that must have stood beside each defender. I liked the concept of Crockett leaving the compound to seek reinforcements, based on fact I've read. But there was no mention of one Louis Rose, who actually left the Alamo before the place was sealed off and the reference of rockets being used by Santa Ana was a pleasant surprise. The author did mention red flags being used to signal &quot;no quarter, no prisoners&quot; but he did not mention the &quot;deguello&quot; (from the Spanish verb that meant &quot;to slit the throat&quot;- degollar, which was the sorrowful, somber and haunting bugle tune. I felt this was a powerful instrument to instill fear in one's enemies and was used by Santa Ana for several years before the Alamo. All in all, the novel was lengthy but rich in detail, good balance of characters and their lives, graphic scenes involving the Goliad massacre and the fight inside the Alamo itself. A worthy topic of a TV or cable mini series. I highly recommend the old Republic flim &quot;The Last Command&quot; with Serling Hayden as a good partner to this novel. It is available through Amazon and worth checking out."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Thorughly enjoyable.Hated to put the book down. The characters are interesting and well developed. Shows the reality of frontier life in Texas. Hope the author continues with many more books of this kind."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I had not found a book to compare to &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; until this year. Suddenly, two came into the stores: &quot;Borderland&quot; and &quot;Gates of the Alamo&quot;.

Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigan expertly captures a time in history that fascinates to this day.

Through his exhaustive research and careful placement (only 5) of fictional characters to advance the plot, he made the story of Texas sing! I was left with a much better understanding of the kind of people who brought the state of Texas into existence, and a better idea of why they love it so! This story will stay with me a good, long time."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigan's novel, \\"The Gates of the Alamo,\\" can only be said to be a noir tale. While it's probably true that nearly all Americans have heard of the Alamo and some kind of territorial dispute there, it's also probably true that very few Americans know what really happened there. With impeccable scholarship, author Harrigan has left no room for such ignorance in a novel that grabs you in the very first page and \\"turns you every which way but loose\\".Built around a handful of protagonists, good and bad, on both sides of the border, the story revolves about a widow and her hapless late teens son, an intense, single-minded botanist versus the infamous Mexican, Santa Ana, his lacky minions, and a power-driven map-reader, Telesfero Villasenor. Author Harrigan's description of the politics on both sides, Mexican military politicians and American land grabbers, not to mention the desire of some in Washington to increase the number of slave holding states brings the reader to a new understanding of the complicated motives behind the massacre at Alamo, territory of Texas. Along the way, we meet the lawless west characterized by James Bowie (deadly knife guy) a man with enormous heart, an unquenchable appetite for liquor, and a lack of scruples about the taking of human life.Author Harrigan's description of the hardships brought on by climate from freezing to broiling are perhaps unparalleled as experienced by troops marching and western colonists trying to eke out an existence from often unimaginably difficult terrain. This author doesn't tell you about it, he takes you there so you can experience it up close and personal and wonder how did the people ever survive. The answer, of course, is that many didn't.Despite the plot which holds us spell-bound, white-knuckled throughout, author Harrigan takes us inside his characters in ways not often done (i.e., the story is peopled with characters about whom we've heard a great deal over many years) - you'll come away knowing the men and women on both sides of the border better than you know some of your best friends.An unforgettable book. Add it to your shelf."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Having lived in San Antonio my whole life, \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" has given me a new perspective on my city. It is one of the better historical documents of a part of history which over the decades has been cluttered with exaggeration and misinformation. The reader will certainly get a much broader understanding of the war with Mexico through reading this novel vs watching a John Wayne movie. For a local this is the perfect novel to make one realize that the very ground we live and work on every day here in San Antonio was at one time the theater for a whole different kind of existence, a difficult one at that, and the stage for a cause much greater than our daily troubles today with traffic, life in the big city etc. I would highly recommend reading this book before a visit to San Antonio. It would give your visit a whole different meaning. Aside from that, I highly recommend just reading the book if you want to read a really great novel you will not be disappointed with - but plan on many late nights, as it is hard to put down at times."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I ordered this book late last week and received it on Saturday It is in excellent condition and is very well written. I recommed \\"The Gates Of The Alamo\\" very, very highly! Kudos to Mr. Harrigan."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"After publishing two wonderful, critically acclaimed novels in the \`80s (&quot;Aransas&quot; and &quot;Jacob's Well&quot;), Stephen Harrigan seemed to drop off of the literary map. But his time was well spent, writing books of essays (&quot;Commanche Night&quot;) and teleplays (&quot;The Last of His Tribe,&quot; &quot;Cleopatra&quot;) while researching his latest and third novel, &quot;At the Gates of the Alamo,&quot; a work of historical fiction which reads like thriller and will have thousands of Americans glued to their seats as they reevaluate that legendary event in our history. Harrigan frames his story with a 1911 parade in San Antonio, as former Mayor Terrell Mott, the last surviving &quot;hero&quot; of the Alamo, takes a place of honor in the procession. Terrell's recollections of that time lead into the main story, featuring Terrell his mother Mary, and a botanist named Ed McGowan as protagonists. Beginning in the months before the citizens of Texas begin their fight for independence, Harrigan's narrative sets the stage for the coming siege with descriptions of violence that were almost commonplace during the time. An attack by Karankawa Indians is rendered in prose that mixes matter-of-fact detail with nearly poetic description: &quot;He raised his war club, and in a strange suspension of time she studied him as if he were a subject sitting for a portrait: the shell gorget at his beautiful neck, the blue circles tattooed over his cheekbones, the rattlesnake rattles whirring at the end of his braid.&quot; After meeting up briefly with Mary Mott and her son Terrell (not to mention Jim Bowie) along the Texas coast, McGowan heads to Mexico City in order to secure more money to complete his _Flora Texana_, a journal identifying the various species of plants and flowers throughout Mexico. At the same time, Bowie and his followers head north in order to join brief skirmishes against the Mexican Army (Steven Austin, the founder of the independence movement, has been jailed in Mexico City). McGowan's journey brings him full circle, just in time to inadvertently get involved with the defenders of the Alamo - among them, Terrell Mott. Although the story of the Alamo is a familiar one, Harrigan lends it new importance by including recently discovered facts in his narrative, such as Crockett's leaving the Alamo during the siege to enlist more defenders. What's more, historical figures are presented in a realistic light: Jim Bowie comes off as a schemer always in search of a quick fortune; Col. Travis is brash and full of bravado; former congressman David Crockett can't seem to shake the habit of politicking; and Sam Houston is a scheming, devious man of questionable fortitude. Mary Mott's observations of Houston, after the Alamo, are telling: &quot;In order to help the \`forted up' men in the Alamo, Houston would have had to abandon his own plans and subvert his own ambition, and men such as he did not do such things, no matter the cost in lives.&quot; Harrigan intermingles his fictional characters with the historical creating a work of seamless beauty. The Mexican characters - like Sgt. Blas Montoya, or Lt. Telesforo Villasenor - are handled with the same amount of care, so that when the battle comes the reader is equally moved by deaths on both sides. And the ongoing (on and off) relationship between Mary Mott and Ed McGowan never slides into maudlin territory. Great historical novels should present their revelations about the past within the context of a story that is both riveting and believable. Harrigan's &quot;At the Gates of the Alamo&quot; does all that and more. (copyright 2000, DTS/St. Louis Post-Dispatch)"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"From the first page this large and satisfying book, you know you are in the hands of a master. Stephen Harrigan not only knows his Texas history like nobody's business, but he knows how to create characters we immediately care about, and finds the trick of building suspense around an historical event with a well-known outcome.Using a mix of Northamerican, Mexican and Tejano characters both real and imagined, we see what life in Mexican Texas was like. One major character, Edmund McGowan, is a naturalist in the employ of the Mexican government who sees no reason to break away. The mysterious end to that income sends him to Mexico City to find out what's happened. The possible breakaway of Texas is the talk of the town, and although Edmund insists that many of Mexico's Texas citizens are perfectly happy (settlers had to become Mexican citizens and Catholics in order to own land) a Mexico City barber sets him straight: &quot;Ah, but these days one can only be a Mexican in one's soul. It is very difficult to be a citizen when one's government is so inconstant.&quot; Also on this trip he meets Stephen Austin, fresh from prison following his latest attempt to have a rational dialogue with Mexican president Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, and Juan Almonte, an intelligent and powerful Mexican nobleman, all of whom will play major parts later in the book. McGowan's relationship with widow Mary Mott, who runs an inn on the Texas coast, adds a deep personal note to their troubled times, as does the tie between the Mexican sergeant Blas and a mysteries Maya girl.The roster of character is large, but each one is sharply drawn and memorable. The siege of the Alamo is exciting and unromantic. Some of its heroes emerge as quite heroic, others portrayed as regular people fighting for their lives. The heroism is not confined to the defenders of the Alamo: many Mexican officers were horrified at Santa Anna's insistence on killing everyone in the fort.I'm not sure I agree with that familiar bookending device of using a 1911 Alamo parade to encase the story, but what the heck, I was glad the book went on that much longer. Unlike the work of many journalists who turn to fiction, every page of Harrigan's novel is alive and vibrant."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Gates of the Alamo is a work of fiction set against the turbulent Texas Revolution and the Alamo in particular. While I am not normally a fan of ficticious works dealing with Texas history this book is the exception. Mr. Harrigan has done his research and taken us into the thirteen day siege in ways few have imagained. This is not Walt Disneys version. The characters are well thought out and human, their decisions are not always the right ones and life does not always have a happy ending. Seen through the eyes of both men and women, Anglo and Hispanic, soldiers and civilians Harrigan takes us through the horrors of war and lets us see that while the Alamo was heroic it wasn't antisceptic and battles really do bring out the worst in its participants. The author has taken the time to understand the different mind sets and attitudes concerning the Texas independence movement and has interwoven them into an interesting story that can be depended on to keep a readers interest and actually inform on many points. Mr. Harrigan has incorporated into his book recently discovered information about the battle that until now only serious researchers and Alamo historians have been aware of adding a deeper understanding of the siege to the casual reader. All in all a very good read that is enjoyable, disturbing, informative and highly recommended"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is the BEST novel about Texas history. The majority of characters are based on actual people of the time, David Crockett, William Travis, Santa Anna, Gail Borden and more. Harrigan brings them to life, gives them breath, gives them hopes and dreams, and makes them human.I'm originally from Texas and have visited the real Alamo in San Antonio many times. Most people, during their first visit, are amazed to find that the Alamo stands in the middle of the city. At the time of the battle it was across the river from the town. One cannot get a good sense of just how big the Alamo compound was, in 1836, by visiting the actual place. The plaza, where most of the fighting took place, is now covered by a street, shops and the U.S. Post Office (where Travis was killed). But, when you read GATES OF THE ALAMO you believe you are there; you can visualize the place, the smells, the cold, the pain, and the hunger. You find yourself totally immersed in the characters of the book with their desperate attempts to survive a very brutal and bloody battle.The battle, as written by Harrigan, comes to life. Even though this book is a novel, what Harrigan has written about the battle is based on the most recent research. His interpretation of the battle is mesmerizing and moving.The story is told from the perspectives of Mexican officers and soldiers and the Texans. Harrigan is fair in his portrayal of these characters and, because of that, one has a deeper understanding of what motivated these people to fight and die before dawn on March 6, 1836."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigan's The Gates of the Alamo is simply the best novel ever written about the Battle of the Alamo, and it is immediately on this reader's shortlist of favorite books. Harrigan works from a deep well of background research, and he displays a sound understanding of the time, the place, and the people of Texas during the turbulent years of 1835 and 1836. In every possible respect this book has the ring of truth and authenticity, and it abounds with thoughtful insight. The author's powers of description rank high, and the reader will feel the sights, sounds, and smells of a bygone world. The central characters include Texans and Mexicans, and both sides are portrayed fairly and with sympathy. Without a doubt, the author's narration of the final battle for the Alamo probably comes as close as is possible to the stark truth of what that savage contest must have been like. As a delightful bonus, the endpapers feature Gary Zaboly's two excellent aerial perspectives of the Alamo compound and San Antonio de Bexar. I recommend this book in the highest terms and without reservation and hope it will be a bestseller!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigan wrote a wonderful novel several years ago entitled &quot;Aransas.&quot; Now he has written another outstanding novel, &quot;Gates of the Alamo.&quot; For those interested in history it is especially appealing because it deals with one of America's most powerful icons, the Alamo. However, it is not just a historical novel. Harrigan has told a brilliant tale full of characters that demand your attention. Characters from both sides of the conflict grip you and carry you all the way to the last page of the story. I highly recommend this book to any one who loves to read a great story, well told."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Ranks way up there with &quot;Gates of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot; at the summit of recently released historical fiction novels. In fact it is the best of the three. &quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; brings history to life as only the best novels of this fascinating genre can, the characters are vividly drawn, the setting and action portrayed with authenticity, and the valor and heroic nature of the siege at the Alamo brought home to the reader with stunning power. A great book!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Alamo is the holiest of Texas shrines, a haunted little mission built at the crossroads of fact and fiction, and in the gospel of Texas, perhaps a vestige of Creation itself.With characteristic hubris, Texans can trace this new millennial world to the blood spilled at the Alamo, a game of six degrees of historical separation: Without the Alamo, they say, there could have been no Battle of San Jacinto. Without the Battle of San Jacinto, Texas could not have existed. Without Texas, westward expansion would have been stymied. Without the West, the U.S. would merely be an Atlantic power, at best, and would not likely have risen to a world power. And without the U.S. as a world power, the world as we know it today would not exist.So there is no surprise that a gifted Texas writer such as Stephen Harrigan would return to the touchstone of this single, epochal event to tell a riveting new story, in much the same way writers have so often returned to the story of Creation.This book is a new masterpiece in the literature of fact. The strength of Harrigan's extraordinarily authentic novel is in its superior storytelling, no small thing when staring down the hot barrel of history."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This past weekend I was in a local bookstore, seeking something interesting to read. Nothing really caught my fancy, and then I happened to notice a thick novel: &quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; by Stephen Harrigan. I must admit that at first impulse I was skeptical; after all, the Alamo is one of those topics which lends itself to paeans filled with noble, square-jawed heroes who die nobly and heroically, with rifle in hand and a patriotic sentiment on their lips. But, a glance at the large number of very favorable comments from reviewers (and not all from Texas, which is important since many Texans tend not to be entirely rational when discussing the Alamo) convinced me that the book might be worth a try.&quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; is told from the viewpoint of half a dozen characters, both Mexican and &quot;norteamericano&quot;. All of these characters are fictional, except for Joe, Colonel Travis's slave (about whom we actually know very little from history), so we see the familiar central figures of the Alamo story -- Travis, Bowie, Crockett, Santa Ana, Sam Houston -- from a distance. This allows Harrigan to hold firm to his stated goal of &quot;absolute fidelity to the truth of the events&quot; without having to resort to invented motivations and thoughts of historical figures. And he does an excellent job of constructing his story on a sturdy framework of genuine history. Certainly there are many elements of Alamo history which are open to varying interpretations, but Harrigan stays close to those events for which there is persuasive evidence. Undoubtedly, there are those who will not be happy with some of Harrigan's depictions of some of the traditional Alamo heroes. No, none are presented as villains, but they may be a little less than twelve feet tall. Unquestionably the most attractive of them is David Crockett, drawn as a genial man instinctively drawn to practicing personal politics with everyone he meets, but underneath all that, a man who is both goodhearted and, well, heroic.&quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; is more than a recounting of a famous battle, however. Indeed, the Alamo is not even seen until the halfway mark of the novel. Before the first Mexican soldier rides into San Antonio de Bexar, we are already deeply involved with the personal stories of the viewpoint characters and, through them, we have come to understand much about the &quot;Texian&quot; settlers and the Mexican army. And the attraction of those personal stories cannot be discounted either; they are complex, very real people walking through the pages of the novel. They include a character as unexpected as Edmund McGowan, a natural scientist who has spent the past ten years as a botanist under contract to the Mexican government to study the plants of Texas; he frequently finds himself distracted by the sight of some flower as yet undescribed in scientific literature or by the flight of magnificent flocks of birds overhead.When the final battle of the Alamo does come, Harrigan provides a powerful, intense picture of desperate combat, a battle deeply involving people with whom we have become intimately familiar. Neither glamorous nor a simplistic &quot;war is terrible&quot; diatribe, it is a realistic portrait of what happened that morning.&quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; stands head and shoulders above most historical novels."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Although a native Texan, I confess that I never really understood or valued the mystique of the Alamo. In fact, I was a teenager before I realized that the Texans were defeated in San Antonio. But after reading Harrigan's powerful account my imagination has been captured by the power, the horror, and the beauty of the epic struggle. Surprisingly the account of the siege and ensuing battle consume only a small part of Harrigan's book. All that preceeds and follows gives the reader an understanding of the complex relationship between the Mexican government and the settlers from the north. Harrigan's characters, even the heroes of the Alamo like Crockett, Bowie, and Travis, are depicted as men and women of both human frailty and heroic courage. Mary Mott's character was especially powerful, and as a woman I could identify with her overpowering need to find her son and the despair and grief that the hardships of pioneer life held for women. After Harrigan's book, I now understand why Texans should remember the Alamo."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Being a Texan and growing up with many trips to the Alamo, you just know the next reading will get it all just right. Sometimes I thought the author was getting it &quot;all just right&quot; and sometimes I just got bored. I think I may have set my expectations too high for no other reason than this is a part of our history that equals no other. The Alamo is the most traveled to tourist spot in Texas. I bought this book in the Alamo gift shop on my 3rd trip to San Antonio in five years. If you like to read novels based on history, you will probably enjoy. It did not keep me turning pages late in the night. I think it was a little over sold."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Will dispel some of your favorite myths. Excellently researched. Highly recommended by reviewer as great toilet reading. Highly recommended by Brooks &amp; Kromer book reviewers from the urban jungle of Europe."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Not having been raised in the US I had always wanted to learn more about the Alamo, and why it is so important in Texas/American history. I saw this book had good reviews and so decided to give it a try. 50 pages in I realized the author is no fan of Texans, or American history for that matter. I pushed through to the end because there is much interesting information (hopefully true) on the time period, but feel like I need to read further to get a perspective that is not so critical of the Texians. Things Mr. Harrigan makes sure to emphasize: All the Texan leaders were useless failures (Houston--never had a sober day in his life, had no control over his troops, afraid to fight, afraid to go to the Alamo; Austin--feeble; Crocket--could only speak in witty yarns, no sincerity, complete politician; William Travis--inexperienced, philandering, all talk, and insincere rhetoric; Joe the slave--cowardly, wanted to kill his master; and on and on--even the un-named defenders letters are dismissed as being bloodthirsty, false and insincere). The only people posed in a decent light are the Mexican soldiers who regret having to massacre all the Americans who want to give up. Even the fictional characters (the main characters of the book) are not likeable--a promiscuous widow, a virgin botanist, and 16 year old who wants to die for no reason other than his mother thinks he had sex. While I realize all the true hero's of the Alamo were not saints and the Mexican's had some good qualities, it would have been nice to read a more even handed treatment of the whole situation. I guess Mr. Harrigan had to find his personal niche in the writings on the Alamo. Hopefully readers will be aware of what they're getting when they order the book. I gave it two stars instead of one because it is obvious there is a lot of research on the time period, and I do feel I learned some things from that."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I sympathize with writer Stephen Harrigan's task - writing an historical fiction about Mexican Texas, on the eve of the revolution, is no easy task. First-hand source material is sporadic, often contradictory, and the subject is still highly charged with emotion among many Texans and historians today. Although I understand the challenge that this book presented him, and respect his right to draw his conclusions and tell the tale, I must advise prospective readers that Harrigan's version of Texas history is highly speculative and considerably biased. If it's a light fictional read you're after, it should suffice - but remember the word &quot;fiction&quot;. If you want a more thorough presentation of Texas history, however, you can do better. &quot;Blood of Noble Men&quot;, by Alan Huffines, presents the battle of the Alamo much more even-handedly, with all its complexities, and &quot;Lone Star&quot;, by T. R. Fehrenbach, is the quintessential book of Texas history, told with unflinching honesty."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"When I first saw this book on the shelves, I picked it up immediately. As I read it, I realized what a missed opportunity it was. Unlike The Killer Angels which tells the story of Gettysburg through the principal characters which participated in that fateful event, Gates of the Alamo instead follows three fictional characters who play out a cheesy and underdeveloped drama. Had Harrigan just allowed the readers to go through the story with Travis, Crockett and others, it would have been so much more effective when these men meet their fates at the alamo. To its credit, Harrigan spares no details when it comes to the battle scene in the end. He depicts it with gruesome and minute detail.An overall good read but it loses a few stars because of wooden dialogue and boring characters. It tries to reach the glorious heights of Killer Angels but never quite makes it."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"As a buff of historical novels, I am probably a little more discriminating than most when it comes to critiquing a book such as &quot;Gates of the Alamo.&quot; That said, I will admit that Harrigan's novel, while entertaining and worth putting on your summer reading list, fell short in some ways.Since I did not know too much about Texas history other than what I learned in elementary school textbooks, I hoped that &quot;Gates of the Alamo&quot; would give me a taste (fictional, at least) of what it was like to be in Texas in the 1830's. Thanks to this book, I have a better idea of why Texas seceded from Mexico, but this book failed to fully flesh out its characters in the same vein as, say, Clavell's &quot;Shogun&quot; and Jennings' &quot;Aztec.&quot; Although the storylines were provocative, the characters were somewhat bland and uninspiring. Harrigan could have taken advantage of these rather interesting storylines to further develop his characters, but, instead, he just stops right there and pushes too quickly ahead with the story. Even after finishing this book, I still could never get a very real sense of why the norteamericanos (Texans) wanted to break off from Mexico and stake out its own path, other than the usual palaver about corrupt government, inefficient economies, and just plain being too far from Mexico City.His writing style also does not lend itself to inspiration or sophistication. At times, his descriptions and observations of various events seem awkward and a bit corny.Perhaps the best part of Harrigan's novel is the way he brings to light the competing priorities of the Mexican and Texan characters, and the way he brings the characters together to an earth-shaking climax at the Alamo. You could only wonder how everyone came out once the smoke and dust cleared from the Alamo. Granted, the violence was a bit too much, as some other reviewers had complained, but then again, there were no video cameras in the 1830's and soldiers then had a little more license to do whatever they wanted without being judged by society.All in all, an interesting read, but nothing to shout about."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I don't know what the point of this book was except maybe to humanize the Texans at the Alamo, and the Mexicans who fought them. The author does a very good job of that, and creates scenes very well. But he relies too much on violence to shock you, and it's a lot like a spaghetti Western---sure, we know people bleed and die, but must our noses be rubbed in it every other chapter? Surely Texans MUST have taken some time out to laugh and play and tell jokes, even during the Mexican invasion!At the end of the book I felt empty, as if I'd just done a lot of ditch digging and couldn't find a beer to cool me down! This could never be made into a movie: the main character is not appealling or strong, as main characters go. He doesn't even get to consummate things with his girlfriend!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"is displayed on the jacket; is this symbolic? This NOVEL uses fictional characters to tell the reader what life was like in 1830s Texas. The end paper maps of The Alamo (Mission San Antonio de Valero) and San Antonio de Bexar are only recreations, but show how little remains today of that fortified mission.The book would have been better with a chapter giving the historical background; &quot;A Line in the Sand&quot; does this much better. The &quot;Author's Note&quot; explains the rational behind this novel, and why it differs from other works. The lack of eyewitness testimony may not contradict the legends!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I've just recently finished reading Harrigan's \\"The Gates of the Alamo\\" and was very disappointed. After reading some of the reviews on ... I thought that I would be reading a much better book. How this book ever made it onto the New York Times Bestseller list is beyond me! I suppose it was monkey see, monkey read! Anyway, I found this book to be pretty boring at times. Although Harrigan did a good job of developing his main characters, I thought that he went into way too much detail about trivial things or about things that had no basis on the overall story. At times I found Harrigan to be brilliant - in his description of the Indian attack on Mary Mott, and in his description of the snowstorm that struck the Mexican Army on it's way to Texas. And, Harrigan can certainly depict action. His description of the March 6 attack on the Alamo was very, very well done - especially his death of Crockett. Still, I disliked this book mainly because of the way Harrigan played fast and loose with history! In the \\"Author's Note\\" section at the back of the book Harrigan states that although \\"Gates\\" is a work of fiction, he \\"made a pledge of absolute fidelity to the truth of the events.\\" Nothing could be further from the truth! Harrigan's description of the discovery of the Mexican force outside of San Antonio on February 23 is as far from the truth as you can get! It is well documented that John Smith and Dr. John Sutherland rode out and discovered the Mexican troops. As they returned at a gallop, the sentry in the San Fernando bell tower began ringing the bell and everyone fled towards the Alamo. In Harrigan's book he has one of his character's ride out and discover the Mexicans. If he is trying to be true to history, why didn't he leave Smith and Sutherland to find the Mexican army and place his character in the bell tower since nobody really knows who the sentry was that day! And Harrigan has Travis's slave Joe confront two Mexican soldiers that break into Travis's headquarters building during the February 24 attack on the Alamo by about 350 men! As Harrigan tells it, while the 350 Mexicans were attacking the south wall, two soldiers snuck around to the west wall, pried some bricks from the window of the headquarters and climbed inside! If it was so easy for these two Mexicans to get into the Alamo - why did it take the other 3,000 another eleven days! And don't get me started on Travis' slave Joe! Historical! It's more like hysterical! the real-life Joe survived the siege and gave numerous interviews about what he did and what happened while he was there. In Joe's own words he described the death of Travis and then stated that he ran to the headquarters room and hid for his dear life. Yet, Harrigan has him fighting with the others and eventually getting stuck in one of the east barracks rooms! Historical! I think not! And then, what about James Butler Bonham? Bonham is perhaps one of the most heroic figures in Texas history. He had a chance to save his life and remain outside of the Alamo, yet he decided to return to Travis and report the results of his futile mission to Fannin! Harrigan gives Bonham the brush off with one line. He deserves better!If you want a novel that sticks much closer to the historical truth, read \\"Holy Sabbath Morning\\" by Bob W. Dunbar. The book was published by a fly-by-night \\"DotCom\\" publisher and has numerous grammatical mistakes and spelling errors but at least it is much more accurate to history. And, while Dunbar seems to steal many lines and situations from John Wayne's \\"The Alamo,\\" at least the book moves along briskly and does not bog down with descriptions of flowers and scenery. If you want a boring, non-historic novel about the Alamo with great character development, read Harrigan's \\"The Gates of the Alamo.\\" If you want an entertaining, historically acccurate story of the Alamo, read Bob W. Dunbar's \\"Holy Sabbath Morning.\\" It's only too bad someone didn't edit Dunbar's book a bit more!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I should have waited to read this book, first of all. I'm probably too young to appreciate it, but being a 6th or 7th generation Texan and having taken Texas History in school this year and being really inspired (not to mention having a slight crush on William Barret Travis, like apparent multitudes of other women) I decided to read it. For the most part, it is all right, but I was really disturbed by a few things.It was extremely graphic, which during the battle scenes is necessary and important, but many descriptions veer into the territory of \\"did we REALLY need to know that?\\", especially the ever-present obsessions with sex and bodily functions. No more needs really to be said.One thing I noticed was how impersonal the whole thing was. The fictional characters are dry and not at all compelling, and I found myself skimming through the sections where they appeared. Getting to know the historical people better was why I wanted to read it, but the author is so concerned with exposing their faults and weaknesses that he doesn't make them into real characters, just wants to shock people with how bad they were. Especially, the author seems bound and determined to throw as much dirt on Sam Houston as possible. I see some of his points, and no one is as heroic as legends paint them, but Houston was a brave and honorable man (just look at how he stood up to everyone else in Texas who wanted secession) whose faults couldn't overshadow his inner greatness. Harrigan is just plain mean in this respect. And by the way, Houston's wife left HIM not the other way around.I'll admit, this book was actually very good and really grabbed my attention. The author did a good job in portaying both sides of the conflict. But the truth is, you can't mess with people's legends unless you can make new ones, and Harrigan can't.Up to some point, I guess, the heroic Alamo myth ought to be told truthfully, but the truth is there WAS heroism and bravery, not just a bunch of selfish cowards whacking each other's heads off. I would have like to hear more about the rest of the Revolution, especially (ahem) Gonzales...oh well.The bottom line is, people need to believe in heroes and legends and freedom. These things do exist, no matter how flawed the people are who achieve them. And the Alamo is certainly not a spotless shrine to glory, it is a place where awful things happened. But these things became great through the memories of generations, and where there's smoke there's fire. We will always believe in the greatness of the Alamo and its less-than-perfect-heroes, no matter how revisionist our historical novels."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Without a doubt this has to be the best fictional book on Texas and this period I've read with very detailed historical mixing of real people and fictional folks. In fact this book would make a great movie or mini series. There's an Alamo in Brackettville Texas just waiting for the cast to arrive."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Harrigan provides a gripping account of this near-mythical battle. His characters have substance, and offer a believable spectrum of opinions on why &quot;the Alamo&quot; happened in the first place. The battle itself unfolds in a totally authentic way, quickly taking on a life of its own that in the end hardly meets the aims of any of the participants. Historical fiction at its best."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"It is rare to read a book that holds one spellbound and really caring for these characters, fictional though they may be. The characterizations are extraordinary and brings to &quot;Alamo-atics&quot; a new perspective that is much more real and human than the cold, historical explanations of the battle. We come to know that these were real people caught up in events that were extraordinarily horrific. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"If the history books I read in graduate school were as good as this work of historical history, the school experience would have been 100% better. Congratulations to the author for a fine work of historical research and the wonderful fictional characters he writes about in the context of this famous event in Texas history. I wish readers who aren't Texans or have some other ties to Texas would give this historical novel a try. It was a truly excellent, well-written story."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The imagery in this book will stay with me a long time. I'm not particularly a fan of American historical fiction and bought this for my husband, but after &quot;scanning&quot; the first few pages, I was pulled in and found it difficult to put down. The characterization was wonderful and the interaction of the different characters both Mexican and Texian was believable and memorable. Toured the Alamo once with a disinterested attitude; now I have so much more respect for those individuals who played such an important part in our country's history. Great read!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"There have been many stories written of the battle at the Alamo, but this is definitely the one that brings that event in Texas history to life. It is excellent, well written, well researched. In my opinion, Gates of the Alamo is worthy of a Pulitzer Prize for best historical fiction. I am going to nominate it!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"It's a pleasure to be whisked away to another world, another time occasionally. A look around this one argues ardently for it. To make the trip the vehicle must be sound and able. Steve Harrigan aids and abets the escape with this fine book.But he does something more in the bargain. He makes you a little smarter. As a Texan from the start, it was through the haze of 8th grade Texas History that I got any exposure to history at all. So the lore has grown larger than the story. \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" brings together most of the disparate versions of the event in a cleverly woven drama told from several key perspectives.As in all well written stories, where the characters become old friends and the feel of the thing is so comfortable, the thinning page count as you approach the end is resisted then lamented. Fortunately, Steve Harrigan is writing more books.If you want to know about the Alamo and the Texicans, I think \\"Gates\\" is the definitive Alamo story and I think it will influence all that follow. And that's for the good."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I read the book with great interest, as I am a Texan, and I wished to get a clearer idea of the actual events at the battle of the Alamo. Mr. Harrigan's book provided a well-researched and superbly written chronicle of the event. I agree that his book also provides some background concerning the viewpoint of the Mexican leaders. I have a couple of problems with the book. All of the main characters are repeatedly beaten, shot, stabbed, and/or clubbed before the battle of the Alamo ever begins. I understand that the Texas frontier was a rough place, but I think it is a little over-done. Also, the sexual disfunction of the botanist Mr McGowan is a little destracting and does not really serve the main story line. The sentence structure and choice of words are first rate and compare favorably with &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot; And the attention to historical accuracy is evident and appreciated by this reader."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I just spent a rainy Labor Day weekend finishing Stephen Harrigan's wonderful perspective of Texas history through the eyes of three very engaging fictional characters who are surrounded by real historical people at the battle of the Alamo. Harrigan so deftly draws his characters that if I didn't know who was real and who wasn't, I would not have been able to tell. The real Travis, Bowie, Crockett, and Santa Anna became alive for me, as do the fictional Edmund, Mary and, most of all, the tortured Terrell.The character development is so superb that I had tears in my eyes at the climax of the book. The reader is drawn to care deeply about each character in this harsh landscape of 1830's Texas.The structure of the book creates great suspense from one chapter to the next, making for very exciting reading.Such supreme story telling is used to describe each person, place and event that the reader feels like he/she is right \\"there.\\" I could smell the blood and the dust and feel the cold. I had a hard time putting this novel down and recommend Gates of the Alamo with 5+ stars!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I was really looking forward to this book, but was disappointed in the end product. I love fiction that teaches something of history, I think it is the best way to really learn something. However, this book veers away from history too often for me to recommend it as a valuable read.Things I Liked (Or Learned):* Back story before the Texians are in the Alamo defending it* The portrayal of the Mexican soldiers and what Texas meant from their perspective* Overall, a very balanced look at the ordeal between the Texians and Mexicans. Complicated issue, but the author does not shy away from critiquing each side in the story.* Geography and architecture at the time were new to me (and I have visited the Alamo at least 5 times in my life)Things I Did Not Like:* Flat characters. Houston is a drunk, Crockett is a witty politician, Bowie crazy, Edmund McGowan boring. No character comes to life, very one dimensional.* Main story follows three characters primarily - Edmund McGowan, Mary Mott, and Mary's son, Terrell Mott. Edmund is one of the most boring literary characters I have read. Terrell feels distant the whole time, never really get to know him. Mary is the only interesting character, but even she lacks any real depth.* Too much backstory. 300+ pages before the fighting starts. Would be interesting to know the backstory of real people, but belaboring the back story of made up characters is boring, especially when they are flat.* The Sam Houston being drunk all the time motif really got old. Every time his name was brought up, he was drunk and portrayed as a loser. If the author had justified it with more of his backstory or more history, it would have been acceptable, but in this book it just comes across as a bad choice by the author.Overall, can't really recommend this book as much as I want to. The main takeaway for me is that I want to learn more about the Alamo and Texas History, and will be looking for other books that do a good job of telling this (whether novel, history book, or something else)."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I've lived in and around San Antonio my whole life, and nothing has brought the battle of the Alamo and the Texian's saga to life the way that this book has. Yes, you know what the ultimate historical end must be, but Harrigan gives a wide variety of characters that bring a personal perspective on the twists and turns in between. We meet personally with true historical characters like Travis, Crockett, Bowie, Houston, Santa Anna, and Travis' slave Joe, but also spend time seeing things through the eyes of more common people: men, women, and children within the Alamo, Mexican officers and soldiers, Texians, Mexicans, and Americans all living in the the area -- some much more willing participants in the revolution than others. I also greatly appreciate Herrigan's refusal to bow to the myths and legends of the Alamo that have no true basis in fact. I wish I had read his end notes before beginning the book to see how carefully he researched things, and why certian eternal staples of so-so Alamo movies were missing from his tale. I'd call this a must read for fans of historically accurate fiction, especially those interested in Texas, Mexico, the settling of the Americas, or various wars and battles. It would be an excellent choice to read before visiting South Texas and the cities of San Antonio, Goliad, or San Jacinto where buildings and artifacts from this period still exist. I'd recommend having a Spanish-English dictionary on hand if you want to not miss anything... though Harrigan writes in such a way that this wouldn't be a necessity if you aren't such a perfectionist as I seem to be."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"&quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; represents the first in a long line of books that I will no doubt read concerning the events of 1836 in San Antonio de Bexar. An Arkansas transplant to North Texas, I've developed a hunger for historical narratives pertaining to my adopted state, and Stephen Harrigan's robust, bloody, entertaining, deeply moving book is my first step into that body of literature.Harrigan has obviously researched the time period thoroughly, and I was transfixed by the amount of political, emotional and topographic detail contained in these pages. Like &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; and &quot;The Killer Angels,&quot; &quot;Gates&quot; transports the reader to another time and place, not simply through historic details, but with characters that live in the heart.A great book in every way. I defy you to put it down once the siege begins. And does anyone else see Tom Hanks in the movie role of Edmund McGowan?"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Although not an in depth look at the historical characters, the author's use of fictional characters shows not only the emotions of anglo Texas, but of Mexican soldiers and officers as well. Descriptions of harsh circumstances on both sides tell a story by itself. I have never read any better description of how conditions must have been for the Alamo defenders. Very easy book to read, recommended for anyone interested in Texas history."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"This is a wonderful period story. I found myself marveling at the quiet courage of the fictional characters, as well as the larger than life failings, courage and characteristics of the legendary Texas personalities. I found Davy Crockett to be an exceptionally moving &quot;real&quot; character. My only complaint about the book is the inclusion of so many Spanish terms without the benefit of a glossary to aid in clarity. In spite of that small complaint, a great read all around."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Harrigan's book is as good as historically based fiction can be, and that statement is meant to evoke comparisons with any of O'Brian's books. Just as O'Brian simultaneously demythologizes and humanizes the Nelson era, Harrigan does the same for an event in Texas history that has become iconic and mythical. His account of the battle, far removed from what we learned in &quot;Texas Comics&quot; (literally a comic-book format pamphlet traditionally used in the Texas history course that, believe it or not, was required by law of the public schools when I was an eighth-grader), is no less heroic, far more believable and as bloody as it must have really been. His treatment of the best known figures of Texas history--Houston, Austin, Bowie, Travis, and Crocket--and many more of the lesser lights is balanced and knowing. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Along with The Holy Sabbath Morning by Bob W Dunbar (actually I think it does just about beat Dunbars novel into second place because of this novel's epic scope, and I didn't think that would be possible), this is the novel I have most enjoyed concerning the Alamo (and the Texas War of Independance). I myself am planning to write a novel about this very same period, but from a different angle and I hope it will be as good! This novel is wonderfully evocative of both time and place and the author has obviously done his research. Yet at the same time there is a very strong plot and well rounded characters. He refuses to take side in the conflict (Mexican versus Texian!)and presents an objective viewpoint - letting the characters - both historical and fictional speak for themselves. I have learnt a lot just by reading this novel, yet have been thoroughly entertained as well. The author obviously has a great knowledge of the times, and of diverse other subjects as well - including botany! An interesting caste of characters feature the historical ones of Jim Bowie, Davy Crockett &amp; Travis vs Santa Anna, the fictional characters of Edward McGowan (the botanist!) and Mary Mott (and the subtle relationship which develops between them), and of course Mary's son Terrell whose first experience of love leads him to war. This book is a great page turner and the plot keeps you in suspense until the climactice finale (the Alamo!). I rate this book five stars and would thoroughly recommend it as THE NOVEL on the Alamo!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"&quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; is a wonderful novel, one that I recommend with the greatest enthusiasm. Above all, the writing is superb. This is not a book that you can simply pick up and race through (which is not intended to sound discouraging) - every word simply counts for too much and, therefore, I found myself actually READING this book. Second, the fictional framework in which the author has enclosed this historical events of the Texas Revolution is compelling - certainly, a framework that is strong enough to stand on its own even without a famous historical backdrop. I cared about these characters, I followed the twists and turns of their adventures with deep interest, and at the end I cared about their fates with emotion. Third, as a reader who knew virtually nothing about the Alamo except that I am supposed to remember it, this book was a wonderful education about famous people and famous deeds. The author has removed the varnish from the legends and left behind a pleasant lesson that will stay with the reader for a long time.Knowing that authors often read online reviews of their books by readers, I want to say to Mr. Harrigan that he is a fine novelist, possessed of the ability to describe people, places, and events with the eye of a sharp observer and the emotional insights of a careful student of humanity. You should be proud, sir, of your achievement here.In short, anyone who is looking for a beautifully-crafted, compelling, and enlightening historical novel should grab &quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; and settle in for an absorbing experience."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Gates of the Alamo is the most compelling fiction I have read in the past year. But don't be misled: the masterful weaving of well-researched historical fact into this drama makes it a virtual must for those studying the period. I have read reviews that treat the famous siege as the centerpiece of this story. But it is not. The real centerpiece is human emotion; the emotions of individuals and groups, colonists and armies, officers and soldiers. It tells the story, through the views of several key (though fictional) characters of the sweeping emotions that led two opposing factions to abandon any attempts to reconcile and to choose, instead, to prove their point by force. Yet, it is the story of these characters that compels you to read. You feel for them. You suffer with them. You want to shout at them to just open up to each other. You wonder how they or the actual people of those times could survive the deprivations they face.It is a tragic story but also one that fills you with optimism over the indomitable spirit and endurance of such frail creatures as ourselves. The historic protagonists are all there, but only observed--sometimes kindly and sometimes unkindly. Only one of them, Travis' slave Joe, is allowed to make his own observations of the desperate situation.I could not wait to see what happened to the central characters and yet, I did not want to see the book end. At nearly 600 pages, it took me surprisingly little time to get there--largely because I was so engrossed in the book that I used my free time for little else.This immediately joined my list of my favorite reads of all time. Enjoy it and allow yourself to be moved by it. Whether or not you agree with the facts as they are represented, that is not the point of the book. When you finish, you will want to go back and read it again."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Gates of the Alamo is one of the best books I've ever read. Although it is based on historical fact, (I suggest you read the Author's Note in the back before you start. It should have been in the front.) it is told by 4 or 5 fictional characters. By the time you get to know Travis, Crockett, and Bowie, you agonize over the fact that you know they are going to die. The main female character (fictional) is no great beauty. She is a woman who has already suffered much by the time the story starts, and her love and trials with her son and the man she is attracted to will keep your emotions on edge. If you like historical novels, you will love this book."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"After this one, I'll be after all of Stephen Harrigan's books. The story line is imaginative, believable and it keeps your attention. Best of all, it's very well written. This book is excellent."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"A good historical western. It put more of a factual twist to the over-dramatized Alamo story. I didn't like the slave guy I thought he was a complete coward. I've been to the Alamo so it brought out a better memory for me and I feel I've learned more."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stephen Harrigans's book takes longer to read than it did for Santa Anna's troops thomarch to Bexar and lay siege before the brief but galvanizing battle. Harrigan chooses to show all the heroes of Texas with all their warts and in the end fails to acknowledge what a loosely organized band of malcontents managed to accomplish.I'm not a native Texan but I have taken the time to learn the history of the state. While everything Harrigan says about Bowie, Crockett, Travis, Houston and Austin is correct, it is incomplete. These were men of great courage and vision. Did Houston fight a different war than Washington did against the Brisish? No. Washington knew the only important battle to win was the last one and if he could stretch the enemies supply lines then cut them off he would eventually win. Houston's &quot;reluctance&quot; to engage Santa Anna until the Mexicans were demoralized and had no supply lines is the same battle.The fact that Bowie was a drunken philanderer doesn't change the fact that he was a brilliant motivator of men. The fact that Crockett was more politian than warrior doesn't detract from the spirit he brought to the battle. Travis was young but he inspired men to follow him to a hell called the Alamo and make a stand for independence.Harrigan does Texas history a grave injustice. Let us not forget names like Lee, Jefferson, Hamilton, Lafite without whom we would still be british citizen. They were as far from perfect as the Texas heroes were.As a book I found the plot drawn out and overly complicated. Too many subplots that failed to tie in with the story or add to character development. Most disappointing were the characters themselves. I found I cared little for Mary, McGown, Terrell, or any of the other minor fictious characters. Beyond destroying the reputations of some great men because of their human weaknesses, he fails to develop one sympathetic character except maybe the parrot."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Rarely have I ever tossed a book into the trash after investing 500 pages in it. However, with Harrigan's \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" I did.Reading the comments about it I had been looking forward to a good and perhaps informative read. I doggedly plunged into the slowly, slowly developing plot. The absence of strong character development or attention to historical detail could not justify any further investment, no, waste of time.One particularly annoying feature of Harrigan's style was the repeated and seemingly gratuitous use of the phrase \\"f-----g\\" by his characters. I am no prude, but this usage sounded more like Enron energy traders talking about California grandmothers than Texians of 1836 expressing their frustrations over the complex and foreboding tensions they faced.I consider myself a fairly informed student of Texas history. When I read the author's self-congratulatory praise regarding his research, I found it laughable - unless his research was all packed into the last 200+ pages. Regardless, I wrote off my angry reaction as a possibly snobbish bias against historical fiction.Now, having just completed the first 100 pages of \\"The Court Martial of Robert E. Lee\\" by Douglas Savage, I am prompted to write this review. It isn't historical fiction I object to, it is B-A-D historical fiction. Harrigan's is.For an example of good Alamo fiction, Lon Tinkle's \\"13 Days of Glory\\" (1958) still reigns supreme, IMO, although it has been 40+ years since reading it. As for non-fiction, Walter Lord's \\"A Time to Stand\\" (1961) is still rated amongst the best. Regarding Alamo fiction in general, reading contemporary published history, still so rapidly changing, is close enough to fiction. I'd recommend it before \\"The Gates of the Alamo\\" anytime. The subject is so well known and vital one doesn't need character development to become engaged in the story.Overall, I'd recommend Savage's book - remember \\"Marse Robert\\", forget Harrigan's Alamo. Maybe someday a courts martial of Sam Houston will come along ... now that could be an interesting read!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Frankly, if you are looking for a book that is enjoyable to read and informs you of a particular event or time period, then I would recommend this book. However, I found the storyline in this book to be very formulaic and typical of historical fiction novels, of which I have read several. There is the typical romance that never quite seems to turn out as the focus of the book with little side plots that are also rather predictable. If you are looking for a historical fiction book, I would suggest reading something like Exodus by Leon Uris or Shakespeare, which actually leaves you with something after you have finished the book. However, Mr. Harrigan's facts seem to be very reliable and accurate, and he does give you a feel for the time from both sides of the battle. All things considered, I would suggest taking the time you would have spent reading this book and doing something constructive with it."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"As a British reader without much knowledge of the Alamo or of Texas, I can't comment on the book's historical accuracy. But like me I'm sure many people will know something of the story - if nothing else from that old John Wayne film and will be encouraged, as I was, to read it. And it is, indeed, a \\"page turner\\". But am I the only one to come out of it angry at the gratuitous heaping of violence upon graphic violence - and it's not just the violence of war - that splatters its pages from start to finish? No, to be fair, \\"gratuitous\\" isn't the right word. We know Harrigan isn't describing a garden party. A better word is \\"relentless\\". We are only too well aware how ghastly war is. We don't need its minute details incessantly drummed into us as though we ought to enjoy lapping them up with a voyeuristic relish. The killing frenzy exhibited at various times in the book by soldiers on both sides, seems almost to be replicated by proxy in the written word. No human being, no animal, can be allowed to be injured or die without having their sufferings exposed to the world in details which are either disturbing or disgusting or more often both. If I had a thousand dollars for every inch of bowel displayed in these pages I'd never need to work again! Why do we need it? What on earth has happened to our society that this sort of thing has become mainstream literature, a \\"best-seller\\" that can be picked up from any airport bookstall by any child? How many fine novels have been written about war where the descriptions are oblique and sparing and the message far more powerful? The delicacy of previous generations had a point."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Stop the myth and the heroics...A bunch of illegal aliens, rapacious and fighting for their right to have slaves.Stop adorning theft and racism."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Having read several novels about the Texas Revolution, I can see the trend here hasn't changed. Take the thirteen day seige of the Alamo and stretch it out so that it seems like thirteen HUNDRED days. (I kept rooting for Santa Anna myself) Add a lot of exaggerated and one dimensional characters from both sides, male and female. (Why do all the Texians in these novels sound like \\"red-necks\\" when they talk when so many of them immigrated from New England and Europe?) Sprinkle in a smattering of historical detail of questionable accuracy and throw in lots of smoke, modern slang, bodily functions, blood and gore (and a little sex) and you have it. A book that ended up on the best seller list and no-one knows exactly why. (At least I didn't) Harrigan's book is no exception.

I did read however the customer reviews to see if this book shows a more enlightened version of the battle. A version different from what Hollywood and the Lone Star State will have Americans believe. They did not. Not one review touched on WHY Texas set out to form its own nation. One main reason was that Mexico had OUTLAWED slavery, which was incomprehensible to (white) Texians. I'm sure that the men on both sides fought bravely, but the Anglos fought to OWN slaves. If this fact is not mentioned than this piece of work is more fictional than historical. Thus many people may find it hard to see the Texians as the &quot;good guys&quot;. This may upset some people, mostly Texans, but look it up. It is the truth. However I will read the book and write an honest and full review.

Set in the time of the Texas revolution, it does not only focus on the Alamo, but the people of the time. It is a story told through three fictional characters: Edmund McGowan, a struggling botanist trying to stay out of the violence and finish his book; Mary Mott, a widow innkeeper who has strange feelings for Edmund; and Terrell Mott, her late-teenaged son who wants nothing more than to join up the fight for liberty. Includes real people as well, such as David Crocket, Jim Bowie, William Travis and his slave Joe, Sam Houstan, Steven Austin, Santa Anna, and many more! Eventually, it all comes down to the Alamo, and the most inspirational battle ever fought!"},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"All things considered, this was not a bad book. It held my interest from beginning to end, mostly because of the strength of the novel's first half and the strong character development there. The fictional story is naturally overshadowed in the second half by the historical battle.In the first half, we get a glimpse of Texas frontier life through Mary Mott and her son Terrell as they run their inn near the gulf coast. We see the inside of Mexican politics through Edmund, the botanist who works for the government of Mexico, and through this plot device we are able to see the political situation from a Mexican perspective. The Mexicans saw North Americans as \\"land pirates.\\" After all, Texas was part of Mexico.The action that eventually brings Mary and Edmund together is both interesting and informative about the historical events that led to the Battle of the Alamo. The budding relationship between Mary and Edmund is written in a subtle and sensitive way. I liked both these characters in the beginning. Edmund is proud and highly educated but has absolutely no knowledge of women and apparently has never considered them necessary, his only love being his botanical study of Texas. The widow Mary is wiser in a worldly sense and is attracted to Edmund but she waits for him to make the first move. This complicated relationship keeps the first half moving.Eventually the author needs to get his characters inside the Alamo and this is where the novel runs into trouble. The formerly strong and wise protagonists, Mary and Edmund, choose to go to Bexar, a place they know will soon erupt into heated battle at the Alamo, for some rather silly and implausible reasons. And as they get into more and more trouble on the way, I kept wondering why they ever went in the first place. This weak link compromises the fictional story throughout the entire second half of the novel.The battle itself is well done. Harrigan writes battle scenes with realistically graphic violence and gore. As with any so called historical novel, the author must be careful not to change history or historical persons, and at the same time invent dialog and actions that can never be verified. Harrigan has done a good job with the battle itself. He's taken out or changed some of the better-known legends. He did this based on the latest available historical documents, according to an interview with him that was published on the Internet.The fictional characters serve little purpose in the second half other than to get the reader into the Alamo, and later into the command post of Sam Houston. Harrigan pulls no punches in his treatment of this legendary Texas hero. Houston is shown as a drunken vacillator who is despised by his men.All in all this was a good novel. Harrigan has enough love for Texas history not to revise it, but only to try to clarify it. An historical novel is not a bad way to teach history as long as the reader can keep the fiction separate from the history. This fictional story falls apart in the second half, but you don't buy a book called \\"Gates of the Alamo\\" to read a love story."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Well told story with fair treatment of the Mexican point of view through realistic portrayals of Mexican officers and troops and General Santa Anna's strengths as well as weaknesses. For a similar well written novel of the Texas Revolution, with particular coverage of Fannin's battle and surrender at Coleto Creek followed by the Palm Sunday massacre at Goliad which claimed 400 lives, read Elizabeth Crook's Promised Lands. Much better depiction of the final encounter at San Jacinto. If you liked Gates of the Alamo, I don't think Promised Lands will disappoint."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Harrigan paints a haunting portrait depicting the effect the historical events leading up to the fall of the Alamo, had upon the inhabitans of Texas at that time. Although fictional, &quot;The Gates of The Alamo&quot; is obviously well researched, and presented in a glittering setting of historical accuracy."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The gates of the Alamo is one of the finest examples of historical fiction I have read. Stephen Harrington matches Larry McMurty's characterizations with a historian's sense of fact. The multicultural approach of the battle gives the reader many new perspectives. When the Mexican sharpshooter lost his life at San Jacinto, I felt pain for loosing such a fine character and soldier in the bloodbath that came in the battle. Mary Mott is one of the best heroines I've met in years. Bravo to Stephen Harrington."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I'd confess that I'm addicted to historical fiction. I think that when it is well written, the result can be staggering, not only taking a reader inside a character's mind, but inside a different time and world. This happens to be one of those books. Harrigan retells that old story of the Alamo we all know so well, slipping in enough historical detail to be absolutely convincing, yet never halting the momentum of his book. It reminded me of another piece of historical fiction I'd just finished, The Requiem Shark, both books dealing with hackneyed subjects (the Alamo and Piracy) and yet they're almost as well written as my number one author, Patrick O'Brian. I say almost, because O'Brian is the true king of historical fiction. It doesn't hurt that he wrote for over fifty years, and hopefully Harrigan will be around at least as long."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Having nearly all of my family in San Antonio, I visited the Alamo many times in my childhood, often because my dad wanted to go. Now, as an adult about to visit again, I wanted to find out much more about the area. When my dad suggested this book, I bought it right away, and I was not disappointed. The first two thirds of the book familiarizes the reader with all the characters, both real and fictional, so that when they finally all reach the Alamo, you wish good things for both sides!My husband, a Marine, was pleased with my fascination at what the various troops endured in order to reach the battle site - frostbite, hunger, stench, weariness, just to name a few. On our upcoming trip, I'll be the one asking to go to the Alamo, and maybe on side trips to Gonzales and Goliad, too. Thank you, Steven Harrington, for re-introducing me to my hometown."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I saw some reviews of this book that made me laugh out loud. One of them literally started with something like \\"When I consider the glory that is the Lone Star State...\\" You might imagine this fella did not like this book. He was looking for larger than life legends and myths about fighting for freedom.It is ironic that the chief freedom they fought for at the Alamo was the freedom to own slaves. The Mexican constitution did not allow slavery and the future cotton barons knew they had to gain independence if they were to prosper. This is not dealt with in the novel at all. What is dealt with is the individual fight for freedom inside of the main characters. Those who cannot free themselves from their own inner chains perish tragically. The survivors live on with a new collection of scars and ultimately for those who last long enough the Alamo loses all relevance and becomes the icon of myth that we have still with us today. But before it is all over the reader gets the best account what actually happened at the Alamo that I have seen to date.This book has drawn greatly upon the discoveries and scholarly evidence concerning those fateful events in 1836 that led to Texas breaking away from Mexico. But more than that, it is a book that uses these events leading up to the famous siege as the setting of a truly human novel about the relationship between fictitious characters - characters whose desires and needs, virtues and foibles resonate far beyond their particular surroundings or time. Yes, we are introduced to all the famous characters we have all read about in the history books. They and their fictitious companions are presented with all the imperfections of real people. But they also reveal a down to earth courage that was required to survive on the frontier. And once we get to the Alamo itself the battle is very real and harrowing.When I read this book I had mixed feelings. I had mixed feelings about the fact so much of the story takes place outside of the historical events that made me buy the book. I had mixed feelings about the fact the main plot concerned a widow and her teenage son and the inapproachable naturalist who were all invented by the author. But by the end of the novel these people were as real to me as my own friends. And weeks later I was still thinking about them and haunted by what became of them. That is why I call it a true novel, as it affected me on many levels, some I was completely unaware of until after the experience was over. Years later I still feel that same way about the people that book brought to life.I would recommend this book for anyone who wants some idea of what it would have been like to live on the frontier in the 1830s and for anyone with an interest in what actually happened at the Alamo."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"Brother Alamo Society member Stephen Harrigan set himself a daunting task when he undertook to retell the story of the Alamo in a way that would please general readers and historians and literary critics alike. It has taken me almost two years to work up the nerve to read his long-awaited, painstakingly researched book. It is a pleasure, and a relief, to discover that &quot;The Gates of the Alamo&quot; fully deserves all the praise it has received.As much as the Alamo siege serves to anchor and highlight the story, it is not the sole focus of the plot (and, indeed, only occupies a bare third or so of the book). Harrigan strolls leisurely through the year leading up to the Texas revolution, concentrating on his fictional characters and restricting most of the historical players to walk-on scenes. This is war as seen from ground level, and the primary players are not generals and politicians, but the innocents, bystanders, and journeymen swept up by events set in motion by men who cannot see the end results of what they are doing. One main character, unexpectedly, is an apolitical frontier botanist (Edmund McGowan); another is a widowed Refugio innkeeper, the sensible and resourceful Mary Mott, who is full of scorn for the grandstanding postures of men like the self-mythologizing Travis or Houston. Yet she, too, is carried away by their actions, as is her troubled son Terrell and the quietly courageous McGowan. Their fates remain linked throughout the simmering course of 1835 and, when the Mexican despot Santa Anna arrives with his army to crush the rebel Texians, they find themselves by design or happenstance together at the gates of the Alamo.We experience the hardships of Santa Anna's private soldiers, too, in a way seldom explored by previous writers. Although el Presidente himself and several of his real-life subordinates appear (in brief but memorable scenes), the most finely drawn portraits are those of fictional soldados mexicanos, struggling to survive a brutal campaign and used as pawns by a leader who regards their lives as of no more value than &quot;chickens&quot;. In this way, Santa Anna is perhaps uncomfortably close to some of the more blustering Texian commanders, agitating for an independence that will allow them unfettered pursuit of wealth and land. Harrigan would not be the first to make a subtle point about the common lament (put into these words during the Civil War), &quot;rich man's war; poor man's fight.&quot; We see this most clearly through the eyes of Joe, Travis' slave, a survivalist who suspects his lot is not likely to improve no matter which side prevails.If Alamo commander Travis is inclined to stoke his delusions of Walter Scott-inspired heroics, famous knife-fighter Bowie is occasionally little better than a pirate, albeit a mannered one. Their redeeming virtues are fortitude and courage, and a basic, dogged respect for a rough sort of democracy. The historical figure to come out looking the best to the modern reader is ex-Congressman David Crockett, whose legend is downplayed but whose quick wit and natural leadership qualities are key to holding the beleagured Alamo garrison together.The attention to detail in this novel is tremendous, if perhaps overpowering to some casual readers, and it will reward those who already are familiar with this period and who will recognize many little touches and nuances. Even though much about the Alamo battle itself will forever remain unknown, there is little sense of the invented or the anachronistic in Harrigan's reconstruction. Almost everything rings true, although I wonder if some of the invective is too jarringly contemporary for the 1830s, and Mary Mott may strike some as being a singularly liberated woman for a relatively unliberated time (but not unbelieveably so, since it took toughness to survive on the frontier, something amply demonstrated in Mary's first appearance). I would personally have liked to see some native Bexareno characters, too, for another unique vantage point, or a chapter detailing the Texian attack on Bexar. Some historical events are handled almost *too* casually, as if the author was fearful of invoking cliches badly handled by Hollywood filmmakers: hence no dramatic Crockett arrival at the Alamo, no *deguello* played by the massed Mexican bands during the attack, no line in the sand drawn by Travis (but as Terrell Mott grumbles, &quot;that never happened&quot;).These are minor quibbles, and do little to detract from Harrigan's remarkable accomplishment. The final Mexican assault on the battered San Antonio mission is as powerful as anything ever written about war. The battle of San Jacinto sequence, where the Texians gain their terrible revenge for the massacres of the Alamo and Goliad, is maybe too abbreviated, but can hardly have been anything more than anticlimactic anyway. The book's coda wraps up loose ends and scrolls into the introduction, lending a suitably circular effect. The overall impression it left with me is one of profound sadness; there is a melancholy that suffuses &quot;The gates of the Alamo,&quot; not martial clamor. It is ultimately a book about loss. When Terrell gazes at the facade of the ruined Alamo church, with its empty windows and gaping doorway, he doesn't see the &quot;cradle of Texas liberty&quot;; he pointedly sees the face of a grinning skull. It is a telling moment, and marks this book as a significant contribution to Texas literature."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"I'm not sure why, but Stephen Harrigan has something against Sam Houston. His portrayal of General Houston would be comical if it were not for the fact that thousands of people who read this book will actually believe what he writes as fact.Although Houston was known to be a drunk before and after the war, even those who hated him agreed that he was sober for the duration of the war.His wife in Tennessee left him, not the other way around. It's likely she left him because she was in love with another man and being only 19 she was forced into marriage by her family. She may have also been turned of by Sam Houston's unhealed wound to the groin he suffered in the War of 1812.There is ample evidence that despite what this book says, Houston was not a coward and he did not stand by helplessly as his men ignored his orders to not attack at San Jacinto. If you would do the research most of the lies about him were created by those who opposed him politically. Keep in mind that he supported many unpopular positions from pro-Indian, pro-annexation, anti-secession and while not exactly anti-slavery (he saw an economic need for it in Texas) he was not pro-slavery either (he spoke out against it publicly).Read James L. Haley's Sam Houston to see the real man and ignore the fictional character named Sam Houston in this \\"historical\\" novel."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"All history is subject to interpretation, and reinterpretation. Historical fiction is more amorphous than that: not only is it reinterpreted when the evidence requires it, it's also reinvented when our view of things changes. Fifty or a hundred years ago, the Alamo was defended by universally brave and hardy characters who only wanted freedom for themselves, and they were mercilessly slaughtered by the evil Santa Ana, for no good reason other than that he was bloodthirsty and vicious. Think Disney movie, with John Wayne playing Davy Crockett, dying heroically.Things change, though, and in recent years, the legend of the Alamo has changed somewhat. In some ways, this makes the defenders of the place more heroic: we're much more aware now of the horrors of war than we were in the fifties. On the other hand, the issues that led to the Texas War of Independance are a great deal murkier now than they were back then. The leaders at the battle itself have been revealed elsewhere to be less-than-lily-white, and this of course leads you to question everything else.The present novel is a retelling of the story of this battle, primarily from the point of view of several fictional characters who interact with the various historical personages who really participated in the events. The narrative follows five main characters: the widow innkeeper Mary Mott, and her teenaged son Terrell, a friend of theirs, a botanist named Edwin McGowan, and a pair of Mexican soldiers, a sergeant named Blas and an officer named Telesforo. The novel begins with a very elderly Terrell, late mayor of San Antonio and local hero, attending a celebration of the anniversary of the battle in 1911.The narratives of the Americans involved in the battle are interesting, for the most part, and provide most of the strength for the book. Following Edwin MacGowan and his dog Professor, and Mary and Terrell, is fun, and the descriptions of the other men involved, Crockett (always &quot;David&quot; in the narrative, &quot;Davy&quot; was an invention of the newspapers), Bowie, Travis, and Sam Houston, come across reasonably well, though the author apparently doesn't think much of Houston. There are other, less well-known characters from history, including Travis' slave, a manservant named Joe. The author spends a good deal of time dealing with Joe's dilemma, fighting for &quot;freedom&quot; when Mexico has outlawed slavery. Joe of course wonders if Mexico wins, will he be free, and his eventual decision is interesting.I enjoyed this book, though it was marred by the Mexican half of things. I'm not a racist, I assure you (my wife is half Mexican-American), but the narrative seemed more burdened by the characters than helped by them. The American characters have a connection to the main story and the main historical characters, but Blas (the sergeant) has no connection to any of the other characters in the narrative until the very end of the book and that's only incidental. Telesforo is somewhat more connected to the rest of the plot, but not that much. Also, while there's a considerable build up to the climactic scene, the author seems unsure how to end the book. As a result, after three dozen chapters which are an average of say fifteen pages, there are a bunch of very short ones where he's apparently doing housework, cleaning up after his plot. It's almost as if he got tired of writing, and just concluded things abruptly.While I enjoyed this book, I will agree that the suspense in the plot isn't as strong as it might have been. It's very literary though: the writing is quite good. I agree that it bears comparison with McMurtry, but Harrigan at least pays some attention to history (I've become rather annoyed with McMurtry's indifference to even making events vaguely resemble historical fact) and the book is much the better for it. My comparison would be to Thomas Flanagan's fine novel, The Year of the French. It's not quite as good as Flanagan, but it's still pretty good, and readable."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"POP QUIZ!The purpose of a Good Novel is to:A) Provide reader into insight into themselves, and/or the world around themB) Educate the reader, and pique their curiousity about learning more about a certain subject.C) Allow the reader a temporary escape hatch from the mundaneness world in which they liveD) Entertain the readerE) All of the AboveIf you answered E) All of the above, THE GATES OF THE ALAMO may be the title for you to read. Harrington's novel is an historical novel, set in Texas during the period leading up to the (in)famous Battle of The Alamo. Harrington aptly populates his version of events with an eclectic mixture of realistically portrayed Historical figures such as Jim Bowie, David Crockett, and Santa Ana of Mexico, and characters drawn purely from his rich imagination. He breathes so much life into his fictional characters mainly the widow Mary Mott, her son Terrell and botonist Edmund MgGovern that they are as real as the historical figures on the pages in the readers' eyes.This novel is an excellent character study. The ending is obvious, for anyone familiar enough with history to know what happened at the Alamo, but Harrington keeps the reader glued to the pages, by making them care enough about the fates of the Motts and Edmund to be eager to read this epic tome until the dramatic conclussion. Yet it is also more than a character study, in describing his characters so richly Harrington provides insight into many motivations of the human race thus providing insight into the readers' and others psyche. On top of successfully doing this he also details lush descriptions of landscape, and settings transporting whoever reads this novel into Texas at the battle for the Alamo.Powerful storytelling is bandied about way too frequently, but it applies to THE GATES OF THE ALAMO."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"When I want pure history, I look for a history book packed with the hard facts as they are known about an event. What I look for in historical fiction is a work that remains faithful to the hard facts, but allows me to enter an earlier world at a more emotional level. History books give me an amber-tinted photograph while historical fiction brings those static faces to life. The best historical fiction bring voices and colors to a lost time and that is what Stephen Harrigan's Gates of the Alamo did for me.It took a little time to warm to, but in the end, I became engrossed in the lives of the 'Texians' and Mexicans whom Harrigan brings to the forefront of his story. His interpretations of the various reasons for different people to be at the Alamo had a ring of truth to them that cut through the myths surrounding the event. By the end of the book, I felt that I had a better grasp on the historical Alamo, but perhaps more tellingly, I cared about the fates of Harrigan's people.Harrigan artfully recreates that lost time in a moving work of historical fiction. I recommend it highly whether you are interested in the history of Texas, in an adventurous tale of the Old West, or simply in subtly textured tales of love and devotion."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"The Gates of the Alamo represents the telling of a period of history known only for the bravery of the men associated with their death at the Alamo. This book puts a human dimension to that bravery as well as the bravery and hardships of the Mexican troops under the ever political Santa Anna. It brings to life the conflicts of the time as well as documented facts about the battle itself that normally escapes the average person who focuses only on the glory and the sanitized John Wayne version. I for one learned more than I had anticipated by reading the book."},{"Title":"The Gates of the Alamo","review":"A mostly excellent, obviously well-researched historical novel, though it gets off to a somewhat slow start.The book's centerpiece, the battle of the Alamo, is -- once you finally get to it -- extremely effective and compelling. Because of Harrigan's approach to laying the historical background and developing his fictional characters, the novel does get off to a rather slow start. I did have a couple of my personal quibbles. First, I'd hoped and expected -- largely because of the book's sheer length -- for a bit more of an epic look at the whole Texas Revolution. Instead, the battle of Gonzales barely gets mentioned, the first siege of San Antonio happens offstage and the reader only encounters the aftermath -- albeit very effectively presented -- of Goliad. (The battle of San Jacinto is also given fairly brisk treatment, but that's not wholly inappropriate, given that it was a quite brief battle.) I don't think this should deter anyone from reading the book;I mention it mainly because knowing this in advance might head off any disappointment with the novel's scope. My second quibble is that I really felt Harrigan was much too negative in his depiction of one of it's nonfictional characters: Sam Houston. I think Houston was a smarter and braver man than depicted in this book (though I admit it probably gets his degree of personal vanity about right)."},{"Title":"The Turkish letters of Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, imperial ambassador at Constantinople, 1554-1562","review":"This is an amazing read from an amazing era.

Lethbridge is the author of numerous books, ranging from pre-history and archaeology to witchcraft and I suppose what we could call the paranormal. I first came across his work in the writings of Colin Wilson (an English author who introduced me to many obscure writings such as these), in connection with the paranormal, and I managed to find a copy of \\"The Essential T. C. Lethbridge\\" over time. I think this book, which was released posthumously as a sort of tribute to the writer, is an interesting indication of the man's depth, which was considerable, yet the original works are far more interesting still.Two of my favourites are \\"Herdsmen and Hermits\\" and \\"The Painted Men\\" and for anyone interested in the pre-history of the British Isles, up until the Viking age in about 1000 AD, they are wonderful reading. Lethbridge was recognised as an archaeologist but he always had the most difficult time getting on with the establishment, since he refused to tow the line on accepted history. Therefore he was always working somewhat on his own, without the support of a major institution and its a wonder he managed to make his way as he did, and publish so much.The other Lethbridge connection which has been of interest to me, is with the Canadian writer Farley Mowat. Although they never met, they were contemporaries and one wonders what the result might have been had they worked on projects jointly. In any case, Mowat eventually discovered Lethbridge's writing and found support for some of his own rather contentious theories about the maritime movements of peoples in northern Britain toward the Americas, before the Viking age. Mowat's book on the subject, \\"The Farfarers,\\" in which he draws on Lethbridge's \\"Herdsmen and Hermits,\\" is one of the most interesting books about early North American exploration I've come across. However, there is no doubt that the scientific community views both writers as being outside the pale.All that is to say that Lethbridge is well worth finding. He reads very well today, although his subject matter is naturally specialised and it is not, I suppose for the general reader. One hopes one day that the important works of writers like T. C. Lethbridge will be brought back into print. In the meantime, good hunting."},{"Title":"The Captive Flesh (Black Lace)","review":"This is a far better-than-average erotic adventure set in that ever-popular exotic location: the harem. What sets this book apart is the quality of writing by author Cleo Cordell, and the emphasis on the psychological reactions of the heroine to her situation. The man who has imprisoned her sets out to seduce her rather than simply overpower her, and in fact the two never have intercourse in this story. Which is not to say there's not a lot of sexual tension, sensual delights, and a few sex scenes. . . . but Cordell is aiming for a different kind of impact than what is provided by a more traditional novel of sex-scene after sex-scene.

In most of the rooms he captures a feeling that it's lived in, a part of someone's daily life. Some books I own on Asian design don't have this quality: the rooms either appear too staged or the photographer gives them a sterile feeling. I could recommend this book on the photos alone.The text is not quite up to standards of the photos, but it's acceptable. The author, Sharon Leece, obviously knows her subject, but she often lapses into blurb-style. For example, she writes on one house: \\"The words colourful, extravagent, and opulent can hardly begin to describe the palatial home of Contrasts Gallery owner Pearl Lam.\\"Another fun aspect of this book is that the places it showcases aren't just the homes of wealthy individuals. You see not only the more than 13,000 square foot Manhattan apartment of Chinese antiquities dealer Robert Hatfield Ellsworth, with its numerous expensive Chinese antiques, but you also get to see how some people with obviously much smaller budgets still managed to design their home with a unique Chinese flavor."},{"Title":"China Style","review":"Reading this was a pleasant surprise, but what impresses most about this beautifully-designed book is not that it opens up all the elements of Chinese style and how its used in modern living -which it does in a interesting way.But that it includes homes of most of the foremost China antiques dealers/collectors in the world.Probably for the first time ever in print, we can see photographs of the homes of China experts Grace Wu Bruce in Hong Kong, Robert Ellsworth in New York (his is the biggest single apartment in Manhattan, apparently) and Kai-Yin Lo in Hong Kong.That this book features their private homes shows they must have given their backing to this book - making it more than another stunning Style book.Overall, this is a luxurious, well put-together book with aninteresting selection of beautiful apartments from many Cities. Recommended for anyone interested in things Chinese."},{"Title":"China Style","review":"A wide range of (mostly) rather luxurious rooms filled with everything and anything Chinese. But you won't find much of authentic traditional chinese homes here (and indeed the dustjacket clearly announces this). Although the rooms are sometimes packed with Chinese things, they almost all still feel western/international/chinese, mixed in different proportions. That said, the photos are great and it's a joy to visit all these apartements and houses and select your favourites. Since each place only gets two (or three) spreads generally, a string of different locations can be presented and you're invited to more rooms and settings than anyone can digest at one read-through. And that's great, you can return again and again to this very rich book."},{"Title":"China Style","review":"Chinese art, architecture and design has a long history and blends many elements from a tradition of wooden courtyard structures, evolving to blend different styles.

Eric Gruen has written of &#65533;The World of the Citizen in Republican Rome: \\"it is far and away the best examination of the fabric of social and political life in the Roman Republic\\".Need to know more? Maybe not, if you are like me, what Gruen thinks is close to gospel. But if you do? Okay. Here we go.So much of what we read of Rome is a history of the rich, the famous, the powerful. Yet Nicolet notes that this \\"political class\\" never numbered above FIFTEEN HUNDRED individuals at any given time. It was Nicolet's objective, however, to \\"analyse Roman political life at the level of...civic grass-roots\\". And Nicolet's understanding of this sphere is encyclopaedic. The only time I have encountered erudition on this scale was in Gruen&#65533;s \\"Last Generation of the Roman Republic\\" and in Ronald Syme's \\"The Roman Revolution\\". In fact, this book should be read alongside, but after I think, both of these booksThe book is, however, long. And it is NOT exactly a stroll in the park. It can be difficult but highly rewarding reading. However, it is not only for the academic reader either. It is filled with fascinating and at times surprising revelations. For example, I never, EVER, thought I would willingly, and not under duress, read a chapter on anything to do with taxation. Here I learned that Roman citizens were, for long periods of their history, free from direct taxation. They considered it a badge of servitude. What taxes they paid were intermittent and for the most part both proportionate AND progressive. Roman taxation was \\"civic\\", to use Nicolet's term, and not permanent. It was not until the burdens of the civil wars and the apparatus of Augustus' military state created such extraordinary demands on the public purse that Roman finances evolved from a civic to a monarchic system. Until then, they were a painful, intermittent necessity, regarded as a counterpart to the citizen's privileges.The Romans also developed a hitherto unheard of and entirely original conception of citizenship. It was not a dual citizenship per se, but rather a \\"citizenship on two levels...that bore within it the notion of cosmopolis&#65533;. It was a potent rival of Augustine&#65533;s Civitas Dei, and the ecumenism at its core was co-opted by the catholic tradition\\". Nicolet explains how it gave to Rome the moral structure and the political robustness to survive for centuries in a roiling and troubled world. Conquered peoples prized Roman citizenship above almost anything else; and the Romans shared citizenship in their nation freely, often enfranchising entire races or nations in one feel swoop. This was a stunning feature of the culture and in this, they were unique in history.Then there is the census. Again, who would have thought THIS could be interesting. But it is. I had literally no idea that the census was, with little exaggeration, the backbone of Roman society -- its ideological underpinnings skilfully balancing timocratic and aristocratic interests. It was called \\"proportional\\", meaning that \\"each individual's rights and duties conformed, so to speak to a constant ratio&#65533;.Rights and duties were relegated to the classification of citizens according to their wealth and acknowledged valour and practically nothing else.\\"In fact, however, there WAS something else -- morality. The censors operated on the principal that a bad man can not be a good citizen. Thus, \\"the census was also a moral and political operation, the fountain of honour\\". This proportional equality, created by the institution of the census, was regarded as a \\"factor of social cohesion\\", helping to bring about consensus within the polity.As much as anything else, this book will teach you what we OWE to the Romans. In this regard, the conclusion is worth reading by itself.It is important for us to recall that the Roman juridical regime guaranteed ALL citizens equality before the law. Nicolet writes, \\"the other great collective interest [of Roman society] was freedom&#65533;[and] equality before the law. Provided this was assured, social and political inequalities were held of no account. The status of a citizen continued to be the indispensable and sufficient guarantee of this form of freedom. This was symbolised and guaranteed by the appeal to Caesar, which descended directly from the appeal to the people, and above all by the codification of laws. Until the middle of the second century AD, Roman citizens, who were steadily increasing in numbers, felt equal before the law even if they shared a condition of political servitude, which on the whole they did not much mind. This essential acquisition was eclipsed during the long centuries of the Germanic Middle Ages; but it was never lost, and has re-emerged triumphantly in the modern world. We are all Roman citizens\\".The one regret? That this appears to be the only one of Nciolet&#65533;s many books to have been translated into English."},{"Title":"The World of the Citizen in Republican Rome","review":"Claude Nicolet's \\"The World of the Citizen in Republican Rome\\" is a work of fine scholarship demonstrating the author's thourough understanding of the subject and his consideration for his audience. It is a work of which its depth of information, organization, and fluid writing will appeal to scholars and casual readers alike.The magnificant aspect of Nicolet's works is that he strikes the right balance with erudition and comprehension. His book's narrative prose covers very precise details as to Roman culture and its institutions with a socio-political emphasis more than anything else. The book explains how Romans perceived civitas as a public duty either as commoners or aristocrats: his narrative focuses more on the aristocratic elite than the proletariat. Nicolet explains the progression of public and private institutions as well as religious ones: how people's participation in them affected Roman individual citizens. His work is so elaborate and substantiated that even Erich Gruen, one of the leading scholars on the Roman Republic, found this expansive work to be excellently detailed and authoritative.Overall, this is book is more a shcolarly work but its prose makes it not too weighed in erudition to not appeal to the general reader. It's quite exhaustive as to the subjects it covers as well as thourough in their analysis. I strongly recommend this work."},{"Title":"Butler's Battlin' Blue Bastards","review":"The book has a good story to tell..about a unit that won the Presidential Unit Citation for its activities during the Battle of the Bulge.

He served in the tradition of his fore-bearers, including General John \\"Mac\\" Alexander McClernand who was commissioned by President Abraham Lincoln. He served and inspired his men, and this book tells the story ably and humbly. That their unit was the only one not to give ground during the Battle of the Bulge is ample testimony of Col. Butler's leadership. (The book reports that at times enemy artillery came in from nearly all points of the compass.)In my opinion this book describes in vivid detail why our citizen-soldiers won the war against the professional soldiers of Germany. This is a great read for an up-close perspective on one ordinary man's willingness to give all for his men and his country.In reunions after the war, the men showed their continued loyalty and respect for Mac when they presented him with a plaque commemorating the \\"Battlin' Blue Bastards.\\""},{"Title":"FRED HOYLES UNIVERSE","review":"Fred Hoyle was one of the most distinguished and at the same time the most controversial scientists of the twentieth century. He was also a quite popular author of science fiction novels, a popular radio announcer on the BBC -- a true renaissance man.His scientific achievements consisted of pioneering work in areas like the radioactivity in stars that produce all of the heavy elements which when subsequently blown into space and collected into planets become the stuff out of which we are all made. He also did fundamental research into some of the practical problems facing the use of Radar during World War II.The biggest controversy came from his support of the steady state theory of the cosmos rather than the Big Bang. Not only did he support steady state, he continued his support long after it became discarded by the mainstream of science. In fact, his last book, published just before his death continued steady state support and further annoyed most of the scientists with a photograph of a flock of geese blindly following one another representing the failure of the big-banger's to even consider an alternate approach.This book is essentially a biography, but it also gives a good look into the world of science in the last century.

All the lyrics are wonderful and the songs have a wonderful tune too. It is neat to be able to read all the lyrics and all the spoken words. The original cast recording of this musical has some of the spoken words, but not near all of them. It is a nice way to re-live the experience. I highly reccomend this book.

A first-person account of experiences in a era long gone, a time in our history seeking to fathom a new land, a time of growing clash between fundamentally different cultures... and Mr. Russell puts you right there on the frontline. You join him at the beginning of his new livelihood in the unknown, and you stay with him, growing in experience and weathering within the raw western realm. The writing is often crude, but his thoughts are hardly so and the total package bursts forth as a true rarity in literature. I consider this journal to be an equal to the recordings of Lewis and Clark, and practically moreso given the fact that it is really the efforts of a lone individual. He was not paid to keep this record, and although he always hoped to see it published, it did not go to print until long after his death, and then only first released in a limit of 100 copies. Aubrey Haines does great tribute to this admirable man by undertaking the task of retracing Mr. Russell's journies and providing us with the maps needed to help us follow him. Working from the original handwritten manuscript housed in The William Robertson Coe Collection of Western Americana at Yale University, Mr. Haines' efforts represent the single most important element in getting this work to the people, and he has done us a great service here in preventing this journal from drifting into obscurity. If you are curious as to what a life was like in a land before McDonalds, MTV, shopping malls, and SuperBowl Sundays, then I suggest you pick up a copy of this jewel and park yourself along with Mr. Russell next to that campfire with its golden sparks wafting up toward that diamond-studded yonder. You will be all the better for it."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"I am a wildlife biologist working in part of the area where Osborne Russell traveled.

If you are a buckskinner, living historian, trapper or just an old west history buff then this is a MUST have!"},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"This well-known and highly-regarded account of the life of a fur trapper in the Rocky Mountain West was born as a corrective by its author of an earlier narrative (Pattie's PERSONAL NARRATIVE) that he thought was filled with inaccuracies. Osborne Russell spent eight years as a trapper in the employ of a number of fur companies before becoming an independent trapper working out of Fort Hall. Fortunately, when he first went to the mountains with Nathaniel Wyeth's expedition in 1834, he began to keep a journal. From his journal he compiled a manuscript for publication; it's from this manuscript that the present book is based on. Osborne had a tendency to run sentences together and to practice unconventional language usage, all of which editor Aubrey Haines retains in this edition. One quickly gets used to it, however.Russell was an acute observer and, especially in describing his travels, was careful to mention distances and names (streams, mountains, etc.) when possible. Haines has been able to trace Russell's travels accurately, and ten accompanying maps illustrate his wanderings. (Haines's annotations are also numerous and thorough.) He trapped for a time with Jim Bridger, and some of what we've learned about him has direct bearings on Russell's journal accounts. In fact, Russell's book is the major source of information for a number of important events in the Rockies during this time. He also writes about the Indians (especially the Crows, Blackfeet, and Snakes) and much about the animals found in the West. Most of all, he tries hard to convey the life of a trapper - scouting the country, the laying of traps, hunting for game, dealing with the weather and terrain, the rendezvous experience (Russell attended six of them) - all the everyday routines trappers went through. This indeed is the most valuable thing about the book. Russell left the mountains in 1842 and settled in Oregon City; after an unsuccessful run for governor in 1845, he wrote his manuscript for JOURNAL OF A TRAPPER. He got the gold fever in 1848 and went to California, where he became a merchant. After his partner ran off with the company funds, Russell spent the rest of his life trying to pay off the creditors. He died near Placerville in 1892.This is a must-read book for anyone interested in the fur trade period of the trans-Mississippi West. It's gone through many editions and always seems to stay in print, thank heaven. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"I was in high school growing up on the Snake river Plain in Idaho when I read this book. I had to take a summer school course on Idaho history and this was our text, we spent the summer reading this book and then traveling to many of the locations in it and experiencing first hand the sights and sounds of the story. It was a great experiance and it has stayed with me ever since. If you live in this area or are just interested in this kind of story I highly reccomend this book."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"This is one of the my favorite books. The writer was not only a tough grizzled mountain man but a pretty good writer considering he kept a 12 year journal while travelling around the West fighting indians and trapping beaver.We took the book and went to Yellowstone and retraced the route of 1 year of the dairy. The writing is so discriptive, we could actually follow his route by landmarks. It was the best vacation we ever took.This book is a must for western history buffs!"},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was never one of the elite of the Mountain Men. He spent most of his time in the mundane tasks of cooking, cleaning, and other camp chores while on trapping expeditions. But he wrote one of the best accounts -- certainly one of the most accurate -- of the peregrinations and the exciting events in the life of a Mountain Man. Osborne was in the Northern Rockies between 1834-1943 and was a minor participant in many expeditions and fights with the Blackfeet.Editor Haines has compiled the routes of Russell's travel in 10 maps and added explanatory notes to his narrative. However, a lot more could be done to make this book more readable. First, there are no chapter or paragraph divisions to ease the task of the reader. It's even hard to keep track of what year Russell is talking about. Secondly, there is room for many, many more footnotes and explanations of what Russell was doing and when and where.We need a new edition of Russell's work which will make it more accessible to the reader. This old edition is invaluable if you are a student of the Mountain Man, but the casual reader will bog down.Smallchief"},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"A remarkable firsthand account of how it was back in the 1830's to early 1840's to be a fur trapper/trader in the Rocky Mountains.

Well written by a resourceful and charming individualist."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Trappers were the first to blaze a trail across the wild frontier west of the Mississippi. Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper edited by Aubrey L Haines is a first-person must have account for fur trade enthusiasts whether those who read of the era or those who re-enact.Russell's first hand comments, descriptions and discourse concerning the time, the topography, the wildlife and life in general provide a peek into the area we know as Wyoming, Montana, Idaho and Oregon long before settlement took place by the pioneers. Russell's book provides much information regarding many of the events in the Rockies during this time. Russell was a discriminating observer who was careful to mention distances, directions, who he was with and names of physical locations, as well as animals, topography and the like in his writing. He describes other fur traders, including some of the 'big' names we know from history, as well as providing description of many Native People in the area; particularly Snake also known as the Shoshones, the Blackfeet and Crow.The hardships faced by the first whites into the country far from the -civilized- East Coast is documented, as Russell provides insight into the Native people already living in the area, and the mountain men who made their way to the Rockies.Russell lived the time of the 1830s and 40s as a fur trapper/trader in the Rocky Mountains he set down a journal to record his thoughts, impressions and what he saw, in doing so he has provided a realistic depiction for those who have interest, but no first hand knowledge. He was not one of the lauded of history, rather he was a simple man, who described in detail the day to day life, survival, excitement and events of the time.Joining an expedition heading into the Mountains during the mid-1800's acquired the skills essential for survival in the mountains, and kept his journal recounting the last days of the beaver trapping era of the Mountain Men who have appeared in movies, stories and books.Rather than the romanticizing of events as is prone in Hollywooded up movies Russell listed the typical commonplace tasks of cooking, cleaning, and other camp chores which all Mountain Men performed while on trapping expeditions and in doing so he offers true insight into what it was that made these men leave the comfort and safety offered in the towns and homes of the Eastern Coastline to tramp out into untried, little known areas where privations were many and ease was hard to come by. He told of laying traps and hunting for game, of scouting the country, and problems that came from weather and terrain, and he described the rendezvous which was the highlight of the fur trapper year as men carried their furs to be traded or sold, re-supplied their food stores, enjoyed the company of others for a short time before returning to the mountains. Russell himself attended six rendezvous before he left the mountains for good.He told of the travels and the exhilarating episodes of the life experienced by the fur trappers. Trapping for beaver in the Northern Rockies between 1834-1943 Osborne took part in a number of expeditions in addition to battles with the Blackfeet who were less than thrilled to find the white men on their hunting grounds.Editor Haines has set down the routes of travel taken by Russell as 10 maps in addition to adding clarifying notes to his account. The maps are scattered throughout the text. Without chapter or paragraph divisions to aid the reader the journal is set down pretty much as a man might do in his own journal.At times it takes a little digging to figure exactly where or when an event is taking place. On the other hand, a true devotee of the era should have no trouble muddling through, as is done when reading the originals of many of the old journals of the time. Leaving the journal pretty much intact in the newer edition provides the reader a better feel for the man and his writing than might be accomplished were the text -cleaned up- with modern paragraph breaks and the like.The landscape of the area changed so much during the decade Osborne describes. Disease, in particular small pox, alcohol, and loss of lifestyle are the depressing legacy left for the Native People. Reading of the decline of populations of Native Americans, beaver in particular, but all fur bearing critters and the near disappearance of buffalo leads the reader on to the last journal entries as the reader follows Osborne. He grimly describes the plunge in buffalo populations and the approaching finish of the fur quest as beaver populations dwindled, the European desire for the fur declined and other furbearers were becoming more profitable.Born in Maine in 1814, Osborne Russell left home at sixteen, and became a fur trapper when he was seventeen. He spent eight years as a trapper working for several of the big fur companies before becoming an independent trapper working out of Fort Hall on the Snake River. Opportunely for us, when Osborne first went to the mountains with Nathaniel Wyeth's expedition in 1834 at age twenty, he began keeping his journal.After leaving the mountains in 1843 to settle in the Willamette Valley in Oregon Osborne used his journal to compile a manuscript for publication. From that manuscript the present book has been built. Osborne wrote in the fashion of the day, despite Samuel Johnson's 1755 dictionary; spelling rules had not yet been standardized as hard and fast, and writers often used a variety of spelling in the same text. Osborne had a tendency to run sentences together and to present unusual language usage, plus, Osborne as journalists then and now tended to abbreviate and use his own form of shorthand, all of which editor Aubrey Haines has kept in this text. Reader's quickly gets used to it Osborne's style and his style is what makes the text such interesting reading.Working from the original handwritten manuscript housed in The William Robertson Coe Collection of Western Americana at Yale University, Aubrey Haines' edition represents one man's enormous effort for getting Osborne's work to the people. For a step back to life as it was before the Interstate, McDonalds, shopping malls, and rockets in space, Osborne Russell's Journal of a Trapper can carry the reader to the open clear sky of the Rocky Mountains and to the camp of the fur traders who were an important component of our collective history. Excellent read, excellent resource, Happy to recommend.Molly MartinReviewer"},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was the real article: a respondent to Ashley's famous advertisement \\"to enterprising young men\\", Russell was one of the few who both survived and wrote about the experience. His life as a trapper was an enviable one, for he both survived and thrived in his nine years in the mountains, and those experiences stood him in good stead for the remainder of his life as a frontiersman in Oregon and California. However, his writings consist primarily of an uninspired travelogue: spend two weeks trapping on this creek, then three weeks on this other creek, then crossed the divide and descended this river to that fort, then spent two weeks trapping that river, etc. There are a few good yarns mixed in and he met many famous people, but you'll find more yarns, better told, and more insights, and better biography, in other books. If you've read a dozen good books about the mountain men, then you should add Russell to your list, but first you should readA Majority of Scoundrels: An Informal History of the Rocky Mountain Fur Company, which is fantastic, and alsoAcross the Wide Missouri, equally so, even though they were both written by modern authors. If you want an eyewitness account, then your first stop should beTough Trip Through Paradise, 1878-1879, one of the best books about a mountain man's life by anybody, from anywhen. You'll also want to check outMountain Men and Fur Traders of the Far West: Eighteen Biographical Sketchesto get some more background on some of these characters, and after that, you'll probably want to read more about the likes of Jed Smith, Jim Bridger, John Coulter and Hugh Glass (who came closer than any other man to getting et by a grizzly without actually dying) before you turn to the relatively humdrum life of Osborne Russell. So, to sum it up, I'd trade moccasins with Osborne any day, but there are better tales in store from other mountain men."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"The trapper's journal by Osbourne Russell during the early to mid 18 hundreds came as a bit of a surprise. First the book is a factual account without any explication of the events more than is necessary. It is not told as an adventure story eg &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; but rather as a journal pure and simple of the travels through the Rockies, mainly Yellowstone, of this young trapper over 9 years in the pay and as a member of Jim Bridger's fur company, around 100 men. The trade was at its peak at this time. As is true of most journals it is full of abbreviations of words because of time constraints eg brot. for brought, staid for stayed etc. This gives the impression of crudity in the writing, or of a man not used to writing but rather writing in only a haphazard fashion. Every reader knows how easy it is to loose all the fine points of writing when it is not practised constantly. The journal is full of place names and directions of travel and a few maps indicating the progress of the trappers. There is some description of the scenery and the Indians of the area eg Blackfoot which are a constant threat, Shoshones (Snake), Bonnack and Crow. Occasionaly I was pleasantly surprised by paragraphs of eloquence and beauty mixed in with the simplistic writing which was the norm. Russell was capable of very good writing when he was inspired or wished to do so. This is also demonstrated by his letters to his sisters which are written with great style and few grammatical errors, completely unlike his journals.There is much which comes to the fore in regard to the period eg the waste and destruction as the parties of trappers even in groups as small as 3 wonder the countryside and simply kill a Bison Cow for a meal and then discard it, or just take the tongue to eat. Incredible disregard for nature is shown at times. The trapper is in continual fear of Blackfoot war parties who harrass them, both white and Indian, constantly. In one instance an enormous group of Blackfeet, thought to number up to 1000 or more by Russell, attempt to eradicate the entire group of Bridger's trappers, about 100. They decide not to due to an unfavourable (omen) display of Northern lights. Even in his day as the story nears the end of the 9 years Russell tells of the scarcity of Buffalo which were not wiped out in total until 1870 or so (80 million -&gt; 1000). Its almost as if it comes upon them suddenly, &quot;5 years ago thousands crossed the valleys of the Yellowstone, now its hard to find any&quot;. Russell even becomes a little conservationist in spirit when he states that maybe its time for the white man to leave this country because the wildlife has been so denuded.An interesting book but with far too few passages describing the trapper's feeling along the way."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Osborne Russell paints a heartbreakingly beautiful image of America. What a poignant picture he paints of the buffalo herds and visions of sheep covering the snow capped mountains that he climbed to overlook other endless mountain ranges and prairies rolling as far as they eye could see against the ski, bountiful game and untouched, pristine valleys that may not yet have been visited by any white man. He must have provided some of the earliest information about Yellowstone Park. About an Indian tribe coming to the fort to trade, erecting hundreds of tepees outside the fort -- try to picture what an amazing sight that must have been. What a thoughtful man and unusual life he led. As I was reading this book, I kept thinking of a line from Dances with Wolves, where Kevin Costner's character says that he wants to go to the West because he wants to see the Frontier before its gone forever. I oftentimes wondered what life would be like back then, the people, the untouched areas that are now covered by cities and highways...People and their way of life back then interest me because I wondered if they were at all like us, given their life situations but people are the same in some respects no matter what the era, I noticed this on Page 20 \\"...Here a dispute arose about the part of the country we were in. Our Leader maintained that this was a branch of the Yellow Stone River but some of the trappers had been in this valley before and knew it to be a branch of Wind River, pointed out their old encampments and the beaver lodges where they had been trapping 2 years previous. But our man at the helm was inflexible, he commanded the party and had a right to call the streams by what means he pleased as a matter of course this was called the Yellow Stone. Three of the party however called it Wind River and left us but not before one of them had given our Charge d'affairs a sound drubbing about some small matters of little importance to any one but themselves...\\" Sounds like some of todays's workplaces. Other books I've read made passing references to fur trappers but I never appreciated the rugged, dangerous lives they lived. Theres a poignancy about the solitary existence of an individual fur trapper, going days or weeks without encountering another human in the wilderness. This is a great, great piece of American literature thats surely overlooked but priceless and unforgettable."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"An ongoing account over a nine-year period in the 1800s by a trapper who moved from area to area in the region encompassing (now) Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks, north into Glacier National Park and west into Idaho. It was interesting to compare this account with the book &#34;Grizzly Years&#34; by Doug Peacock, which takes place about a hundred years later. In &#34;Journal of a Trapper&#34; the area is teeming with buffalo, elk, deer, wolves, and grizzly bears, and there are friendly, unpredictable and warlike Indians. A hundred years later, the Indians are essentially gone; there are only the descendants of the original buffalo, the bison, in certain areas; and far fewer of the other wild animals. Of necessity, because the book is essentially a journal, the writing can be a little repetitious. Understanding this, I found it a very interesting book."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"I bought this book for myself but I sit and read in spurts and haven't read enough of this book at one time to really say that it will hold my attention."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Osborne Russell spent about a decade in the fur trade traipsing around the Rocky Mountain West in the 1830s-40's. His journal is wonderfully written and gives the reader a sense of this unique living around the larger area that today encompasses the Grand Tetons and Yellowstone. All this of course was in pursuit of the beaver, the commodity that first opened up the West in the wake of Lewis and Clark's journey.An adventurous soul, Russell signed up to trap beaver when the West was still raw and new. His journal is a remarkable account of living off the land, encounters with Indians, relations with fellow trappers and mountain men and the wild lands that today encompass northern Utah, western Wyoming and Eastern Idaho and southern Montana. A few well-known mountain men make an appearance and Russell spent some time in Jim Bridger's party which for me made an interesting tie-in. Today's reader will marvel at his life of camping in rugged terrain and living off the land - including cold, snow and rain - for more than a decade (although winters were relieved somewhat by stays in rudimentary forts or encampments). Meals seemed to be plentiful as the buffalo and elk were thick. The area is well drained so water was hardly ever an issue and there are other vegetable sources of food. It is interesting though to read of daily meals of game taken by the hunt. Not a daily occurrence since a buffalo could be dressed and meat packed for a group that would last several days, but almost every time he wanted or needed more food it involved dropping a buffalo, elk, mountain sheep or occasional bear. I like meat as much as the next red blooded guy, but I wondered while reading what a decade of game eating would be like. Steak for breakfast, lunch and dinner; repeat, repeat.Russell's journal contains a lot of entries describing movements, such as: \\"went 13 mls around the mountain and crossed 25 Yard River and encamped.\\" It is, after all a journal. But the gems of this book are his occasional descriptions of the land in all its solitude and beauty - an impression that didn't fail to move this mountain man even after he had been years in the wild. Russell had run-ins with Indians - some friendly, some poor and pitied, some encountered in battle at the end of a gun (which usually described his interactions with the hostile Blackfoot tribe). His fellow trappers were also not to be trusted entirely, as Russell states at one point that trappers as they broke away from the trail in pursuit of streams in which to hunt often wouldn't share with each other exactly where they were going or how far up they were setting traps due to the competitive nature of the beaver hunt.I am constantly astounded at the ability of these early-in travelers to navigate the land and make circuits of hundreds of miles that eventually wind their way to a meeting place or encampment. Although the journal describes occasional forays up a creek or river mistaken for another one, Russell and his fellow travelers seemed very adept at knowing where they were and where they were going over a vast expanse of relatively untrammeled land.The editor (Aubrey Haines) does a very good job of providing biographical and setting information in a helpful forward. He also has an exhaustive series of footnotes and maps (about 10) of the journalist's travels. As the names of mountains, holes and rivers were not settled and have changed to some extent in modern times, these notes are very helpful in placing the trapper's locations on the contemporary map. Particularly if a reader has been over the Grand Teton and Yellowstone area, the notes and maps will take one to places often visited by travelers to the area today through Osborne Russell's eyes (for example, Russell several times camped near the present day location of the Lake Hotel on Lake Yellowstone, a place where I have stayed and can picture readily).I liked this book a lot and it will please anyone who likes to read of mountain men, exploration or the area. The entries have been preserved in Russell's format, so punctuation is not observed to the extent it would be in a professional writing and the entries often run together in long, paragraph-less pages, but I got used to the format fairly quickly and it did tend to lend authentication to the work as I was constantly able to envision this trapper making his entries around the campfire with a pencil stub on well folded manuscript."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"Osborne Russell was a New England born man who left to find his destiny in the Rocky Mountains in the 1830s and 1940s. He spent 9 years living with friendly Indians, trapping, riding, fighting hostile Indians, working for various fur companies, and keeping a daily diary.This book is his (basically) unedited diary, and it's a treasure. It's hard to read because it's basically a hundred-page long paragraph without much punctuation. It tells of temperatures, and distances, and describes the wonders of Yellowstone. It talks of hunting and cooking, huge herds of buffalo, suffering in winter, the Rendezvous the Mountain Men are famous for, and his fellow mountain men. Punctuation aside, it's one of the most authentic accounts of the trapper days I've ever read.Most useful are the footnotes in the back of the book, which the editor added to help explain places and people Russell refers to. There are also many maps and reproductions of paintings by Charles Russell (no relation to the author) and others which set the tone for the book. I also enjoyed the biography of Osborne Russell, added by the editor, which prefaced the diary part of the book.As you read this book, you will see his attitude towards wildlife change. At first he was happy to shoot multiple buffalo and only take choice parts. Towards the end he writes about the way the Indians kill only what they can use, and that perhaps white men should move on before all the wildlife is gone.When Russell decided to leave the mountains, he wrote a beautiful poem (included in this book) which portrays a gentle, romantic side of the man that wasn't apparent in the rough and tumble of his diary. And the inclusion of some personal letters he wrote to family back East round out the whole picture of his personality.I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves reading about the Old West, the Mountain Men, or historical diaries."},{"Title":"Osborne Russell's Journal of a trapper","review":"I have been an avid reader of American history, especially that related to mountain men and Western exploration.

The book focuses on the strategic importance of Colombia's mining and energy sectors to explain how powerful interests have conspired to wreak havoc on the lives of workers and the environment.In the Introduction, Aviva Chomsky contends that intervention by the U.S. into Colombia's affairs is driven by the need to secure corporate profits by preserving social inequality. We learn how Colombia's corrupt ruling class has partnered with major transnational corporations to exploit its labor and resources largely for the benefit of the few.The Prologue by Javier Giraldo is a passionate indictment of the violence inflicted upon Colombian human rights and labor activists by the Colombian military and private paramilitaries. Mr. Giraldo paints a damning portrait of an entire nation that appears to have lost its moral compass through its wholesale servitude to the interests of capital.Mr. Cuellar's description of how native peoples have been dispossessed of their lands is reminiscent of the movie \\"The Rundown\\". Multinational corporations have been granted privileges by the Colombian state within specially-designated economic zones where civil liberties have been suspended and rule is enforced by paramilitary force. Through such arrangements, international investors and corporations such as Conquistador Mines, Exxon-Mobil and Harken Energy have been allowed to extract Colombia's wealth at criminally low tax rates.Mr. Cuellar urgently requests support from the international community to help end the violence in his country. The author notes that U.S. military aid has been mainly directed to the mining and energy economic zones, suggesting that the so-called Drug War is in actuality a front for the repression of human rights. As the President of Sintraminercol, a union representing workers in Colombia's mining industry, Mr. Cuellar provides many pages of footnotes, documentation and statistics to help support his claims and lends credibility to the story."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The message and instruction contained in this book is vital to the walk of those wishing to follow Christ.

Apart from a great recommendation, this 50 yr. old book would have been overlooked. Watchman Nee had a knack for breaking down scripture for easy absorption. Totally altered my life."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The top values when reading Watchman Nee are depth in Bible exposition and insight. The drawback of reading Nee is lack of hermeneutical restraint. He sometimes \\"reads in\\" meaning that may or may not be true, but is not warranted under a grammatical-historical hermeneutic for the passage in question.This book is his best. His conclusions are all well reasoned and exposited from the text of Romans. Nee has a delightful grasp of the grace of God and what a living relationship with him should be like. You get the depth of insight, but without allegorizing or undue license.-Dennis McCallum, authorOrganic Disciplemaking: How to promote Christian leadership development through personal relationships, biblical discipleship, mentoring, and Christian community"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Watchman Nee (1903-1972) was a Chinese church leader. He spent the last twenty years of his life in prison, as Christians were (and continue to be) severely persecuted by the Communists in China. The Normal Christian Life was originally published in 1957 from a collection of Nee's spoken messages and magazine articles.The Normal Christian Life is a Romans-centered exposition of what Christian living should be. The key verse of the entire work is Romans 6:6: \\"We know that our old self was crucified with him so that the body of sin might be destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin.\\"This book is refreshingly well-reasoned, and Nee's explanations are simple and his illustrations are good and helpful. Nee brings a eternal perspective (and I like anything with an eternal perspective) to the work of Christ. He has a good theology of sin and the sin nature. He also has some interesting insights on baptism.Nee deals with some basic yet fundamental and sometimes misunderstood concepts. Freedom from the sin nature, for example, is something a lot of Christians (including Lutherans, of whom I am the worst) neglect, don't understand, or refute.A lot of Nee's message seems extreme. It certainly is, but the real question is, is it correct? I have never read any meaningful work on Christian living that was one hundred percent doctrinally correct. But most of what Nee has to say is sound, and more often than not, his principles are valid where his specific applications might not be.This is a great book for Christians who are just getting by - those who are \\"truly saved and yet bound by sin,\\" as Nee says. Nee's is a Christianity of deep and powerful faith. He takes almost for granted a level of faith that most Christians do not have or strive for.One thing, and I include this as an interesting aside rather than a knock on Nee: when Nee discusses Romans 7:24 (\\"Wretched man that I am! Who will rescue me from this body of death?\\") he uses as an example the old Roman tradition punishing murderers by binding the corpses of their victims to them hand to hand and foot to foot (Nee was not the first to use this illustration, nor was he the last). Well, this set off all my urban legend alarms. I did some research and found no evidence whatsoever that this ever happened. It certainly doesn't seem in line with Roman attitudes toward punishment, particularly of capital crimes.But I do not wish this to be held against Nee that the good of his message should be overlooked. This is an excellent treatise on how Christianity \\"works\\". To those interested in the manifold fullness of Christian living, this book must beHIGHLY RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This is one of the most challenging books I've ever read as a Christian. It's not challenging because of its language, the language is simple. It's challenging because of how direct, simple and clear it is. The book is a pseudo-commentary on the book of Romans. Despite being translated from the teachings and writings of a Chinese Christian in the first half of the 1900s, the illustrations and language read as if they had been written by your closest friend.There is so much in this book that has transformed my understanding of Paul's writings to the Romans and what that means to the overall message of Christian teaching. I got rebaptized as Nee gave me a better understanding of the need for baptism. That's just one of the ways this book has seriously impacted my walk with Christ. Ever since reading it I've been trying to get my hands on as many other Watchman Nee books as I can and I've already bought a couple extra copies of this to pass on to firends who are being changed by it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Before reading this book, I have a lots of question about what is the real spirutal life.

This, IN ADDITION, to the Word of God, should be considered essential reading!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The Normal Christian Life (Hendrickson Christian Classics). If you purpose yourself to be principled by this book it will change your life forever and you will find yourself being used of the Lord in a fresh way. As we approach His merit it's essential we recognize and confess our sins appropriating the blood of Jesus. To walk in the gifts freely given, we are encouraged to practice repentance and consecration. Author Watchman Nee proves it is not by gaining strength that we overcome sin but by becoming weaker so His power can be made perfect. The law was given to us to prove our weakness, exposing our true nature and inability to keep it. This book stresses that we must determine to put no reliance on the power within ourselves, our souls, for overdeveloped souls crowd out the life of the Son of God in us.If we are to be used it is though the Word that we get the light that cleanses and kills what should not be there. When God compels us on to new discoveries our attitude should be subjected to the Holy Spirit. For all the \\"doers\\", \\" movers\\", and \\"shakers\\", The Normal Christian Life will make you take 2 steps back and rethink about \\"works\\" in a new way while revealing the heart of God's will for your life. It is not what we attempt to do but our focus must be the Lord Himself- losing ourselves in Him alone- no strings attached. For the aroma of Christ to ooze out of our lives we must first suffer and with the limitation brought, be willing to still find satisfaction only in the Lord. What we become more than what we do are key and our prayers should be directed that we might touch others and impart the presence of God out of our broken alabaster boxes. He sets us here to create in others a hunger for Himself."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Watchman Nee does the best job I have ever found on the Book of Romans. I read the book first in the 70's and then again in the 90's and then again in 2011. He is very thorough. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"this book arrived on time in excellent shape. i would recommend buying from this book store. the book contained no writing or marks, in perfect shape"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I have read this book repeatedly for many years now starting in 1969..There is absolutely nothing in it that would offend in terms of race and gender.

There is nothing in the book to justify that warning."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Just started this book but fantastic so far. Because these are adapted from speeches Nee initially gave, there is some redundancy in the text, which is what you do when speaking publicly to emphasize points. But this redundancy doesn't distract in the least from his message. He is clear, methodical and intensely insightful into the Scriptures and how he uses them to measure and motivate his life. I recommend this to new and seasoned Christians alike because there're some tremendous insights to think and pray over. I recommend this to seekers for the same reason. I also recommend this to those who don't believe as it may provide its own insight into those of us who do. Meaningful and interesting on every level."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This is another insightful book by Watchman Nee. Anything I have ever read of his has been great. I recommend anything from this author."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"You can approach this book in two ways. The first is just read it. Contents will bless and amaze you. It is, in a sense, the most straight forward presentation of what Christianity should be. Second, you may want to take the time to actually look up and ponder the scriptures he references. The book can easily absorb and direct a bible study of significant length. I'd say that if I were to teach a foundations of Christianity class, this would be the textbook. Yet, I read this book nearly 20 years ago and when I read it recently, it amazed me and at times, blew me away."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Nee describes the essentials of the Spirit-filled life in such simple, clear, and yet profound terms. I started reading this as I was in the process of moving to China. Quite a moving experience."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This is the most beautiful, clear, concise, Spirit filled book I've ever read (other than the Bible). I hope my life will never be the same. Watchman Nee's words were very sweet to my soul. The other reviewers say it all. The only thing I would add is that what others might have called redundancy, I would call critical, necessary, and creative repetition. These basic Biblical truths have been so lost in our Western Christianity that we need a clarion call to get our attention. The book is progressive, so that after the early chapters lay the foundation, the later chapters build on them to take us from the elemental truths to the deepest truths, always reminding us that all these things are true because we are crucified with Christ, we are dead to sin in Christ, and we are alive to God in Christ. These are the facts for those who are in Christ. It's all him and none of us. May the Lord get all the glory!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"&quot;Normal Christian Life&quot; is an excellent book, but unfortunately many who appreciate it never learn of a book that is even more representative of Watchman Nee's ministry: &quot;The Normal Christian Church Life&quot;, also available at Amazon.com. In this book you will learn of the truths for which Watchman Nee died in a China prison."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Contains many truths that Christians, both new and mature should grasp."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Here is another classic on how the biblical Christian should live \\"IN\\" Christ from a Chinese pastor and missionary who spent many years and died for his faith in prison. One of his most endearing and well-known chapters is on how God's Grace triumphs over Law in Romans 7. The story of the one woman and two husbands is as timeless and insightful as it is biblical. The entire chapter is full of insights into our new position in Christ, and the believer's relationship to the Law.In the first chapter, The Blood of Christ, Nee starts out with the question, \\"What is the normal Christian life? He gives us the Apostle Paul's answer in Galatians 2:20, \\"It is no longer I, but Christ.\\" He summarizes it this way, \\"I live no longer, but Christ lives His life in me.\\" What follows throughout the rest of the book is a superb biblical study on how the Christian should and can live victoriously In Christ. As a missionary to Africa, I have seen how important it is for converts from a syncretism of animism and Islam to truly realize their new position in Christ. This teaching, empowered by the Holy Spirit, is their only means of throwing off the chains of fear and darkness that have imprisoned them. Yet, this applies to all believers the world over.From the back cover of my 1977 edition:\\"Watchman Nee (1903 - 1972) is remembered for his leadership of an indigenous church movement in China as well as for the books that continue to enrich Christians throughout the world. Beginning in the 1930s, he helped establish local churches in China that were completely independent of foreign missionary organizations and were used to bring many into the kingdom of God. From them came many of the house churches that continued a faithful witness when Western missionaries were forced to leave the country. Arrested in 1952 and found guilty of a large number of false charges, Watchman Nee was imprisoned until his death in 1972.\\""},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This is a great, fantastic book for Christians. \\"The Spirit who dwells within me is no mere influence, but a living Person; He is very God.\\" There are truths that we have learned so well, mechanicaly, that pass us by without becoming real and alive, through meditation, in our hearts and souls. When one reads Mr. Nee one has the feeling that knowledge becomes revelation, and that the political map of our normal Christian life becomes suddenly a relief map. I believe that this precious book will do for you what it did for me. It will be a revelation for you in certain aspect of your life most needed.It is divided into 14 chapters that cover everything that a follower of Christ needs to know to help him enjoy a spiritually fulfilled Christian life. What I appreciated most of Mr. Nee is that not only he explains clearly his subjects, but he brings along examples of his life experiences that illustrate his points convincingly. If one image is worth a thousand words, then one illustration is worth many books. This is no ordinary Christian literature; it is really a treasure."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Watchman Nee always makes matters so clear. In this book he lays out what it is to live the Christian life. According to chapters 6, 7 and 8 of Romans, the conditions of living the normal Christian life are fourfold. They are: (a) Knowing, (b) Reckoning, (c) Presenting ourselves to God, and (d) Walking in the Spirit, in that order.In the first matter, of knowing, there is no need to pray but only to praise. God has put us all in Christ, so that when Christ was crucified we were crucified also. If you feel that you have died, you have died; and if you do not feel that you have died, you have nevertheless just as surely died.Likewise, our reckoning must be based on knowledge of divinely revealed fact, for otherwise faith has no foundation on which to rest. When we know, then we reckon spontaneously. It is that because we are dead --because we see now what God has done with us in Christ --therefore we can reckon ourselves to be dead. \`Reckoning' in Greek means doing bookkeeping, which is the only thing in the world human beings can truly do with precision. Reckoning and faith are here practically the same thing. Faith is the acceptance of God's fact.\\"Present yourselves... and your members\\", says Paul, and again: \\"Present your members\\" (Romans 6:13,19). God requires of us that we now regard all our members, all our faculties, as belonging wholly to Him. Because Christ is risen, we are therefore alive \\"unto God\\" and not unto ourselves. Nee asks how many of us dare not use our time or money or talents as we would, because we realize they are the Lord's not ours? How many of us have such a strong sense that we belong to God that we dare not squander a dollar of our money, or an hour of our time, or any of our mental or physical powers? Nee also points out that we must remember that God will always break what is offered to Him. However, after breaking it, He blesses and uses it to meet the needs of others.The final point of walking in the Spirit means to trust the Holy Spirit to do in ourselves what we cannot do ourself. This life is completely different from the life one would naturally live of one's self. Each time you are faced with a new demand from the Lord, you look to Him to do in you what He requires of you. It is not a case of trying but of trusting; not of struggling but of resting in Him. If you have a hasty temper, impure thoughts, a quick tongue or a critical spirit, don't set out with a determined effort to change yourself, but, reckoning yourself dead in Christ to these things, look to the Spirit of God to produce in you the needed purity or humility or meekness. This is what it means to \\"stand still, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you\\".Watchman Nee uses plentiful examples of real-life scenarios to drive these points home. Reading this book really clarified for me what it is to live a \\"normal\\" Christian life, versus a typical one. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"When I was 9 years old I got my first pair of glasses and was amazed by the detail and clarity of my new vision. What was once green blobs atop brown cylinders became gorgeous, complex trees in their full, leafy glory. In a similar way, thanks to Nee, I see the details and wholeness of God's greatest gift to us, His Son.Watchman Nee makes Paul's Letter to the Romans accessible and applicable. I have been a Christian for many years and participated in many Bible/Christian studies. Nevertheless, I did not grasp the fullness of the Cross. The Normal Christian Life explains in everyday terms the many benefits of Christ's sacrifice for us and how to walk in Him. Please read this book and share it with others. It is a life refiner."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Watchman Nee is one of my favorites. This is for the intermediate Christian. Nee takes us through the book of Romans. Not like every other study that is out there. One needs to read this to advance.

I'm almost done with my first read thru the book and plan on immediately re-reading it."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The title of the book doesn't stand out but the point is that most Christians are not living what God considers normal but what is actually subnormal. Watchman Nee presents what the normal Christian life is all about and the reasons why a lot Christians never get above subnormal. The book of Romans comes alive and the normal Christian life is meant for all believers not just a select few. It is the overcoming life that is meant by normal. All believers are overcomers because of who they are in Christ but not all believers recognize and appropriate this fact into their thinking and are, therefore, defeated and/or subnormal."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I recently finished reading The Normal Christian Life by Watchman Nee. This is one of the best books I've ever read that is centered around Christianity. I get tired of seeing all the \\"Christian\\" books out there with 3, 5, or 10 steps to being a better Christian or how I can obtain spiritual maturity by praying certain prayers. However, The Normal Christian Life is a basic explanation of Christianity in simple, real terms. Watchman Nee is so genuine in his writing and helps to explain certain aspects of my Christian faith that are still kind of hard to grasp even after all these years. This is not a new book, in case you've never heard of Nee. He wrote the book around 1957 and why I am just now hearing about his writings is most likely due to the Christian \\"self-help\\" books that have always been shoved my way instead.

Once I left for college, I disregarded it all because I lacked a relationship with Christ. Christianity seemed like drudgery and a boring set of rules to follow. After 10 years of self-destructive living, I turned back to God out of desperation. I then experienced God's grace, intimacy, and redemption power in relationship with him for about 5 years. However, it seemed like the more &#34;churched&#34; I got, the farther away God seemed.I finally began to understand that I was trying to earn His approval and had gone back to my &#34;roots&#34; of Christianity that I learned as a child.....&#34;don't do this, don't do that, be good, be happy, act Christian&#34;. Ugh....what a waste of time! After a few years of that junk, God answered my prayers and led me to read and listen to teachers that ministered God's grace like Watchmen N&eacute;e and Joseph Prince. This book was an eye opener for me (and my husband). It is an easy listen but not simple. My relationship with Christ is new and deeper than ever AND my marriage is better.

I have heard much better.This review is made possible by the Reviewers program at [...]"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The Normal Christian Life is Watchman Nee's take on the book of Romans, just as Sit, Walk, Stand was his journey through Ephesians. Nee uses these pages to remind his readers that everything depends on our resting in Christ's completed work. On that basis he calls Christians to live holy and upright lives, not in their own strength, but in the Spirit. And he calls his fellow believers to realize that God is not content to simply undo the results of the fall. There is much more in view.He does a wonderful job of bringing home theological truth, though I found a few pieces of his thought process difficult to swallow. I must admit I found the last third far better than the first two. But as a whole it is rich in material you will want to go over more than once, and full of imagery that brings the subject to life.While Sit, Walk, Stand was full of moving personal stories and interactions, The Normal Christian Life stands out for its use of analogies. Simply, they are brilliant and succinct.Not only am I in Christ, but Christ is in me. And just as, physically, a man cannot live and work in water but only in air, so, spiritually, Christ dwells and manifests himself not in terms of \\"flesh\\" but of \\"spirit.\\" Therefore, if I live \\"after the flesh,\\" I find that what is mine in Christ is, so to say, held in suspense in me. Though in fact I am in Christ, yet if I live in the flesh - that is, in my own strength and under my own direction - then in experience I find to my dismay that it is what is in Adam that manifests in me. If I would know in experience all that is in Christ, then i must learn to live in the Spirit. (p.176)In this way he presents the difference between what we experience and what is objective reality, and shows that if we are to live as disciples, we can only expect to do so by breathing in the right medium. Or his grappling with the nature of the two \\"laws\\", of sin and death and of life:If we will let ourselves live in the new law, we shall be less conscious of the old. It is still there, but it is no longer governing and we are no longer in its grip. That is why the Lord says in Matthew 6: \\"Behold the birds...Consider the lilies.\\" If we could ask the birds whether they were not afraid of the law of gravity, how would they reply? They would say, \\"We never heard the name of Newton. We know nothing about this law. We fly because it is the law of our life to fly.\\" Not only is there in them a life with the power of flight, but that life has a law which enables these living creatures, to overcome the law of gravity. Yet gravity remains. (p.192)His dealing with the nature of the church and its relation to the creation of Eve out of Adam's side is beautiful (p.213). As well, his treatment of the normal source of our strength (pp. 230-231) will make you rightly question every spiritual gift inventory you have ever taken, encouraging you to drink from the well of the Spirit.I did find his treatment of our sinful nature lacking (p.35), as it calls into question how we should take the humanity of Christ (though I don't think that was his intention). I also think he takes 2 Corinthians 4:11 out of context to prove a point on p.228. And as I already suggested, I found the early parts of the book more tedious than the latter due to his incessant reminders that everything is the work of Christ; nothing is to our credit. I got the point early, and was ready for some balance before he was ready to provide it.The best way I can think to end this review is with a story involving a biscuit, from near the end of the book:I was sitting one day at supper with a young brother to whom the Lord had been speaking on this very question of our natural energy. He said to me, \\"It is a blessed thing when you know the Lord has met you and touched you in that fundamental way, and that disabling touch has been received.\\" There was a plate of biscuits between us on the table, and I picked one up and broke it in half as though to eat it. Then, fitting the two pieces together again carefully, I said, \\"It looks all right, but it is never quite the same again, is it? When once your back is broken, you will yield ever after to the slightest touch from God.\\" (p.265)"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This book was awesome.

I'm not a huge fan of reading spiritual books primarily because I think they all pale in comparison when matched up against the Bible, but this book was very good! Please gather some history on Watchman Nee before reading any of his books because it really drew me into his writing after I knew all the things that he had been through for the name of Christ."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This book maps out the Christian life beyond forgiveness... and into a deeper walk with God. It has been a real blessing! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"One of the best books I've ever read as it pulls together all we need to know to live a good and legitimate Christian life. I read some of Watchman's works in the early 70s about the time he died. Recently I'd thought about him again and, as always, checked out Amazon's possible availability of his books. And, of course, I found many. I loved this book, have sent it to a daughter and plan to share my copy with others. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"When I first read the printed version of Watchman Nee's \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" I sensed that here is a book revealing the hidden secrets of what really matters, a map pointing to Bali Ha'i (the island of heart's desire). It's a treasure trove of wisdom densely packed - fairly easy to read on the surface, yet needing repeated reading and meditation to fully unlock it. During my teenage years many emotional troubles made concentrating enough to retain its message difficult, so I longed to have an audiobook I could listen to again and again to get an overall grip on the book and anchor it in my mind.In the 1970s, audiobooks (also called \\"talking books\\") were virtually unheard of unless you were blind. Thank God sighted people can have them today and there now exists the recording I longed for. There are even two editions; I own both for variety, rotating a copy between my house and my car. The readings are clear and generally rightly nuanced, and the narrators' voices can be listened to repeatedly without becoming annoying (at least to me). They are doing a narration, not preaching a sermon. A slight thing I noticed is that although Nee was Chinese, both he and his editors spoke and wrote in a British style of English. Yet the narrators sound American, like me; to hear them speak of \\"shillings and sixpence\\" with an American accent is a little amusing but certainly not distracting. The message is so wonderful that focusing on THAT will be rewarding forever!The audiobooks encouraged me to meditate again on the printed version, which includes helpful footnotes by editor Angus I. Kinnear who prepared the book for its first publication in Mumbai, India in 1957. There's also a study guide by Harry Foster published separately in England in 1976 available on Amazon. Both Kinnear and Foster heard Watchman Nee deliver the original late 1930s spoken addresses on which the book is based.Watchman Nee has been criticized in some circles because of the doctrines and practices of some of his disciples and colleagues - \\"guilt by association\\". It is no more legitimate than criticizing the apostle Paul for Hymenaeus, Alexander, Phygellus, Hermogenes, Philetus, Demas and \\"all who are in Asia\\" who had been Paul's associates and followers but decided to \\"distance themselves from him\\" (I Timothy 1:20; II Timothy 1:15; 2:17; 4:10). Some of them became proto-Gnostic heretics who claimed Paul as their hero while totally perverting what he actually said. Unlike them, Watchman Nee sometimes extrapolates beyond the Scriptures in a few of his other books but not in what we would think of as outright heresy. \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" has only one prominent mistake I've noticed: he applies Luke 17:26-37 (\\"one shall be taken, the other left behind\\") to the doctrine of the Rapture found in I Thessalonians 4:13-18; but the context of Luke's passage actually refers to the flood of Noah and the judgment on Sodom \\"taking away\\" the sinners, not the saved. Nee is not alone in this traditional misapplication. Just ignore his mistake here and don't let it rob you of the wonderful benefits of everything else he has to say.The message of \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" is not just for a few Christians who might enjoy it as their own particular interest or emphasis. Rather, it is the core of what it means to be a Christian. This is far different from what the average person thinks, or even the average Christian thinks. Had I read this book when I first believed in Jesus it would have put me on the right track and helped to save me from the will-power moralism of average Christianity. Nee's message may seem radical or strange, but that's only an indication of how far we've drifted from the Gospel of the Grace of God as it was revealed through Paul by the ascended Lord, Christ Jesus. The late Francis L. Patton, godly and able president of Princeton University (as quoted by William R. Newell in \\"Romans: Verse-By-Verse,\\" 1938) said, \\"The only hope of Christianity is in the rehabilitating of the Pauline theology. It is back, back, back, to an incarnate Christ and the atoning blood, or it is on, on, on, to atheism and despair\\". I have found this to be true in my own life. May Watchman Nee's \\"The Normal Christian Life\\" help you as it has helped me, to deeply experience faith, hope, and the love of God!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I've been in the church since I was a small child, but Nee presented perspectives on many issues and scriptures that were entirely new to me. I found this to be very impressive. However, there was some redundancy in the book, so I give it four, not five, stars."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Nee gives the best explanation of the Book of Romans in the Bible that I've read. A must read for those who are studying the Book of Romans. He is a bit long winded, and I thought some examples could have been shorter. However, he makes the point of his teaching well."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The only way I can describe the amount of help I recieved from brother Nee's spiritual insight is to say that it changed my life. I went from a passive, religious Christian into a consecrated disciple of Jesus Christ. The simple truth laid out in this book is that Christ himself is all we need. Victory, not defeat, is the normal for a Christian who recognizes that God has already given us all we will ever need when he gave us his Son. Would that every Christian would learn the truth revealed in this book by brother Nee and would engage in the victorious, Spirit-empowered, normal Christian life!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I recommend this book to all Christians. I believe that this book has essential facts for the Christian life and if you do not know and experience these things your Christian life will be lacking the reality. I hope that you enjoy it as much as I have."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"For the newcomer to a relationship with Christ and others who have been living the Christian life, this book addresses several aspects that can be difficult to grapple with and understand.The author discusses process of salvation and sanctification, in a way that is not only informative, but inspirational and encouraging. For the reader, who is fascinated by the Book of Romans, the writings in this book do an incredible job of developing a type of topography in the book, such that the book can be really explored and mined; however, the book is not a commentary on Romans. Romans may perhaps be the foundational writings, with the author reaching out and drawing upon other related writings in scripture to give the reader a comprehensive view of the material.When reading this book, don't consider it as an academic read, but treat it is an experience that will strengthen your Christian life. You want to strive to experience what the author is trying to describe. As I read it, I find that while I might run through a book of this size in less than a week, just a matter of days, I have been reading this book for 2 weeks, and I find that it is pulling me into scripture and challenging me to give serious thought to the material, so while you will read the writings of the author, the author is focused on scripture. The writings of the author truly reflect the attitude and mindset of \\"Less of me and more of Him\\"."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This book is must for a believer who desires to know God, to understandNew Birth and Life in spirit. A great teaching on Romans.

I always underline and use my books for future reference. In this case I underlined more than what I left unmarked. I also made notes in the back of my book with page # and subject pertaining to explanations of many biblical terms. In my opinion, this book would greatly help every reader and I wish I could put one in every Christian's hand. The Church would be so victorious if all Christians read this. I am planning to give as many copies away that I can. And to everyone I talk to I will mention this book is MUST READ!

In my opinion, it should be a must read for every person serious about living a God honoring life."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"For years I have been searching for the &quot;victorious&quot; Christian Life, always going from one defeat(in one area) to another defeat(in an entirely different area). This book is soooo liberating in showing Christian's, in such a practical way, how it doesn't depend on us and our &quot;self-control&quot;, but soli on what Jesus did on the Cross through His Blood and Death. Which, after all these years, of not experiencing the personal side to His blood and death, has finally come home for me through the skillful teaching and story illustrations of Watchman Nee.But, it doesn't end there, it just begins!Watchman Nee explains what so many of us long to hear. How not to despair in trials, and failures but to see them as God see's them. They bring us to the end of ourselves, and to a dependence on God. Hallelujah! No more striving.Two more awesome books are: The Overcoming Life, by Watchman Nee and Hudson Taylor's Spritual Secret"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I have strengthened my spiritual relationship as a result of reading this book. First of all, Ni To-sheng, aka Watchman Nee, (1903-1972) was a man of inspiring determination and courage. During his thirty years of ministry, beginning in 1919, Nee travelled throughout China planting churches among the rural communities and pastoring in Shanghai. In January of 1956, Nee was brought up on charges by the local authorities in Shanghai. He was imprisoned until 1972 when he was released days before his death in his home province. I am thankful that I live where religious tolerance is practiced. I am also impressed with Mr Nee's example. His book is equally impressive. The book of Romans deals with some difficult theology. At times, I have been unable to explain many of its concepts, particularly, to non-Christians. Watchman Nee is simple and thorough, but never thoroughly simple. He eschews theological discussion in favour of explanations and examples intended to provide new Christians with tools to build a spiritual relationship. This direct approach was in response to his audience, as he explains, &quot;We have learned in China that, when leading a soul to Christ, we must be very thorough, for there is no certainty when he will again have the help of other Christians. We always seek to make it clear to a new believer that, when he has asked the Lord to forgive his sins and to come into his life, his heart has become the residence of a living Person. The Holy Spirit of God is now within him, to open to him the Scriptures that he may find Christ there, to direct his prayer, to govern his life, and to reproduce in him the character of his Lord.&quot; In this manner, Mr Nee explains that a spiritual life begins with an objective revelation followed by a subjective experience which is composed of typically, a crisis and an on-going process. From this book, I understood more that the LORD, my GOD, plays a personal role in my life, building a spiritual relationship. If you are interested in Christian Missionary work in China, or in building a stronger spiritual relationship, this book will be interesting to you."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This is the best Christian book I've ever read aside from the Bible. If you only ever buy one book, buy the Bible. But if you only buy two books in your lifetime make the second one &quot;The Normal Christian Life&quot; it will change your life. Take it slowly and pray as you read it; it will revolutionize the way you see yourself, the cross, the blood of Jesus, and your status before God. I've read a lot of Christian books, I don't think any of them come close to this. You will be changed. Pray about it."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Beside the Bible, this book has had the greatest impact on my life of any book I have ever read, and I love to read.

I would highly recommend all of his books. This is one of those classic books that all Christians should read. Warning: It will challenge you. Depending on your level of spiritual maturity, you may often find yourself questioning if you have ever been saved. Of course, this is certainly a healthy thing to examine every now and then (2 Cor. 13:5).If you have never read any of Watchman Nee's books before, I would start out with this book, \\"Sit, Walk, Stand\\", and \\"Let Us Pray\\". These books are certainly full of depth, and they will be good for understanding some of his even deeper writings down the road.If you are already familiar with Watchman Nee's writings and you haven't read this book, put this on your must-read list right away.

A poor edition of a classic book, most of the notes were removed, and some explanations aren't there either, the book has been mutilated."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Have you ever heard of Watchman Nee? He was a Chinese national, and the penultimate Christian missionary. He was finally arrested by the Communists when they came to power in China, and he spent the last two decades of his life in a small, barren prison cell. Almost all of his books are transcriptions of his sermons. This one is a series which studies Paul's letter to the &quot;Romans.&quot;First, let me clarify---I am *not* a Christian. Second, let me say that I have read equally non-Christian historians decribe &quot;Romans&quot; as one of the all-time classics of human literature---one of those books that, regardless of your belief, will change you, and broaden your perspective on the life you live. Why? Because it is the most incisive anti-religion treatise you will ever read. What, and this book is in the Bible???Anyone familiar with my reviews will know that I admire true individuals. Watchman Nee was one of these. Despite the fact that he's a favorite among many Christian believers (even those who tend toward fundamental Christianity), I seriously doubt many of these would agree with some of Nee's most fundamental tenants. He was considered somewhat of a &quot;problem&quot; by other missionaries in China at the time (1920s-1930s). It's no accident that Angus Kinear's biography of Nee is titled &quot;Against The Tide.&quot; As a simple example, Nee strongly believed in &quot;the local church.&quot; By this, he meant that each individual congregation not only had the right but was *obligated* to establish their own set of doctrinal beliefs. He was solidly anti-institutional religion. He also had a unique view of what consituted human nature (most clearly outlined in &quot;The Spiritual Man&quot; [three volumes]). This view, I believe, was far more consistent with healthy psychology than what most American Christian churches currently preach.In &quot;The Normal Christian Life,&quot; Nee takes on the Apostle Paul at his finest. I'll avoid saying much about the contents, as it's a complicated and detailed study. I'll simply relate one of my favorite chapters. It's Nee's commentary on Paul's exposition on &quot;The Law&quot; of Moses. This actually constitutes several books of the Old Testament, but it can partially be reduced to what most of us know as &quot;The Ten Commandments.&quot; Are these rules that we're expected to follow? No, says Nee. The whole point, he says, is this---you can't do this! There is no way that anyone who has ever lived could do it. The person who says they can understands *nothing* about true religion.Nee uses a very Christian language in his discussion of this issue. If you're not able to &quot;translate&quot; that into your own world view, then Nee is unlikely to do anything for you. If you're a Christian, you *MUST* read this book. If you're *not* a Christian, it would be nice if you could. In any event, this one is a classic."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"The Normal Christian Life is a true classic! This book has helped me to finally grasp Paul's presentation of the new life for a new law in Romans.Nee takes you through Romans ch. 1-8 and deals with who a person is in Christ. If we are not bound by sin and the flesh, then why do we struggle? Have we really been set free? Yes! Nee concludes that many Christians are living in their own strength. Many fail because they will not \\"take their hands off\\" and walk in the Spirit. It is in the moment of failure that we did not place our faith in the Son of God. It is in that moment of failure that we were living in our own strength and walking in our own power.Nee reminds the Christian that he has already been given all that he needs to live a victorious life. We were given the \\"fruit\\" of the Spirit, not the \\"fruits\\" of the Spirit. We were given one gift! Christ is our love, joy, peace, patience, etc. We need only ask that he be more realized in us. We have been fogiven and we are now free to walk in the Spirit!I believe Nee's book cries out to Christians in America to identify with Christ and the new law of love. It has been my experience that most Christians living in America only give lip service to this \\"new life\\" and are still living by the old law in the old man. We can live exactly like Christ... because we've been given his very life!I pray that you will learn from Nee what Paul meant when he said, \\"The life I live in the body I live by the faith of the Son of God.\\"I pray this book makes it on to your shelf with pen and highlighted markings galore.After you have read \\"The Normal Christian Life\\"... I suggest readingThe Release of the Spiritby Nee.Further Recommended Reading:Christ the Sum of All Spiritual ThingsThe Centrality of Jesus Christ (Works of T.

There is simply no other book that compares to it in terms of explaining the work of Christ on our behalf."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"This book is profound! Life-changing. Each page is is so greatly written. It is a captivating piece, and thoroughly grounded in the truth. It is a must read for any seeking Christian!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I struggle even how to describe this book other than saying it is definitely one of my all-time favorite books. Nee's depth of insight and ability to communicate with colorful imagery and language is simply amazing - it really makes for not only an informative read, but an entertaining read as well. Nee's concept of \\"the normal Christian life\\" is that it is a life marked by sacrifice - identified with the death, burial and resurrection of Christ - and if only more followers of Christ really understood this biblical principle, Nee believes that the world would witness truly transformed individuals by the power of God.Nee uses as his backdrop the Book of Romans and walks the reader through the writing of Paul to demonstrate the significance of the blood sacrifice of Christ, the death of Christ on the cross and then the resurrection of Christ from the grave. There are far too many wonderful examples that Nee uses to lividly describe the biblical principles put forth in Romans and other books of the Bible - in fact, one of the amazing things about this book is how comfortable Nee is with the entire Word of God; he continuously drops in references and verses from almost every book of the Bible, Old and New Testaments!Two things that really stood out to me in this book were Nee's insistence on the believer truly understanding the significance of the Body of Christ, the church, and each person's role in being an vital part of that body. The other part that really struck me was his last chapter where he talked about a life of service being a life poured out at the feet of Jesus - the essential element is that our lives satisfy Christ, because He is worthy, and that our primary concern is not taking care of the poor or the homeless, but rather satisfying our Lord and Savior - it really is about perspective and focus - Christ is the only thing we should have our eyes on as we evaluate our lives!There is a new version out of The Norman Christian Life and I intended to read that one as well. My version was my dad's and was published in 1957. I would give The Normal Christian Life to almost any Christian, especially one interested in a book that will really challenge his walk with the Lord - an outstanding book!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"Second only to the Bible, no other book has ever had such an impact on my life! In this book, Nee explains the book of Romans; a somewhat confusing book for probably a lot of Christians! In very clear and simple terms, he explains what it REALLY means to be crucified with Christ. He sheds great insight on the text \\"not I, but Christ.\\" In this book, Nee calls Christians to a completely different level of Christianity, or probably to put it better, a much more intimate relationship with Jesus Christ. But, as Nee points out often in this book, he is not trying to make \\"elite Christians,\\" he is trying to show what the Christian life SHOULD be like; every Christian that is not at this standard is an abnormal Christian. Which, sad to say, that is probably the vast majority of Christians; I know I was before I read this book. This book in itself will not make you a more holy Christian, but if you go into it with an open heart and an ear to hear and seeking Jesus; your life will be changed. I especially encourage this book for every new beleiver!!"},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"In a time when American Christianity has been reduced to a weak, anemic, apathetic, watered down fairy-tail, Watchman Nee's writings call us back to the foundations of all that is important and meaningful. To wet your appetitite, from chapter 14, a little subchapter called \\"Waste\\" cleary defines perpective on the Christian Life. If I might quote Nee, \\"...in approving Mary's action at Bethany, the Lord Jesus was laying down one thing as a basis of all service: that you pour out all you have, your very self, unto Him; and if that should be all He allows you to do, that is enough. It is not first of all a question of whether \`the poor' have been helped or not. The first question is: Has the Lord been satisfied?\\"If I were to send someone away with two books, naturally, one would be The Bible, and the other would be The Normal Christian Life.

We are typically mentored through the discovery of the corners. During our early years in the faith we quickly discover and place the side pieces. Then comes the tough part--trying to figure out the middle pieces. On first read, this book appears to contain a marvelous patchwork of insight to the middle of the puzzle--the day-to-day life of an engaged believer. Wow! What a treasure! Someone who can explain in plain language the deeper truths of Scripture!However, if one looks more than skin deep and you begin to notice something very troubling. Watchman Nee's theology in this book is all over the map. Examples? In the early chapters, prayer is said (correctly) to not be a prerequisite to salvation. [He even correctly addresses Romans 10:10.] In later chapters, prayer is clearly described as a necessary prerequisite. Nee also describes the importance of the indwelling Holy Spirit to the believer, but later flatly states that the Holy Spirit does not indwell the believer until after water baptism.Clearly, Watchman Nee has some issues with his \`corners and sides.' The question you, the reader, must decide is how much credibility Nee's insights into the difficult middle pieces of the puzzle carry if he hasn't yet settled on his corners and sides?Did, for example, the Holy Spirit reveal to him that the Spirit indwelling did not take place until post-water baptism (thus, denying the Spirit's role as \\"earnest of our inheritance\\")? If your answer is no, then what assurance do you have that Nee is correct about anything in the middle of the puzzle?It's a shame too. I wanted it to be true. I wanted those insights to be the answer. As an evangelical, I must define truth by comparison to Scripture. Nee fails in a very disappointing way in this regard."},{"Title":"The Normal Christian Life","review":"I am not yet at the point of accepting the doctrine presented here.The book is mainly from short portions of Paul's epistle to the Romans.I suppose I still see things as a child.

There is awe for that, though the gratitude comes hard because, hell, please don't do that for me.If Paul can decide the world wanted a new religion, maybe anyone can; clearly that fire can spread fast.Maybe after reading this I've come closer to prayer than ever:Dear God,Are you only my better self after all? Please God, don't let my better self die before I do. Your son said your house has many mansions, I hope by now there is some affordable housing as well.You know, they say forgive and forget.

But it is a car that's firmly attached to the fundamentals: getting you from here to there in comfort and safety at a reasonable price.There may be a lesson here: things that are built on fundamental concerns about function don't go out of style. The Greengrocer is a bit out of date:there are many more varieties of produce available today than in 1972. The attitude towards food is distinctly contemporary, even prophetic. Here was a guy-Joe Carcione- who loved the things he sold and took them seriously. He paid careful attention to the fundamentals and, what a surprise!-his book is both useful and charming as a result.Lynn Hoffman, author of New Short Course in Wine,The and the perennially up-to-date bang BANG: A Novel"},{"Title":"Little Gnome Facts","review":"Once you enter the land of the Gnome, you'll be lost in it!

In a scant one hundred pages the author does an excellent job of capturing the essential facts relating to these conflicts sprinkled with useful maps and chronologies as well as some superb representational pieces of period art. I enjoyed the two interesting sidebars, one on a British naval officer and another on Nelson's ladylove, Emma Hamilton. The short bibliography lists two of my favorites, Paddy Griffith's ART of WAR of REVOLUTIONARY FRANCE and T.C.W.Blanning's THE FRENCH REVOLUTIONARY WARS. Fremont-Barnes has done a very good job on supplying the interested reader an introduction to an extremely colorful and fascinating period."},{"Title":"The French Revolutionary Wars (Essential Histories)","review":"This period is really extensively complicated by alot of fascinating events. A purely Military History view would still be 1000 pages, because the French Revolutionary Wars were just such a fascinating time, with so many campaigns, battles, skirmishes, sieges.This book attempts to give it a concise shape, and does a good job a the operational level of untangling the web of campaigns. Its difficult to find, in English, good stuff about this war. On Napoleon, there is an avalanche of books, even on specific battles. But not so much about this period, besides the Italian campaigns of Napoleon that ended these wars.At the operational, it gives a good account, however, it lacks just due to the space about what occurred at the unit level at each of the battles, since each battle was its own story within a story. The way a Civil War book would spend a few pages on Antietam, Bull Run, and 5 pages on Gettysburg alone. There are 3-4 fronts at any given moment in this period, and untangling them all is done in a pretty decent way. The reader has a solid picture of what had transpired before Napoleon enters the stage. From than on, well, most of you have probably read a good deal on Napoleon already.For those who haven't gotten a Napoleonic military history background, the Smithsonian History of War - Napoleonic Wars is a great starting point. Too bad it skips everything before Napoleon's Italian Campaign, which is why I own this book. This series also has a very good 7 years war and Spanish Succession books about the wars of Frederick the Great."},{"Title":"The French Revolutionary Wars (Essential Histories)","review":"This book provides a good introduction to its topic for those with only about 2 hours to invest in reading its 96 page length. The book starts out by providing the geopolitical balance of power prevailing before the wars and a description of the militaries of each of Europe's major combatants. Then it goes into how the wars played out covering not only military campaigns but how the militaries themselves evolved during the course of the war, the role of ideologies and the after effects of the war.

This gem of a book chronicles an average family's life in a small northwest Germany town during the great conflagration.The author retells the events as seen through the eyes of a sensitive young child. Several of her stories touched me. They include: Trouble finding enough food, school field trips, saving a pet rabbit during an air raid, the plight of a starving elderly couple, the crash of a British warplane, a crippled veteran's sad return from war.

Medway's \\"Lure of the Sinister\\" is a well written investigation of historical and modern Satanism, focusing on the myths of Satanic Ritual Abuse and the wide-spread Satanic Panic of the 80s, when many people, deluded by sensationalist books and TV talk shows were lead to believe that an international Satanic conspiracy was working to undermine church and state.The book first addresses the origins of Satanism and the idea behind the existence of the mythical entity known to Christians as Satan and Lucifer. It analyzes the cases most often cited as reliable instances of historical Satanism and devil worship such as Gilles de Rais, the Affaire des Poisons, The Hell Fire Club, as well as modern cases of supposed Satanic crime like the Black Circle Boys and Richard Ramirez. In all cases, paranoia and media sensationalism were shown to have warped the facts of these crimes and have mythologized them to the point were fact and fiction are indistinguishable and that, in truth, Satanism was either not a factor or was only a side issue to the real motivation. It also shows that the Church of Satan, far from being a truly evil threat to mankind, is not much more than a red herring meant to antagonize mainstream Christians and induldge themselves on ego rather than the Dark Lord. The book goes on to take task with the myth of SRA and the panics of the 80s and 90s that were fueled by delusional paranoid religious factions and psychotherapists eager to cash in on a nation's fears by endorsing nothing less than a real modern witch hunt.While there are very real problems with adolescent crime and drug abuse today, the fears that they are related to a world-wide conspiracy of black magic and devil worship are unfounded and have no supporting evidence. The book debunks the many myths that have grown up around this subject and gives a balanced and interesting accounting of them."},{"Title":"Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism","review":"Gareth Medway's book is an illumanating look at the Satanism, and Witchcraft scare that has plagued England, and the United States. Medway retells stories of supposed possessions, satanic activity, and other \\"evil\\" occurrences, and discounts the authenticity of these accounts. Even though he is biased in his presentation of some of the facts, his wit, and sense-of-humor emerges throughout the book. The title is misleading though because Medway does not really deal with the history of Satanism, instead with the hysteria surrounding it. His bibliography is also extensive for anyone interested in the occult. This book is ideal for those looking to examine if those stories we heard during the 80's of Satanic rituals in our backyards were true."},{"Title":"Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism","review":"Tolkien wrote that hobbits were fond of books full of things they already knew, laid out fair and square with no contradiction. I share that fondness, but even more appealing are books full of things I would _like_ to know. Medway has achieved this - Lure of the Sinister is not for everyone, but if you're a Clear-Eyed, Dedicated Seeker of Truth (with a taste for the occult, obscure and esoteric) this will be just your meat.His exposition of the 'satanisme' flap in 1890s France is one example - I knew the bare outlines, now I know the details.I wish I found a book like this every month!"},{"Title":"Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism","review":"Yet another history of Satanism. While this one was recommended highly by people who should know better, the prose is journalistic, windy and overwrought. Some small parts of it cover interesting history not covered elsewhere but the yellow press who originally covered it. The problem is, some of it was excruciatingly poorly researched nonsense (probably based on some other yellow journalism). Medway desperately needs a fact checker. Footnotes do not mean you checked your facts. Its main purpose seems to be something with footnotes to wave at witch-hunters when they show up at your door bearing pitchforks and torches, assuming you are a friendly neighborhood Satanist. Mostly it made me sleepy. Doubtless the soporific effect would also be effecacious on pitchfork-wielding witch hunters.Seriously; the world doesn't need another book about this sort of thing. I wish Mr. Medway well in getting his assistant professorship or whatever this book was supposed to accomplish, but the rehash of well-known nonsense involving Led Zeppelin records, Al Crowley and Charles Manson for the umpteenth time is completely unnecessary. The repeating of Huysmans and Dashwood mythology, yet again, is actively harmful to scholarship in this \\"field.\\" If you want to dig up something new in the Satan game; dig up some reports of Satanism from other cultures and other histories. And please, check some of your footnotes."},{"Title":"Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism","review":"_Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism_ by Gareth J. Medway is a fascinating history of the source of evil in those individuals who have opted to sell their soul to and worship the Dark Lord. Unfortunately, the book is marred severely by the author's skepticism regarding the reality of Satan worship. While many cases of Satanism have no doubt been exaggerated for political gain, there remains the distinct possibility of real live Satanists, often occupying high places in society, engaging in ghastly deeds and defying the Christian God. The author, who is a pagan, seems to feel that the reality of Satanism is inimical to his religious persuasion; however, this is not the actual case.In any event, this book includes a thorough discussion of much of the history of Satanism, including the persecution of heretics and witches in the so-called Dark Ages. It should be noted that Satanists are not to be confused with pagans in general, wiccans, or even with \\"Church of Satan\\" poseurs; they are far more sinister and seek to ape Christ and His Church. The author includes discussions of Satanism and freemasonry including the hoax of Leo Taxil and his allegations against masonry. The author also includes discussions of various cases of possession, such as the Loudon case, as well as various sinister individuals from the Middle Ages, including the child murderer Gilles de Rais. (Unfortunately, both the author's discussion of possession and the case of various mass murderers from the Middle Ages are marred by extreme skepticism.) The author also includes a history of the black mass, fully demonstrating the magical properties associated with the transubstantiation, though again he leans towards skepticism. Notorious black masses include the mass of Saint Secaire and the black mass (supposedly fiction but based on fact) from J. K. Huysman's novel _La-Bas_. The author also discusses various pacts made with the Devil, as well as witchcraft, mentioning such witch-hunter's manuals as the _Malleus Maleficarum_, mentioning demonic acts involving incubus and succubus. In addition, the author discusses various instances of real life Satanism, including the notorious Hell-Fire Club. Upon completion of this survey, the author turns to more modern day allegations. Here, the author mentions cases involving pedophilia and child abuse. Included among these are the notorious circumstances surrounding the case of \\"Michelle\\" of \\"Michelle Remembers\\" fame, allegedly regaining knowledge of her past after recovering lost memories. It should be noted that in nearly all of these cases, prominent individuals play a role in the abuse of children and the performance of diabolical deeds in obeisance to their Dark Master. While many of these cases have been overblown, and while it is true that many innocents have been unjustly convicted, I believe the author is overly skeptical and should not dismiss the reality of Satanism as out of hand simply from a cursory perusal of the evidence available. The author also discusses the role of conspiracy theories in the thinking of anti-Satanists; however, he never justifies his inherent skepticism of the concept of conspiracy to begin with. The book ends with the author belaboring his point about the non-existence of malignant Satanists, claiming that Satanists are generally law-abiding and that cases of Satanic crime, such as that involving the Manson family or instances in Matamoras, Mexico, are rare occurrences. Finally, the author concludes with an appendix on the black mass, in which he attempts to tar the memory of Roman Catholic priest Montague Summers, whose books attempted to reveal the reality of witchcraft and occultism.While this book is certainly interesting and much of the material in it is useful in terms of compiling a history of the worship of the Dark One, it is unfortunate that the author has allowed his skeptical \\"rationalist\\" bias to interfere with an otherwise scholarly work. While it is certainly true that many of the cases of Satanism have been overblown, it is also true that many more have been real. One need only look to the recent pedophilia cases among the Roman Catholic clergy for instances of such scandal."},{"Title":"Lure of the Sinister: The Unnatural History of Satanism","review":"I'll start MY review with a quote from an idiotic review from amazon:\\"Medway retells stories of supposed possessions, satanic activity, and other \\"evil\\" occurrences, and discounts the authenticity of these accounts.

That's the same fear that Anton LaVey and other modern \\"Satanists\\" picked-up. This very historical book reads more like a fun journalistic romp through history. It discusses the fear in the Christian mind both in the far past, and recent past of the 1980s when there was much \\"Satanic Panic\\" going on.Fearing that Satanism might exist sorta birthed such a thing into existence.

To appreciate the beauty of nature and how we are all directly connected to it is only one aspect of Paganism. The more I delve into the pre-historical and contemporary roots of the various traditions, the more I realized that all of our religious beliefs, in all religions, stem from a common ancestor. While some may worship Jesus or the Old Testament Yahwe they are only particular aspects of a far older, non-gender specific belief. In this book I have tried to bring together certain elements of the past and illustrate how they have been changed over time to reflect the opposite of what they once were. I have also shown how even Paganism, a belief system that touts an ability to worship directly with the divine without an intermediary, is being transformed into a system directed by a few--entirely opposite of what we should be experiencing.

And theauthor rightly criticizes the poor supply situation,particularly that of cold-weather clothing, asdevastating to the soldiers, but his conclusionthat the problem was rooted in a Pacific Firststrategy is questionable, as it is generallyunderstood that a Europe First strategy was embeddedin U.S. policy right from the pre-war Rainbow Plan5(D), and affirmed in the Arcadia Conference of1941-42.With photos, good maps, bibliography, appendices,index.

Despite calling itself an introduction, it was a very heavy going read - even for someone like me with 6 years experience in TESOL. Widdowson's style is to define the main areas of enquiry very briefly and then call on the reader to make judgements about what each discipline should be studying. However, with these abstact definitions alone, the reader cannot even begin to make a judgement. I felt that these kind of questions would only be suited to those who already have an extensive knowledge of linguistics. I also felt that such questions were irrelevant - it doesn't matter what area of linguistics a certain type of study comes under; what's important is whether it's worth studying. I would have preferred a book that actually got down to concrete examples of what lingustics was actually studying. Nevertheless, the book is useful in that it explains the meaning of all the terminology used in linguistics. This will no doubt be useful for further reading."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Oxford Introductions to Language Study)","review":"Although Widdowson is the editor of the Oxford Introductions to Language Studies series this book does not have the same feel as others in the series. The format is the same with a selection of readings following the author's introduction. However, this book seems to have been written as an introduction for experienced linguists. It contains all of the information but with none of the details that would make it a pleasant read for novices. Ultimately, trying to squeeze everything there is to be said about linguistics into 77 pages is an impossible task and makes for an unprofitable read.That said, the selection of readings is particularly strong and Widdowson asks some pointed questions of each author. It is at times very apparent what answer he expects because he goes on to ask questions based on what his answer would be. This would annoy those who disagree with him.This book only rated two stars because I expected more from the series editor. Widdowson seems to have missed the second word of the series title: introductions. Only those with a graduate level reading ability in the field of linguistics would find this book enjoyable. I would recommend Jean Aitchison's book instead (0340870834). It is highly readable and geared more for the novice."},{"Title":"Linguistics (Oxford Introductions to Language Study)","review":"There are many introductions to linguistics; Henry Widdowson's book not only provides an excellent overview of the basics it does so on only 80 pages (main text). For those who want (or need) more, the author provides excepts from other books, a list of references and a glossary.Because the book is short it is necessarily dense. However, the concepts are explained clearly and'without being overly verbose. To say that Widdowson &quot;calls on the reader to define what the subdisciplines of linguistics should be studying&quot; (an Amazon reviewer) is only partially true. In the main text the areas of inquiry are clearly outlined. In the extracts from other books, however, Widdowson shows that different authors draw the boundaries between the various sub-disciplines differently. Of course, this may be difficult to accept for those who demand one irrevocable academic truth."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Why has it taken so long for industrialized nations to get back into space in any meaningful way? Dobbs and Newquist tackle this question and hit the nail on the head with this book--pointing fingers when necessary and giving credit where it is due. This is a quick read that makes me think we have a shot at serious space business in the coming years. Excellent."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"My excitement at a major new rally to space by a high-profile journalist turned largely to chagrin upon reading this effort, which reads more like a transcript of a spoken-word broadcast than a book, with enough five-second sound bytes to make any CNN anchor envious. Steel yourself to go beyond thickets of breathless hyperbole into really careless errors, such as alternately referring to &quot;Lockheed Titans&quot; (correctly of course) and &quot;Boeing Titans&quot; (say what?) This is more than embarrassing; to see such glaring errors where I know a little about what he's talking about causes me to doubt all the seemingly useful information in areas unfamiliar to me. I can't escape knowing that the book's facts are sloppily researched and undependable. (It also gives me one more reason to wonder about the sentience behind CNN's financial reporting, of which Dobbs was apparently the architect - I'll stick to the Economist magazine.) The book's flaws extend further, with analysis as flawed as the facts. The predictions of developing technology are about as authoritative as if someone read Michio Kaku's &quot;Visions&quot; last summer and is now trying to summarize it to you after a handful of martinis. Think I'm exaggerating? See page 204, for this steeltrap analysis of mining asteroids: &quot;While the robot miners themselves would have to be durable and sturdy, the relative lack of gravity on asteroids might make the actual removal and transport of heavy metals a relatively easy process.&quot; Might be relatively easy? He couldn't say something like, it would be a tremendously difficult and complex feat of engineering, but would have the great advantage of a miniscule escape speed? If you're still not sure, see page 212 for this stunningly unintelligent hot air: &quot;Although a vehicle that can essentially use air as a form of propellant would seem to be the ultimate spacecraft, it does have its limitations, most notably in space where there is no air.&quot; FEEL THE BURN!!! All he's talking about there is air-breathing combustion engines, as space-age as a Ford Model T, which of course are the ultimately WRONG engines to use in the vacuum of space - but he phrases it as if that is a small technical detail. This would feel dumb even relative to the average letter to the editor of &quot;Popular Science.&quot; I can only give Dobbs the benefit of the doubt that he handed off a bunch of half-organized notes to the small-print-listed career shadow writer to assemble into what was supposed to be a coherent book form, and by the time Dobbs saw the finished product, it had already gone to press. So why was I generous enough to give two stars? There is still some interesting information in here, even assuming it is reliable and even if it must be weedled out from among the fluff, which is painful enough to read like AOL Time Warner is experimenting with content-writing software in place of awkward, more expensive human writers. The history of Rene Anselmo's PanAmSat as a renegade startup that now earns a billion dollars a year on GM's behalf is a great example of the tasty tidbits of actual information on space business. Most of the book, though, is a regurgitation of speculations on the future of space business, as if someone decided the world needed a cliff's notes of Gerard O'Neill. Just about all the book's material is covered elsewhere with much more clarity and understanding - the majority is covered with a thousand times more intelligent analysis in the first few chapters of Robert Zubrin's &quot;Entering Space: Creating a Space-Faring Civilization.&quot; In fact, the book co-opts so much previous material in such a dead-on rehash, with so little source documentation, that the book at least borders on plagiarism. (You know when a source does happen to be documented by the humorously dramatic appearance of the word &quot;Source&quot; in parentheses; apparently looking up a standard reference convention in MLA or the Chicago Manual of Style were also beyond the scope of this book, as is any kind of index. Of the sources that are given, most are merely to web sites, another telling testament to the book's research ethic.) Still, hopefully Dobbs' huge mug on the cover - even grainy and slightly out-of-focus as it is - will draw a new cross-section of society into the dialogue on the human future in space. And fleeting through the first half or so of this book is a rational projection of the economic potential of space and an indictment of the bureaucratic domination of the aerospace industry that has stifled progress in the past few decades. I sincerely hope a more responsible commentater takes up the task in the next year or two of releasing the book this should have been. Until then, unless you feel the subject matter here is so compelling to overlook this book's many flaws, you will find your time and money far more rewarded by skipping this slacker's cream puff in favor of Robert Zubrin's &quot;Entering Space.&quot;"},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Math is not among the strong suits in this otherwise readable and informative narrative.

And they dig pretty far down into the space industry (explaining, for instance, the strange relationship between Lockheed and Boeing--another recent headline).Dobbs' knowledge of business serves him well here, and I can't think of any other space book that has really looked at space as a place where hopefully we'll all be doing business some day."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"I am a big Lou Dobbs fan. I have read all his books, and if you like reporters that speak up for the Middle Class, than Lou is your man. He tells it like he sees it, and he pulls no punches. He's a true patriot who attacks Democrats and Republicans alike. If he believes a public official is up to no good, than he will say so, and it doesn't matter who."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Lou Dobbs is a well known American through CNN. I read the book more because of who he is as opposed to his knowledge of space science. The book, after all, is entitled: Space - The Next Business Frontier. For a 2001 publication date, the book was and remains insightful. American space industry still faces the International Traffic in Arms Regulation of the U.S. State Department that he seeks to provide commentary. The Congress has yet to adopt a Zero Gravity Zero Tax regime so desperately needed to foster the commercial space business. After reading this book some time ago, I still cite it now and then because of the business personality author and because of his correct insights to make space commerce more viable even in 2007. It is a contribution to enlisting non-space business niche people to understand the sector's problems. It would be great if he updated and republished."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"As an interested observer since the early 1960s, I found this to be well-thought out and insightful. There have been plenty of problems in space in recent years, but this book shows that with the proper business acumen, we could make &quot;near-space&quot; business a reality. They're already doing &quot;business&quot; on the space station--there's no reason to believe that private enterprise couldn't do it as well. Especially companies like Boeing and Lockheed, which (according to this book) have a huge stake in making space work.And there's nary a word in here about Space.com or CNN, so there's no self-aggrandizing on the part of Dobbs (or Newquist). Good for them that they've kept the focus on space as an industry and not personal projects."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"With Dan Goldin stepping down from NASA, now is the time to really rework that most bloated of agencies. In this book, Dobbs shows that he understands exactly what is wrong with NASA and its culture of complacency. Point after point is made about what can be done--effectively--to get space on the front burner again. Maybe Dobbs is the guy to take over for Goldin. His writing shows that he knows how to talk the talk (and he walks the walk on CNN), so let's give him a shot."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"This book contains a few errors that affect its credibility (e.g. John Glenn was 77, not 65, when he returned to space in '98). The errors don't ruin the positions that the authors take, but they do undermine an arrogant stance that they choose to adopt in places, often directed at NASA; the authors criticize others for such sloppiness and hypocrisy, ironically. Let's raise the bar for everyone involved in the pursuit of space, including the prominent authors of this book. Most readers do want the book to succeed, for space's sake. Have a quick read and provide constructive feedback for the 2nd edition. It needs an index, a bibliography, a more positive balance in places, and some general polish to rid the feeling that the book was rushed to press. It does have interesting content: a look at companies and technologies and trends in the space industry.

Shows a complete lack of understanding of the space industry. Was amused by the other reviewers (Lou Dobbs as NASA Administrator--I guess wasting tens of millions on Space.com wasn't enough for the reviewer). Seems that the other reviews were written by people more interested in space as an idea than as a business. Lou Dobbs should stick to what he does best -- being a business newscaster."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"After a procession of inept Upper Management Lou 'writing' a book 'profiting from his experience' there is a joke.His continued micromanagment and focus on things that didn't really matter in the long term run of the company proved to be a complete waste of time.And some of the Upper management that allowed him to do that were just as guilty of the inevitable failure of the company. While he can be a very charming man, his penchant for megalomania proved to be the detriment of the company.If this is an example on how to run a company, then this should be rephrased on how not to run a company."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Mr. Dobbs's personal interest in space is genuine. So is mine. But to claim that space and business are on the verge of an explosive boom - well, that was over-optimistic even before the Columbia disaster. Now it looks as unlikely as ever.........unless of course American companies are willing to out-source satellite-launching to foreign countries like China, at a fraction of the cost in the US. That's the only hope for a boom in space-related businesses, and the more down-to-Earth solution.A handful of super-rich space-tourists willing to risk their lives on a Russian rocket are simply not enough to make an industry. Besides, manned spaceflight is now on indefinite hold in the US, which renders space tourism stillborn, at least in the US.Mr. Dobbs ought to plant his feet firmly in the ground of reality and make a choice at some point which scenario he prefers. The premises of this book are at best premature - at worst totally unrealistic."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Lou Dobbs is a national embarrassment. He obviously doesn't know how to think straight, as this book clearly shows. It is totally unrealistic. Space is not the next business frontier unless we are willing to hand over the satellite launch business and space tourism business to the low-cost and reliable Chinese. And that's something Dobbs does not realize in his wildest fantasy. This guy has zero imagination and clearly doesn't know how to make money. I wish I could give it zero star as it doesn't deserve any. The author of this book belongs in a lunatic asylum."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Why not let the Chinese make all our rockets to space, under contract from Boeing? After all, their manned spaceflight is a success. Besides, EVERYTHING is now made in China at a fraction of the cost here. This way space business is guaranteed a future. The next frontier indeed."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"It is very ironic that outsourceing to China, the only hope for a boom in the satellite launching business, is repeatedly and heavily criticized by Lou Dobbs's Moneyline on CNN. I see no alternative when the Chinese can do it cheaply and safely while our own space program is not going anywhere. Lou, watch the news as the Chinese send a man to space later this week. And if this doesn't open your eyes, talk to executives at Boeing and ask them what they think of your views. And I haven't even mentioned the numerous technical errors in this book which have been covered clearly and hilariously by somebody else."},{"Title":"Space: The Next Business Frontier","review":"Lou does not have the wits to realize that China is the only hope for future space business. Otherwise his scheme is totally out of this world. Save your money - don't buy this book."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I am the editor of Diabetic Mommy Online Magazine. I have lots of diabetes books in my personal library and there are a select few that I am always recommending to members on my site. This one is now at the top of my list of essential diabetes books for insulin users, both syringe and pump users.I found this book at my local library. I thought it had a catchy title and took it home. Cute title aside, this book took me by total surprise. It is now on my wish-list because it will make a tremendous difference in my self-management plus I want to mark this baby up with notes.If you have diabetes, you might be like me...you read in books and hear organizations stressing self-management however your own healthcare team won't give you enough information to make corrections on your own so you are still dependent on them for every single little adjustment. Busy schedules for all parties mean that a simple correction can be a hassle and a long wait.This book is not intended to be a replacement for your healtcare team, don't get me wrong, but it provides you with enough information so that you will not be totally helpless and you will have more knowledge to work WITH your team rather than just be the recipient of instructions.This book covers many topics: Why diabetics need to be in control of their glucose levels, history of diabetes, insulin basics, tips, various methods of insulin dosing, having diabetes in the \\"real\\" world, hypo/hyperglycemia, resources, forms, and easy formulas for personalizing your insulin doses and timing, etc. It is the most detailed and clear book on the subject I have seen yet.Something else this book has going for it is great clear writing and the unavoidable good-humor of the author. He really made me chuckle. If you are a pop-culture fan like me...and you recognize the phrase, \\"Hi, I'm Larry, this is my brother Darryl and this is my other brother Darryl,\\" Then you'll feel right at home with this book!I also found very interesting facts that I didn't know before - such as mind work lowers your glucose levels and that caffeine effects your glucose levels.The only slight problem I had was that the author seems to be a man who really loves sports - while I am a woman who really does not! Many of his analogies use sporting examples which most of the time leave me pretty clueless. In addition, he definitely communicates \\"man-style.\\" He uses very visual-type examples and explanations.For example, I feel if the author were to give my husband and I driving directions, my husband would understand right away and take off. (He wouldn't necesarrily find the place - haha) I, on the other hand, would have to review the info, ask for landmarks, and make some notes. (I would find it for sure!)While the book gives detailed and complete information, I would have found a little summarizing in the form of a cheat sheet would have been fantastic. Worksheets to enter your information and make up your personal plan would be great too. He does have helpful log sheets in the book.As a result of reading this book, I feel more empowered regarding my ability to troubleshoot and correct. And it will open up a dialogue with my healthcare team and possibly start a battle with my insurance company. I found in my own personal case (and everyone is different), I would probably do best with a pump. In lieu of that, long-acting, short-acting AND an occasional intermediate acting insulin via syringes would be good too. I would feel confident enough to make the suggestions to my team, but I don't know how realistic it would be for them to provide me with all three different types of insulin. I woudn't hold my breath for a pump either!In spite of this, I still give the book 5 stars because I feel it is so valuable and there is more than enough information for me to make my own info sheets and make suggestions for my care."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I have been a diabetic for over twenty-eight years and have read many books on diabetes through the years. This book , has by far, been the most informative, easiest to comprehend, and I found it quite fascinating. There are many new things to learn.

Every practical detail of being in control of your diabetes, eating exactly what you want, when you want to (like \\"normal\\" people). He tells you how to match your insulin to your food instead of matching your food to your insulin without being an angel. When your doctor calls you with your A1C results you'll no longer hear the catch-all, meaningless \\"Watch Your Diet Better\\". Instead you will hear \\"Fantastic!\\", Keep Up the Good Work!, \\" AND you will feel like a million bucks - You'll be surprised at just how good normal feels again."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This book is credible because the author has researched the facts and has the disease. No laundry list of simple steps but rather a realistic discussion of the many frustrations associated with diabetes, the proactive actions recommended make sense without making it sound easy to achieve. Since this is the reality of diabetes management, the book's tone engages the reader who is has realized this will take commitment but wants to know there is a plan that works."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This book is a great overview of the basics on how to deal with using insulin. At the same time, there are a lot of individualized issues for staying out of trouble that each diabetic learns with time for him/herself that the book doesn't quite get to. With the upcoming availability of continuous sensors for blood sugar monitoring in conjunction with fingerstick testing, this field is going soon to expand into a whole new world of improved management that will require the next edition. I'd recommend this edition right now, though, for a thorough start."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"After reading this book going on the 3rd time, I am still discovering more and more ways to improve my insulin regimine. I was diagnosed as a Type I diabetic 06/82 at the age of 13 months old. I will be 26 in two weeks and have maintained acceptable control but felt that I truly haven't gotten to where I want my health to be. After reading hands on information in this text, I am happy with producing an HbA1C of 6.7%, and I look forward to bringing it closer to 6% as possible. This comes after maintaining a 7-8% average over the course of many years and thanfully there have not been any long-term consequences \\"yet\\".To anyone that feels they need some additional help with control, wants to refresh themselves on care methods, or anyone recently diagnosed I would recommend this book to. It is imformative, it is easy to read, and the overall context is a very laid back approach with a semi-humorus attitude at times. My girlfriend just finished reading this book and is already helping me with fine tuning my basal and bolus rates. I firmly believe that with all of this in mind, this book is worth more than it's weight in gold."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"A direct approach, with illustrative examples, to creating a protocol to control your blood sugars. It's written in simple language and well organized, providing a step by step approach to figuring out your basal rates, insulin sensitivity, and carb ratios. Provides insights into the many, many, many (many, many, many) factors that can influence your blood sugars. Well thought out and presented graphs illustrate the effects of insulin. Simple tables illustrate averages for basal rates, boluses, carb rations and sensitivity, offering a good starting place for divining your own settings. Some simple tables of carb content and glycemic indexes. An interesting table for calculating the effect of exercise on blood sugar.I'd recommend for anyone who's BG is on a roller coaster. It's informative but not preachy.Terry"},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I have a medical background so I was interested in reading about this technique. I'm still taking my insulin (70/30) twice a day, but have gotten up the courage to experiment a little bit. You really have to be determined if you are going to count carbs, carb factors, etc. I'm still learning. To really follow the book you need slow acting and fast acting insulin and I'm still too scared to try that. I told my nurse practitioner about the book and she asked if she could borrow it! Guess that speaks for the reliable information and instruction it provides. I need to do a lot more studying, but what the author says is right on. And it's funny--very nice touch when you are a new diabetic and can't find much humor in anything at first! It made me forget my plan to jump off a bridge... There's hope!"},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"After almost 5 years as a Type 2 Diabetic I finally reached the point where the oral medications no longer worked and insulin was prescribed. That was about 5 months ago and since that day my insulin experience had been filed with frustration and disappointment. No matter what I did I rarely got my glucose to stay below 250-300. I didn't really know what I was doing other than shooting myself 4 to 5 times a day with insulin in the hopes that a miracle would take place and my body would eventually respond favorably.I bought this book as a last ditch effort, hoping that it might give me some direction. I began carefully calculating the carb counts of my meals and the dosing of my Basal & Bolus injections according to the formulas & tables in the book and that miracle happened! Within 48 hours my daytime insulin was down to between 128 & 150. My morning glucose levels were an acceptible 120 to 180. (still working on fine tuning that).If you are frustrated with the results of your insulin therapy and are serious about getting it under control, this book, in conjunction with a big book of food carbohydrate values may very well do the trick!The book provides the same types of helpful information for insulin pump users as well. If you are diabetic and your diabetes is out of control you can't go wrong with this book. After all, isn't your continued health worth the price of a paperback book? Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I have been type 1 for over 20 years and have always tried to stay as well informed as possible.

I really hope that there will be another version some day that includes more information on continuous glucose monitoring systems."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This book has it all. The content is useful and relevant to all people with type 1 diabetes. Even better, it's written clearly and elegantly with a sprinkling of good humor that makes it an easy read.

If you have diabetes or care for someone that has diabetes, read this book."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I tried to find something to read to manage diabetes with insulin but was almost impossible. There are lot of places on the net very fatalist only talking about all the complications and the terrible dead that will occur if you don't control well the sugar levels. However this book talk about the complications but only a few pages.The author writes in a very easy way to understand how to manage type 1 diabetes with insulin, something very difficult but with the explanations on the book is easier to control the sugar, was very helpful to me because i live in Mexico and here is almost impossible to find good information even doctors are not very helpful."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"Great book for someone beginning insulin injections.

It has given me insights into my diabetes and is well worth the read."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This isn't a bad book if you are new to using insulin, but just FYI: this book still talks about Lente/Ultralente, which is no longer available, at least in the US. There is some info on Lantus, which has taken over as a basal for many insulin users, but not enough. It has a lot of info on NPH, which many users have stopped using now that Lantus/Determir are available. So the insulin info is dated.Also a caution: the writer uses a pump. Expect to read pump-biased therapy. If you want a good book that is more up-to-date on insulins and methodology, as well as dietary guidelines, get Dr. Bernstein's Diabetes Solution (the 2007 edition). With the Bernstein book, you'll learn how to inject insulin in minute doses to approximate the results from a pump without the pump hassles or the pump cost."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"I like this book.

I would prefer some distintions to be detailed but they do not affect living with diabetes requiring or depending on insulin. I have been using insulin for over 14 years and am 53 years old.

'Think like a Pancreas' was thoroughly enjoyed by my husband and me. Very honest & 'Let's get on with it' attitude written by someone who knows. The other book, for both the parent & child, was 'Type 1 Diabetes in Children, Adolescents and Young Adults: How to Become an Expert on Your Own Diabetes'. I would purchase the latter first, then Pancreas, then... when you're ready, let's say 3-4 weeks into this new diagnosis, I recommend learning about the GI (Glycemic Index) of food. But don't worry about this until some of the fog clears."},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This book was recommended to me by another diabetic who found it extremely useful.

My 5 year old daughter is Type 1 diagnosed a year ago. I read as much as I can on diabetes and found this book answered those little nagging questions I have always had. We have a great endo but they can only give you so much information at each appointment.

I got some good advice from my diabetes nurse educator and then went straight to Amazon to look for books that would help. This one jumped out at me because I was told I was being put on intensive insulin therapy because my pancreas quit producing any insulin at all, and this seemed like the perfect book for me. It was! The information does tie in with the info my clinic gave me, but it also gave me important questions to ask on my next visit. I wound up giving my copy to someone I met in the doctors office because she saw me reading it and found it so helpful. It's not terribly expensive, so I just ordered a new one for myself.

I don't know about you, but the real information you need from the doctor to start basal and bolus injections or pumping insulin is minimal or sketchy at best. There are so many factors influencing just where to start and where to go from there that a physician just can't spend that kind of time with you. Maybe it's very inconvenient or impossible to get to an endocrinologist or go to classes. This book will give you the information you need to avoid doing more harm than good! Formulas are there for titrating your bolus/bolus/pump insulin based on weight, based on your personal rate of absorption, what to do when things go wrong, all the what, where, whens and hows you need to know to get your blood sugars under control. There are also plenty of websites mentioned to follow up on any further research. It really is a MUST HAVE book!"},{"Title":"Think Like a Pancreas: A Practical Guide to Managing Diabetes with Insulin","review":"This great book shares the experience and knowledge the author, Gary Scheiner, has.

The parts that I found most useful were in figuring out proper basal and bolus amounts. Diabetes (at least in my case) tends to change over time, sometimes I need more insulin and a year later I need less, so having a good guide to figure out good numbers to minimized both highs and lows is great.

Understanding Art","review":"Stephen Little has created a brief, succinct, thorough, and portable little book that provides a much-needed resource. No matter where you are with art, be it novice, museum visitor, gallery wanderer, artist, teacher, collector, writer, essayist, advanced art historian who makes frequent speeches, this book is so well done it is as valuable as a dictionary or a thesaurus.Little has addressed the problem we all have: he has provided information with visual examples for all the periods and trends of art throughout history that can be confusing at best, contradictory at worst. Some of these periods are vague both in reality and in Little's book, but they are nonetheless defined in a scholarly, reader-friendly way. From trying to remember Baroque vs Rococo, Mannerism vs Symbolism, Impressionism vs Post Impressionism, Modernism, Cubism, Fauvism, Conceptualism vs Neo Conceptualism, Surrealism vs Illusionism, etc etc etc - it is all here: instant information regarding definition, time frame of each ism, list of artists of that ilk, and full color images of examples. The book is written in chronological order and does not linger on any one period, but instead maintains the speedy accessible overview of information we all should have at hand.Recommendation? Buy this book. No matter your degree of interest or level of expertise, this is truly a valuable little volume of beautiful information. Highly Recommended! Grady Harp, January 06"},{"Title":"Isms.. Understanding Art","review":"Isms: Understanding Art is a handy, little, reference book outlining the major visual art movements in an easy to follow manner. This is the perfect primer for those of us interested in art but without the background to know the painters, movements, and history surrounding a favorite style of work. Each section explains the particular movement in a light, easy to understand way and includes photos and information about key artists of the period.Not really appropriate for \\"in-depth\\" study, this book is perfect for the beginning art student or those who want to enjoy the museums and galleries."},{"Title":"Isms.. Understanding Art","review":"This book is a quick reference of major styles of visual arts with a very brief descriptions, most known artists and works. Because of it's small size, the reproductions are tiny and the descriptions usually are just a few lines long. Sounds like a not very useful book to you, doestn't it? Well, actually it has it's niche. Let's say you want to take your girlfriend (ok, let's say your kid) to an art museum and look smart. Or you want to buy some painting for your office and need to decide about style. Or you've been just always curious how visual art can be categorized. So this is one of those things like a street map or a sticker with a few phone numbers on your fridge. Yes, you can get better information from other sources, but sometimes you don't want to go deep into details and just want have something handy."},{"Title":"Isms.. Understanding Art","review":"Last year I received a membership to the Philadelphia Museum of Art and I have spent as much time there as possible since. I have no formal art training. I found this book to be simply incredible. It is easy to understand the main points of each movement.At first, I found the four categories (broad cultural trend, artist defined movement, retroactively applied label, and trend within the visual arts) Little uses to classify the movements to be cumbersome and difficult to understand. However, by the middle of the book I found myself looking at each of the categories more and more frequently to help me to understand how and why the movement got its start.Art reflects the times in which it originates and it is usually born from the previous movements. This book captures the dialectical relationship between each movement and its predecessors. Artists seem to want to understand the world as it truly is and they are convinced that their point of view is correct. Little explains this point of view and the conflict between movements perfectly. I can't wait to learn more about art and art history. I feel like this book has prepared me to begin to learn about art."},{"Title":"Isms.. Understanding Art","review":"This is a handy dandy little book that serves as a quick reference guide for art movements. It, however, has a few shortcomings. The first is that the author makes up a few of the \\"isms.\\" The terms he makes up are marked--sort of, but are still hard to keep straight. The book progresses in chronological order, but it is confusing when the author delves into trends within movements. This book would benefit tremendously from a foldout timeline and some sort of chart to indicate how/when the various movement occurred in relation to each other. Overall, it is a good little reference, but be wary of which terms you use when in the company of those educated in art history."},{"Title":"Isms.. Understanding Art","review":"Great book and design. As a new artist I'm finding it very helpful though to list the dimensions of the works. I was recently surprised to note some of Paul Klee's works are only 8x10 inches, though when viewing a book or on a website one might think the work to be much bigger. Knowing the scale is good for a beginning artist to understand as they begin to create works of their own."},{"Title":"Isms..

The artworks in each section are grouped by the museums where they are on display so that visitors to each museum can view the representative paintings shown as well as others mentioned. The book also lists similar trends as well as those that are dissimilar, and gives a graphic timeline at the end of all the \\"isms\\" listed.

You may also be looking for ways to increase your value to your team. If so, this book should be a tremendous help you.The Intervention Resource Guide (IRG) is a work that should sit not on your bookshelf, but on your desk top as a ready reference. I will not attempt to evaluate each intervention, as valuable as they are (of the ones I have used), but choose to focus on the heart of the book, &quot;Part One, Intervention Selection and Implementation&quot; which includes the &quot;Matrix of Interventions&quot;.The editors have efficiently and credibly provided the leader-manager with the ability to make use of the proper intervention given the goal of: &quot;Establishing, Improving, Maintaining or Extinguishing&quot; performance in the &quot;Business unit, Process, Work group, or Individual&quot;. All 50 interventions are evaluated for relevency against the above eight factors. By using their intervention selection model, any leader and manager should be able to select a proven intervention leading to a high probability of performance improvement. Conversely the avoidance of selecting the wrong intervention is just as valuable, and through use of the matrix, the leader should be able to avoid costly damage to the organization she serves.The Intervention Resource Guide provides an elegant solution to the workplace manager that wants to make the best use of systematic performance improvement tools."},{"Title":"Intervention Resource Guide: 50 Performance Improvement Tools","review":"At last!

I get so overwhelmed with all the new interventions that abound - and I don't have time to go to ALL the conference presentations, or read ALL the articles in professional journals, so say nothing about reading all the books out there. This book gives me good, clear overviews that have shed light into the shadows.As a validity check, I looked at interventions I know. Yep, what was covered was right on! So I'll trust that those I don't know are also well presented.One overview I browsed was a bit, hmmm, well, pedantic. One sentence I read 4 times but was none the wiser. Fortunately I browsed again and found other overviews that were clear and easy to understand.

The book helps you to convince the client not to &quot;jump&quot; to any fashional intervention, and to have corelation between the &quot;medicine&quot; and the dyagnostic phase. And, above all, the book talks in an international language, which fits the time of globalization. Here, overseas, the book is written in a common terminology, that fits our culture.

Recently, &quot;Job Aids&quot; was very helpful with a client who has high seasonal employment needs to assure good customer service and satisfaction.

For one who does not have time to keep up with all the literature, this is a valuable resource.In addition, many of the chapters have samples, models and other useful exhibits that convey a lot of information as well as provide good summaries of the approaches offered.

I really appreciate the user-friendly way The Intervention Resource Guide is organized and the powerful simplicity and clarity of its writings. Specifically, I found the &quot;back to the basics&quot; information in the introductory chapters on selecting and implementing interventions helped me re-focus on the important fundamentals of our work. The short, yet content dense section on &quot;How to Build Your Own Repertoire of Interventions&quot; is filled with concrete, practical suggestions to deepen expertise, which challenged me to re-consider the degree to which I personally have contributed to the field of human performance technology. I really liked how the tools were dual-classified in the Matrix of Interventions; both factors, &quot;the kind of performance change&quot; and &quot;level of audience,&quot; are a highly effective and useful way of organizing the interventions. The consistent presentation of information on each tool makes it easy to zero in on the content.My suggestions to the editors for their next edition is threefold: explicitly define the criteria for including a tool, use this criteria to choose tools that are consistent with each other in scope, and include in an introductory chapter a conceptual model and practical information on the relationship of related professional fields to Human Performance Technology and the tools.This book is a worthwhile investment. I plan to keep it within easy reach in my office."},{"Title":"Intervention Resource Guide: 50 Performance Improvement Tools","review":"As a manager of a large organization, I am constantly faced with situations where I want to implement new interventions to meet my ever-changing business needs. This is an excellent resource for helping me to identify the possible interventions needed and trigger my thinking about options to achieve my objectives. In the past I have had to use an HR professional or do a lot of digging to find what I can now find in one convenient book. In addition it gives me case studies that help me to see if the application will meet my need.

As an experienced practitioner, I regularly come across problems that are a little different from what I've seen before and I am always on the lookout for good tools. This book provides brief reviews of a wide variety of tools. It doesn't teach how to use the tools, but it does tell me enough so that I can decide whether I want to REALLY learn about a specific tool.I put this book on the same shelf as my ASTD Reference Guides. I don't read it (or them) like a book to teach me about Expert Systems. I read it to assess whether an Expert System might be a tool I could use with a current need with a specific client. If the answer is yes, then I'll go find a good book or program on Expert Systems. Since we all seems to have different language for similar tools, this book is very helpful.My critique of the book is in the selection of tools. Some tools are very specific, while some tools (e.g., training) are very broad. A more consistent scope of tools would strengthen the book. Still, as a resource for identifying and initially assessing the usefulness of intervention tools, it is very good."},{"Title":"Intervention Resource Guide: 50 Performance Improvement Tools","review":"I've been in the performance improvement world for 15 years and found the book a wonderful way to expand my knowledge beyond my set of experiences.

It just jumps on my chest and starts wailing on me. Bam! Bam! Bam! And so I'm, like, &quot;what the f*ck?&quot; I try to tear it off of me, but I just get a bunch of paper cuts all over my hands. Paper won't tear. Too tough. Next thing you know, I'm on the floor crawling around trying to get out my lighter, but it sees me reaching for my pocket and it kicks it away. I gotta tell you, I was scared. Anyway, just when I thought that was it, lights out for old Alphonse, the book sees the copy of Grickle I got last month ago off of Bruno.

But he manages to portray their conscience and their deep-rooted fears and hopes as well. I love how adeptly such subtle themes of loneliness, self-doubt, relief, and satisfaction are packaged into such an enjoyable work of twisted humor. Do yourself a favor and read it more than once. It is at once leisurely, funny, clever and insightful, so you might not be able to catch all that the first time around."},{"Title":"Grickle","review":"Reading this book is like hangin with a good friend.

As a German-German dictionary, this stands head and shoulders above the best English-German German-English dictionary you can buy. Whereas the EG/GE dictionaries usually just match up German words to their English counterparts and vice versa, the Duden gives you genuine *definitions*. The result is that you are far less likely to use German words in inappropriate contexts: For example, thinking that because 'werfen' means 'throw', the translation of 'throw a party' is 'eine Party werfen' (it's not). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Duden, deutsches Universalworterbuch (German Edition)","review":"Can't truly say that I've read this whole book, after all, it has 1,816 pages, is three inches thick and has three columns of very small type on each page. This is not an English to German / German to English dictionary. It is a German dictionary written entirely in German. That is, it has German definitions---which is why I got it for Christmas two seasons ago. This is a great reference work, especially if you are confused by multiple German entries for English words in the standard German-English / English-German dictionaries. Although the print is small, it is very distinct, with the bold type standing out well above the rest. Each entry is also very comprehensive. Of course, because Germans have such long words, most of the entries are replete with abbreviations, but don't worry, there's a long listing of them in the front of the book along with a concise grammar guide and other amenities."},{"Title":"Around the Southern Table","review":"This is an excellent modern cookbook with delightful historical excerpts.

I watched two of the three main subjects of this book in action: Rudolph Wanderone (The Fat Man) and Luther Lassiter. Having frequented some of the New York pool joints (McGirrs, 7-11) that figure in R.A. Dyer's vivid depiction of the hustler's life, I can partly attest to its authenticity.But I was a player not a hustler. What Dyer gave me was the full and colorful history of the era that I saw ending. This is a beautifully written account covering the 1940s through the 60s. The story is told with the steely, merciless attitude of their game, but with a great deal of humor and affection.Dyer has written about the game in various publications and he appreciates the astounding skills of these men: the hustle was in the fact that if you were not in their world, you had no idea of the abilities that could be brought to bear against you if you went to the table.Anyone who saw \\"The Hustler\\" with Paul Newman has some idea of all this. But Dyer digs deep into their lives, sometimes painfully so. The canvas is not just New York but all the towns, big and small, where the action was. Such as Norfolk, Va., the Naval and shipbulding hub which during WWII was a pool hustler's paradise and a regular stop on the circuit.Once tournaments began to be televised, another chapter in the hustler's life opened and Dyer has it covered, shot by excruciating shot. Big-time pool is all about pressure, and with Dyer you can feel it taking the air out of the room.I loved reading this book and look forward to reading it again."},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"This is a great book for all the baby boomers out there that loved to play pool (pocket billiards).

Dyer will certainly be at the top of my gift list for the men and sports lovers in my family!"},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"R. A. Dyer's book is an interesting read that gives you an insight into the lives of three of the greatest legends to ever play the game of pool. He takes takes you back to the days of dark, smoky pool halls and the hustlers that made a living off of the innocent wanna-be's. However, this is not just a book about Fats, Wimpy, and Red, it's a book about life in a most difficult of times. If you love the game of pool and the history of the game, this is a must-read."},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"Watching the lives of these truly American sportsmen as they intersect is a fascinating human drama. Dyer draws you deeply into their worlds and then places you alongside them on their collision course. I'm not a pool aficionado, but I found this book impossible to put down. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"Pool is probably one of the few sports that the general public knows virtually next to nothing on. Ask anybody to name one pool player and the majority will say \\"Minnesota Fats\\". Most of the public would be amazed to find out that he wasn't a champion, never won a tournament, probably couldn't even beat half the country. This book explains how he could con a nation into thinking he was \\"the greatest\\" and in the process become single handedly the biggest promoter to the sport the game has ever known. Yes, this book is really about the true story of Rudolph Wanderone (Fats) and it is a very good read."},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"Who wouldn't want to be a pool hustler, being rich without ever having to work a day in your life? It's an exciting fantasy. To live in Little Egypt during the early 40's shooting pool with Minnesota Fats would've been incredible. Or riding with Sonny Barger in the mid 60's or any other kind of walk on the wild side fantasy one could concoct.The author clearly feels the same way in a midlife crisis sort of way. The subject matter is definitely fascinating, but I wish R.A. Dyer could've taken himself out of the text more. The book reads like he learned all his tough guy speech patterns from Scorcese films.Another thing that would've helped the prose is to explain the games more within the text. To an outsider it could get difficult during the game decriptions. It've been nice to not have to constantly check the glossary in the back."},{"Title":"Hustler Days: Minnesota Fats, Wimpy Lassiter, Jersey Red, and America's Great Age of Pool","review":"This book is outstanding! It garners that rating because it accurately depicts the character and lifestyle of the three spot-lighted players. I know; I played Wimpy and the Squirrel in 1962 in Johnson City. I wasn't in the tournament per se, ( I had a real job) but came down on one weekend from Chicago with other Bensinger and 20th Century players ( Youngblood, Mexican Johnny, and Billy the Kid) for the action. I saw Fats there but never saw him play. He was side-betting and looking for prop plays. I saw Jersey Red at 20th Century in either the fall of '63 or '64, I can't pinpoint which.

I had been given vol. 1, 2, 3, and 5, and so was very glad that I was able to purchase vol 4 from Amazon. This set of books does have some controversy surrounding it concerning whether the Roman Catholic Church has granted its approval as private revelation or if it has rejected it. Whatever the case, I found it to be very helpful in deepening my appreciation for all that Jesus Christ has done for us and thereby increasing my love for Him."},{"Title":"POEM OF THE MAN-GOD, THE, Volume Four (4)","review":"I can not say enough good things about this book. You learn so much about the life of Jesus. It just expands your faith and brings you closer to Jesus. Just wonderful BUY IT!"},{"Title":"POEM OF THE MAN-GOD, THE, Volume Four (4)","review":"After the Holy Bible and the most sacred perennial books of the Catholic Faith (the Summa Theologica, etc.), there is perhaps no greater book that exists in the world today than the Poem of the Man-God, and I think it is truly impossible for any person of good will to not only highly benefit from reading it; but I would go so far as to say that any person of good will who reads it will almost certainly have his life changed profoundly in some way.I believe the Poem of the Man-God is one of the greatest gifts and mercies God has ever given to mankind, and that it is of such importance as to be listed, historically, side by side, with the Sacred Heart revelations, La Salette, Lourdes, Fatima, the Miraculous Medal, and all of the great Church-approved private revelations of history; and that it is so lofty and magnificent that it even surpasses all visions and dictations of the life of Christ and of the Blessed Virgin ever given to mankind to date, including those written by Blessed Anne Catherine Emmerich and those written by Venerable Mary of Agreda in her world-renowned work, The Mystical City of God.I found an online e-book about Maria Valtorta and the Poem of the Man-God which the well-known Valtorta site \\"Maria Valtorta Webring\\" has hosted for download. To find the download link for it, google \\"Maria Valtorta Web Ring\\", go to their site, and on their home page, scroll down to the \\"Poem of the Man-God Research Document\\".This e-book is a comprehensive and well-researched guide to everything a Catholic could want to know about Maria Valtorta's Poem of the Man-God, including its importance, its history, its ecclesiastical status, how it compares to other revelations, the 14 proofs of its divine origin, and its critics and defenses.This free e-book is the result of hundreds of hours of research over 6 months, utilizing a tremendous number of Internet and printed sources. To give you a taste of its level of depth and scholarship: it has 902 references/endnotes.Check it out. Also check out the trailer, which can be found by googling \\"Poem of the Man-God research document trailer\\".A high-ranking prelate personally handed Pope Pius XII a 12-volume typewritten copy of the Poem of the Man-God in 1947. Pope Pius XII put these volumes into his personal library, and an eyewitness reported that there was a bookmark in them, and that it moved over time. After these volumes were evaluated by the Pope for a year, he granted a special audience with the three Servites of Mary in charge of this work. At this audience, as Bishop of Rome and the Vicar of Christ, Pope Pius XII gave the Poem of the Man-God an official imprimatur, commanding them to publish it, saying: \\"Publish it just as it is. There is no need to give an opinion as to whether it is of supernatural origin. Who reads it will understand.\\" (Pope Pius XII to Frs. Berti, Migliorini, and Cecchin on February 26, 1948). Father Berti testifies: \\"I asked the Pope if we should remove the inscriptions: \`Visions' and \`Dictations' from The Poem before publishing it. And he answered that nothing should be removed.\\"A long-time spiritual daughter of Saint Padre Pio, Mrs. Elisa Lucchi, in 1967, asked him in Confession, \\"Father, I have heard mention of Maria Valtorta's books. Do you advise me to read them?\\" St. Padre Pio replied, \\"I don't advise you to [read Maria Valtorta's books] - I ORDER you to!\\"Blessed Gabriel M. Allegra, O.F.M., a very holy missionary, world-renowned theologian, & the only beatified biblical scholar of the 20th century, wrote:\\"I assure you that the Poem of the Man-God immensely surpasses whatever descriptions -- I do not say of mine, because I do not know how to write -- but of any other writer... It is a work which makes one grow in the knowledge and love of the Lord Jesus and of His Holy Mother... I hold that the work demands a supernatural origin.\\""},{"Title":"POEM OF THE MAN-GOD, THE, Volume Four (4)","review":"I bought this set in 1991 and have read about 80% of it over the past two decades. It's incredible. People today argue over the books and whether they're divinely inspired. Personally, I believe they are. However, if they aren't, then they are the most incredible work of historical literature you will ever encounter. Even in the Bible, it says \\"Jesus did many other things as well. If every one of them were written down, I suppose that even the whole world would not have room for the books that would be written.\\" (John 21:25, New KJV).You can read about the books and the visionary Maria Vatorta online so I am writing here only of my own experience. The Poem of the Man-God brings the stories of the Bible to life in vivid detail. Reading it is like being of the middle of the scene, with sights, sounds, smells, and other senses. One year, I read all of the Easter stories during Holy Week, reading day by day as it happened. It was the most amazing and awe inspiring experience. Never have I felt the depth of sorrow of Good Friday nor the overwhelming joy of Easter Sunday so profoundly. Another time, I read the portions related to Mary Magdalene and it helped me better understand my own emotional life.These books will not, and should not, replace reading the Bible. It is, however, a wonderful way to deepen your connection to Jesus. I am not a Bible scholar, but I've read the Bible nearly all my life. After reading thousands of pages of Poem of the Man-God, I have yet to read anything that contradicts the scriptures or my faith. In fact, it helps me better understand how they all fit together. Reading Poem of the Man-God has deepened my faith, opened my heart, touched my soul and expanded my understanding.Because people feel strongly about the work (for or against) I suggest that you find some excerpts online, pray for guidance, read them, and decide whether you feel God reaching out to you through this work. Buying Poem of the Man-God is one of the best spiritually-motivated investments I've made. It strengthened my faith and changed my life. I wish you strength, peace and wisdom on your own faith journey..."},{"Title":"POEM OF THE MAN-GOD, THE, Volume Four (4)","review":"I've just finished reading all five volumes of Maria Valtorta's The Poem of the Man God. I really can't say enough good things about these books. The print is small and each book is over 900 pages but they held me captivated to the end. (They have now released smaller easier to read books 7 volumes rather than 5) They are probably the most inspiring books I've ever read. They are based on visions Maria Valtorta had over many years mostly while she was bedridden. They are beautifully written and the detail is amazing. It transports you back to the time of Christ and you learn so much about the history, customs, and people of that time. It is a hundred times more detailed than the Bible. You truly understand Jesus in a way that uplifts and inspires. The detail is so rich and well written you feel you are walking with Jesus, Mary, and the apostles and disciples. Reading this book truly helps you become a better person with a deeper understanding of what Jesus came here to accomplish and the importance of love. Even if you don't agree with all the information contained in the visions, (I didn't agree that marriage is till death and that reincarnation doesn't exist) the books kept me spellbound. They are the type of books you can go back to over and over, and with each reading your insights will grow deeper."},{"Title":"Peleliu: Tragic Triumph: The Untold Story of the Pacific War's Forgotten Battle","review":"This is probably the best account of this particular tragic battle I have come across. The battle alone, Peleliu, is not well known and now that it falls into the category of \\"ancient history\\" by the younger set, is even less heard of. This is a shame. The history of the U.S.M.C. is a testament to the ability and endurance of the American fighting man and woman Never has there been a better example than this forgotten battle. I have had the honor of having several conversations with two of the survivors of this epic battle...it is hard to imagine that the human body and spirit could survive such a thing. They did. The author has done his research with this one. He has been able to address the controversies surrounding this episode without distracting from the bravery of the men who took part in it. There is much to be learned here, both of the human condition and of military blunders and why they happen. I highly recommend this one be added to your collection."},{"Title":"Peleliu: Tragic Triumph: The Untold Story of the Pacific War's Forgotten Battle","review":"With only two reader reviews to this point, it is possible that this book has not had much readership. Tis a shame, since when compared to some of the books written shortly after this engagement, this one is certainly more comprehensive and insightful. With the added benefit of the previous books and other documents, plus interviews and correspondence, this book reflects a wealth of research, in addition to being well written. Also, when compared to the more recent book, Last Man Standing, by Dick Camp, it is certainly a better choice for understanding this battle.There is plenty of controversy about the need for the battle at Peleliu as well how it was conducted. Bill Ross addresses both and doesn't mince words with regard to his views. He extoles the courage and spirit of the fighting forces while questioning the \\"leadership\\". It begins with Admiral Nimitz's decision to pursue this battle despite solid evidence that it was no longer necessary. It ends when General Rupertus is belately overruled and the Army finally brought in from reserve to replace the few remaining combat capable marines.Other books to consider on this battle are With the Old Breed at Peleliu and Okinawa (Sledge), Coral Comes High (Hunt) and The Devil's Anvil (Hallas)."},{"Title":"Peleliu: Tragic Triumph: The Untold Story of the Pacific War's Forgotten Battle","review":"Out standing and extremely well written book on this \\"storm landing\\".

It appears to be a book in one of those series one sees today made up of short works about Great Men (Winston Churchill, Napoleon, Jimmy Carter) or Great Things (Buddha, Imperialism, Peanut Butter) that seem to proliferate today. A wonderful introduction to this difficult, sprawling topic. It is an injustice that this work is out of print. Oh, and I certainly enjoyed Simon Schama's Citizens which does not disagree with this work in its essentials."},{"Title":"The French Revolution, (Home university library of modern knowledge)","review":"As expected with Belloc, the prose in this book is a delight to read. His main thesis gives the lie to the unsophisticated post-modern interpretation of Belloc as a right-wing idealogue. He eloquently manages to sympathize with both the Revolution and the Reaction (especially its Catholic elements.) This book, along with Belloc, deserves a little deeper thought and analysis than many of our post-modernist contemporaries seem capable of giving."},{"Title":"An Unsocial socialist (Collected Works of Bernard Shaw)","review":"As the previous reviewer has noted this book is hard to put down. I was most impressed with the author's ability to successfully create a colorful (as in inflection-filled) and thus dynamic commentary.

I only gave it 4 stars because in the end, though the book had me laughing throughout and was very entertaining, it both began and ended abruptly with the oddest of situations.

He's got a full-on crush for the leading lady, Myrtle Manners, and fancies that any glance she gives him means that she's burning up with love for him. His chance to impress her comes when he stunt doubles for the cowardly leading man Jack La Rue, who flat-out refuses to enter a lion's cage to save Myrtle in a scene. However, Tommy's bravado quickly melts when faced with the tame old lion and he makes a mess of the entire shot.Great story, and very funny. It's a fabulous snapshot of the motion picture industry at the time (1913), and Van Loan illuminates the movie-making process for his readers. It sounds elementary to us today, but the nuts and bolts of movie-making were still rather new to the movie-going public:Scenes are photographed with an eye to background or location and no regard for sequence. The complete plan exists only in the magnificent mind of the producing director. Picking up the plot of a moving picture by following the actors at their work would be as easy a task as unraveling Monte Cristo by reading chapters at random. This is one reason why seasoned moving-picture actors seldom ask questions. The director tells them what to do and they do it.Thus Myrtle Manners did not ask questions when she was given a Spanish costume, though she wondered what she was to do with the short rawhide whip. (p. 32)Van Loan's portrayal of the film industry has the smell of accuracy where later novels always seem tainted by the advances made in the system. Rather than writing about what early movie-making was like, to me the post-talkie portrayals have always seemed like what we imagine the silent era was like. The Keystone Cops and corny melodramas are the stock images of silent movies, but this story was about the making of an action movie of the period and wasn't made exaggerated or ridiculous. It's what goes on behind the scenes that supplies the humor.For those familiar with early silent film, Titan Pictures (with its massive animal zoo and high output of jungle pictures) is obviously inspired by pioneering Selig Polyscope, which was famous for the same. The head of Titan is even called David Seligman. Rounding off the similarities are studios in both Chicago and a tiny little cow town with great weather called Los Angeles.Part of the story is told from the lion's POV, which was a funny twist. Duke's an old trooper, formerly abused at the circus, who knows he's got a good gig humoring the actors and just wants to do his schtick and take a nap. In the end, it's Duke's hide that is worth far more than the spazzy Tommy.In case you're wondering where \\"Buck Parvin\\" comes in, he's a veteran cowboy stunt double who talks a good tale and knows everything about everything. For Tommy, Buck's expertise with the ladies makes him the go-to guy for his Myrtle dilemma.International Cup (July 12, 1913) 4 1/2 stars--Kenneth Clifford Devenham is a British lad visiting the States who has spent all his money on installments for the Grand Canyon and buying a ranch in the Rockies outside Chicago. (Not too swift is our Kenneth.) He's moping over his sweetie back in England and wondering what he should do when Fate intervenes. Titan Pictures is about to make a polo movie and British toffs are needed who can ride those English postage stamp saddles. Kenneth answers the newspaper ad and he finds himself front and center before the camera. His boyish charm puts him up the ranks into leading man status in a matter of weeks, loving up Myrtle Manners and making his finicky fianc&eacute;e jealous from afar.Again, we get a glimpse into the workings of the industry, as the head of Titan Pictures hears about a forthcoming local polo event and orders a picture be made and rushed into theaters to capitalize on it. Back then, filming durations of a couple days meant that topical movies could be shot, edited, mass-produced, and shipped off to theaters within a week or two. It's a bittersweet thing, because they were regarded as so disposable that thousands of these movies were melted down for the silver nitrate (worth a matter of cents) and reused. (Sorry, let me wipe away a tear.)This book traded on British stereotypes, as Buck Parvin says: \\"There's something about a lean, blond boy with a loose chin and buck teeth that sort of reminds me of polo.\\" Kenneth is forever exclaiming, \\"I say!\\" and, when confronted with the prospect of kissing Myrtle on-screen, says, \\"It seems such a cheeky thing to do--rather.\\"Yet another fun, inoffensive little tale about the wild and woolly movin' pitcher bizness.Man-Afraid-of-His-Wardrobe (July 26, 1913) 5 stars--Stage matinee idol A. Lester Hale has been signed by Titan to a $10,000/10 picture deal. He's been a hit on Broadway and on the road shows as rugged cowboys, so doing the same thing in front of a camera should be no problem, right? After he demands the star dressing room, it's all downhill as stunts, handling guns, and even riding a horse prove too much for our cowboy dandy. Producer/director/villain actor Jim Montague teams up with Buck to get Hale to quit and nullify his contract.This one was hilarious, and I wish that the film version still existed because I'm sure I'd laugh as much as I did while reading it. Most of these stories were filmed in 1915-16 - only one exists - and, given the setting, they naturally lend themselves to the visual medium. A. Lester Hale's egotistical wimp (\\"omg, there are burrs in my beautiful angora chaps!!!\\") is perfect comedy material, and the fact that Hollywood was luring Broadway stars with big contracts wouldn't have been lost on the people reading this story back in 1913. In fact, Van Loan is a bit of a psychic as the next year would find cowboy matinee idols William S. Hart and William Farnum leaving Broadway for the West Coast to do their stuff in front of a camera (and get fat paychecks). However, both of them were more macho than the easily-terrified A. Lester Hale.Buck Parvin is more prominent in this story than the previous two, and he provided more than a few tidbits that had me giggling:\\"Mac was a right nice quiet sort of a guy until he got about seven or fifteen drinks under his belt, and then he'd go home and lick his wife. Not because he didn't like her, you understand, but just because it was a kind of habit with him. Whenever I'm tanked right I get a craving to whale a street-car conductor. I don't know why -- it's just a fool notion I get.\\"I ' these stories. ^_^Water Stuff (November 11, 1913) 3 1/2 stars--Montague takes his crew and a bunch of extras out to the Alden Besse, an old, barnacle-encrusted clipper ship that is docked at San Pedro and has been used in a slew of movies where ever a nautical setting is required. Buck dreads the seasickness and refuses to remove his new $27 cowboy boots from \\"K.C., Missoury.\\" He's being a cranky little actor, but the arrival of a frightened extra girl distracts him somewhat. As the scene rolls for the ship to catch on fire and all the extras jump overboard, the girl's hesitation messes up leading man La Rue's cue and he screws up the shot. However, Buck comes to the rescue and saves the scene, although he suffers his own bit of heartbreak for his bravery.This was a good story, but it seemed to be missing something. I guess it felt a little too loose and crazy, while not being about much in the end. While the story did take on yet another aspect of the early movie business with the usual chaos, it didn't have the same sparkling quality that the previous ones had. There did seem to be far more \\"stage-directing\\" dialogue from Montague than in the others, and the setup simply didn't grab me as much, though it was satisfying to see egotistical buttmunch Jack La Rue get upstaged by our cowboy protagonist.Buck's Lady Friend (March 14, 1914) 5 stars--Buck has been seeing the mysterious Georgine, who is more than a little skeptical about Buck's credentials as an actor. (Every girl in LA gets the line from a guy that they're in the business, but only a few can prove it.) When Buck takes her to a picture where he did a flashy stunt and scene right close to the camera, he's expecting her to be all over him. Except...the scene's not there. Buck's been left on the cutting room floor! Humiliated, he has Georgine come directly to the studio during the filming of a costume historical. All dolled up in satin, powdered wig, and patches, Buck is given a dramatic scene while Georgine looks on. Unfortunately her eye has already been caught by La Rue, and Buck turns the planned \\"light slap/challenge to my honor\\" scene with La Rue into a barroom brawl. Everyone on set gets into it, and Georgine leaves in a huff. Buck's brief flirtation with romance is over.Very funny! It must have been hard for lowly extras and bit part actors to get respect from the skirts, and I felt for poor ol' Buchanan Parvin. His desperation to show Georgine up after getting snubbed in the movie house is pretty pathetic - a bow-legged cowpuncher in satin knickers and velvet patches is pretty desperate, if you ask me, but Buck goes all out when he wants to prove a point.And when the oft-talked-about-but-unseen Georgine is finally revealed...that was a big LOL. Buck likes 'em lush.I really have to wonder if Van Loan had Art Acord (the cowboy/actor who played Buck in the film versions) in mind when he wrote these. While Buck's physical features aren't that well-described - and darned if I know what he looks like, come to think of it - Buck talks about bulldogging steers and riding Steamboat (famous bronc of his day) and Acord did both (and was a world champion at the former). Acord was in Hollywood from 1910 onward, so I'm sensing that Van Loan's fact-gathering tour of the studios for his stories might have intersected with Acord. At any rate, in lieu of any description of Buck's features from Van Loan, it's been Acord who's been in my mind while reading the stories.Desert Stuff (December 6, 1913) 4 stars--Titan decides to make a camel picture and shoot it in the actual desert for extra realism. They rent a bunch of the critters from a circus, the lead camel an ornery albino named Aladdin. Unfortunately a crazy old prospector in the desert comes across a totally-made-up newspaper story - tossed off the back of a passing train - about ghostly rampaging camels in the California desert and wreaks havoc on the production.I liked this one, up to a certain point. The ending was really sad, although it gave Buck an added dimension and showed just what a softie he is. He talks a good, tough tale but he's really a marshmallow. I guess after having so many funny and feel-good tales, to see it take a serious and tragic turn really brought the mood down.There were still some funny lines - Van Loan has a real tongue-in-cheek style I'm fast loving:\\"...Jimmy Montague, author, director and sometimes actor, wrestled with his desert scenario, a delicate little figment of the imagination introducing love, jealousy, treachery, hate, and a few other human emotions besides battle, murder, sudden death and camels, but particularly camels.\\"I'm also fast picking up some mid-1910s slang. These stories are full of it. I had no idea that \\"doping\\" meant \\"figuring something out.\\"Author! Author! (August 1, 1913) 5 stars--Titan Pictures options the rights to film \\"The Lure of the West\\", a literary sensation on the East Coast by one Marcellus M. Peckinpaw. The short, bespectacled author wants his baby filmed exactly as he wrote it and knows nothing about the picture business. He and Montague butt heads throughout production, and Buck takes it upon himself to get ride of the meddlesome little man with the help of fearsome Indian actor Peter Lone Wolf (who is full of surprises).Van Loan has a definite theme: a flicker company is a tight little band, and interlopers who don't mind their own business deserve everything that's coming to them. There's a distrust of authority beyond the director, who rules as he sees fit for the good of all. It's a hierarchy with its occasional dustups, but at the end of the day everyone kisses and makes up and gets on with the job because they're all in it together. They're the ones freezing or broiling on location shoots and working 12 hours a day when the light's good, not the money men back in New York. Solidarity!This story had a nod to the recent practice of luring Broadway actors and star authors to Hollywood (and paying a hefty sum for importing such prestige). Peckinpaw is one of those authors who glanced out a train window on the trip West, talked to a couple people, went to the Wild West Show in Madison Square Garden to pet an Indian, and then made up a bunch of romantic hooey.I loved the character of Peter Lone Wolf, who trades on all kinds of Indian stereotypes to awe, then intimidate, and then outright terrify Peckinpaw. The final scene with the punchline was pretty damn funny. Again, Van Loan writes in a way that's very easy to visualize.Snow Stuff (September 19, 1913) 4 stars--Isadore Gordan owns a chunk of Titan stock and in fine \\"buy a job\\" fashion has been made General Manager of Western Production. He arrives in Truckee to inspect the company at work and look for places to trim the fat. Montague et al are filming an Alaskan picture and have ornery malamutes and difficult hotel-to-set commutes to worry about. They don't need to deal with a corpulent lech from the front office who has designs on leading lady Myrtle. When Gordan tries to put the moves on Myrtle, the whole company bands together to get rid of him.Apart from the first story, we'd seen precious little of Myrtle Manners. I wish Van Loan had featured her more, because she's a great character here. She's torn between wanting to keep her dignity as an actress (since Gordan thinks they're all whores and fair game) and not wanting to risk her job by kicking up a fuss. While the theme is a repeat (\\"Outsider, go home!\\"), it had a different twist because there was something darker at play here, and the paternalistic feelings of all the guys for their leading lady was pretty touching.This Is the Life! (March 13, 1913) 3 stars--Adeline Gribble is a wealthy matron, but bored. Rather than join a drama club or crusade for suffrage, she decides to fill her time by being an actress over her hubby's objections. She gets a lead role right off the bat, but Montague puts her through the wringer of costumes, make-up and stunts until she cries uncle and gives up her aspirations.While this was a fine story with some good lines and turns of phrase, I knew what the twist was going to be from a mile off and the device of running an outsider out on a rail was getting old by the time I reached this last tale. If there was a story I'd have rather cut from the collection, it was this one.I'm glad I finally got around to reading these stories. I've known about them for well over a decade, if not more, and I even had the stories in hand at one time...and then never read them. Better late than never, especially in this case, because these have been some of the best stories about silent film. I wish modern writers could evoke the feeling of this rugged little era of movie history, but so far only Jane Kendall in her lovely Miranda and the Movies has come close. Still, I have lots more Old Hollywood books to read and I hope there'll be some surprises.Average rating: rounded up to 4.5 stars"},{"Title":"Buck Parvin and the movies","review":"A delightful contemporary collection of short stories written 1915-1917 that display the struggling early movie industry with humorous insight.

It is a rollercoaster opening and when the credits finally appear, it is with a sigh of relief. But no- the credits are short and within minutes, not only has the rollercoaster ride resumed, but it is now faster and more dangerous.Such is the impact of this western style, shoot-em-up detective novel by Hammett. It starts with blood being spilled, continues with blood being spilled, and ends with blood being spilled. Continental Op detective travels to an on-the-verge of lawlessness town in Montana to help the town boss settle a score, and finds himself in the middle of four or five warring factions all trying settle their own scores. Lies fly as often as the bullets and not only does the detective have no idea what is going on, but neither do we, other than the fact that any new character that appears after page ten will probably be dead before too long. Romance, sex, gangsters, arson, jail break-outs, extortion- it's all here and it's all intriguing and it all makes for a book that once picked up, will not be put down easy (unfortunately, the same cannot be said for half the thugs in this classic)."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Dashiell Hammett was maybe the earliest hard-core mystery writer, and this novel is tops. An earlier reviewer said \\"blunt wit\\"--that's dead right. Hammett can do more with fewer words than any writer I know--poetry but you never notice it. Humor follows horror follows betrayal.His detective is unusual in belonging to a Pinkerton-type organization, and in other stories cooperates with the police, but here he systematically isolates himself by breaking all rules, betraying one ally after another, refusing to clear himself of suspicion, and generally inciting mass murder. By the end he's driven away colleagues, his employer, gangster allies, his girlfriend [who he apparently has killed], and any semilegitimate forces such as the police. He's very conscious he's doing this, and explicitly describes the bloodlusting cultural corruption that he is reveling in, feeding, steering, and using to clash and destroy itself. He starts counting up the killings at one point, gets up to eighteen or 20, clearly is leaving some collateral damage out, but on he goes. Initially, Hammett throws in examples of business corruption, police corruption, and gangsterism as everyday asides, but then as his detective undermines the prior balance of power, 'normal corruption' breaks down and the whole town feels the anarchy.Hammett remarkably demonstrates the power of accounting skills: his detective tells one story of a murder one time and causes one mob war, then gives a rival account to cause another murder. He doesn't know the truth, but while searching for it he raises doubt that truth may even exist, as one more account emerges to fit every new cumulated and reinterpreted set of facts. Thus, he keeps turning the idea of 'mystery story' back on itself into a whirling cesspool.Hammett throws in initial examples of business corruption, police corruption, and gangsterism as asides, but then as his detective undermines the normal balance of power, the whole town feels the anarchy."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Above all of his other books, Red Harvest is the essential Hammett read. Dark, gritty, thought provoking and even humorous, this book delivers everything you could desire from a classic detective text. To not enjoy and appreciate this book is to dismiss the genre as a whole."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This was my first time reading a hard-boiled detective novel and I loved it. Hammett is an impressive writer with an amazing talent of packing in tons of action into very few words. Example:\\"A garbage can helped me over the gate into a brick-paved yard. The side fence of that yard let me into another, and from that I got into another, where a fox terrier raised hell at me.I kicked the pooch out of the way, made the opposite fence, untangled myself from a clothes line, crossed two more yards, got yelled at from a window, had a bottle thrown at me, and dropped into a cobblestoned back street.\\"This story is about a nameless private detective who's called upon by an important man in Personville, but the client is murdered before the detective can meet him. He decides to do a little investigation of his own and before you know it the entire town is in chaos with non-stop shoot outs, wholesale murder, crooked cops, a dangerous woman and lots of drinking and trash talking."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This was my introduction to Hammett and I knew from reading the first page that I would read everything he'd ever written.

Have at it, folks."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This is one of Hammetts' best stories. enjoy reading it over and over!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This is a hard tale of a hard guy, a nameless private detective, who arrives in the western mining town of Personville (called &quot;Poisonville&quot; by many of its criminal denizens who hail from points east) to meet a client . . . only to learn that the client has been murdered on the very night of their scheduled meeting. The client was the son of the town's wealthiest citizen, an aging tycoon who, to beat back the unionization of the miners he employs, has invited all manner of gangsters and hard cases into town to break the unions.But, in breaking them for him, the gangsters have moved in for good and taken over running things, setting up their own rackets, controlling the police and sucking the old man into their schemes since they have so much &quot;on him.&quot; The detective (known only as the Continental operative throughout) approaches the tycoon about the murder of his son and soon conceives the notion of cleaning the place up, whether the old man wants him to or not. Playing the various sides off against one another, the detective embarks on a cold-hearted, calculated odyssey to win the confidence of one gangster after another, in order to turn each against the other (shades of Yojimbo!).In the process, the detective, himself, gets drawn into the bloody maelstrom he has created through his various betrayals until, sinking into the same moral morass as all the others, he finds himself waist deep in murder with only the shakiest of alibis and a profound sense of his own moral surrender. The body count mounts as one gangster after another is betrayed by our apparently amoral &quot;Continental op&quot;, until the very pegs on which the town has been hung are shaken loose.The real mystery here is less who killed the detective's original client than who killed the detective's own victim . . . and how will he manage to extricate himself from the violent and bloody depths he has plunged the town of Poisonville, and himself, into. Lots of blackmail and mayhem and bloodshed here and a real sense of lost moral bearings. This detective, for all his good intentions seems no better, in many ways, than the criminal element he has set out to undermine.In the end he does pull himself out of the fire and manages to see the job through, but we are left with a clear sense of amorality that makes this nameless detective little better than the crooks he has overthrown. In fact some of them, like Whisper Thaler, seem a hell of a lot more honorable . . . and likeable.SWM"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Hammett is a master of fast-paced narrative and snappy dialogue. He wastes neither his own time nor that of the reader's with unnecessary characterization or flowery descriptions. The intensity of his writing is most evident in &quot;Red Harvest&quot; with its numerous characters and non-stop action. The clever story builds, along with the levels of suspense and violence, to depict a savage world in the heartland of America.

The harvest of death is both plentiful and bloody in Dashiell Hammett's marvelous thriller \\"Red Harvest\\".Dashiell Hammett, a former Pinkerton detective, pretty much invented the hard-boiled (U.S.) detective genre. The influence of Hammett's short stories and novels, \\"Red Harvest\\", \\"The Dain Curse\\", \\"The Glass Key\\", \\"The Thin Man\\" and \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" can be seen in much of the detective fiction writing that followed, including among others Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, Jim Thompson, Ross Macdonald, James Ellroy, Robert Parker, James Lee Burke, and Michael Connelly. The plot of \\"Red Harvest\\", Hammett's first novel, also found its way into movies such as Akira Kurosawa's \\"Yojimbo\\", Sergio Leone's \\"For a Fistful of Dollars\\", and the Coen brother's \\"Miller's Crossing\\".\\"Red Harvest\\" begins with the arrival of the Continental Op, Hammett's trademark \\"man with no name\\" in the town of Personville. The client he has been summoned to see is found murdered before the Op can meet him. In short order the Op finds that Personville's nickname, \\"Poisonville\\" is well-earned. It is a town filled with small town greed and big time corruption. The Ops arrival coincides with the onset of a turf war for control of the city between rival gangsters. The Op pays a call on the dead man's father, Elihu Willsson. The Op soon determines that the town's descent into a state approaching a low level of hell began when Willsson imported some mobsters to break up a strike. Their stay turned out to be far from a temporary one.For reasons of his own, perhaps just to be stubborn or perhaps as a matter of some principle or warrior code, the Op decides to stay and clean up the town. His method is simple, pit each gang and its various factions and sub-factions against each other until the dust settles and it is discovered that they have pretty much killed themselves off. The Op is not afraid to pitch in and help the process along.As noted above, \\"Red Harvest\\" was Hammett's first full length book. Perhaps as a result some of the sentences were longer and more \`literary' than his later books, by which time he had perfected a leaner, staccato, machine gun style of dialogue. Nevertheless, \\"Red Harvest\\" was and remains an impressive and exciting piece of writing.\\"Red Harvest\\" along with just about everything else Hammett ever wrote is well worth reading.L. Fleisig"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The best thing about Dashiell Hammett books is that they are usually readable within 48 hours and yet still contain enough interesting content to prove satisfying. The Continental Op is in full force in Red Harvest, which often gets overlooked in favor of the Maltese Falcon or the Thin Man but which is still evidence of Hammett's eminent skill in crafting an intricate plot with interesting characters. Unlike the meandering prose of others in the genre, Hammett manages to combine a flowery descriptive style with a human quality that achieves a high level of suspense. When the Op is finally sucked into the machinations of Poisonville, you can't turn the pages fast enough to find out how it will turn out. That's the mark of a good book in any form."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This was the first novel featuring Hammett's short story character, The Continental Op, and it's well worth reading. The Op is sent from his home in San Francisco to Personville, Montana on the request of a client. The fact that Personville is pronounced posionville by its residents will tell you the kind of town he enters. The violence is so bad that the Op never actually sees his client alive, but he sticks around to avenge his death. The deep plot is as convoluted as any detective novel, but the basic plot of a man playing two sides against each other proved to be important in the history of film even more so than literature.The Op was the original Man With No Name. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western borrows both the stranger concept and the plot from Red Harvest. Though the credit is usually given to Akira Kurosawa for his film Yojimbo, both films actually borrow their essence from Hammett.It's not necessary to have seen either film to enjoy this story. Overshadowed by the classic Maltese Falcon, Red Harvest deserves more ink than it gets. It's here with Hammett that the noir detective novel was born. The romantic notion of a poor detective who would rather live up to his own standards of justice than take a big payoff is a very American outlook. I can only figure that such a character comes from the many assignments that Hammett got working for the Pinkerton detective agency and the many times that Hammett wasn't allowed to do the right thing. Our detective is so virtuous under the standards of his own ethics that you admire him even when he is creating a bloodbath.The most surprising thing is how well the whole book flows and quickly I read it. Hammett has a great way of leaving each chapter with enough questions that you want to immediately read the next one. He'll leave you with the conclusion of a boxing match and with a fighter that falls over with a knife in his back. How can you go to sleep on a chapter like that?Any fan of detective novels and film noir should do themselves the justice of reading all the Hammett they can get. Red Harvest is a good start to that goal."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I have always enjoyed mystery and crime novels, but I can't say I'm an avid fan of either genre. I've read a fair amount of Sherlock Holmes, Edgar Allan Poe as well as some Victorian Gothic fiction. I've read some Agatha Christie and other early/mid-20th century mystery/crime novels. I'd paid attention in history class and had a basic idea of life in and around the Prohibition era in America and the world of gangsters and bootleggers. And despite all of that, I wasn't entirely prepared for what to expect from Red Harvest.The general style of the novel was intriguing from the onset. We're dropped into a gritty first person narration from an unnamed character as he wanders the streets of \`Poisonville' to meet some unknown client and then, later, to solve the murder of that client.I really enjoyed the way the details of the story were presented. The writing was very detailed and the narrator conveyed his thoughts and perceptions very well. With the tight first person narration, the mystery for the characters was just as much a mystery to us. Even simple details such as names and places seemed to come on a \\"need to know basis.\\" Thus, there existed the mystery of the crime to be solved, as well as the mystery of what details were being withheld from the reader and why.As the story progressed, I grew attached to the protagonist as a cynical hard-nosed detective of the sort who \\"always gets his man.\\" When he solved the murder, I was impressed by the logic involved and by his way of seeing through the prejudices and smokescreens around the case.The way the case was solved was quite unlike a Holmesian solution in that there weren't any telltale clues at the crime scene or analysis of fingerprints or paper fibers. Instead, the Continental Op made a logical supposition and then through manipulative and threatening speech worked enough of a confession out of the killer to close the case. It reminded me of the intimidation tactics seen in so many of the crime movies and TV shows today.I expected the confession to be incorrect since so much of the novel was left unread. Instead of letting the murder unravel, the plot took a different turn that I rather enjoyed. The corrupt \\"head\\" of Poisonville asks the Op to clean up the town and gives him carte blanche to do so.The resulting manipulative method of setting crook against crook was a lot of fun. What was interesting to me, as the city grew more and more corrupt, was that our protagonist had become an antihero. Instead of the altruistic detectives of other early crime novels, the Continental Op was secretive, manipulative, vengeful and dishonest. He had an end goal in mind and he planned to achieve it at any cost. While he wasn't actually running a bootlegging or gambling operation himself, he largely became as corrupt as those he hunted. He compromised those around him who may be innocent or, at least, less corruptible.Finally, he fell beyond the point of no return and concluded his downward spiral. At that point, I had no idea whether or not the story would allow the Op to be redeemed or if he would simply succeed in cleaning up Poisonville and then leave it a tainted and broken operative, ready to take his cynicism to the next case. While the Op did end the novel a bit more hardened and broken than when he started, the resolution did lighten some of his burden and return his respectability.I definitely enjoyed my experience with this book. Looking to the few books I've read from the Victorian era, I can see numerous stark differences. The dialog was much harsher than that of a Sherlock Holmes story and the violence was more over the top and graphic than the Victorian Gothic novels I've read. The mystery was tight and well organized, but the clues were extracted more through force and intimidation than through insight and deduction.What is even more striking to me is the pacing of the novel. While it did have vivid descriptions and various scenes of thoughtful internal monologue, the pacing was much quicker than the average 19th century mystery or adventure novel. While the story did expose many sides of human nature, the narrative didn't pause for lengthy paragraphs reflecting on the motivations or psyches of the characters or of society as a whole. Any explicit analysis was concise and well integrated into the peppy, fast-paced world in which the action revolved.The book's first purpose seemed to be one of escapism and it does provide an exciting escape from a mundane life. The heightened action and quickened pace would coincide well with the quickly expanding world of the post-war Americans watching the world zip past them. Added to the speed is the vivid portrayal of the exciting and frightening criminal underworld which puts a human face on the stories people may hear about on the radio or speculate about as they drink their own Prohibition scotch and think about where it came from.This book opened new storytelling elements and devices that are still being used today. It seems to create a new realistic novel that allowed it to show the darker underbelly of the world without flinching. It also provided a darker antihero who ends the novel only partially redeemed and yet more human and relatable.Likely somewhat shocking at first, I suspect this sort of adventure was quickly accepted by the younger for its fast pace and \\"real\\" portrayal of the tenuous world of the 1920s. The older generation may have found it too shocking and may even have condemned its graphic and violent content. I can see the crime story of the 1920s as being a huge boundary pusher in terms of content and style in the same way that violent radio and then television, movies and eventually video games would continue to do over the next century. The shock value would be titillating to the younger crowd, intriguing to the middle generation, and hateful and offensive to the older generation engrained in the classic values of days gone by.****4 stars"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I had problems with this novel. I couldn't follow all of the complexities of the ultra-complicated, ever-shifting plot of wholesale corruption in a small, industrial Western city (corporate, police, mob, etc.). And it all seemed so familiar, hackneyed. But then I remembered a couple of things: That this was so familiar because hundreds of other authors and thousands of other books have tried with varying degrees of success to mimic and further develop Hammett's \\"hard-boiled\\", noirish style in the past 75 or so years. And also, that perhaps it wasn't necessary to follow the incredibly convoluted plot, or even keep full track of who each of the legion of sleazy characters are, in order to best enjoy the book. After I made those decisions, the rest of my reading experience was much more pleasurable and rewarding. In a strange way it reminded me of some the French \\"nouveau romain\\" authors where the style, the words, the way things are expressed, the endless repetition of certain motifs, words, and concepts become the primary or perhaps only true point of the novel. After a while, it became hypnotizing, marvelous, and, for me, laugh-out-loud hilarious, particularly with the \\"Laudinum\\" chapter (and actually, a lot of the second half of the book) beginning to remind me of things like Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, a favorite book of mine. Always very granular and factual, the overload of facts, events, wise cracks, sleaze, and more sleaze and wise cracks becomes like some kind of demented (but amazing) symphony. I believe I'll remember this one for quite a while -- although I'm not sure I'm ready to jump into another one of his works right now. I'll save it for later when I've recovered from this one."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The name &quot;Personville&quot; is a generic name for all the towns named after a company owner. &quot;Red Harvest&quot; is about a town where hired gunmen were brought in for strike-breaking. They then gained control of the town, going from servants to masters; but no one gang gained control. The company owner then used his newspaper to try to advocate a &quot;civic reform&quot; campaign to regain control. His newspaper publisher son hired the Continental Op, but was killed before they meet. (Was this similar to Robert F. Kennedy's prosecution of organized crime?) Machiavelli's Letter to the Prince of Florence (p.9) tells of the problems with a mercenary army: they can takeover the government that hired them. Only a citizen army is proper to a republic. Creating a militia by arming the cirtizens of &quot;Personville&quot; could have put an end to these gangs, but the political control of &quot;Elihu Willsson&quot; would have ended as well. The 1877 strike in Pittsburgh's coal and iron industry led to the abolishment of the traditional local militia and its replacement by a state-controlled militia. Newly powerful corporations now controlled the state government, and the new &quot;National Guard&quot; developed into a strike-breaking force with the power of law. The Continental Op purges &quot;Personville&quot; and leaves, but the book doesn't tell how quickly new gangs re-appear. The corporate control continues, with its need for strike-breaking gunmen; they pop up like teeth in a shark. Corporate control of politicians and government may only be possible with this corruption. The politics of this novel guarantees that it will never be faithfully filmed by Hollywood, unlike some of his other novels. But this made it a best sell in 1929 and afterwards."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The posters for the Bruce Willis blood-fest Last Man Standing credit the original story to Akira Kurosawa's insanely funny destroying-the-town-to-save-it movie Yojimbo (AS IF Bruce Willis had an earthly of filing the blood-and-dust soaked waraji of Mifune). And there, for the majority of movie-goers, no doubt, the story begins and ends.Unless you know Dashiell Hammett's Red Harvest. Unless you've ripped through the pages in an agonizing frenzy of suspense and awe, desperate to find out WHAT HAPPENS NEXT but hanging on to each page a second longer to savor the impeccable use of words, the flawless balance between economy and imagery, the sheer perfection of the writing.It's gang warfare in Poisonville, set in motion by the venomous old snake whose bite sickened the town in the first place. Poisonville is an oozing sore ripe for cleaning, and the Continental Op cleans it with a vengeance.Wolf this one down in one gulp the first time through and then start over again at the beginning and linger over the sweet taste of nastiness made delicious through the brilliance of a master word-chef.Hammet perfected the hard-boiled private eye genre even as he invented it.

The Language.. oh.. what language. Every phrase designed to excite and to be enjoyed. This book, in a genre that traditional English Depts do not consider as literature, is one of the literary classics of all time."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I like to consider Dashiell Hammett part of the Lost Generation. True, he wasn't a member of the crew including Fitzgerald, Dos Passos, and Hemingway that concentrated in France following WWI, but Hammett does use many similar elements unique to this movement, and Red Harvest is the epitome of my observation.It is a fascinating book, taken from the point of view of Hammett's trendsetting Continental Op. He is sent to Personville and finds himself a solitary soul on a quest to clean the town of a corruption that is so ingrained that even he begins to querie whether or not he too is being corrupted.Red Harvest is a fast paced book that is also a profound study of society, and it is a book that I highly suggest."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The narrator is the kind of carefully observant man who notices the woman with a \\"big ripe mouth\\" hasn't rouged her lips evenly. A distinct staccato poetry infuses Hammett's writing. His description of a prizefight: \\"Smoke. Stink. Heat. Noise\\" (74). Beautiful ugly. I've known burly guys like Continental Op, the stocky Ernest Borgnine thrown in, and they talked like this, down to their memories of Butte, Montana, and her infamous soiled-doves of the 1950s.Hammett's is a landscape of dark imagination, the hard industrial West. The recent film noir fantasy homage \\"Dark City\\" imparts Butte's rough glamour. In Poisonville, Hammett used Montana's Butte, Walkerville, Anaconda, and the extinct Meaderville. Written in 1929, the pages are awash in booze, though the Prohibition (1920-1933) was still official.A perfect moment, \\"I...went up to my room for a shot of Scotch. I would have rather been cold sober, but I wasn't. If the night held more work for me I didn't want to go to it with alcohol dying in me.\\" Again, poetry.Having lived in Butte for years, I heard many stories of bootleggers and Butte's wild past, and knew folks whose illegal stills sometimes blew-up their cellars. Like the narrator, Dashiell Hammett worked in Butte for a detective agency, and the realism of his experiences shines through. \\"Red Harvest\\" swims in outlaw Scotch, twisted humor, and delicious authenticity. Many try to imitate, few can capture this man's style."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"It's hard to overemphasize just how important this book is to modern literature. In one fell swoop, Dashiell Hammett forever upset the world of &quot;nice&quot; genteel adventure and mystery stories, flooding the world in a clipped, tight-lipped, ugly torrent of blood and violence -- and I ain't compaining! Just about all modern novels and films of savagery and violence can be traced back to this crazy-kilter detective story in the sin-burg of Poisonville. I give it four stars instead of the full five only because the narrative, composed of linked but separately published units, doesn't cohere in the same astonishing way that Hammett's follow-ups, &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; and &quot;The Glass Key&quot; do. Still a kinetic fix for those interested in the seamier side of classic American literature. Practically adapted lock stock n' barrell by Akira Kurosawa for his Samurai movie &quot;Yojimbo&quot; (which later became &quot;Fistful of Dollars&quot; and &quot;La! st Man Standing&quot; -- the latter coming the closest to Hammett's original setting, making this sequence a huge circle back to the origin of species)."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest by Dashiell Hammett, is a tense, fast-paced well written tale of Hammett's hero, The Continental OP, cleaning up a criminal-ridden town by setting all the various factions againts each other.

I did not like it over much the first time I read it, but when I reread all of Hammett I found I liked it more than any except the Maltese Falcon.It is much less violent than modern riffs on the theme -- and there are many -- but somehow Hammett captures a hardness and ruthlessness that no-one else (not Ellroy or Thompson or Vachss) quite can.And the prose is perfect."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I've always been a big fan of The Maltese Falcon and other noir classics, but I'd never read a Dashiell Hammett novel. When I saw Red Harvest mentioned in a magazine article, I thought, \\"Why not start here?\\"Though Red Harvest is supposed to be set in a Western town called Personville, it feels like it's set in a big, hard-luck city. The only place big enough to fill the bill in 1929 was probably Denver. The nameless protagonist, a detective with the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is called only the Continental Op(erative). The book has a huge cast of shady characters that are a bit hard to keep track of. The strangest thing about the book, though, it that it is completely passionless--almost to the point of being enervated. There are dozens of murders and ganglang killings throughout, but each one is described as coolly and bloodlessly as the next. Obviously, this coolness gives a really hard edge to the emotionless Continental Op, which I'm sure was Hammett's intention, but it also make it hard to feel anything for anyone.Nevertheless, the dialog is smart, snappy and witty. That's the best reward for reading the book.I admitted that I hadn't read any other of Hammett's novels so I wonder about his range of characterization, but if you've read (or seen) The Maltese Falcon, you've already been introduced to the main characters in Red Harvest: The Continental Op is a dead ringer for Sam Spade (actor Humphrey Bogart) in The Maltese Falcon. Likewise, Dinah Brand for Brigid O'Shaughnessy (actress Mary Astor), bootlegger Max Thaler for Joel Cairo (actor Peter Lorre), corpulent police Chief Noonan for Kasper Gutman (actor Sydney Greenstreet). They're all here--and more--and they're all part of the fun of reading Red Harvest."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"10 bucks for a story written in 1929?

A man is murdered under strange circumstances, with his intriguingly strange family members being either suspects or wanting revenge. In waltzes a private investigator, ala Philip Marlowe, who seems tough, street-wise, and does well with the ladies. Oh, and the lingo throughout is very 1930s tough guy talk. However 'Red Harvest' ultimately sinks into mediocrity. Why?Firstly, Dashiell Hammett spins an overly complex story with way too many characters ... into what is a very short book. Too many killings, too much action, very little coherence. While the story sort of pulls itself together in the end I find myself ultimately bored, and disappointed, with the entire effort.Bottom line: not an enjoyable reading experience."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Nowadays, not many people think of reading a pulp detective novel from 1929. Most would expect the plot to be superficial, the characters one-dimensional, and the dialogue filled with obscure eighty year-old words like 'dames', 'dingus', 'gams', and 'gat'.But 'Red Harvest' is one of the best (are there any bad ones?) novels from Dashiel Hammett, arguably the most artful if not memorable detective story writer of all time.If you are reading this, then you are already a fan of the genre or you are branching out from your usual 'mystery' choice. You're looking for an entertaining read that won't dumb you down. You're hoping to stumble upon a lesser-known gem from a great mystery writer. Or maybe to find out why they say Hammett was so good. Well, you've found it.I won't recount the story line--- plenty of other reviewers will do that. But I will tell you why you should buy it and read it.'Red Harvest' is a fine piece of American literature, one of the most perfect detective novels I've read.The serpentine plot winds it way between the predictable and unpredictable, telling the story about one man against an entire town. In 2007 this might seem trite and overdone, but it was a fresh idea in 1927.If violence and gunplay is your thing, you're in luck. Chapter 21's title is 'The Seventeenth Murder'.The Obscure 1920's Gangster Dialogue Index is set to 'Low'. I don't want Edgar G, Cagney or Bogie to pop into my mind while I'm forming my own mental image of the character.Dialogue and exposition are extremely well-written. Words tumble naturally from the pages like dice in a crapshoot.In his exquisite portrait of femme fatale Dinah Brand, Hammett succeeds in the difficult task of capturing for his reader the essence of a physically imperfect woman who has perfected the art of attraction and allure, enchanting any man she wants.Best of all things about \`Red Harvest' is the wily Continental Op himself. He appears a deceptively average guy: anonymous, middle-aged, average height, soft around the middle, receding hairline. But smart and tough as nails, he's not one to cross."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest is one of only five full length novels completed by the legendary Dashiell Hammett. The action unfolds in a western mining town nicknamed Poisonville. It's protagonist and first person narrator is the Continental Op, a San Francisco detective whose name the reader never learns. Summoned to Poisonville by local newspaper publisher Donald Willsson, the Continental Op quickly gets a taste of the town's predilection for violence when Willson is murdered before the two men even have a chance to meet.In the following days, a seemingly never ending series of shootings, stabbings and bombings account for multiple deaths in a nihilistic frenzy of violence fueled by greed, corruption, jealousy and unbridled aggression. A number of the killings are instigated by the Continental Op himself. It is his belief that only through purging the town of its plentiful criminal element will anything resembling normalcy ever have a chance of gaining a foothold.As always, Hammett's writing is crisp and highly readable. Most of the characters are colorful and quite fascinating to read about. On the negative side, I found the the narrative a bit too convoluted for my taste. Worthwhile reading for Hammett fans but less compelling than either The Maltese Falcon or The Thin Man."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Some novelists are great in their genre. Some novelists create a genre. In many respects, this book exemplifies the birth of the genre referred to as the American crime novel - one which Raymond Chandler said \\". . . took murder out of the Venetian vase and dropped it into the alley. . . .\\" And, oh how from-the-street this novel is.This novel started a critically acclaimed writing streak for Hammet - 1929 (\\"Red Harvest\\"and \\"The Dain Curse\\"), 1930 (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\"), and 1931 (\\"The Glass Key\\"). Hollywood was right behind the publishers as they produced his books to film almost as soon as the print dried on the second printing: 1930 (\\"Roadhouse Nights\\" based on \\"Red Harvest), 1931 (\\"Maltese Falcon\\" ) and 1935 (\\"Thin Man\\" and 5 other movies to follow with the Thin Man theme.)Hammett was hot. Maybe the hottest commodity in print and screen the first five years of the 1930's. Then in 1936 he secretly joins the Communist Party and you can guess the rest.This book reviews many of his personal experiences. At 31, he became a private detective (Pinkerton Agency) and the major character of this book is a 190-pound 5'6\\" solidly built unnamed character who works for a similar agency. He is called an Op. And, his \\"Old Man\\" sends him to Personville which is affectionately referred to as Poisonvile - dank and mysterious, it lost its innocence when old man Willsson hired Italian goons as union busters to preserve his bottom line for his many capitalistic ventures. After they did their dirty business, they stayed and the old man could not live as he had before - in total control of the city.When the Op is shot at by goons and cops, he decides that even though his business is over, he will stay and earn $10,000 while making himself a Poisonville regular. Thereafter, 24 bad people are murdered - cleaning the streets of the bad blood - and the worst injury suffered by the Op is a burn. Good conquers all, or mostly all. The Op meant what he said, and said what he meant, he hated the town 100%.Hammett, probably from having to gumshoe streets following leads for the Pinkerton Agency, understood American vernacular. Implementing the same created his \\"style\\" which probably was not consciously done. But, it was artistic. And, this artistry is purely Americana. American vernacular was new in literature - something which was also brought to readers by another hot commodity of the 1930's - Ernest Hemingway.His curt and precise statements, dialogue, and great descriptions of the physical appearances of characters are Hammett's best weapons. And, this is one of his best books - probably only exceeded by \\"Maltese Falcon.\\" It seems only a shame that he could not produce more of these novels"},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The same operator that apears in The Continental Op, but this novel is more elaborated. A must. Hammet at his best."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Not only great Hammett, but also great Kurosawa and great Sergio Leone.

Read Red Harvest and then view the films."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This novel was an excellent change from the sweet innocence of Mrs. Marple or the cold calculations of Sherlock Holmes. The novel follows the attempts of a Continental Op to clean up Poisonville. He has accidentally gotten himself into something too large and complex for him to handle. The town sucks him in though, not letting go until he is done. There are times when the streetwise detective wonders if the town hasn't also corrupted him. I love the detective's bumbling attitude that sometimes lands him in more trouble than good but always helps him survive. Throughout the entire story our main character has no idea what's going on which is a change from our most famous detectives. This was an excellent book that I would recommend to anyone looking for a good detective story."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"One of the major pioneering works of the hardboiled detective genre, Red Harvest is also a nightmarish vision of a world thoroughly corrupted by capitalism in an era of crisis. Hammett has received plenty of attention for his brilliantly drawn characters, razor-sharp dialogue, and judicious use of humor, revulsion and violence in moving his plots along. The key character in Red Harvest, however, is not the unnamed \\"Continental Op\\" who narrates the tale but meglomaniacal Elihu Willsson, the mining magnate who transforms Personville into \\"Poisonville\\" through his insistance on retaining absolute power over his company town by unleashing murderous gangsters to crush the local labor movement when they go on strike after World War I. By the time the Op arrives on the scene the city has become a criminal cesspool engaged in every form of vice, and claiming Willsson's reform-minded son as its latest victim.No serious assessment of Red Harvest can fail to take into account the way in which it parallels the contemporary rise of fascism. Using violence to preserve the privileges of capitalist elites at the expense of any pretense of democracy or liberty, fascism's paramilitary brownshirts and the sharp-dressed gangsters in Red Harvest are brothers in arms. In his effort to \\"clean up\\" Personville, Hammett's Continental Op finds the only means of doing so is by exploiting the distrust, greed, and corruption of its gangsters and local government officials, a process that draws him into the same moral pit and from which he recoils by seeking to escape. While we continue to grapple with the corruptions of late capitalism, Hammett's work is as relevant in the 21st century as it was in 1929."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"This is not my favorite Dashiell Hammett book, but there is no such thing . . . well, I was going to say that there was no such thing as a bad Dashiell Hammett book, but then I remembered that the last couple of things he wrote, when he was trying to write \\"literature\\" instead of extraordinary hardboiled stories. There is, however, no such animal as a bad Continental Op story, and this is one of the Op's adventures. One of the most lamentable situations in contemporary publishing is the rather small number of Op stories in print. It is occasionally possible to turn up one of the old anthology of Op stories that Hammett published in BLACK MASK, but these are getting harder and harder to find (though several of them recently appeared in the new Library of America edition of Hammett's stories). BLACK MASK itself put out in the late forties, I believe, several issues collecting the otherwise uncollected stories. My understanding is that Lillian Hellman, who held the copyright on Hammett's books until her death, would not allow these stories to be reprinted. The copyright must be getting close to expiration, so perhaps all of Hammett's stories will once again be available.I was fortunate enough to read all the stories that Black Mask collected in their special issues. My access was through the marvelous holdings of the Beinecke Rare Book Library at Yale University. I sat in the reading room where others were undoubtedly reading manuscripts of Boswell or Ezra Pound or Yeats, while I sat engrossed in Continental Op detective yarns. My best guess is that there may have been enough stories to produce one or two more collections to supplement the two collections we already possess, THE CONTINENTAL OP and THE BIG KNOCKOVER. I must admit that the quality of these stories were not overall up to the quality of those in the latter volume, which are in turn not quite up to the quality of the stories in the former volume. That volume is in my humble but most accurate opinion, the finest detective short stories ever written, along with \\"Red Wind\\" by Raymond Chandler. I feel that of the two founding fathers of the hardboiled detective genre, Hammett wrote better stories and Chandler wrote better novels.RED HARVEST is very good Hammett, but is not quite up to the level of his very best work in THE CONTINENTAL OP and THE MALTESE FALCON. The story has been widely imitated in film. Akira Kurosawa borrowed heavily from it in making the movie YOJIMBO, which was in turn used by Sergio Leone in making A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. More recently the story was mined for the semi-awful Bruce Willis vehicle LAST MAN STANDING--which had tons of wonderful period atmosphere to go along with tons of stupidity, and which provoked for the three thousandth time the perennial question of why bad guys are such dreadful shots while the good guys never miss.I must further add that the Vintage covers of all the Hammett books are both attractive and wonderfully evocative of the era. I don't know about others, but I always have a more satisfying reading experience if the books look inviting."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I have just finished reviewing in this space all of Raymond Chandler's Phillip Marlowe detective series. It occurred to me that I might as well review the work of that other exemplar of the modern hard-boiled noir detective story, Dashiell Hammett. Most of those familar with his work know it from Nick Charles of the Thin Man or, more likely, Sam Spade of the immortal Maltese Falcon but Hammett, like Chandler, did not blossom forth with these classics without a grinding apprenticeship in pulp detective fiction. Red Harvest represents Hammett's baptism. This story of an unnamed shamus who moreover works for a detective agency runs against the type we have come to expect from Hammett and Chandler-the independent, no-holds barred character. Have no fear our Continental Op has most of those qualities and the single-mindeness to clean up a rotten crime-dominated town no questions asked. While there is not the plot or character development of Hammett's later work here this is still a good read.****Dashiell Hammett, along with Raymond Chandler, reinvented the detective genre in the 1930's and 1940's. They moved the genre away from the amateurish and simple parlor detectives that had previously dominated the genre to hard-boiled action characters who knew what was what and didn't mind taking a beating to get the bad guys. And along the way they produced some very memorable literary characters as well. Nick Charles, Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe are well known exemplars of the action detective. However, on the way to creating these literary works of art Hammett did journeyman's work at the detective genre in various pulp detective magazines. Moreover, in the beginning he hid his detectives behind the anonymous, although not faceless or without personality average detectives, of a national detective agency (shades of his own past).The unnamed universal Continental Operative (Op) who is the central character of here is the is the prototype for Hammett's later named detectives. He has all the characteristics that mark a noir detective-tough, resourceful, undaunted, and incorruptible with a sense of honor to friend and foe alike that sets him apart from earlier detectives. The plot line here requires all the resourcefulness of the Op as he tries to cleanup a new Western boom town tied together by many a criminal enterprise and the greed (and complicity) of the local bourgeois big shot who let things get out of hand. The twist and turns as Op tries to mix and match with the various interests at play drive the drama of the film. Along the way, of course, just like in the Old West, there plenty of shoot- \`em-up action before the town, Personville (aka Poisonville ) is fit for respectable folks to make an honest dollar in. If you want a well-thought out story, although not as memorable as The Maltese Falcon or the The ThinMan, that is also well-written, although without the numerous unforgettable lines of the above-mentioned novels, from a member of the second echelon of the American literary pantheon, this one is for you."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest is less well-known than its more famous Hammett brothers, The Maltese Falcon and the Thin Man. It may well be my favorite, but it would be really hard to choose. Hammett is one of the greats of detective fiction and his work has both defined and exceeded the typical genre boundaries.Red Harvest (1929), like many Hammett novels, is as much about the corruption of place as it is about a particular murder mystery. The mining town of Personville/Poisonville comes into the life of the Continental Op when he gets stood up by a potential client, and becomes the focus of his efforts to clean up corruption in the town when that client is killed. The book is actually structured as a series of linked smaller stories about the town, but instead of providing obvious divisions, this structure lends the book a complexity which compliments (rather than undermines) the unity of the whole.Red Harvest is as tough and dark as a reader could want without falling into self-parody. Hammett has a distinctive crisp and clean writing style which makes the pages fly by faster than the reader would want them to. A must-read for fans of Noir and hard-boiled detectives, a should-read for pretty much everyone else."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"It's simply one of the best hardboiled books I've read. In my opinion it surely surpasses the Maltese Falcon. Hammett writes with urgency and compels you not to stop reading until it's done. Action here in nearly non-stoping, but the book truly shines in its dialogues, smartly crafted and believable. Surely a Top 5 Noir book. The quality of the paper and the cover are also above avarage when you consider it's a paperback. Very pretty art and fitting with the theme and genre."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"In prohibition-era Personville, Continental Op (what a great name for a character!) has been hired to learn who murdered the son of the czar of the town. Nicknamed \\"Poisonville,\\" its a city riddled with corruption and graft. Continental Op speedily resolves the case, but is subsequently hired to \\"clean up the town.\\" In doing so, a veritable blood-bath ensues, hence the title. (I had originally assumed the title was a reference to the IWW and labor disputes - it turned out it was a red herring if you will pardon the pun.)The plot is fast-paced and typical Hammet as Continental Op pits one crook agains another in a widening circle of violence - ultimately over 20 characters are murdered. What really makes the book, though, isn't the resolution of the conflict, but (as with all of Hammet's stories), his dialouge. And while its a bit dated, it is classic noir: (what follows, in spite of appearances, is not a spoiler)\\"... Dinah told me you were a pretty good guy, except kind of Schotch with the roll.\\"\\"I had a nice visit. Will you tell me what you know about Donald Willsshon's killing?\\"\\"His wife plugged him.\\"\\"You saw her?\\"\\"I saw her the next second - with the gat in her hand.\\"Hammet's description of action is also priceless: \\"Pat twisted us around a frightened woman's coupe, put us through a slot between street cara nd laundry wagon - a narrow slot that we coudln't have slipped through if our car hadn't been so smoothly enameled and said, 'All right, but the brakes aren't so good.'\\"This was my first Continental Op story. It won't be my last. While he's not as well developed a character as Sam Spade, I much prefer Continental to his Nick and Nora - maybe its a west coast thing, but Hammet's San Francisco characters are much more interesting to me than those set in New York. In broad terms, you can't go wrong with anything by Dashiell Hammet, and _Red Harvest_ has all the elements one expects and loves about his writing. Recommended."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Originally published in 1929, Red Harvest is a classic crime novel that helped established the hard-boiled genre. This is most definitely not a polite, parlor mystery where most of the blood is spilled off of the page. As the title suggests, this book is filled with mayhem and the bodies are falling left and right.The main protagonist is the Continental Op, who doesn't remotely resemble the genteel Hercule Poirot or any of the other fictional detectives who were so popular in the 1920s. The Op is certainly smart and skilled, but he's a squat, overweight man who's more than willing to cut whatever corners are necessary in order to achieve what he believes to be the greater good.The Op, who is employed by the Continental Detective Agency in San Francisco, is detailed to the Personville, a mining town known to most as Poisonville. The town was, for a long time, under the thumb of Elihu Willsson who owned the Personville Mining Corporation, the local newspapers, and a number of other businesses as well. He also controlled all of the politicians of any consequence, up to and including the state governor.During the First World War, Willsson had made whatever deals were necessary with the miners' unions to ensure that the company's operations were unimpeded. But once the war ended, he determined to break the unions and in doing so, invited in a number of thugs and crooks to assist him. The unions were effectively cowed, but the thugs and crooks stayed in town and carved out interests for themselves, effectively reducing Willsson's authority.As the book opens, Elihu's son, Donald, has asked the Continental Detective Agency for assistance. Elihu has now turned the town's newspapers over to his son and the son is something of a reformer. But before the Op can even meet with Donald, Donald is murdered. The Op believes that it is his obligation to identify the killer. As he attempts to do so, old Elihu Willsson offers the Op $10,000.00 to clean up Personville. In reality, he wants to get rid of the gangs that are competing for control of the town so that he can dominate it unchallenged once again.The Op is repulsed by the level of corruption in the town and by Elihu himself. But he decides to take the job so that he can indulge his own desire to clean up the town and cleverly drafts his agreement with Willsson to effectively give himself carte blanche, even if Willsson should ultimately change his mind about turning the Op loose on the problem.The plot that unfolds is dense and convoluted, but the strength of the book lies in Hammett's prose style, in the characters he develops, and in picture he paints of Personville. As a practical matter, there is not a single moral, selfless person in the entire town, the Continental Op included. He quickly proves that he's ready to get down in the muck with the croooks, grafters and corrupt city officials and do whatever is necessary to complete the quest he's assigned himself.As a young man, Hammett had worked as a detective for the Pinkerton agency in San Francisco and had spent some time during the war in the mining town of Butte, Montana as a strikebreaker. People have long speculated that \\"Poisonville\\" was modeled on Butte, a company town controlled by the Anaconda Mining Company. People have also speculated about Hammett's motives for writing the book, suggesting that he might have been seeking some redemption for the actions he had taken in Butte. Whatever the case, the result is a seminal work that stands as one of the great classics of American crime fiction and that has influenced scores of writers who have attempted to follow in Hammett's footsteps."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest is the first hard boiled novel I've ever read. It won't be the last.I picked it up after reading an interview with Matt Stover, author ofHeroes Die,Blade of Tyshalle, andCaine Black Knife (Acts of Caine). Stover is easily my favorite writer, and his Caine series is my favorite sf/fantasy series of all time. In the interview, he mentioned his strong liking for the hard boiled genre and it's influence over his own work. Red Harvest was a book he singled out as having a particularly strong influence on him. So I decided to check it out.After reading the first page, I was hooked. I bought it right then and there, and blew through it in no time.I won't bother to summarize the plot, since so many others have already done so. I will say that the writing is some of the best I've ever seen. Hammett says more with fewer words than anybody I've ever read. His lean style is a master class in the art of word economy. More writers could learn from him.The overall plot inspired several later works, such as Kurasawa's Yojimbo and Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. Experts constantly argue over just how much influence Red Harvest had on Yojimbo. Though I wouldn't go so far as to say Kurosawa \\"ripped off\\" Hammett, as a casual observer I'd say it was definitely a source of inspiration.Either way, Red Harvest is a classic that stands on its own. It's a gritty, violent tale full of corruption, revenge, and greed. The hero is as morally grey as the villains at times, and the end isn't a triumph of good over evil. It's a restoration of order to a rotten, lawless town. That kind of work demands a hero who's willing to fight just as dirty as the bad guys, and Hammett gives him to us.I'll definitely be reading more of Hammett's Continental Op stories in the near future."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The Continental Op who is the narrator of the novel doesn't even give a name. If you know the author's history, he was probably basing it on his experiences with the Pinkerton Detective Agency in Butte, Montana. Anyway, the Op is sent to Personville which was pronounced Poisonville somewhere near Utah.The setting is curious to me. When you first start reading, you keep asking yourself why the Op stays in this corruptive village in the middle of nowhere. It's a mining town but it's filled with plenty of corruption. Everybody is corrupt even the narrator. The stories here were told in a serialized style for pulp fiction magazines for entertainment value.Is there literary value in pulp fiction, you bet there is with Dashiell Hammett who was the king of pulp fiction of his time period. He was a troubled author with alcohol problems, health, and his own demons of war and experiences as a Pinkerton detective. He was really trying to redefine the mystery detective genre.Unlike Sherlock Holmes, Jane Marple or Hercule Poirot, Op is unique in his voice. He's not necessarily evil nor good but shady and complicated. His character is never really defined nor do we do much about his character's history and background. He stays to clean up Personville.True to style, Hammett's writing includes plenty of references to alcohol during the prohibition time period which this book was written in the first place. It was published in 1926 at the height of prohibition where alcohol consumption and distribution was largely forbidden. Well, corruption ran rampant anyway.That's the morality tale here about corruption in a small town or any town over alcohol, power, money, etc. The characters here are thinly veiled and just mere caricatures of society's depiction of the time period. We don't feel sympathy towards anybody in this novel nor do we root for anybody even Op.I was assigned to read this novel for my 20th Century American history class in college about the 1920s. At times, I struggled with all the murders, crimes, motives, and explanations regarding the novel. I do now understand a lot more about the 1920s. Personville seemed more like Poisonville after all with blood, poison, manipulation, lies, treachery, even in the small towns."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"\\"Red Harvest,\\" Dashiell Hammett's first published novel (in 1929), reveals a world of venality, mayhem and revenge that set the tone for detective novels half a century into the future.A Continental Detective Agency Op is summoned from California to \\"Poisonville,\\" Mont. by aged newspaper owner and banker Elihu Willsson.

Brutal and cynical in conception, it pits a San Francisco detective against a corrupt Midwestern town nicknamed poisonville. The hero, after his client dies on the very evening of his arrival, becomes embroiled in a triangular fight between police, gangsters, and their common, industrialist paymaster. Shifting allegiances, gunfights, and repeated murders pepper the breathtaking contest that ensues. And the plot would not be complete without the involvement of the femme fatale Dinah Brand, the protagonist's beguiling but faithless information supplier.Red Harvest is breathlessly-paced and highly readable. Still, I came to Hammett after having exhausted Raymond Chandler, and I did not find one quite on the same level as the other. This is a different kind of noir: rawer, punchier, less polished. The Continental Op, the anonymous hero, does not match the self-deprecating Philip Marlowe in complexity. Sultry L.A. has been lost in favour of a more rough-and-tumble setting. And the style of writing reflects this, stripped of Chandler's quirky yet apposite metaphors, of his ironic asides and wry character sketches. I will no-doubt be trying out more Hammett. As this did not match my extremely high expectations, however, I can only give it four stars."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"I know, a lot of people will insist \\"The Maltese Falcon\\" is not only the greatest book by Dashiell Hammett but maybe the best book of its kind by any author. I think maybe those people get the book confused with the movie, which is a superior version of the same story. \\"Red Harvest\\" is a more complex book that I think is both darker and more satisfying than any other book by Hammett or Chandler. Nobody ever created the kind of noir feeling that Hammett did so well, and this is probably the best showcase of that. The dialogue is just great, there are lots of surprises to the plot and you really feel like you are living back in that era as you read it. For anyone who likes those genre of storytelling or just wants to get familiar with it, there is no better place to start."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest is noir prohibition era novel set in a corrupt western mining town. The story begins with the narrator, a private investigator from a prestigious detective agency based in San Francisco, arriving into the dirty and unkempt town of Parsonville (pronounced Poisonville). In the first act the narrator finds out the client that hired him is killed shortly after the detective arrives in town. What follows is a gritty and deadly whodunit. The narrator is taken through the dark and dangerous streets in an attempt to unravel the mysteries and clean up the town of organized crime. He is shown to be circumspect and tough, with a weakness for alcohol and making impulsive decisions.The highlight of the book is in the descriptions and observations of the detective. This is Dashiel Hammett's greatest skill as a writer. The narrator makes clear and keen observations without any unnecessary details. There is a Sherlock Holmes like astuteness in his conclusions and solutions in the unsolved crimes of the town. As a whole though, the story might seem a bit cliched and overwrought to the modern reader. Tropes and twists that have been used repeatedly and refined in books and movies in the ensuing years might seem to be cheap and simple in retrospect. The story is a bit weak too. By the end of the book there are close to 30 corpses. Life is quite cheap and killing is done repeatedly and without much remorse. In this aspect the book lacks realism. However the real power is in the writing. Hammett makes acute observations. The dialogue is filled with the long lost vocabulary and idioms of the prohibition-era. While the book has its flaws, its rich with well-crafted descriptions and action."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Red Harvest, originally published in 1929, is Hammett's first full-length novel featuring the nameless \\"Continental Op\\", a private detective employed by the fictional Continental Detective Agency. This book and Hammett's other Continental Op stories are based on his real life experience working for the Pinkertons. Red Harvest and the Continental Op, along with Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe series are the \\"fathers\\" of hard-boiled private-eye fiction.Attempting to outline, let alone explain the plot of this book, is difficult and describing it as convoluted is an understatement. When our hero arrives in Personville, aka Poisonville, for a case, he finds the mining town a cesspool of corruption, embroiled in a life and death struggle with rival gangs, hoodlums, grifters and crooked cops all vying for the top of this squalid, but lucrative heap and their piece of the financial pie.Our nameless hero insinuates himself into the middle of this mess playing the warring factions against each other with double crosses, misinformation and manipulation. (This storyline of the lone gunman in a corrupt town the precursor/basis for Kurosawa's Yojimbo, Clint Eastwood's A Fistful of Dollars and Bruce Willis' Last Man Standing.)Written 80+ years ago this story still has a modern flavor - particularly the violence as well as the smarmy characters and their less than stellar motivations. If you're a fan of the PI genre, pick up Red Harvest to see where and how it all began."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"&quot;Red Harvest&quot; was author Dashiell Hammett's first novel. The material was not entirely original; it first appeared in serial form in &quot;Black Mask&quot; magazine in 1927-1928 under the title &quot;The Cleansing of Poisonville&quot;. Hammett reworked the story into novel form, and &quot;Red Harvest&quot; was published in 1929. This is also the first of Hammett's popular &quot;Continental Op&quot; novels, which feature an unnamed private detective employed by the Continental Detective Agency of San Francisco. &quot;Red Harvest&quot;'s narrator and veteran Continental operative defies any idea of a glamorous or attractive crime fighter. He's short, pot-bellied, alcoholic, and resolutely cynical. He's living in an immoral world, where success comes to those who fight fire with fire. Like all of Hammett's protagonists, he has little use for the law, but lives by a personal code to which he strictly adheres. That doesn't make him especially ethical, only principled. But Hammett's characters, like Hammett himself, are coping in their own way with the widespread corruption that ruled America's cities in the 1920s and 1930s.&quot;Red Harvest&quot;'s opening paragraph is one of the best hooks I've ever read in a novel. It's fantastic. We are sucked into the mind of our narrator, the unnamed Continental operative, and we want only to read more about this man of such blunt wit. The Continental Op has been called to a town named Personville by the owner of the town's newspaper, Donald Willsson. He doesn't know what the job is, but before he can find out, the client is murdered. So the first order of business is to solve the murder. In doing so, our detective discovers how Personville got its nickname, Poisonville. Everything and everyone in this town is corrupt. Its citizens are ruled by bootleggers and low-lifes who retain their power through indiscriminate violence. Even the town's former boss, Elihu Willsson, a wealthy industrialist who was not above murder in his own day, is now reluctantly under the thumb of the new crop of thugs. Our detective takes offense at Poisonville's powers trying several times to assassinate him in the course of his murder investigation, so he decides to stay and clean up the place. Little did he expect that Poisonville's rampant bloodshed would poison him, as he is seduced by the town's murderous ways.It's surprising to me that Dashiell Hammett wrote &quot;Red Harvest&quot; years before &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. &quot;Red Harvest&quot;'s style seems more developed and its characters better drawn than in the later novel. That's not to say that I don't like &quot;The Thin Man&quot;. I actually prefer its more scandalous brand of cynicism. Hammett is always cynical, but sociopathic behavior is to be expected from the characters that inhabit Personville's landscape. They are criminals and police officers (remember, this is the 1920s). The undeniably sociopathic behavior of everyone in &quot;The Thin Man&quot; -from small time con men, to respectable bourgeois, to Park Avenue blue bloods- is like a slap in the face. And so is the book's shameless lack of justice. But perhaps Hammett just chose a different shock tactic in &quot;Red Harvest&quot;. The book's greatest cynicism is in the ease with which the Continental Op is seduced into abandoning his own code of conduct when faced with the opportunity to murder without consequences. That's why they call it Poisonville. Fans of noir detective stories wont' want to miss &quot;Red Harvest&quot;. There are enough hard-boiled one-liners to inspire glee in those who really enjoy them. Hammett's style is fluid and easy to read. And there is more than one mystery to be solved."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Dashiell Hammett took the mystery story out of the drawing room and put it squarely into the American street with his stories of his nameless Continental Detective Agency Private Eye during the 1920's. Known as \\"the Continental Op\\" Hammett's hero, a short middle aged, slightly fattish loner was a break from the past as regards mystery stories. Hammett, along with Carroll John Daly and other BLACK MASK MAGAZINE pulp writers revolutionized the detective story with their gritty realism and adventurous stories of gats, guns, and molls.RED HARVEST is probably the Continental Op's best know adventure, pitting him against the forces of corruption and crime in a small town named Personville. The Op calls the burg \\"Poisonville\\" and the cast of villainous characters that he encounters and goes up against make the nickname quite apt.If you've seen the movies \\"A Fistful of Dollars\\", \\"Last Man Standing\\", or \\"Yojimbo\\" then you have a general idea of what the tale is about. While none of these follows Hammett's intricate plot, the premise of a lone gunman outsmarting and out dueling the whole town is what the story is about. From the time that the Op breezes into town to talk with his client, whom is murdered before the Op can ever meet with him, till the end of the story, there is lots of violence, murder, double dealing and cynical observations by the narrating detective. While we never learn very much about the Op his driven and unswerving dedication to riding the town of any and all opponents takes on the role of obsession and vigilantism by the end of the novel, so much so that the Op himself even begins to have some doubts. Not enough to stop him from completing the job however.Hammett's spare lean style of writing isn't for everybody, especially those who want in-depth character studies where the protagonist spends a lot of time mulling over the state of the universe and his own personal angst. However if you want action and good tight writing then he's your man. A justly acclaimed classic ever since it came out, this novel is the one that started the \\"hard boiled\\" school of writing ball rolling."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Of all the books written by the chronological trio of Hammett, Chandler, and MacDonald, only Red Harvest seems as honest and truthful now as I am sure it did in 1939. Although Hammett lacks Chandler's writing flare and sarcasm, his style makes for fast-paced, edge of the seat reading. As his Continental Op escapes harrowing situation after another, I was left with a disbelief, but this novel is not about whether the Op could ruin an entire town with merely a scratch. It is instead a commentary on society, and on the cutthroat nature still evident in us all. In so many ways, this novel reminds me of Shirley Jackson's haunting story &quot;The Lottery&quot; because the evil in our world is within the system, and in each person. Just as the Op confesses to wanting to join the killing spree, Hammett has made us want to read about more killing. He dupes us into playing the Op's game. This novel is so much deeper than what can be read in the text. In his own way, he tells us to look out for a system corrupted by greed and a quest for power. Much like Chandler, Hammett always has a message. Heed this one readers, but enjoy the enchantment of this amazing novel."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The Continental Op, an anonymous agent of the Continental Detective Agency, comes to corrupt Personville (aka Poisonville) and investigates a series of murders. In succession he confronts the murder of the publisher of the local paper, the murder of the police chief's brother, and the murder of a beautiful woman. The publisher's father, convinced that local gangsters are responsible for his son's death, employs the Op to break up the organized crime stranglehold on Personville. The Continental Op determines that he cannot quickly destroy the crimelords by lawful means, so he decides to work outside the law to destroy them. The murder of the police chief's son provides him with a golden opportunity to maneuver the rival gangs into lethal conflict. During these investigations, peripheral characters drop like flies as rival gangs feud over turf. The Continental Op continues his investigations, stirs up strife among the gangs, and tries to elude arrest himself as the dance of death lumbers to its bloody denouement. It is near impossible to keep an accurate bodycount through the course of the novel. Despite the carnage, the detective work is excellent, the intrigue is gripping, and the mysteries are satisfying.This book inspired three movies: Akira Kurosawa's &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; the Clint Eastwood oater &quot;A Fistful of Dollars,&quot; and the Bruce Willis prohibition era epic &quot;Last Man Standing.&quot; I haven't seen &quot;Yojimbo,&quot; but the Eastwood and Willis movies hardly compare to &quot;Red Harvest&quot; for complexity and character development. They accentuate the bloodshed and virtually ignore everything else."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"Between 1915 and 1922, Dashiell Hammett worked for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, initially from Baltimore's Continental Building office and later in Washington State and California. His experiences for the firm provided the background and the name for the Continental Detective Agency that features in most of his stories and in two of his novels (including &quot;Red Harvest&quot;), and Pinkerton operative James Wright served as the model for the &quot;fat, middle-aged, hard-boiled, pig-headed guy&quot; referred to only as the Continental Op.In &quot;Red Harvest,&quot; the Op is summoned to Personville (known locally as Poisonville), where he is engaged by newspaper publisher Donald Willson, who is murdered before the agent has an opportunity to meet him. At first the novel feels like a traditional murder mystery; in its first half there are two homicides (among more than two dozen gangland-style assassinations) whose clues are scattered for the reader--and the Op--to solve.Yet the two whodunits are red herrings meant to distract--and entertain--the reader (and crime novel aficionados will figure both of them out within a few paragraphs). Not just a murder mystery, &quot;Red Harvest&quot; pursues broader themes: how corruption and greed poisons the inhabitants of Poisonville, how the Op is able to thwart the ambitions of various criminals by playing their own unprincipled game, and how his own abandonment of professional code nearly destroys the detective himself.Most of the crooks are stock figures from noir central casting, but the novel's femme fatale, Dinah Brand, is the most memorable. She serves not only as foil to the Op's passionless cynicism but also as a warning to the dangers of the sport: like the Op, she insinuates herself into whichever camp is in control, never dirtying her own hands with the unsavory activities that bring her the money she voraciously accumulates--only to find herself expendable when no faction needs her at all.During a flirtatious rendezvous with Dinah, the Op slips into a laudanum-induced dream, in which he imagines himself &quot;hunting for a man I hated. I had an open knife in my pocket and meant to kill him.&quot; He finds the man and pursues him across a rooftop, where they tussle near the building's edge, only to realize &quot;that I had gone off the edge of the roof with him.&quot; When he awakes, The Op--and the reader--discovers just how near the edge of precipice he has crawled, and the remainder of this perceptive book recounts his journey back from the brink."},{"Title":"Red Harvest","review":"The story is told by an agent from the Continental Detective Agency. He has been called to the town of Personville or, as he explains, is more aptly named, Poisonville. His client is Donald Willsson, but Willsson is shot and killed before the Continental Op can meet him. He decides to visit Willson's father, Elihu, who until recently ran the town. Elihu Willson winds up hiring the Continental Op to clean up the town by getting rid of the town's 3 criminal bosses. In true gangster-style, the names of the criminals are Max \\"Whisper\\" Thaler, Lew Yard and Pete the Finn.The clean up job becomes the main focus of the rest of the book, although along the way, the Continental Op manages to solve the murder of his original client as well as most other minor crimes that spring up around him. The Continental Op is an interesting character, having no qualms about setting others up, knowingly placing them in mortal danger in order to uncover evidence or confirm his suspicions. He will lie, cheat and double-cross just about anyone.The deaths come thick and fast and are mentioned off-handedly, almost as an afterthought. Red Harvest is fast moving and entertaining and as hardboiled as they come."}]`),S={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:H},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},x=["disabled"],M={key:0},q={key:1};function R(s,a,n,u,r,i){const c=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[a[1]||(a[1]=o("div",{class:"top-banner"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[o("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),o("div",E,[(e(!0),t(w,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),g(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:a[0]||(a[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",q,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",M,"See more"))],8,x)):p("",!0)])}const C=d(S,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-769f49c0"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/26.md","filePath":"quotesmag/26.md"}'),P={name:"quotesmag/26.md"},N=Object.assign(P,{setup(s){return(a,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(C)]))}});export{W as __pageData,N as default};
