It's very Teen TV, it's very Katie Holmes, very Buffy, very Charmed. It's very much a near-miss. The first 100 pages could've been compressed to 50; the whole high school atmosphere was unnecessary--and a poor retread of countless H.S. movies--even though the protagonist was a high school student, the HIGH SCHOOL didn't need to be so prominently featured--ever read Peyton Place?--that book's protagonist was a high school student, too, you know. I also feel Miss Atwater-Rhodes diluted her story's impact by bringing in witches IN ADDITION to vampires. Two such diametrically opposed groups merit their own respective stories--or at least a VERY BIG book to cover them both--not some novella one can read on a train ride from Milwaukee to Chicago. But to zero in on this world Miss Atwater-Rhodes has created: I thought Risika rendered Aubrey basically impotent at the end of &quot;Forests&quot;; so how come Aubrey is such a powerful dude in this book? Her concentration on Aubrey, the first book's antagonist, smacks of Anne Rice's exploration of Lestat (her 1st book's antagonist) in her SECOND vampire novel (coincidence?). The scene wherein Caryn and Aubrey join forces in the forest to do a good deed at the end--it made me think of Rodney King after the L.A. riots in 1994--&quot;Can we all just get along?&quot; Oh, brother. The scenes at Las Noches--and all of New Mayhem--defy reality--just too many mortals around witnessing these vampires' quarrels--gee, aren't they going to blab to someone that there are VAMPIRES acting rowdy in upstate New York! And this whole idea of vampires walking around in sunlight is just ridiculous--it's just not how the myth goes--sure, there's room for individual interpretation--but you gotta stick to the core rules. And don't tell me about Lestat going out in sunlight--as soon as Lestat could fly like Superman, I was all through. And I really missed Risika--she was so beautiful and so powerful and independent--that's the kind of vampire I love! So for all of these reasons, I cry FOUL!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This book took me an hour to read -- one hour! Besides that it was terribly written for someone he age for that fact. It was too shallow and she couldn't go on a page without the pathetic sarcasm. Jessica sounds like a baby and Aubrey sounds like a teen who just reached puberty. It was just another sad love story with the fantasy of Amelia herself. I wouldn't suggest this, or unless you are a teen who will read anything. It was just like reading a subcription of Vogue and I hate Vogue."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This was actually the first novel from Amelia that I read, what threw me off were the myths. I am getting quite annoyed with White Wolf writers who keep changing the vampire myth. I don't care about one of two things, but Amelia takes their reputation away as the Creatures of Darkness.The closest thing to gothic was Jessica who dressed dark and mysterious, supposedly, but held the persona of an annoying cheerleader gone scorned trying to be something she isn't. She's under the pen name of Ash Night who meets a guy by the name of Alex, only in actuality, Aubrey from her books.Predictably, there is a love story and from the beginning you know Jessica will turn into a vampire. Those who didn't obviously haven't read anything in the vampire genre. The relationships are anything but realistic. Two dimensional and shallow. Everyone looks like a model, I never though Amelia to be the type of person like so. If she lived in reality she would know a majority of young girls are going through peer pressure when it comes to the teen adolescents.I laughed when she said Fala was the villain, one of the weakess vampires? What convinced Amelia to do that? The villain was nothing but whiny, held no sign of intelligence and listened to Aubrey like a dog. She's even afraid to kill Jessica's mother with her own hands.The book is filled with cliches and the vampires seem more like humans then they do vampires. For those who find the vampires more believable, well, the first sentence of this paragraph explains why. The only people who will fall for this book are teens who either haven't ever read an Anne Rice novel, or those feeble minds who pay no attention to good work.As far as the changes in vampires, it's Amelia's way of trying to be original. Hanging the vampire myth nowadays is far from the originality of writers who stick with most of the myths. This is definately her worse work yet. I have seen fanfiction better then this garbage.I would suggest this for the middle school and under. This book is actually a third grade level when it comes to reading, or unless you count the passages where she forces higher vocabulary as if it means anything to her weak style."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I just loved this book. I read her first book (In the forests of the night)and liked Aubrey from the start even though he was bad in the first book.It was great to see him be the good guy in this book.Ok basicaly this book is about this girl named Jessica Who writes horror books about vampires. She doesn't think that vampires exsist and thats where the trouble starts. See vampires really DO exsisit and she's writting the truth about them.BIG problem. In telling her stories some of the vampires have come across as weak. Thats a very bad thing because vampires don't like seeming weak.So Aubrey go's to check it out.Well he gets a big suprise.He meets her at school where Jessica is an outsider. He detects a slight vampiric arua around her but doesn't know why. She immediately trusts him not knowing that he's a vampire. A witch/Vampire hunter/killer shows up at her school too. And tries to keep her away from Alex/Aybrey But fails because Jessica doesn't like her.Well in good time Jessica learns that what she's writing IS real and that Aubrey IS a vampire and that she's in some BIG trouble. First she thinks that Aubrey is going to kill her. But she's wrong again he's fallen in love with her and is trying to protect her from a vampire named Fala. Aubrey wants to turn jessica into a vampire but can't because thats what Jessica wants and if he does what she wants she will be a VERY weak Vampire.Jessica finds out that her mother became a vampire by will while she was pregnant with Jessica So Jessica was kept alive on vampire blood for 20 years. her mother was brought to ife by a vampire hunter because the hunter wanted to save jessica.But by being kept alive for 20 years on vampire blood is why she's slightly Vampiric and thats where her vampiric arua come from. Her So anyway Fala attaks jessica and almost kills her. But Aubrey and the Witch save her. Jessica drew Fala's blood which means that Aubrey can now turn her into a vampire because in fighting Fala she fought for her life. Aubrey asks Jessica if she would like to become a vampire. She thinks it over and decides she wants to be one. He turns her and the book pretty much ends. But you can tell that she's gonna be very strong. I hope the auther continues the Jessica/Aubrey thing. So Amelia if you ever read this I think you have a ton of talent and and I hope you continue this series."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"It is incredibly difficult to find a GOOD book when you are fourteen years-old. My mother is always telling me to expand my horizons, but I never do. I have to be able to relate to the main character in a book in order to like it. I don't usually read horror stories, because the main characters are always at least a decade or three older than me. Demon in My View is different. It is an intriguing story; I read it all in one night. The author created an amazing world, and I find myself wishing that I could read all fifteen of Jessica's manuscripts for want of more history. character. This is exactly the type of book I like, and my only qualm is that there aren't that many books like it out for teenagers. The magic of it has left me somewhat sad that I finished it so quickly. Amelia Atwater-Rhodes is a true inspiration for all young writers. You can not possibly expect one so young to be perfect in her writing. It is surprising how much her skill is developed. I can only possibly dream of being able to write like her. I love to write, and it is wonderful to see a girl my age succeed. Adults can not possibly understand the main character of this book unless they remember exactly what it was like to be a teenager. The main character's ultimate inner conflict is what she wants to do with her life. Atwater-Rhodes portrays this beautifully as only a teenager can."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Mary Sues are unforgivable. This book is such a blatant and shameless MS that I regret asking for it for Christmas all those years ago. Eh, what can I say. I was only twelve--didn't know any better. But now I'm older and I can say this book is crap. It doesn't deserve shelf space in a respectable book lovers home, especially since anyone who has the audacity to put herself so obviously into her book after only writing ONE deserves to have her hands acquainted with a sledgehammer.Sorry Amelia but this just isn't a good book. Still isn't. I'm terrified to read it again because I might rip out my hair or something. One star because I can't give a 0; and one star for making my bizarre adolescence somewhat enjoyable with your descriptions of Aubrey. (Huzzah!)Jessica Allodola is this writer who doesn't understand why her dreams and stories about vampires are suddenly becoming reality, nor does she understand why the kids at school hate her and most specifically why the boys don't ask her out. You learn early on that Jessica is beautiful, \\"flawless,\\" and yet everyone avoids her like the plague. Enter the mysterious new student Aubrey to try and seduce the girl for whatever reason. Isn't it one of those tried and true laws of vampire novels that you don't get to know the person you want to kill because some way or another feelings will develop? That's what happens here. Aubrey originally went to Jessica's school to find out more about her before he snaps her neck and he finds himself drawn to her. So immediately the tough guy of the series that Amelia is timidly laying out for herself has turned into a wishy washy sap that goes weak for a girl with a pretty face. Doesn't make me afraid of him, but it does make me fear just how much more damage Amelia can do.Trying to sway Jessica away from Aubrey and the clutches of vampires is probably the only likable character Amelia's uninspired imagination ever spawned: a witch, Caryn Smoke. Caryn is genuinely nice and concerned with Jessica's well being, but Jessica wants nothing to do with her. Hey if I had this sweet little thing trying to heal me after I got my arse handed to me by vampires I wouldn't snap at her. And if said Healer witch offered to have me stay at her house after a vampire killed my foster mother I wouldn't treat her or the girl's mother like pests. Jessica is a spoiled brat that deserves to get killed off if Amelia had any sense. I feel bad that Caryn wasted her time on her.For some reason Amelia makes every character in her books drop dead gorgeous. It's not that Amelia herself is ugly, but she definitely needs to understand that her airbrushed view of the world is only accepted for so long.Don't praise this girl for her age. I'm 16 and I can write better than the garbage she's producing at 19. Now that may seem like arrogance on my part but I can assure you, it isn't. It's disgust. Amelia's age isn't something to be proud of, not if she wants to try and make a serious career out of her writing. She's going to be plagued by her slights for the rest of her career--that is if she has one. At this rate it seems slim at best; all those pre teens praising her can only bow and worship her for so long until they realise just how godawful she can sink. Demon In My View is a sure testament of how low Amelia can go, and considering how bad her recent books were, she still hasn't rose fully up.And just so you know: Mary Sues is when a writer makes a character that's so obviously themself and puts them in outrageous, fantasty-derived situations you can tell the author is just dying to have happen to her."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"she comes up with such creative story lines and creative unique titles that make you want to pick it up and give it more thought, since this book i have read all of her other books! and i love them all!!!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I had a serious problem with anything out of any horror film, including vampires. This book makes me wish it was all real. What makes this book so great? A A-R puts together all sorts of genres together under the cover of a horror. Only a great writer would be able to do that. This book would make even the scariest book-scardycat brave. I mean, seriously, I would shed SOMEONE's blood if they didn't write a sequel. This book gives me a shiver of pleasure, no matter how many times I read it."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"This wasn't the worst book; it wasn't the greatest book. Granted, Amelia was fifteen when she wrote this, it isn't too bad of a book, being the grammar's right and there aren't any spelling errors or anachronisms, like you'd find in a VC Andrews book. But the characters weren't developed and it seemed as though she told too much rather than showed. Also, there were way too many adverbs. As Stephen King said, \\"The adverb is not your friend.\\" But besides that, she did decent. She told the story and got it published. Would I recommend it? No. Read her later works, which are actually quite good. Hawksong surprised me. I dislike her early works, but Hawksong is a good novel and definitely worthy of publication. And to Chelsea K. Palmer - get over yourself. If you are so good of a writer, then why aren't you putting those 'talents' to use? You obviously aren't that good if you can't finish a dang story!With that said, read the book if you want to. But I suggest not. Stick with her latest works.Cheers!"},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Good book, I read it within a few hours, and although it's not an on the edge of your seat page-turner, it follows a consistent plot line and she effectively throws in a couple twists. Jessica the female lead in the book is written as a strong heroine. This is a \\"PG\\" rated book. I thought upon picking up Demon In My View that it didn't seem like it belonged in the Young Adult Genre, but it's accurately placed. Although some sparks fly between Audrey (our heroine protecting vampire) and Jessica it's all very innocent. I would recommend checking this book out at the library before purchasing it.As far as the story line goes, Jessica finds out that the fictional paranormal stories aren't so fictional. Not all of her characters are so happy about how they are portrayed. So Audrey her vampire lead is sent out to check out this \\"Mysterious Author\\" and make sure things get taken care of. He likes her of course because she is a very independent individual with lots of inner strength. All in all a decent read.If you are looking for something that is well written and has a bit more bite, I highly recommend Simon Green and his Nightside Novels."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"After seeing all the good reviews, I have to say that I would had never read a book by a high school student, but since it got such praise, I decided to take this one up. I read the NOVELLA, getting tired of seeing people call it a novel. Majority of YA books are nothing but short novellas and a majority of YA books are from inexperience writers.This book is another one of those.The main character is a callous and lone wolf, Jessica, who apparently hates everyone for unknown reasons. That's what makes the character so unrealistic. She's a loner and doesn't have friends, why? Well, lets put it this way, she's rude, mean, shallow and highly superficial. Who would want to be her friend?The sad thing is both main characters, Jessica and Aubrey are extremely hot, so hot that they deserve each other. If I were Jessica, I probably would have tons of boyfriends. Apparently, these characters have no flaws once so ever, none mental or physical.The vampires are nothing but invincible beings. Even the villain is a weakling. She is one of the WEAKEST vampires I have seen in a book.RULE #1 Amelia Atwater-Rhodes: You never and I mean never, make the villain weaker than the heroine and hero. It's plain stupidity.Vampires: holy substances don't harm, stakes don't kill, hell, they aren't even demon. Vampires are suppose to have weaknesses, rather they sound like human-vampire wannabes.Question: Why are the vampires in school?Others things I had a problem with were the plot, characterization ans style. The style was annoying to read. It sounded like a Dawson's Creek episode. The book is cliched and unrealistic. I don't understand how this girl got published, but we know why, her age. It had to do with her age. After reading this book I am suggesting you don't read anything by a high school student, or unless somehow the writer withholds his or her age and gains actual praise for actual writing..."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"Ii saddened me when I picked up IN THE FOREST OF THE NIGHT and wanted to throw it across the room. It was one of the most unoriginial books I had ever read (and I read more then the average teenager. About a book ever two days.). Miss Atwater-Rhodes writting is not all that great. It is to filled with to many cliches and horrible attempts at intelligent words, to grab my attention and want me to keep reading till my eyes fall out. He story is very close to Christopher Pikes' THE LAST VAMPIRE to really snag the originaility line. The &quot;mythology&quot; is chilish and simple. And her mortal teenagers plain out bothered me. They were the same as every sterotypical teen you see and read about. Even the teens on TV seem real, and they are writen by forty-year-olds. I am a social outcast-- yes, I know that was unexpected-- and many of my classmates think I'm satan, but they do not treat, in any way, like Jessica.And another thing. In the first book wasn't Jessica said to be living in Concord. And I DEMON IN MY VIEW she is said to haved lived in Ramsa all he life. Can we say plothole?Oh, well, I know you all are tired of me and want me to be swept away be a swarm of locusts, but this is my opinion, and I know it doesn't matter to you.

Jessica doesn't know how much trouble the book gets her into until two people step into her life. These two people are Caryn Rashida who is secretly a witch, and Alex Remington who is really a vampire named Aubrey that Jessica has written about in her books. The reason Caryn and Aubrey seek Jessica is because everything Jessica has written in her book is true. Jessica writes about the world in which vampires and witches live. Caryn must protect Jessica from Aubrey because he is trying to kill Jessica so she can not write anymore. After meeting Jessica, Aubrey falls in love with her and will not kill her although he is pressured to by another vampire named Fala. Fala dislikes Jessica because Jessica wrote about Fala's weaknesses. As the story goes on, Jessica learns the truth about her life while dodging death. In the end Jessica does die but it's not the death you would expect. Jessica's inner strength is amazing and she is very sure of herself and very confident. Her actions are never influenced by others. Jessica doesn't dwell on what she wishes would happen, but looks reality in the eye and glares right back. I definitely recommend this book, but I would read the first book, In the Forests of the Night before reading this one."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"I admit I liked &quot;In the Forests of the Night&quot; better than this book.

I couldn't understand why Aubrey would want to help her.The Aubrey character was the biggest letdown with this book. For Aubrey to be such a tough vampire, I thought it unrealistic of him to fall in love with Jessica and give so much to save her life when he despises humans.

Miss Rhodes has some signs of talent but I think it would have been wise to wait a few years so she could grow and learn more about the art. I'm the same age as her and read a little to much (I average a 300-400 page book about ever three days. The idea that this is suppose to be a teen book scares me. There are many good YA authors who deserve a lot more plublicity then Miss Rhodes (Cormier, Block, and Klause, just to name a few). Another thing that bothered me was Miss Rhodes age. I'd expect someone with her intelligence to come up with better ideas and believable characters-- there is no way she's passing any English class. I felt like I was reading a Buffy book, and not in a good way. I'm also tired of all these happy endings we keep see in Ya literature. The world for teen is not a happy place. Even the newest Harry Potter book is darker and scarier then DEMON IN MY VIEW. In short, Amelia At-water-Rhodes's books should be marketed to 11-13 year-olds and she might want to wait a few years before publishing a new YA novel (but we all know this won't happen)."},{"Title":"Demon in My View (Den of Shadows)","review":"&quot;Demon In My View&quot; (the title is lifted from Poe's poem &quot;Alone&quot;)contains nothing of redeeming value, or any serious literary merit.

This is my first &quot;undeworld&quot; book, but from other &quot;underworld&quot; readers this is said to measure up very well. The best thing in this book are the characters, who are masterfully described in every detail, but not all at once to overwhelm the reader. The person, or shall I say vampire, that caught my eye the most was Aubrey, a powerful vampire who shadows the rest of the characters, although he is not the protagoninst. Aubrey is a powerful, suductive, teasing, and very cool vampire who you have no hope but to surrendur to.

However, one will get the main thrust of what Feuerbach was arguing if one takes the time to read this short digest whose original subtitle was \\"God the Image of Man: Man's Dependence uon Nature the Last and Only Source of Religion\\".Feuerbach says very little that is new in this book; one can find many of its main ideas in Friedrich Schleiermacher's work On Religion: Speeches to its Cultured Despisers, particularly the notion that religion is fundamentally the feeling of dependence within man. In defining the religious impulse as \\"intuition of the universe\\", Schleiermacher very much set the stage for the materialistic interpretations of Feuerbach that were to come a generation later.In fact, Feuerbach seems to want to set Schleiermacher on his head, inverting the notion of dependence and intuition of the universe into dependence upon Nature (which has now been deified). Thus, not only is there a projection of humanity's feeling of dependence onto Nature called \\"God\\", but a further step in that projection where God (ie, man's projection) is now said to create humanity in His own image. Religion, then, is based on a type of vicious hermeneutical circle - until Feuerbach, of course.Feuerbach stands at the tail end of the Enlightenment's disenchantment of the world. As he himself puts it, \\"man disappears by the side of a God; only where the earth is depopulated of Gods, where the Gods ascend into heaven and change from real beings into imagined ones; only there men have space and room for themselves, only there can they show themselves without any restraint as men and put themselves forward as such\\" (41 - 2).One of the most interesting things about this brief compendia is how often Feuerbach turns to Protestantism's founding theologian, Martin Luther. While Luther undoubtedly would have been horrified at the emptying of Protestantism into secularism, the question of anthropocentrism as being the heart of Protestant theology - even in its secular parodying - is raised in Feuerbach rather starkly.Karl Barth, the greatest Protestant theologian of the 20th century, one wrote that in Feuerbach we have an \\"anti-theologian\\" and in this he was certainly correct. Next to no one reads Feuerbach any more, and this is probably due to the fact that his arguments against religion as supernatural are largely trapped within a mid-19th century hermeneutical horizon where Reason and Science still permeated the then-modern social imaginary in ways that we ourselves are now skeptical of. Nietzsche, however, would argue at the end of the 19th century that the \\"death of [the Christian] God\\" meant that humans also had to abandon Christian morality. This does not seem to have occured to Feuerbach, but the flight of the Gods that he describes certainly places a considerable level of context behind persons such as Nietzsche and, after him, Heidegger. The question is whether or not the flight of the Gods has really benefitted us or simply left us devoid of grace?"},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"I bought this book on the strength of Marjorie Garber's excellent past Renaissance scholarship. I was expecting something more theoretically informed and original, but as it is this is a very worthwhile book, and I predict it will be an essential reference book for teachers and students. It's a BIG book with a substantial chapter on each play (but not the sonnets), as with Harold Bloom's book on Shakespeare. Garber, however, is less idiosyncratic than Bloom; She synthesizes the best of recent scholarship, but without footnotes or extensive theorizing a la Derrida and Lacan. Garber combines close attention to language with valuable historical background and context. For example, in her chapter on Macbeth, she relates a \\"new critical\\" analysis of the clothing imagery to sumptuary laws regarding clothing (laws which served to enforce the social hierachy of Renaissance England). The strengths of this book are her comprehensive discussions of the play, which sum up what we know for sure about the plays including the relevant historical contexts, and her brilliant analysis of Shakespeare's language, i.e., close reading. While her work is illuminated by recent scholarship, she avoids the Stalinesque imperatives of political correctness. Compare Garber's intelligent discussion of the problem of gender in Macbeth with Stephen Orgel's \\"introduction\\" in The Complete Pelican Shakespeare, in which he reductively reads the play as a \\"misogynist fantasy.\\" The only reason I docked the book one star is that, based on the chapters I've read so far, she doesn't really make a major original contribution to Shakespeare studies (in contrast to, for example, Greenblatt's recent bio of Shakespeare, Will in the World) so much as synthesize what we already know. All in all, a very valuable reference book that I will be consulting regularly in my college teaching. Highly recommended for high school teachers, English majors (undergraduate and graduate), and all fans of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"My husband and I are lawyers who have recently returned to reading Shakesepare, decades after college. We wanted literary criticism that was qualitative superior to the plot summary readers guide--criticism that would help us explore the imagery, themes and metaphors of the plays. Marjorie Garber is the answer to our prayers. We recommend to readers returning to Shakespeare that they purchase a paperback edition of each play with good notes to help with line specific language issues--the Arden series is the best-and then supplement/enrich the experience with Garbers insights. It is a pleasure for us to carefully read each play and then see what treasures she has mined based on her own reading and that of prior critics. We considerably prefer Garber to Bloom as a single compendium. Garber packs an enormous amount of insight into a single 30 page chapter. Shakespeare is surely worth the detail she provides. I would also suggest that you purchase the Ambrose DVD set of tapes of the great BBC plays--after you have read the plays it is wonderful to watch Jacobi et al. The DVD format enables captions which is very helful to savoring every line."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"This is a wonderful, rich, exploratory book that holds nothing back; a meditation about the Shakespeare canon that resonates in all planes at once. It is certain to be [...] by college teachers everywhere, and so it should be; together with Shapiro's 1599 as a biography and a solid encyclopaedia like the Oxford Companion to Shakespeare, this is one of the only supplementary volumes you'd ever want to shelf next to the Complete Works. This is the kind of full-service critical homage and investigation Shakespeare has been waiting for all these years. I hope he and Marjorie Garber meet in Heaven, and that someone leaks the resulting sonnets."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"This is a monster of a book packed full of insight into the plays of William Shakespeare. Another reviewer has criticized the way Professor Gerber tackles each play, but I think she pitches her analyses pretty spot on. As she describes a play she will stop and detour into some aspect of the cultural mores of the England of Shakespeare's day and come back. I find ( as a layman ) that is exactly what I wanted. I wasn't looking for Heavy Textual Criticism that might only be understandable to other Eng Lit Professors. This is an excellent book for the layman - if you are prepared to concentrate and forgive Professor Gerber when she does occasionally throw in a semantics term that you have never heard of - USUALLY she explains them. But not always."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"As a fan of Shakespeare (both on the stage/screen and written page), I have added to my appreciation by reading various works about this playwright. First there was Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare, which was a well-written commentary on the historical contexts of the plays. Then, there was Harold Bloom's Shakespeare, The Invention of the Human, a scholarly work offset by a tone of high-toned intellectual snobbery and condescension. Now, there is Shakespeare After All, a work that fits between these two in quality.In Shakespeare After All, Marjorie Garber's 900+ page tome on the Bard's plays, we are given an opportunity to learn more of what makes Shakespeare Shakespeare. As a long-time Harvard and Yale lecturer on Shakespeare, Garber certainly has the credentials and experience to back up her extensive essays on the plays. If there is a problem with the book, it is only that she is perhaps too familiar with the plays and is unable to be truly critical of them.The book begins with a lengthy introduction which serves as a biography of Shakespeare and provides a bit of historical context for his body of work. Then we get a chapter on each of thirty-eight plays, including The Two Noble Kinsmen, which is not always included in Shakespeare collections. The plays are presented in rough chronological order and focus only secondarily on plot, with a greater emphasis on character and the use of language.Garber is a good writer, and each chapter is insightful. As this is written more as a collection of essays, there is not always perfect continuity between chapters and there is more than a little redundancy (which I suppose does make this easier to read this work in portions or out of order). As stated before, however, the principal flaw in her writing is that she refuses to say anything really critical about any of the plays. In Garber's view, Shakespeare batted 1.000, all hits and no misses. Henry VIII seems to be just as worthy of merit as Othello or Hamlet. Furthermore, there are no mistakes; any apparent contradictions or omissions are cleverly intended, not just an error.Certainly, Shakespeare is worth a lot of praise. When you consider what he did - writing over three dozen plays with an adeptness that is readily apparent - he is definitely deserving of the title \\"genius,\\" but he wasn't perfect. It would be nice if Garber acknowledged this, but her strengths clearly outweigh her weaknesses, and if you are interested in learning more about Shakespeare's plays, this is a worthwhile way to get that education."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"William Shakespeare's immortal words will live forever. In this excellent book of criticism Professor Garber of Harvardexamines each of the 38 plays from \\"The Two Gentlemen of Verona\\" through \\"The Two Noble Kinsman.\\" Her work is detailed and insightful for anyone who seeks more knowledge and understanding of Shakepeare and his plays. As we explore Shakespeare we also learn more about what it is to be human being in the world!Garber writes about each play as she analyzes the characters and their motivation; the history of the play's production and how the play is related to other plays and characters in the Shakespearean canon. Along the way we learn the derivation of words used by the bard; what was going on in England and the world at the time the play was written and such various topics as sumptuary laws (dealing with clothing); class structure and the growth of the English language.Shakespeare's life is covered in an insightful introduction.Marjorie Garber must be a brilliant person to listen to in the lecture hall! I wish these insighful looks at each play would be available in tape format! Her book is a classic which should be required reading for anyone teaching Shakespeare in high school, college and adult education classes.I was fascinated by her depth of scholarship and ability to relate Shakespeare to our day. My highest appreciation to this wonderful book on our great treasure of poetry and the art ofdrama William Shakespeare!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"Garber's essays can be a little unfocused, and she may abruptly change topic and theme from time to time, but this is the value of her work. She'll offer a queer or post-colonial critical comment, perform a close reading of the text to illustrate the how the rhetorical style is linked to the plot structure, and then perhaps add something of a historicist reading of a scene. Each essay can stand alone-- there is no thematic unity nor single critical viewpoint linking them (nor is there ceaseless repetition of a handful of opinions, as with Bloom). Not a bad choice for an introduction to a deeper understanding of Shakespeare's art, particularly if you wish to include critical insights from the past few decades, but not as thought provoking, or concise, as Goddard. With Garber, you'll feel like you have attended a diverting though lengthy lecture; with Goddard, you'll have read an argument with which you may agree or disagree, but not easily dismiss or forget."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"I have had this book for about a year, and I keep it right on my end table along with \\"The Complete Works of Shakespeare\\"- that's how often I refer to it. The book is simply phenomenal. The author, Marjorie Garber, provides intriguing analysis and insight into the Bard's works. For instance, she discusses how the play would have looked when presented to Elizabethan audiences, which we often forget about when reading the plays. As an example, I was disappointed in \\"Love's Labour Lost\\", the only play so far I have disliked. But the book pointed out that in this play Shakespeare used themes and jokes that an audience of the times would have understood and probably found hilarious.The book starts with a wonderfully written bio of the Bard and then discusses each work in a separate chapter. This is no mere recap of the material here but an in-depth look at the work from psychological, historical, and literary angles. What I like about it is that it makes you think, and to appreciate Shakespeare's works more. For instance, a deeper meaning and themes can be found in all of the plays and poems- the interpretation of them is endless, and has provided me with endless fodder of analytical fun.Highly recommended for the true lover of Shakespeare and of books that make you think."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"I have recently purchased this book, based on positive reviews I've read here and in other places. After reading the introduction, I am even more certain that this is a book worth having. But, the Kindle edition of this book does not containt a table of contents, making it very difficult to find the specific chapter you want to read. I just finished reading Kind Lear, and I tried locating the chapter about the play using the search function. I received 57 pages of results, and it was a laborious task finding the one which brought me to the opening of the chapter about the play."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"Marge Garber has thought long and hard about Shakespeare's work, but her book has a fatal flaw: it is too long, and (like Bloom's execrable, self-indulgent fantasy),it lacks linear drive and cogency. Each essay meanders through its play without a clear thesis or argument, skipping (often brilliantly) from topic to topic like a butterfly. Bloom begins his chapters with a hypothesis, then (self-admittedly) circles and circles it, finally announcing \\"see!I was right!\\" at the chapter's end - never haveing documented a fragment of evidence along the way; it's a con game. Garber's chapters are like a walk through a garden; the flowers are beautiful, but you never know where you're going, and it's easy to get lost in the maze.Compare these works to Frye's On Shakespeare, or Mack's Everybody's Shakespeare, or Empson's Essays, and you can see what a good writer pack into a small space."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"Garber's book is an excellent resource for anyone seeking an overall appreciation and understanding of the Shakespeare's plays. The chapters, one per play, are not laden with the usual scholarly apparatus and jargon, but are clearly written and offer intelligent interpretations and insights into the plays. The book's value lies in its usefulness for anyone interested in Shakespeare--the seasoned scholar or the newly interested reader. Recommended."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"This is a wonderful book which helps the reader understand the language of Mr. Shakespeare. I am an English major at a university in California and my Shakespeare professor highly recommended this book to help us understand exactly what is contained in the elements of each play. I used it to help me understand and to write coherently about the element of disguise in \\"Much Ado About Nothing\\" for my term paper. The author dissects each play, bringing the symbolism and meaning to a level easily understood by the lay person."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"What I have read so far of this book, gives me a \\"comfortable view\\" of the two plays I happen to be reading - \\"Loves Labours Lost\\" and \\"Troilus & Cressieda\\". Frankly, the only way to find out, enjoy, come to realise that WHS is indeed by far the best poet in the English language, on so many different scores, is to read the plays and sonnets - with such help as Marjorie Garber offers. Reading the plays beats even her commentaries."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"This is a \\"must have\\" for any student, scholar, or Shakespeare aficionado. Asimov is good to start with, but this is superb: if you work with Shakespeare, you will find that some part of each essay expresses opinions you already held (and how nice to be supported by such a scholar!) and the rest shows you aspects you never thought of.Hooray! (and for her most recent book, too)."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"Having read Garber's delightful and insightful \\"Shakespeare After All\\" after reading a little over half of Bloom's bloated and awful \\"Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human\\" (all I could stomach of that volume), I am pleased to no end that I found Garber's jewel of a book. She sets out to do - and accomplishes admirably - what I had (perhaps falsely) assumed was the task Bloom had set himself: to discuss and compare the plays in the canon, giving brief plot summaries, insights and analysis. For Bloom, the play \\"Hamlet\\" is all, and the character Falstaff is all. He very unevenly reviewed the plays, always commenting on each with too much about \\"Hamlet\\" and Falstaff. My favorite play (\\"A Midsummer Night's Dream,\\" I am not too shy to say) merited only a few inadequate pages in Bloom. Garber, instead, has created a marvelous work that advances the cause of twenty-first Shakespeare scholarship while delighting the casual or studious reader. Many thanks to Professor Garber for providing what will be for decades to come one of the most important works on the Bard of Avon and his life's work!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"This book is an excellent resource for Shakespeare students or readers looking to gain a deeper understanding of the motives and actions of the various characters as well as Shakespeare's agenda. Although every reader is free to come to a different conclusion on reading Shakespeare's plays, Garber clearly has studied each and every play deeply to illuminate those darker points of the play."},{"Title":"Shakespeare After All","review":"Shakespeare After All is an amazing book when you need to understand the backgrounds of Shakespeare's plays. I am taking a Shakespeare class; however, his writing confuses me a lot so I usually need to look up meanings and try to figure out the play that way, but after reading her interpretations of the plays that I had to read, it was much easier to understand where he was coming from and what certain lines meant.

I got my frayed copy from a garage sale and have replaced it through Amazon so it will last longer. Rev. Dawley is a prominent figure in the Anglican church and Chapters in Church History is the story of the formation of the church from the very beginning all the way through to the founding of the Anglican Church and its offshoots in America. This is like sitting down with a grandfather who is interesting to listen to. He is very comfortable with his subject and makes writing history and making it interesting look easy.He covers a lot of topics I have never seen handled before - the schisms in the early church over the Gnostic beliefs, the schism over apostates, the various councils and how the Creeds got started (like the Nicene Creed),the move of the Catholic church to Avignon, the drowning of the Anabaptists, and the beginnings of other protestant religions like the Wesley's involvement with the Moravians and how his followers came to be called Methodists. He also goes into depth to explain how the Anglican church derives it authority and how that was communicated to the Americas in the Episcopal tradition. It was the first time I understood the concept of the eucharist.Very interesting, very informative, very good buy."},{"Title":"Chapters in church history (The Church's teaching)","review":"\\"Chapters in Church History\\" by Powel Mills Dawley is part of a series called \\"The Church's Teaching.\\" It's an excellent little historical introduction to Anglicanism that's aimed at the educated layperson, and not at the clergy or scholars. Dawley's main concern is to tell the story of Anglicanism against the broad sweep of Christian history, and the book is a very readable history of Anglicanism filled with excellent insights. In fact, it's a testimony to Dawley's skills that he was able to present as much information as he has in such a relatively small space. He has a knack for making church history simple and readable.The structure of the book is a little odd, but understandable. The first two chapters give a general history of the Church until the time of the Reformation, while Chapter 3 discusses Christianity in England in particular. Chapter 4 then covers the crisis of the Reformation, and the book concludes with Chapter 5, concerning Christianity in the modern world. While I understand that Dawley is trying to put Anglicanism into its historical context, I would have preferred that he discuss Anglican history in more detail and offer less information about the development of Christianity in general. Context is certainly necessary to understand Anglicanism, but in a relatively short book dedicated to Anglican history, more time on Anglican history would have been better.Having said this, Dawley manages to say a lot in a short space. While most of the information in \\"Chapters in Church History\\" is well-known to me as a student of Anglicanism, Dawley's book is a good starting point for someone who wants an easy historical introduction to Anglicanism. Even though Dawley is aiming at the layman, I was glad to find that some of his insights put things in a new light, even for someone already familiar with Anglicanism.While the book has limitations due to the nature of its intended audience, its size, and its date (it was published in 1950), \\"Chapters in Church History\\" makes for an enjoyable introduction to Anglican history. More advanced students have many equally excellent works available should they wish to delve deeper into Anglicanism."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"This book is an excelent reference for anyone who works on, has an interest in or has studied the design and modeling of aircrafts. Its explainations are very clear and understandable"},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"This is a great book but it approaches the subject very mathematically! So be ready to see lots of derivations and proofs of many concepts presented in the various chapters."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"The chief virtue is its clarity. I've worked directly in this field since 1986, and wish I'd picked up the 1st edition in 1992 rather than finding the 2nd edition in 2006. Most of the material I've picked up through coursework and on-the-job training, but this book presents a thorough, practical and understandable development of each aspect of aircraft control and simulation. In addition, the 1st chapter provides the basis for incorporating oblate, rotating Earth equations into gravitational and kinematics modeling, which is the reason I bought the book.Roughly, the book covers:* Kinematics and Dynamics* Quaternions* Properties of Aircraft* Simulation, Trim, Linearization* Linear Analysis-- State Space Models-- Transfer Functions-- Frequency Response* Handling Qualities* Stability Augmentation* Autopilots* Linear Quadratic Regulator* Model Following Design* Multivariable Frequency Domain Analysis* Observers and the Kalman Filter* Discrete (Digital) ControlNOTE: The 1st chapter of the 2nd Edition is substantially enhanced vs. the 1st chapter of the 1st Edition. Several practical needs are now covered in better detail. Quaternion math is added. An algorithm for converting from Earth-centered Inertial coordinates to Geodetic Latitude and Altitude for an oblate Earth model is now provided. If a flat Earth model is ok to use, the 1st Edition is a very good aircraft controls book. If a rotating oblate Earth model is also required, only the 2nd Edition will do."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"This book, in my opinion, is a must have book for any aircraft controls engineer. Very practical so you don't get lost in the theory, and it uses an F16 linear model throughout the book (for example problems) so the numbers mean something as opposed to other books that just have random numbers in the examples. It's also easy to read and it gives matlab and fortran code for most example problems. I recommend the 2nd edition because more informations was added and nothing taken away from the 1st edition."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"This book covers classical and modern aircraft control techniques in a easy way to understand, including continuous-model discretization."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"I'm a flight controls engineer and this book is all I need to do my job. I had been looking for something that dealt with the subject from a modern controls perspective, but most other books either only deal with classical controls, or were written using strange (European) notation and conventions. The authors start out with the equations of motion, assuming only that this is a rigid body. Most other books just go straight to the linearized decoupled equations and make a lot of hand waving when it comes to including wind or time varying derivatives. Next they cover design of all standard control loops from a SISO approach and finally delve into modern design techniques. To find this much material, you'd normally need to consult several books, and then you probably wouldn't have any MIMO examples that apply to a real airplane. The book does present code examples, but consider these only references. If you're interested in doing this for a living, you'll have to learn how to code in Matlab and possibly C/C++ (take it from me, I actually do this for a living). Consider this a modern version of either Blakelock or Roskam. Unlike those other guys, this book does have solved examples."},{"Title":"Aircraft Control and Simulation","review":"This book is quite good, but it is not perfect. There is 1 minor error and a very minor issue in the F-16 simulation with which I disagree. One thing it probably should emphasize more are servo rate limitations. Also, performance limitations of feedback loops are not discussed.**************************************************************************1st Error:On pages 526-527, the author cites an erroneous result from a publication by John Doyle and Gunter Stein in 1981.Counter example:Using the notation in this section. G(s) = 1/s, M(s) = 5, K = 1.The sensitivity of (1+(1+5)*1/s*1)^-1 is stable. however, the condtion of max_sigma[ GK*(1+GK)^-1 ] &lt; 1/|M(s)|, is violated at low frequency since 1 is not less than 0.2The singular value conditions in the book are a sufficient but not necessary for closed loop stability. One can fix this error by simply changing the \\"iff\\" statements to \\"if\\" statements on p. 527.****************************************************************************************************************************************************2nd Opinion:This is a very subtle problem and I have personally made the error of summing forces and moments at the wrong place or miscalculating angle of attack or sideslip in my research efforts. There are probably many other simulation codes that make this mistake. Arguably, this is more of an opinion than a legitimate error because the aerodynamic data can be taken from tests where the static angle of attack and sideslip are measured.There should not be a substantial difference in simulation or linearized results when making these proposed changes.The \\"problem\\" is in the computer code of the F-16 model on p. 184. The problem arises when XCG is not 0.35, otherwise the code is accurate. Basically, the \\"problem\\" occurs on the 14th line of uncommented code that reads:VT = X(1); ALPHA = X(2)*RTOD; BETA = X(3)*RTODThe issue is that the aerodynamic look-up tables could be using the wrong ALPHA and BETA when XCG is not 0.35.The ALPHA and BETA values come from the euler 6-DOF equations of motion which may not be located at 0.35c. However, the aerodynamic tables need an ALPHA and BETA that does occur at 0.35c. Therefore, one needs to translate the 6-DOF velocities, which may not be at 0.35c, to ALPHA and BETA values which do occur at 0.35c.The reason this is not a legitimate error and more of an opinion is that the aerodynamic data is probably purely static. The aerodynamic data corresponds to cases where p = q = r = 0 and the AOA and sideslip angle should be uniform across the entire body. If one wanted to adopt this point of view, then no changes should be made to the code.If one wanted to change things, we can assume that there are arctangent and arcsine subroutines, ATAN() and ASIN(), respectively. The code can be modified as follows (although it is a matter of opinion):VT = X(1); CBTA = COS(X(3)); U = VT*COS(X(3))*CBTAV = VT*SIN(X(3)); W = VT*SIN(X(2))*CBTAP = X(7); Q = X(8); R = X(9)ALPHA = ATAN((W-Q*(XCG-XCGR))/U)*RTODVTEMP = SQRT(U**2+(W-Q*(XCG-XCGR))**2+(V+R*(XCG-XCGR))**2)BETA = ASIN((V+R*(XCG-XCGR)/VTEMP)*RTOD**************************************************************************Aside from these issues, this is a pretty good book and I have used it a lot. For those on a budget, this is fairly good compilation of flight dynamics and control.It is probably too ambitious to completely cover every aspect of aircraft dynamics and control with one book.

Politically incorrect, but always dependable. He doesn't appear in every 87th Precinct episode, but when he does, it's special. Fat Ollie is one of McBain's more interesting characters; on the surface he is an alarmingly horrible bigot, but he's also a pretty darned good police officer, shows that he cares deeply for people (at least the ones he chooses to show an interest in, or those that reciprocate and don't automatically spurn him due to his brusque nature), and is capable of sincere compassion. Once in a while. He's also a budding author, thus this \\"book\\" that he is writing. Fat Ollie, along Carella, Kling, and the rest of the 87th Precinct crew, combine to deliver another funny, charming, riveting, and thought provoking read. As usual, never a dull moment.

Without Ollie's book (which may, just may be better than McBain's/Hunter's) taking up enough slack with all of the repeats of previous book stories, this could have been a short story. There is also all of the griping that McBain does about other mystery/police procedural writers, book sellers, agents, etc, that make the subject of the book to be nothing but an add-on. The shooting of the councilman and the involvement of the \\"junkie cross-dresser\\", seems so unnecessary that you wonder why Carella and Kling are involved in the book at all.That Steve Carella keeps talking to himself about being forty, seems more like Hunter complaining that he's seventy. Considering that in the first 87th Precinct novel, Carella was a Korean Vet and Meyer was a WW2 vet, now almost fifty years later, Carella has only aged maybe fifteen years. This is strange-r because he didn't marry his wife for ten years and his kids are only twelve years old, though they were born in the late sixties. Though while everything else has been modernized, we have computers and cell phones the cops haven't aged at all. It's hard to imaging after all this time that Carella is still a Detective Second Class and Kling a third class. With all the times they've been shot and the number of big cases they've solved, you'd think they'd been promoted.The murder story just doesn't hold ones attention, in fact it wouldn't make a good 'Law & Order' episode. It's been obvious for a while that McBain is bored with the 87th Precinct, but money talks. What is the need for Hunter to used all these terrible jokes, just because he can dump them on Fat Ollie and Parker and we're supposed to expect these guys to be getting away with this bigotry and sexism in the 21st Century? Ed, you should have finished these guys off or at least sent them into retirement, but then they have only served like what, fifteen years? To bad, it used to be a good series and McBain had more respect for his fellow writers. He acts like he invented the idea of police procedurals. Guess he never had time to read Chandler or Simenon.Zeb Kantrowitz"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I listened to this on a tape while I was walking. The word \\"SAID\\" must have been said about 500 times throughout the story.........very irritating!!!"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I have always considered Joseph Wambaugh and Ed McBain the deans of the police procedural because their novels are very well written and often a cut above other writers who seem to only care for plot details. Fat Ollie's Book maintains McBain's rep as a fine writer and, perhaps the best part, his capacity to create characters whose antics make me laugh out loud.In this novel, Fat Ollie Weeks is a buffoonish, bigoted antihero who is also a police detective in McBain's famous 87th precinct. Clearly the city is New York, although McBain thinly disguises it as a fictional metropolis with neighborhoods, rivers, problems and politics that will be familiar to anyone who knows anything about the real Gotham. Ollie writes a crime novel that is inadvertently stolen from his car and this is the device that propels much of the action. And there are also generous portions of murder and mayhem, lies and disguises.Ollie's remarks and secret thoughts are generally hilarious; his eating habits are revolting, but his detective work, as befits a hero-like figure, is pretty good. He is a repulsive character, yet on the other hand rather likable in a perverse sort of way. Several of the other characters are equally memorable, particularly the cross-dressing Emilio/Emmy, who mistakes Ollie's novel for a genuine criminal case and causes much ado over it.This novel provides solid entertainment, along with a couple of tidbits that provoke further thoughts about the way we live now. If you enjoy detective stories and good writing, you will like Fat Ollie's Book."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I've read most of the mysteries in the 87th Precinct series and haven't found a klinker in the lot. I envy readers who've not yet discovered them, because they have a treat ahead. That said, this is perhaps the best of the lot. Alas, there will be no more. Evan Hunter, aka Ed McBain, is no longer amongst us.There are two major plots working here. First, there is the murder of a city councilman and wannabe mayor; it's in there so we can have the second plot, Ollie's stolen novel, the story it contains with Ollie's pursuit of the perp who stole it. Both plots weave nicely together. The atmosphere is police procedural in a big city. Only Michael Connelly is McBain's equal in this sub-genre. The characters, especially the obnoxious, egotistical, pitiful, elephantine Ollie, are excellent. No one wrote dialogue better than McBain/Hunter--with the possible exception of Lawrence Block.It was a pleasure to read this book. My only fault with it is that it ended before I wanted to let it go."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"If the classic British mystery seemed to take place entirely in the drawing room of a stately country manor and the classic American one involved a hard-boiled private eye working entirely on his own, the formula he crafted took an entire squad of detectives and set them down on the streets of a tough city -- the fictional Isola standing in for his own New York. His books seemed more realistic because the cops were more recognizably like us, with girlfriends, wives, and families and problems with bureaucratic politics. His large cast of regulars allowed him to develop multiple storylines and to shift his focus around the station house. To the extent that there was a central figure it would have to be Steve Carella, earnest, morally centered, with a deaf wife, Teddy.Carella is on the case here, partnered with Bert Kling, who's been the naive junior member of the team for half a century now. But pride of place is given to Detective Oliver Wendell Weeks, the \\"Fat Ollie\\" of the title. Part of the delight of the books is that over time they've become completely anachronistic. Mr. McBain kept writing his characters as he'd invented them, but let the background events reflect the present day. So 9-11 and the war in Afghanistan are frequent touchpoints in the story but Fat Ollie is like Archie Bunker before Norman Lear got ahold of him. The idea that a cop could get away in the year 2002 with being as vociferously racist, sexist, and homophobic as Weeks has remained is obviously ludicrous. However, it's quite amusing to watch him cut a swathe through politically correct times.The mystery involves the shooting death of a city councilmen who was about to declare for mayor and the theft of the novel that Fat Ollie had just finished. The murder is pretty stock stuff, but the police author plot gives Mr. McBain an opportunity to riff on the very genre he invented and wield a rather poison pen. At one point Ollie meets yet another cop who's written a novel of his own:That's what we need, all right, Ollie thought. Another novel about police work. There used to be no novels about police work at all. Then, all of a sudden -- God knows who or what the influence might have been -- every sh[odd]y town in America had a fictitious character working out of a detective squadroom. To look at all these police novels out there, you'd think every hamlet in America was overrun with crime. Dumb little village has a population of six hundred people, according to these novels there are murders being committed there every hour on the hour.Even as it drips with a fair amount of bitterness -- Mr. McBain even wanted to sue the creators of Hill Street Blues for pilfering his ideas -- that's awfully funny stuff. Doing things like dropping in such metafictional discourse earned the later books a reputation for greater ambition, but the older, more straightforward entries are even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Now a whole book featuring McBain's least likeable character, Ollie Weeks.

I enjoyed the different twist in this book. Fat Ollie is the typical Columbo type cop. Ollie is portraded as a fat, bigot aspiring writer. The book is about the murder of a councilman. It seems more or less important to Ollie to find who stole his book. There are different story lines that are quite easy to follow. It was quite fun to read and guess what OLlie would do next as well as reading along Ollies' book.

The Precinct fans who only met Ollie as a loudmouthed, grossly fat smelly bigot from the 88th, will be surprised to meet Ollie as a bona fide writer of fiction. As usual, McBain spins the yarn in an entertaining, folksy style, tying together action and comment in a fast paced, amusing fashion. Some unusual things happen in this saga, such as Ollie's romance with rookie cop,wherein we find out that Ollie, like many &quot;big&quot; men, is a good dancer, light on his feet, a TV &quot;talent&quot; has a crush on Carella, and Kling encounters Eileen Burke on the 87th's turf.All in all, it is a typical McBain--fast paced, entertaining, humorous, with an occassional insight into human nature.If anyone wants escape literature, there's no better."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Ed McBain serves up a couple of plot lines in \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\"---#52 in the 87th Precinct series.Ollie's completed novel is stolen from his vehicle while he catches the call on a murdered political activist.The outrageously outspoken Ollie tries to track down the book while joining up with all the regulars and irregulars from the 87th to solve the murder.The book thief thinks the manuscript is actually a police report that will lead him to a fortune. He provides the comedy of errors.It is a good big city police procedural. As expected, the crew from the 87th is in top form and the dialogue is crisp and provocative.Always entertaining, consistent activity and lots of the equal opportunity bigot Ollie Weeks---perhaps a bit too much humor and not enough drama---but still fun."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"This book is for all Ed McBain and police procedural fans, but if you have not read MONEY MONEY MONEY you should read that first because this is a direct sequel. Detective (Fat Ollie) Weeks is the first detective on the scene to investigate the murder of councilman Lester Henderson, who was considering a run for mayor. The murder actually occurs in the 88th precinct where Ollie is stationed, but this becomes the next book in the 87th precinct series because Henderson lived in the 87th and (despite the reluctance of their lieutenant) Ollie decides to enlist the help of detectives Steve Carella and Bert Kling, with whom he worked in the MONEY MONEY MONEY case. The murder is solved in a straightforward way (with the unintentional help of the murderer), but that is background to the main story and almost incidental.This is not FAT OLLIE'S BOOK just because he was lead detective on the case, but also because he had just finished his manuscript for the dectective story which he had decided to write during his and Carella's previous case. As he was investigating the Henderson murder, his briefcase with his only copy of REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER (written using the pen name Olivia Wesley Watts) was stolen from his car. Thus, Ollie is simultaneosly trying to retrieve his manuscript and apprehend the murderer. We revisit not only Carella, Kling and Ollie, but several other characters from previous books, including the Reverend Gabriel Foster, and detective Eileen Burke, a previous love interest of Kling who gets assigned to the 87th in a move that threatens to complicate his relationship with Deputy Chief Surgeon Sharyn Cook. And we meet Officer Patricia Gomez, to whom Oliie becomes attracted in the process of Gomez helping Ollie solve the case. We gradualy get to read Ollie's manuscript interpersed with the Henderson case through a clever device which McBain adopts which introduces another complication and very funny thread to the book.Ollie remains his bigoted self, and this element plays an integral role in the story. It is carried to such extremes that it is at times hilarious, but not, of course, for the targets of his bigotry. And it does remind us of how such attitudes lurk just below the surface in many organizations. Before reading very far into the book I decided that it was to be read in a lighthearted way, sort of a parody of mystery writers, detective stories, bigots, racial agitators, drug addicts, and homosexuals. From this viewpoint, it was a fun, very fast read, while further developing the characters with which I was already familiar as an avid McBain reader. While I loved the cleverness of the idea of parallel cases for Ollie as the basis of this book, a few unanswered questions (which would reveal too much of the plot) and the (perhaps intentional) superficiality of the story kept me from giving it a five star rating."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"You can't go wrong with any 87th Precinct tale but this was has the added attraction of having Fat Ollie from the 88th as a main character. He is a shulb but despite his non-PC take on life the author allows him to still be a good detective. The book uses the ploy of Fat Ollie's stolen manuscript as a subtext. The long quotes from Ollie's book are good as over the top examples of bad writing and are actually blended into the book's plot. The book is a quick and fun read. It is a nice change of pace for the usual 87th crew. The book is written in the time when 9/11 was still hanging over the country. It is poignant to go back to that time of shared feelings."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"This book is excellent. What makes Ed McBain special is that he can make a hero out of Fat Ollie Weeks, an overweight policeman who is a bigot. In this book Fat Ollie's own manuscript is stolen. There are excellent comments on writing and on how the author (Fat Ollie or McBain) found his &quot;voice.&quot; The book pokes fun of other McBain novels, of Fat Ollie and of bad writing. Ultimately, Ed McBain does not take himself, or Fat Ollie, very seriously, which makes for a great story. Some of the reviewers have misunderstood the cleverness of this book, and that's too bad."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I'd figured it would be impossible to take a character like Ollie- who has been an utterly unlikable irritant in every previous appeaerence- make him the lead character, and still like the book.

And he has written a book. A whole 36 pages long, this pride and joy is in a briefcase in the back of his car on its way to the copy shop (he's still living back in the days of typerwriters without carbon paper) when he gets a call. Someone has seen fit to murder a popular politician running for mayor. While Ollie is inspecting the scene of the crime and quizzing witnesses, someone smashes his car's back window (right in front of a bunch of uniforms, what would you know?) and makes off with the briefcase.And that, my friends, is only the beginning. While Ollie is out tracking down both a murderer and a thief (and treating readers to a running stream of horrificly unPC comments along the way), the crossdressing hooker who filched the manuscript (which is titled REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER, by the way) takes the little tale at face value ... and starts searching for the captured policewoman therein.FAT OLLIE'S BOOK is full of double meanings on several levels, and Ed McBain (Evan Hunter) gets in hilarious but subtle pokes at nearly everybody -- himself, bestselling authors, literary agents, writers, both sexes, cops and villains, and last but not least, even us humble layperson book reviewers. We all know the fictional city described here, Isola, is supposed to be New York City, and we all know the fictional city described in Ollie's book is supposed to be Isola, and it just gets funnier. McBain has a way with both words and humor that is truly mind boggling.Still ... masterful as this 52nd book in the series is, it's not really a mystery. It reminded me of a cross between Lawrence Block's humorous crime capers and Patricia Cornwell's forage into new territory in HORNET'S NEST and company. Rather than being surprised by twists and turns, the reader is instead denied any suspense by getting to follow all the threads as they grow closer and closer and finally converge. Also, while the no-holds-barred humor starts out funny enough, too much of it turns the story tedious. Halfway through this book I was all set to give it five stars, but by the time I reached the ending my enthusiasm had waned.FAT OLLIE'S BOOK is a great tongue-in-cheek parody and full of laughs, but to me it read like a chocolate dessert -- delightfully sweet in small quantities, but heavy when taken as a whole."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I couldn't finish the book..it was that bad.

I really like the continuity of the 87th and the books are very entertaining. It's hard to believe there are about 50 of them, I'll have to find #1 and see how how the late 1950s were portrayed.

The 87th precinct cops play key roles and the introduction of Officer Gomez actually takes Ollie a few steps away from his normal range of bigotry, but not totally. In the fifty-second 87th precinct novel (think alphabet two times), Mr. McBain shows his wit with one of the series best novels ever and surely will be recognized as one of the year's finest sub-genre entries.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"When Oliver Wendell Weeks is called to the murder scene of mayoral candidate Lester Henderson, he was on top of the world. He had just finished writing his first book and had it safely stored on the back seat of his car. After attending the crime scene, he returns to his car to find that the unthinkable has happened, his car has been broken into and his manuscript has been stolen.I think at this point a bit of an introduction may be in order here. Ed McBain's 87th Precinct series, set in the fictional city of Isola, is now over 50 books strong with the detectives from the precinct that bears the series title all making regular appearances. Ollie Weeks, on the other hand, is only a fairly recent addition to the series and works out of the neighbouring 88th Precinct. Ollie is an ignorant bigot (is there any other kind?) who complements this with a complete lack of sympathy when dealing with victims families. He prefers the rude abrasive approach when requesting help from colleagues, usually softening them up with an insulting joke and then becoming astounded when they don't appreciate his humour. In short, Ollie Weeks is a thoroughly dislikeable guy.But back in MONEY, MONEY, MONEY (the previous 87th Precinct book) Weeks saved Steve Carella's life not once, but twice and now he's cashing in on the favours he believes Carella owes him. If you had to pick a leading character out of the ensemble cast that makes up the 87th Precinct, Detective Steve Carella would be that man.Ollie's proposed favour is for the detectives from the 87th Precinct to help him work the Lester Henderson murder case. It seems that although Lester was murdered inside the 88th Precinct boundaries, his house lies within the 87th Precinct, so Ollie would like Carella to interview Lester's widow. In return Ollie magnanimously offers to share the credit for the bust. The real reason for Ollie's appeal for help can be put down to the fact that his attention has been captured by his desire to find the person who stole his manuscript. After all, he's convinced it's bestseller material and why not when the story is based on his own experiences as a cop.And this brings us directly to the storyline that runs in parallel to the murder investigation involving the junkie who is now in possession of Ollie's book. Oh yes, not only do we know who stole the treasured manuscript but we also get to read it, while the thief thinks he has stumbled upon inside police information that will lead him to a fortune. The plight of the missing manuscript and its drug dependent new owner is cleverly worked into yet another case being pursued by the police, making its recovery oh so tantalisingly close.One of the constants of the 87th Precinct series is the sharp and snappy dialogue that prevails. Whether it's in the form of questions and answers rattled off during interviews or as a rapid fire exchange between two cops, the style is distinctive Ed McBain. I've always enjoyed this aspect of his books because you get the real impression that pressure is being put on the suspects and the pace of the investigation is instantly accelerating while clues and information are rapidly collected. The result is a fast-paced police investigation and that's exactly what we get in FAT OLLIE'S BOOK.One area in which the 87th Precinct stories have changed over the years and I thought it was particularly noticeable in this book was in the area of character development. McBain has never gone in much for giving his detectives terribly much personality, preferring to concentrate on police procedure and the case under investigation to carry the story. These days we are actually learning about the lives of the detectives outside of the precinct environs, giving them even greater appeal. Now, I admit, in the case of Oliver Wendell Weeks, the more you learn about him, the less you like him, but then that seems to be the appeal that McBain is trying to equip him with. Apart from learning all about Ollie's skewed philosophies of life, the two featured detectives, Steve Carella and Bert Kling were actually depicted at home with their families. We are now getting the impression that they're real men.Fans of the police procedural to end all police procedurals can rest assured that the fast-paced investigative style is still alive and well in the mean streets of Isola. I would caution anyone planning to read this book that it would be best to have read MONEY, MONEY, MONEY first, this book second and then THE FRUMIOUS BANDERSNATCH third because these 3 books read like a mini-series within the larger series."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"For those of you not familiar with the literary terms, flat character and round character, here's a brief definition. Flat characters have clearly defined (almost rigid) characteristics and don't change or develop in a story. Most Dickens' characters, though delightful, are flat, in contrast to Huck Finn or Harry Bosch in M. Connelly's novels, both of which are round and have tension, ability to change, often ironic touches etc. Mcbain's characters are always, and tiresomely so, flat. Carrella and Ollie are good examples: Carrella good, p.c., loves his wife passionately (idolizes her and her deafness, not a nice touch but too friggin' p.c. for me) and cares for people. Ollie is a stereotype villain in McBain's universe: bigot, gross, and totally un-politically correct, actually the one of the only interesting characers in McBain's galaxy. Fat Ollie's Book is humorous and flat characters can be fun: the transvestite reaches beyond McBain's usual inflexible character--some minor characters have some roundness: pawnbroker for example. Black doctor and white cop is rather sweet, but again so cloyingly flat and predictable. Do they ever disagree on anything? Black and white lovers is oh so passe. Average plot and sometimes spot-on satire of myster writers characterize this overrated and rather silly book. But McBain gives his readers what they want--could he add a little Rendell and Bill James to his novels--not likely, when he can grind out these stale hamburger novels while watching reruns of Colombo. Come on Mr. Mcbain reach, take a risk. Your Hope novels show promise, but you still can't go for a little more than a modicum of rust and edginess. Entertaining, bus book, nothing else."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Summer is when I get caught up on mystery/detective/crime novels on my list.. I have the time and the inclination then. Ed McBain usually has one novel on that list every summer. This one isn't bad--it just doesn't end up doing very much. It may strike McBain as interesting to base a whole novel around the weeknesses and prejudices of Fat Ollie Weeks. But seeing the world through his eyes is not a very pleasant journey. Even as a minor character he had little to offer except for his consumption of food and his prejudicial thoughts. In this novel he has a bag with his own police novel in progress stolen This comes very early in the novel--thus the title--and I, for one, didn't care about his novel and had little or no sympathy for his loss. There is a murder at the center of the book--but it's resolution is bland and dull. The novel does allow the reader to keep up with his/her \\" friends\\" at the 87th. But, all in all, I could have spent my time better--maybe a second Bartholomew Gill would have been better after all."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I have read all of Ed McBain's 87th Precinct books and have loved them. However, I found this one moved slow. I've almost finished and can't quite get through the last couple of chapters."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"This is not the book to start with in reading the 87th Precinct series (the pedant in me would say &#65533;start at the beginning,&#65533; but I personally feel the series hit its stride in the 1980s, when McBain was taking more time between books to plot, develop characters, and build suspense). But it does call attention to what have been two of the series&#65533; strengths almost from the beginning: variety and humor.Previously McBain has dared to narrate one novel in the series entirely from an unapprehended perp&#65533;s perspective, build another as a commentary on Richard Nixon and Watergate as reflected through a smart but grievously flawed gang leader, and frame yet another as a ghost story. Here he infuses almost the entire novel with that other series characteristic, humor. Now, there is a history of two kinds of humor in the 87th Precinct: mordant gallows humor, and self-referential, occasionally smug humor (fellow 87th Precinct aficionados will remember all those gibes at Hill Street Blues for ripping McBain off a bit too egregiously). For better or worse (mostly better), Fat Ollie&#65533;s Book usually utilizes the self-referential approach.Fat Ollie Weeks himself is an odd duck, sharing all of Andy Parker&#65533;s foul-mouthed foul-minded bigotry and sexism, but displaying, unlike Parker, signs that he can actually be a good, dedicated detective when he wants to be. But from his introduction, Ollie has also been an object of fun: the bigot as Popeye&#65533;s Wimpy, overweight, always looking to cadge another hamburger, ah yes (and come to think of it, Wimpy also always sounded a big like W.C. Fields, whom Weeks tries to imitate to the growing consternation of generations with no taste for or experience of film comedy before, say, the Pink Panther).The joke here is that Fat Ollie has written a detective novel based less on his own experiences than on a form letter with the 7 rules for writing bestselling thriller fiction and on his reading of book reviews on, well, Amazon.com! The set-up, which interweaves Ollie&#65533;s awful prose with McBain&#65533;s consummately professional approach, allows the real author to score humorous points against other genre writers and to underscore what makes his novels work as well as they do.For me at least, what kept this self-consciousness from lapsing into narcissism was the humor in Fat Ollie&#65533;s renaming of the topography in and around &#65533;Isola,&#65533; McBain&#65533;s version of Manhattan, with new names of his own. This completely unnecessary renaming not only befuddles the poor drug-addled transvestite who has stolen the manuscript and thinks that it is describing real events from which he can profit. It also represents a seeming acknowledgement from McBain that the fake names laid over what is otherwise a realistically portrayed New York City have long since become a dispensable detraction for the reader and an extraneous obstacle for the author, as in the circumlocutious trips &#65533;upstate to the state capital&#65533; and the odd references here to the World Trade Center bombing in some unnamed city.There are signs of uncharacteristic haste and sloppiness in some parts of the book (is it just me, for instance, or does McBain offhandedly interject the last names of two 87th Precinct detectives into a conversation on p. 227 without having previously introduced them this time around). But much can be forgiven the author for indulging himself, and his readers, in an experiment in humor and a lesson in the craft of detective fiction.There. Now, to figure out how to keep Fat Ollie Weeks from reading this and taking it as encouragement to write another novel&#65533;.."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"There's nothing likeable about Fat Ollie Weeks. Hilarious, yes, but not likeable. His eye and ear for the world around him produce well-crafted observations from those of your everyday equal opportunity bigot to his very special contempt for female crime writers and Amazon reviewers. From police work to eating to casual conversation, Fat Ollie doesn't have a clue what a misfit he is.Ollie has written a 36-page novel, complete with repetitious dialogue and grammatical redundancies. The book's hero, actually heroine, is Olivia Wesley Watts a svelte, attractive redheaded detective who becomes trapped in a basement while on the trail of a gang trafficking in conflict diamonds. Ollie pursues Emilio (Emmy) Herrera, an addicted transvestite prostitute who stole his prized manuscript. At the same time Emmy is looking for Olivia, convinced she is real and the key to the biggest payday of his miserable life.As multiple investigations unfold and McBain's fiction intersects with Ollie's, McBain decides to show us Fat Ollie's sensitive side. Even though he prefers blondes and can't understand his attraction to a Puerto Rican, Ollie asks the sexy young Officer Patricia Gomez to go dancing. Officer Gomez thinks Ollie eats to compensate for other pain in his life. Incredibly, she seems to enjoy his company. Fear not, Ollie has not lost his lecherous weakness for blondes, which will come back to bite him in a predictable but funny scene in a bar that Emmy is known to frequent.All in all, \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is a very funny story - good, not great. It gets an extra star from me because of Ron McLarty, narrator of the audiobook. When McLarty is Fat Ollie, he sounds just as crass as you imagine the character to be. When he's Detective Oliver Wendell Weeks reading his debut novel, McLarty projects the author's misplaced confidence in his nonsensical work in a perfect grade school monotone."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"That about sums it up. Utterly brilliant. I smiled through the entire book. Hurray for Fat Ollie!"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"In MONEY, MONEY, MONEY we first learn that Fat Ollie Weeks is writing a book. In this one, he's completed the tome and is on his way to the copier, when he is called to the scene of a murder. A councilman has been murdered in the 88th Precinct and the case belongs to Ollie since he was the first detective on the scene. While he's conducting interviews, the valise in which he's placed his masterpiece is stolen from his car. When Ollie finds out his manuscript is missing, he passes the case off to Steve Carella, whose life he'd saved, twice, in MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.The fun part of this work for me was how McBain describes Ollie's process of writing. We get a short lecture about \\"voice.\\"Ollie reads the best-sellers and arrives at the conclusion that most readers are women and that it might be a good idea for him to assume a female nom de plume. His book is entitled REPORT TO THE COMMISSIONER, and he's become Olivia Wesley Watts.Every once in a while McBain gives us a glimpse of Ollie's novel, which has been stolen by a transvestite prostitute, who believes the report is real and that there really is a fortune in diamonds to be had if he can only find the basement where Livvy is being held captive. As in most 87th Precinct novels, there's also a subplot involving Bert Kling's former lover, Detective Second Grade Eileen Burke, who with Andy Parker, is investigating a potential drug transaction during which $300,000 is supposed to change hands.Maybe I'm just getting old, but I had a hard time keeping all of these plot threads straight. When Eileen and Andy appear after side trips to visit Carella and his councilman murder case and Ollie's attempt to track down his book, I had forgotten what their case was about. The councilman's murder is as predictable as dust in a bachelor pad. The drug bust seems like an after thought. The one thing that saved it for me was when Ollie gets a girlfriend. Her name is Patricia Gomez and she's a rookie patrolwoman who helps to crack the councilman's murder. She doesn't see an obese bigot when she talks to Ollie. She wonders at the pain that's causing him to overeat. They make a date to go dancing; Ollie, being Ollie, tries to throw a wrench into the works by besmirching her Puerto Rican ancestry. She sees right through him; she's bought a new dress and they're going dancing."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Ed McBain likes the titles of his 87th Precinct series to bear more than one meaning, and \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is no exception. Fat Ollie Weeks, detective of the neighboring 88th Precinct, stands at the center of this novel, having caught the call on the murder of an aspiring politician. Fat Ollie, not an incompetent detective but quite willing to let others carry the load if circumstances warrant, shifts the burden of the investigation to Steve Carella and Bert Kling while he pursues a case far more important to himself - the theft of the sole existing copy of the manuscript of, well, Fat Ollie's book, a detective thriller written by him to cash in on the lucrative fiction market dominated by a bunch of women amateurs who wholly lack his real world expertise and insights. The book took him months to write, too, at least three or four months, all thirty-six pages of it, and he wants it back, no matter the effort required or whose toes must be stomped on.Fat Ollie, it should be said, is a racist, but that is an inadequate description. He is also an ethnic, religious, and sexist bigot. He despises, in short, everyone not exactly like himself. Come to think of it, he also despises anybody who IS like himself. Oblivious to the insults he showers upon others and sensitive to slights from others, he nonetheless is not absolutely without a touch of oafish charm, just enough to intrigue a Puerto Rican uniformed female cop caught up in the murder case and just enough to keep the reader interested in such an otherwise unsympathetic protagonist.As usual in the 87th Precinct novels, the plot twists around itself, sweeping up a collection of odd characters marching unknowingly to inevitable interaction and intermeshed fates. Along the way, we get to read - in short doses - Ollie's truly dreadful attempt at literary creation, so bad as to become bizarre fun. And we follow the developing stories of McBain's familiar stable of detectives from the more than fifty novels that have preceded this one. No 87th Precinct fan should miss this one, another top-notch entry in this series filled with dark humor."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"In his fifty-second 87th Precinct novel, Ed McBain features the loathsome and obese sexist bigot, Fat Ollie, who has finally finished his own police procedural, \\"Report to the Commissioner.\\" Oliver Weeks sees himself as a literary lion in the making. The protagonist of his rather brief novel is Ollie's female and slim alter ego, whom he names Olivia Wesley Watts. Unfortunately, Fat Ollie never got around to making a copy of his manuscript, which he composed on an old fashioned typewriter. When Ollie leaves the novel in a dispatch case in his car, a junkie steals the case and its precious contents.\\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" has many of McBain's trademark touches. It is politically incorrect and filled with flippant dialogue. The author seamlessly threads three main plot lines throughout the book and they cleverly overlap at times. A prominent councilman who may be planning to run for mayor is shot while preparing for a rally. A pair of cops is hoping to interrupt a big drug sale. And, of course, Ollie is determined to find the perp who ripped off his precious book.McBain's 87th precinct novels are always entertaining, and \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" gets high marks for its large and colorful cast of characters, its fast moving story and its self-mockery. McBain quotes large sections of Ollie's book, and through Ollie, McBain makes fun of the conventions of the police procedural. McBain's fictional city of Isola is a homage to New York City, with its high-octane excitement, its political pressure and the desperation and chutzpah of its criminal element.Ed McBain has won every award that is available to a mystery writer. \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" makes it clear why McBain has remained successful for so many years, while lesser talents have fallen by the wayside. This novel, like so many others in this series, is witty, smart and irreverent, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Every time I read an Ed McBain novel (and I've probably read half of the more than 50 he's written, each a gem), I wonder why it's not sitting atop a best-seller list (arbitrary as those lists may be). Mystery-lovers of the world, take notice! McBain (aka Evan Hunter) is a brilliant writer, the kind who dreams up ingenious plots and then populates them with an array of diverse characters, filled with spunk and armed with witty banter, who will make you laugh out loud and might - just might - even cause you to shed a tear or two.In this latest winner, Detective Oliver Wendell \\"Fat Ollie\\" Weeks of the 88th Precinct has written his first novel - a police procedural. Unfortunately, just as he's taking his precious tome (all 36 - yes, 36 - pages of it) to be photocopied (somehow Fat Ollie hasn't seen fit to purchase a computer), he gets called to a murder investigation, and wouldn't you know it, someone filches the sure-to-be-a-best-seller (!) from the back of his squad car while he's off fighting crime.Can Fat Ollie find time to recover the manuscript while solving the murder of a political up-and-comer? Heck, should he even be concentrating on the murder when the fruit of his labor has disappeared? Truth and fiction are tightly intertwined as Fat Ollie teams up with the boys from the nearby 87th Precinct (familiar to and well-loved by McBain fans everywhere) to figure it all out.McBain's sense of humor is beyond priceless, if that's possible, and this story is a grand piece of entertainment. I enjoyed every page. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"Those who pull an Ed McBain book off the shelf, or take one to the check out, are unlikely to be disappointed. This 2002 offering is as good as they usually are and funnier than most. Occupying most space, in terms of physical bulk and narrative focus, is Oliver Wendell Weeks, a cop otherwise known as Fat Ollie. Affecting a style of delivery modeled on that of W C Fields (who remembers him?), and able to boast that his music teacher successfully taught him the first three notes of \\"Night and Day\\", Fat Ollie has further displayed his talents by writing a police procedural novel. Unfortunately for him it is stolen, but fortunately for us its full text is interlaced with everything else that unfolds in this rich McBain extravaganza. Thrown in also are comments about Internet sites like this one, and those who read and write reviews thereon."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"This book contains the worst crime fiction Ed McBain has ever produced, and that's meant as a complement. After all, it takes a gifted writer to write prose as bad as McBain produces on behalf of one of his less noble fictional creations, Detective First Grade Oliver Wendell Weeks. Weeks figures if he solves the crimes, what's the trick in making one up on paper and getting it on the best seller's lists? Not only does he have a well-worn list of \\"how-tos\\" for creating crime fiction (\\"BE SURE TO AVOID AMBIGUITY\\"), he's been doing his homework surveying the marketplace by reading Amazon.com reviews.Clearly this guy is in trouble...Weeks has been floating around McBain's 87th Precinct novels for a while, and now he gets center stage. Though he's with the 88th Precinct, and much disliked by the 87th Precinct detectives (and many readers) because of his nasty manner and blunt racist approach to life, he's still a decent detective.Weeks kind of works as a protagonist only if you are playing it for laughs, and McBain is here. \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is one of the more comic 87th Precinct offerings. People still die, and others mourn, but this time there's more emphasis on laughs, incongruity, and malaprops, particularly when it comes to Weeks' novel. He decides it should star someone like himself (maybe not quite as fat) but female, since he discovers women buy more mysteries than men.It's not exactly like Weeks transforms himself into Phil Donohue. His opus, \\"Report To The Commissioner,\\" includes references to the narrator's ample bust and what a hot dish she is in general. She's writing from a locked room, you see, waiting for someone to kill her, and the first thing she wants you to know is there's a run in her stockings...Then someone steals his manuscript, and Weeks goes on the warpath to get it back.As a crime drama, \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is problematic. There's a couple of cases being worked on in tandem with Ollie's crisis, neither which holds much interest. The other detectives, like Steve Carella and Bert Kling, go through their paces but don't manage anything particularly interesting this time around. A problem with this book is that Weeks is probably the most colorful character anyway, and pushing him up to the foreground, especially as entertainingly as this, makes the others pale by comparison.But as a crime comedy, \\"Fat Ollie's Book\\" is a nice reminder of a key reason so many of us visit the 87th Precinct: McBain's one funny writer, and he can spin a yarn.Pity poor Ollie can't. But at least he can dance, play \\"Night And Day\\" on the piano, and come up for a derogatory epithet for anyone else on the planet."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"McBain has done it again with his latest 87th Precinct book, although this time the primary character is Oliver Wendell Weeks, aka Fat Ollie. Fat Ollie is a fun character - his inner thoughts about those other than himself are hilarious to the extreme. Love the fact that he doesn't think he's biased against anyone - just discerning. The way he constantly debates with himself the rules of grammar (he's a writer now) was just funny as heck. I'd like to see more books featuring this character. Carella and Kling are only on the periphery here and there's not much of a mystery, but Fat Ollie takes up the slack and does it well."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"One of the bits of information bestowed upon the reader perusing FAT OLLIE'S BOOK is that Steve Carella is 40 years old. Given that he was around 25 when Ed McBain published COP HATER, the first 87th Precinct novel, in 1956, that certainly demonstrates an ability to age gracefully! Like Carella, the 87th Precinct series and McBain have aged well and, if FAT OLLIE'S BOOK is any indication, still have plenty of life.FAT OLLIE'S BOOK, while being \\"A Novel of the 87th Precinct\\" is also technically a novel of the 88th Precinct. FAT OLLIE is Fat Ollie Weeks, a detective assigned to that particular precinct house. He is held in good-natured contempt by his fellow officers for various reasons, most of them legitimate ones. Weeks becomes embroiled in the affairs of the 87th Precinct when he answers a call concerning the murder of Lester Henderson, a city councilman. Weeks' automobile is broken into while he is at the scene of the crime. The thief makes off with two of Weeks' possessions: an attach&eacute; case that he does not value much and the only copy of his manuscript, Report to the Commissioner, which he values very much. Weeks is, of course, incensed and spends almost as much time methodically tracking down the thief as he does Henderson's murderer. He is assisted in the latter endeavor by a couple of the lads of the 87th --- this is, after all, a novel of the 87th Precinct --- as well as by Officer Patricia Gomez, a newly minted cop who found the murder weapon in the Henderson case and who becomes, against all odds, the willing object of Weeks's love interest.With respect to his search for his erstwhile manuscript, well, Report to the Commissioner indirectly becomes the catalyst for the involvement of a couple of prostitutes in a cocaine rip-off. McBain, as always, brings all of this off so wonderfully that he makes it look easy --- which it isn't --- and makes it wonderful, which it always is. McBain also leaves some threads unraveling within the personal lives of some of his characters, just to be sure that the reader will be back for the next installment. Be back?! Hah! Read one and try to stay away!McBain shows no signs of wear, tear or rust as he approaches his half-century of chronicling the 87th Precinct. He seems incapable of writing badly, though there is an example in FAT OLLIE'S BOOK of what he is able to do in that regard, when he sets his mind to it. Let's just say that Weeks isn't half the writer that McBain is and count us the luckier for it.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I just finished this book and thought it one of the best of the 87th Precinct novels so far. Oliver Wendall Weeks, aka Fat Ollie, is so obnoxious, he's hilarious. He's obese but considers himself simply a large man who hates fat people. As McBain describes him, he is an equal opportunity bigot. McBain gives his reader something you can count on him to provide with each book: the joke. I always look forward to that.In this installment, Ollie has written a book, all 36 pages, which reads like an actual police report. Ollie's car is burglarized while he's investigating the fatal shooting of city councilman Lester Henderson, and his manuscript is stolen. The burglar, Emilio Herrera is also a transvestite and somewhat dim-witted. He thinks Ollie's book is an actual police report. From there, the book just gets better and better. The investigation into the councilman's death is mainly handled by the best of the 87th detectives: Steve Carella and Bert Kling.There isn't much of a mystery here - I figured that out rather quickly. But this is a wonderful book which is so funny in places, you'll laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"This is the best 87th Precinct novel so far -- even though much of it is actually the 88th Precinct. The characters are superb and McBain's sense of humor is enthralling. He braids a murder investigation into the theft of a manuscript -- and we are just as interested in both. But beyond the actual plot, the characters are what make this novel so good. We are glad to see some of our old favorites -- Carella, Kling, Parker, the snitches Cowboy Palacios and Fats Donner -- but the \\"fleshing out\\" (so to speak) of Ollie Weeks is superb.

As first on the scene, all around offensive, foul mouthed and bigoted Detective Oliver Wendell Weeks catches the case and begins to run with it, interviewing witnesses, barking obnoxious orders, and getting a sense of the scene and what had just happened there. Ollie's feeling pretty pumped, grabbing a high profile, headline making murder case. That is, until he returns to his vehicle and finds the only copy of his just completed first novel, Report To The Commissioner, missing. It seems that while he was inside the hall working one crime scene, someone outside was creating another. Some low-life broke into his car and stole all thirty-six pages of his soon to be bestseller masterpiece. And to complicate matters, the not-too-bright thief doesn't even realize he's holding a novel. He thinks he's just found his ticket to the good life; a police report detailing a soon to be bust involving 2.7 million worth of diamonds..... Award winning, master storyteller, Ed McBain, finally gives one of his most colorful and entertaining characters a book, actually two books, of his own. This is a police procedural that has it all... seemingly unrelated, complex, and intriguing story lines that are deftly woven together, creating a stunning climax and satisfying ending; clever, vivid, often laugh-out-loud scenes, and brilliant, meaty characterizations including the ever quirky and engaging cast from the 87th precinct. But it's Mr McBain's smart, crisp, humorous writing, and witty and irreverent dialogue and asides that make this, as well as all his novels, stand out and sparkle, and once you begin reading, be prepared to finish Fat Ollie's Book in one sitting.

He's an equal-opportunity bigot, and his novel, except for the last chapter, has been stolen from his patrol car. Yes, he's written a very short (30+ pages) novel, Report to the Commissioner, and has no backup copy, because he composed it on a typewriter. So there are two crimes being solved here, and how they become intertwined is hilarious. The transvestite prostitute, Emilio/Emmy, who stole the novel, doesn't realize that it's fiction and starts doing some sleuthing of his own to locate the people in the book. There's also a drug deal going down in the middle of it all, with some two-bit crooks who have no idea what they're getting into. Needless to say, this is not a thriller or a serious mystery. Fat Ollie's novel is included in its entirety and provides lots of laughs, especially as its author repeats himself to be sure that he's covered all the bases grammatically. And the protagonist of Ollie's book is a female cop, so that it's almost as if Ollie is channeling a woman in the book.

The first one was written in 1956. It was a straightforward novel with one relatively simple storyline. Today's volumes are conciderably longer with several distinct subplots that intertwine with the various characters. They are much more complex and character rich novels. They might be rarely equaled by current writers but never surpassed in pure writing style.In this, the 52nd book in the series, Fat Ollie Weeks, a crude and rude detective of the 88th Precinct has just completed a detective novel. He has the manuscript stolen off the back seat of his car while investigating a crime. The case he is given is the assasination of a politician who may very well have been a candidate for mayor. Fat Ollie solicits help on the high publicity case from Steve Carella of the 87th Precinct. Fat Ollie not only wants to solve the crime, he also wants to get his manuscript back.McBain uses much humor in telling this multifaceted story. The murder of the politician is compelling enough. However, we also meet some of the dregs of society as Fat Ollie trails his book. Characters are superbly portrayed- many of which are old friends to those of us who have followed the series.

Although the victim was murdered in the Eight-Eight he actually lived in the Eight-Seven so Ollie gets Carella and Kling from the Eight-Seven to help out in the investigation. Help out? More like do most of the investigation and actually find the perp. While Carella and Kling are busy tracking down leads on the murderer, Ollie is busy trying to track down who stole his book. And a brand-spanking new rookie who just might possibly go dancing with Ollie one day, hands Ollie, Carella and Kling the clue that allows them to nail the killer.I found this book quite an amusing way to spend an afternoon (yup that is all it took me to read it, Gertie). However while it was a pleasant afternoon read, I could only give it 3-stars.I've read all the 87th precinct novels and found over the years that I enjoy the detectives of the Eight-Seven, their cases and their personal lives. I, however, don't like Ollie Weekes and am dismayed that he's playing an increasingly larger (no pun intended) role in the series. And it isn't because of his bigoted views, although they play a part, it is because he's not an interesting character. He's one-dimensional and has not a single quality that makes him an interesting \\"person\\" to read about for several hours. I read books where an unsympathetic character is made compelling because the author has infused a little glimmer of humanity into their personalities that keep them from being completely flat. McBain has not done that for Ollie for me. If McBain had done for Ollie what Bochco/Milch et. al. did for Andy Sipowicz, then I'd have enjoyed this book much more. So to have this flat, unsympathetic caricature as the main character, really, in this book makes the book lose quite a bit of luster for me.I liked the case of the murdered councilman and the police work that lead to the capture of the perp. And the interwoven misunderstanding where the person who stole Olie's book thinks it is true is kinda amusing. Yet, I can't help but think there was something a little too frothy and a bit elusive about the whole thing. I kept wishing for a bit more meat, a bit more bite, remembering back fondly to books in the series that really got me hooked on the 87th Precint: such gems in as \\"Lady, Lady, I Dit It\\", \\"Shotgun\\", \\"Tricks\\" and \\"Lullaby.\\"I did like the reintroduction of Eileen Burke, a character that I loved back in the earlier books. And while I enjoy Bert's current relationship with Sharyn, I can't help but wonder if his old flame may cause Bert some romantic angst. Bert's romantic woes have always been a very popular draw in this series for me.And finally, I can't help but be a bit turned off by McBain's somewhat intrusive semi-editorial third-voiced comments pooh-poohing political correctness. These have been happening with much more frequency starting about the time \\"Mischief\\" came out. Just tell the darned story. If you don't like the fact that a hearing impaired person is called \\"impaired,\\" then use a better word, you're a writer!"},{"Title":"Fat Ollie's Book","review":"I have read every 87th Precinct novel -- and every one of McBain's \\"Matthew Hope\\" novels -- and enjoyed them all to a greater or lesser degree.Even \\"Hail to the Chief\\", which was a satire of Watergate.Even \\"He Who Hesitates\\", in which the cops of the 87th are barely seen, in a story about a murderer's state of mind.Even the latest \\"Deaf Man\\" book (though that one *did* try my patience a bit).I didn't finish this one. And i *really* expected and *wanted* to enjoy it; friends and reviewers who i trust had given it glowing notices.Just proves the old saw about meat and poison and two different men.The running joke this time (virtually every 87th Precinct novel has some running shtick, often humourous) is that Fat Ollie, the fat, bigoted, annoying cop, has written a novel. And it's terrible.Wow. I wish he'd actually worked on a readable plot for this book to go with the joke. 'Cos the joke ain't very funny and wears out its welcome long before the book is over.Yes, Ollie's book *is* terrible. I knew that was going to be true before he rubbed my nose in it. And that's the problem, because, essentially, this book *is* Fat Ollie's book; if you took out the quotes from Ollie's manuscript, this would be a longish short story.And it still wouldn't be readable, so far as i'm concerned.I -- apparently almost alone among 87th Precinct readers -- don't like Fat Ollie. If McBain feels a need to write about fat bigoted cops, there's always Andy Parker (who, last time i remember encountering him, was actually becoming a bit sympathetic).And the pathetic geek who gets hold of Ollie's manuscript and is stupid enough (i estimate an IQ slightly below that necessary to sustain life) to believe that it's a coded official report that will lead him to Great Riches is just too annoying to be allowed to live.The Worst In The Series. Pass it by; re-read some of the earlier ones.Or, if you haven't yet read any of the Matthew Hope novels, try some of those."},{"Title":"Beautiful Face, Beautiful Body","review":"Reading the delightful chapters of this book brings back so many treasured memories of my childhood summers in Somerset, England during the 1940's. My aunt often took me foraging in the hedgerows and fields for wild herbs and fruits, and made skin tonics, bubble baths, hair rinses, furniture polishes and luandry softners. Fresh produce was used for cooking, cleaning, and skin-care. Natural beauty ment taken from nature. No chemicals were addes for preserving or storage and therefore no testing on animals. The author authenticates natural as being free gifts from nature. She offers fresh foraging and used of wild herbs and fruit, infused oils, free range eggs, unpasterized milk, raw honey, and if there are recipies that require an alcoholic spirit as a preserative, it would have probably been (since most of her recipies are generations old) made from the humble potato, much like the gin my grandfather made called &quot;moon shine&quot;. Obviously the reader should take into consideration that our American countryside is not as uncultivated, and farming methods are not as traditional as they were, and in some areas, still are, in the counties of England. The author has to the best of her ability offered alternative ingrediants accessible to readers and workable to her recipies.

But, this book is riddled with errors. I fought my way through the examples up to chapter 5, correcting things which didn't work as described in the book by trial and error, and by comparing with the supplied CD (which is often considerably different from the printed code). In chapter 5 this just got too ugly, and even when I tried to resolve it by using the examples from the CD, one of those had a hard coded absolute path based on the author's E: drive and wouldn't compile!

There is much more wrong here than typos and cut and paste oversights; some of the errors are fundamental, and grievously misleading. Furthermore, I've tried to contact the publisher about corrections or explanations of specific issues and gotten no response.The bright side is you will actually learn something as you struggle to understand how to make the examples work. It was painfull but I made progress using MSDN info and ATL source. I've also formed plenty of questions that I'm sure I'll now better apreciate expert answers for.Beware, don't let it's potential suck you in. It took me way to long to give up on this book.Other lessons learned:1) Resist the bookstore computer book section, the odds are worse than the lotery. 2) Look for author's that stand behind their work with a personal email address for comments, questions, and suggestions. 3) Be extra suspicious of this publisher."},{"Title":"COM/DCOM Blue Book: The Essential Learning Guide for Component-Oriented Application Development for Windows","review":"This book seems cover every facets of COM.

[2] Fanciful speculations drawn on true life events (&quot;The Queen's Ring&quot;, &quot;The Mystery of the Marie Celeste&quot; and &quot;Goodbye, Miss Lizzie Borden&quot;). [3] Classic literature (&quot;The Signalman&quot; by Charles Dickens, and &quot;The Mystery of Marie Roget&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe). [4] Crime and detective stories (&quot;St. James Infirmary Blues&quot;, &quot;The Great Train Robbery&quot;, &quot;The Face is Familiar&quot;, &quot;Want Ad&quot;, &quot;Murder by Jury&quot;, and &quot;The Cave In&quot;). [5] Westerns (&quot;The Spencer Brothers&quot; and &quot;Ordeal in Donner Pass&quot;). [6] High adventure (&quot;Action&quot;, &quot;Hellfire&quot;, and &quot;Lily and the Colonel&quot;). [7] Suspense (&quot;Pigeon in a Cage&quot;, &quot;Never Follow a Banjo Act&quot;, and &quot;Parole to Panic&quot;). [8] Science fiction (&quot;Plan X&quot;, and &quot;Heavens to Betsy&quot;).The collection features some classic stories and big stars (for example, Ronald Reagan, Agnes Moorhead, and Van Heflin). Some of the real gems, however, are little known stories featuring people you never heard of. &quot;Public Defender&quot; tells the story of a lawyer who performed far above and beyond the call of duty. &quot;Sequel to Murder&quot; features a man who makes up for a lack of creativity with a talent for imitation. In &quot;The Cave In&quot;, a policeman risks his life in an attempt to solve the murder of a man everyone hated.It's difficult to collect sixty stories from one series without getting some clunkers. &quot;Over the Bounding Main&quot; made no sense whatsoever. &quot;The Empty Chair&quot; was just a little too preachy. &quot;The Game&quot; wasn't any fun at all. And &quot;Premonition&quot; was predictable."},{"Title":"Tales Well Calculated to Keep You In Suspense","review":"I bought this book off Amazon last year and it took me a while to get through all sixty shows. On the whole, this box set is great. Most stories are well acted and of course have suspense! One anoying thing about this collection is the inclusion of the dumb autolight commercial between shows but by the tenth cassette the comercial is gone. Like the reviewer below me, a collection of this size is bound to carry a few duds but I would say that there are only three or four in this entire collection. Most are quite intriguing and well written. Its worth mentioning that comparing these stories with today's pop culture and morals is amusing though I was rather surprised that they tackled themes like divorce, adultery and even alcoholism; pretty progressive stuff for those days. For the price, you can't go wrong. If you are a lover of classic radio drama or audiobooks in general its worth every penny and they will give you hours of enjoyment. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tales Well Calculated to Keep You In Suspense","review":"This was a terrific collection to enjoy. The CBS radio series was just ending it's run on the radio network by the time I entered high school.In listening, I was reminded how much I loved listening to the great acting, stories and sound effects.

Magical, innocent, and just plain strange, Carroll brings out the wonder of the imagination through jaunty verse. He also wrote some beautiful and not-widely-known love poems. This is one for the bookshelf in all our hearts"},{"Title":"The Humorous Verse of Lewis Carroll","review":"This edition contains the complete verse of the author of 'Alice in Wonderland' and 'Through the Looking -Glass.' It contains parodies on the sentimental verse of his day,and verbal inventions such as coin-words and portmanteau, two-words in one inventions( slithy = slim, and lithe). It builds a world of play in words all its own. Just looking at some of the wordplay I see how James Joyce must have ' understand well' what was going on here.Many of the lines and characters of this work have become part of the ordinary vocabulary of the English language. The rule seems to be that in this internal rhyming world Carroll followed his own advice \\" Take care of the sounds and the sense will take care of itself\\"Here is the first stanza of one of his most well- known examples, \\"Jabberwocky\\"'Twas brillig and the slithy tovesDid gyre and gimble in the wave:All mimsy were the borogovesAnd the mome roths outgrabe\\"But if the nonsense verse is not to the reader's taste there is of course much else more readily understandable 'woetry'How many times in this life of ours do we for instance return to the insight given in the immortal ' Humpty Dumpty\\"\\"All the kings horses and all the kings men, could not put Humpty Dumpty together again\\".In this collection Carroll's work is, however, all together for what will most likely be the delight of the reader ready to ' twaste 'it."},{"Title":"The Humorous Verse of Lewis Carroll","review":"I don't know why but you really want to learn this stuff by heart so you can recite it to yourself in odd moments. Some of it is incredibly witty and it bounds along in a very good rhythm. The poems are quite different from each other and reflect Lewis Carroll's many moods. He must have been a complex and interesting person, as well as an amusing one."},{"Title":"The Humorous Verse of Lewis Carroll","review":"My recent reading of the Historic Novel \\"Alice I have been\\" prompted me to revisit this favorite.This is a collection of some well known poems (including \\"The Walrus and the Carpenter\\" and \\"The Jabberwocky\\") and some very un-known. My favorites lie within the verses about and reminiscent of Wonderland. Some of his other verses are heavy with political inference, and without context are difficult to enjoy.Because Charles Dodgeson was in real life a math professor, he included many puzzles in his stories. Most of these involved a play on words that the reader or listener must pay close attention to find.Check out my blog at [...] for a full review!"},{"Title":"100 Carols for Choirs (For Choirs Collections)","review":"I had the pleasure of participating in a workshop with David Willcocks, and received this book as part of it. It was first published in 1987, but Sir David had some amusing anecdotes to share about how he and John Rutter, another name to reckon with in choral music circles, put it together.This is what I like about it:* These gentlemen are giants in the English choral music scene, and personify the English choral tradition in everything they do. So it's a pleasure to find that they have included many carols from other countries, as well as the English ones. It's very hard to find non-English-language carols, so this is a nice little collection.* Their 4-part arrangements are imaginative but easy enough to sight-sing.* It also includes a listing of church festivals other than Christmas, with the names and page numbers of carols that would be appropriate for each.* For ease of navigation as you're singing, the verses are in Roman type while the refrains are in italics.* For reasons that are not clear, they have chosen to include the text in the original language in some cases, but not all. The foreign language texts are immediately under the English translations, so you can sing in either language.* At the very end of the book is the order of service for the traditional Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, with instructions on the appropriate rank of each person to read, from chorister to bishop.If you are only going to buy one carol book, this and the Oxford Book of Carols are the best ones to consider. The Oxford has more in it, and is hugely more expensive, so I recommend this one! it'll take you several Christmasses to sing your way through it."},{"Title":"100 Carols for Choirs (For Choirs Collections)","review":"This book is a wonderful source for any established choir.

Herrera's poems, as always, are thought provoking and innovative, linguistically and intellectually, and they are a perfect match for Rodriguez's linocuts, which are also innovative and thought provoking. This is a book that you'll want to read over and over again for years to come. WOW!"},{"Title":"Lotera Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives","review":"&quot;A book about innovation and tradition&quot; is how Rupert Garcia describes this book in the useful introduction. I recommend that this is read first, because it helps one to understand the history of Loteria Cards in Mexico and the traditional iconography associated with them. They are actually the fusion of two games, Patolli a game of chance the Aztecs played, and Loteria a European Version of Bingo. In the game the name of the Loteria card is called out rather than the number. It may be a type person, an element or feature of nature, or something elses, and it is often accompanied by a phrase or poem by the caller to further identify the picture on the card. This is origin of the cards, a fusion like so many things in Mexico, has been put into a contemporary setting in this book.Artemio Rodriguez uses a mixture of traditional iconography and modern images to produce beautiful Linocuts for the images of the Loteria Cards. They look both traditional Mexican and old (they remind me of woodcuts by D&uuml;rer), yet contemporary and modern at the same time. Each is distinct and unique.The poems by Juan Felipe Herrera go very well with the Linocuts, and they too are a mixture of traditional Mexican, Chicano and modern subject-matter. They show that beliefs, feelings, and emotions carry over in time, space, language and culture. Some remain the same, while others change. The mix they create is in a constant state of metamorphosis, becoming undefinable, yet staying distinct.The presentation of the book is beautiful, the cover, binding, paper, and printing are al well-done. Each page has a Loteria Cards and a poem that accompanies it. I really recommend this book. It is a thoughtful and beautiful present to give to someone who appreciates the combination of tradition, modernism, art, poetry..."},{"Title":"Lotera Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives","review":"I bought this book last year to give to a friend and after leafing through it, decided I couldn't part with it. Rodriguez's prints are rich, beautiful, terrifying -- but it is Herrera's words I fell in love with. Each poem is it's own mystery. These are perfect pieces, perfectly married to their accompanying images, and make one incredible poetic whole."},{"Title":"Lotera Cards and Fortune Poems: A Book of Lives","review":"Cutting edge Chicano poet Juan Felipe Herrera and young master print maker Artemio Rodriguez of Michoacan Mexico combine as a dynamic duo to produce a book that is more than the sum of its gifts. The two share an obvious affinity of irrepressible hilarity in their work, a Mexican aesthetic of living with and laughing at death present in the darkest issues, the grittiest subjects, simultaneously celebrating in florid imagery in both picture and word the sometimes desperate, sometimes exhilarating vivacity of Mexican American immigrants. At the same time there's enough aesthetic difference between Herrera's hip Bay Area surrealism and Rodriguez's more folkloric technique to exercise friction between the gritty and the sublime, between the dreamlike and the quotidian that depicts well the sometimes dangerous, often moving human drama of exile, immigration and restttlement. Out of the maelstrom of the experience of millions flies this piercing poetry combined, each poem, with a striking print."},{"Title":"Caldera OpenLinux Installation and Configuration Handbook (Handbook)","review":"At last, an easy to understand book on Linux. I followed it and had no problems setting up Openlinux 2.3 (which is what the book covers, not version 2.2 as described here.)

Her parents handle her food refusal by indulging her with bread and jam at every meal and snack. She soon tires of it and wants to eat what everyone else is eating: a well-rounded meal.This is a cute tale with little rhymes that Frances sings to herself with her food musings. The illustrations are adorable, they are not a visual assault as some other children's books have. This book was first published in the 1960s and as with other picture books of that time, has nice long prose, a good length of a story.Both parents and children who deal with fussy eaters will appreciate this funny tale. It is a classic that is sure to be a favorite!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember falling in love with &quot;Bread and Jam for Frances&quot; when I was a child and I was eager to see if my 3 year-old daughter would be equally fond of it. It's one of her favorites. We've read this book before bedtime almost every night for the past month.When fussy eater Frances refuses to try anything new to eat, her mom and dad teach her a loving lesson in how you can have too much of a good thing. My daughter likes pointing out all the different food that's represented in Lillian Hoban's wonderful illustration and she's memorized all of Frances's charming little songs about jam and food. The love, humor and gentle nature of this book make it a good one to pass down from generation to generation."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Bread and Jam for Frances by Russell Hoban, with illustrations done by Lillian Hoban is one of my favorite books. This book teaches a very important lesson to any child who has a favorite food. In the story Frances eats only bread and jam, even though her mother prepares other foods for her. Eventually, Frances' mom stops preparing other foods for Frances and gives her only bread and jam, just as she likes. Frances is happy with this at first, but then grows sick of eating the same food for every meal while her friends and family are able to eat other foods. In the end Frances' mother gives her different foods for her lunch at school and Frances is happy again. I believe this story to be one that any elementary school aged child could relate to. The story tells children of the importance and enjoyment of eating a variety of foods. The pictures and text directly complement each other. The text is needed to tell the complete story, but the pictures enhance the story. Bread and Jam for Frances is a simple story that is easily followed by children. Children can read this story and relate to the realistic situation. This book captures the child's attention and finishes the story within the short attention span of a child. The illustrations of this book contributed to my choosing it as a favorite. Frances' facial expressions in the illustrations help children easily identify her feelings throughout the story. In the beginning Frances is very happy, but as she gets tired of eating bread and jam a frown appears on her face. When Frances becomes very upset that she can only eat bread and jam, she cries. At the end when Frances' mother offers Frances other foods Frances is very happy again. The pictures are very soft and friendly. The colors are engaging and follow the story directly. The style of the illustrator follows the style of the author. Neither the text or the pictures overpower the other; there is a complementary style between the two. I believe this book to be very appealing and appropriate for an elementary age child."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"In 1964 Russell Hoban wrote, and his wife Lillian illustrated, a charming little book entitled \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\". Already an established character in such books as \\"Bedtime For Frances\\" and \\"A Baby Sister For Frances\\", this next story observes Frances as she stubbornly believes that she would like to eat only bread and jam, rather than any other food. Her parents oblige her willingly, and Frances comes to learn that a person should expand their tastes once in a while. The book is charming and dated only in the slightest of ways. Yes, Frances only wears skirts and dresses. Yes, Mother is the only one making the meals. But this is such a light happy little tale that these flaws are easily overcome. Lillian Hoban's illustrations are as cute as can be. The story itself is amusing (Frances often singing little songs to the food she dislikes out of earshot of her parents). Sometimes you just want to read your kids something that doesn't involve huge battles, gross out jokes, or didactic morals. If that's you, then allow me to introduce the perfect solution.... a little number I like to call \\"Bread and Jam For Frances\\"."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I read this book about twenty-eight years ago.

A great gift for any child."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Fussy eater Frances only wants to eat bread and jam (whichactually sounds pretty good right now) - but she's confused when herparents actually give in to her wishes and allow her to eat as shepleases.These are wonderful books, the lessons are taught kindly and gently, and the illustrations are delightful."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"The irrepressible badger Frances, now an older sister to baby Gloria, decides that she likes the predictability of her favorite meal, bread and jam, and refuses to eat anything else. In a gentle way, Mother Badger shows Frances just how boring life is when you always eat the same thing. For fans of Frances, it is as much of a treat as the other books. For example, Frances's thoughts on the drawbacks of eggs is laugh-out-loud funny. However, do be forewarned that the gender roles in this book are even more traditional than usual with Mother Badger whipping up every meal and Father Badger praising her for it. It actually doesn't bother me because at least the father is appreciative, but I thought readers should know what to expect."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"This wonderful book has quickly become one of my children's favorites, and they regularly ask to hear it at bedtime. Frances is a cute little badger who has a passion for bread and jam; so much so that she refuses to eat anything else.Breakfast, lunch, and dinner consist of the same thing; a slice of bread with some jam spread on top. Frances refuses to try the other meals her mother makes, such as veal cutlets or soft-boiled eggs. She just happily eats her bread and jam and skips rope. Eventually, her mother and father only fix her bread and jam, while they eat other types of food. Soon, Frances is asking why she is not getting such things as spaghetti and meatballs, while the other family members are. Finally, Frances agrees to try the other food, and much to her surprise, she enjoys it very much.This is a wonderful book for young children, and it provides them with a valuable lesson; too much of a good thing can turn out to be bad. The pictures are fun to look at, and the story is very entertaining. I can remember hearing this story when I was a child, and my own children have grown to love it just as much as I did. I highly recommend this great book. Your childen will surely enjoy hearing about Frances and her picky eating, and how with a little love and encouragment from her parents, she learns to try new things."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I remember this book from my childhood and thought I'd order it to indulge in a little nostalgia.

The books are wonderful for helping children explore their feelings and interaction with others.

You see Francis make up rhymes about the food her mom puts in front of her to eat, which is really cute. Then something interesting happens. Francis is only given bread and jam to eat, her absolute favorite. She soon realizes how boring that can be. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is a classic!"},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Frances, a young badger girl, wishes to eat nothing but bread and jam, although the rest of her family enjoys many kinds of food. Her mother gently and lovingly teaches her the value of eating a diversity of foods by plying her with nothing but bread and jam until she is very tired of it, and by the end of the story she has learned to enjoy other foods. Young children, who often gravitate toward the same comfort foods for long periods of time, will identify with Frances' preference for bread and jam, with which she knows she is \\"always pleased.\\" After she tires of bread and jam, her willingness to try other foods (and to savor them with the niceties of doily, flower and vase, even at her school desk) sets a good example without being at all preachy.It is difficult to write well with the simple sentences and limited vocabulary of early-reader books, but Hoban does a wonderful job with this carefully-paced, pleasingly illustrated story. The aesthetics and rhythmic repetitions in this story make it pleasing at several levels. The best part of this story is that Frances' parents are loving, patient, and kind, and express genuine respect and affection for one another. A very nice read."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"I grew up listening to Francis tales on road trips with my family. A fine example of what children should be reading at a young age--pure, simple, clean fun--not adult themes, concepts or sexual innuendo \\"imbedded\\" cartoons. The story still resonates with me because when I was younger I would only eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches...like Francis I quickly learned to add some variety during mealtimes. These stories are perfect for entertaining on long trips or just to teach a simple lesson without the strain of tantrums or punishments."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"We love reading the Hobans' books to our daughter. Frances is an excellent example of how aware, how strong, and how vulnerable children are. In this book, what is at the center of Frances' attention is the family--more precisely, how the family inaugurates a way of eating, of understanding the crucible of family meals. Frances' parents embark on an implicit lesson for Frances--that giving her what she (from their perspective) THINKS she wants will lead Frances to see that what she wants is in fact different and more sophisticated than bread and jam for every meal. It is poignant and melancholy and at times humorous as Frances works through what her mother, father, and sister are setting up for her as images of what it means to eat well. Are the parents doing what they should? One can only hope. Thankfully, Frances has her friend Albert as a model, too. And, as Frances goes on to see, it is true for her that eating a variety of foods is something she can start to like, in a variety of ways.For the careful reader, and for the parent who can process the book with his or her child, the character of Frances may offer hope to a young child who is faced with how to eat in a family. This is no small task, and we can all be more reflective, I think, on how well we are helping our young ones to accede into adult practices. May we all arrive at the wisdom that Albert and Frances share at school...there is something eucharistic there, I think."},{"Title":"Bread and jam for Frances","review":"Russell Hoban, Bread and Jam for Frances (Harper Collins, 1964)The badger is one of the world's most noble creatures. Somehow, when they get rendered in picture books, they always end up desperately cute. Never has this been truer than in Russell Hoban's Frances books. While my only brush with Hoban's writing for older folks was less than auspicious, the Frances books are never less than a joy. In this one, Frances refuses to eat anything but bread and jam, no matter what her parents give her to eat. After a while, they stop giving her anything else, and she realizes that variety is a good thing. Ah, if only it worked that way in real life.

It has lots of witty dialogue, a brave and independent heroine, and a hero who appears stuffy and snobby at first but turns out to be a true gentleman and a very caring protector. But best of all, this is a story of Scotland! Skye Crawford is so proud of her Scottish roots that she won't even hear of accompanying her stuffy ward, Sebastian, to his luxurious mansion in England. She runs away instead -- never thinking that the proud nobleman will pursue her into the stark but beautiful Scottish countryside! Waylaid by corrupt soldiers, the two have to work together, and the sparks between them are too strong to be denied. This is a very subtle love story, no more than kisses, but the tension in every scene makes it seem much hotter! Buy this book, it is truly irresistable and delicious."},{"Title":"Rebel Lady (Signet Regency Romance)","review":"Synopsis: The Insufferable EnglishmanSir Sebastian Hilliard was everything that beautiful, young, Scotch noblewoman Skye Crawford detested in an Englishman. He had wealth and power, and the arrogance to use them to get what he wanted. He had good looks and charm, and the ability to use them as well.What he wanted now was to put Skye's brave brother in prison for defying British might, and hold her in bondage in his London mansion as his ward. Spirited Skye's personal war of independence had begun--against this lord who assumed he merely had come to conquer, and against the tremors of surrender in her own treacherous heart...My Review: Rebel Lady is a relatively good \\"old school\\" Regency Romance. The story revolves around a young Scottish woman, Skye, and her older brother Colin. Colin has committed low level treason by helping the Jacobite cause, and is in hiding. Skye's guardian, whom she's never met, is an Englishman, Sir Sebastian, who is a distant cousin, and a loyal English man and works for the British home office. After hearing of his rebellious Scots relatives antics, Sebastian decides he must go to Scotland and bring Skye back to London before she get's charged with treason herself.There begins a high drama, high action Regency. The story was overall well written but low on Romance. Skye is also an extremely annoying heroine who is stubborn and naive all the way to the end of the story. Her stupidity almost gets both her and Sebastian killed several times. All that being said, the story carries along enough to make Rebel Lady worth reading for any Regency fan looking for a different storyline.3.75 stars"},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I've heard from many people who are interested in reading books about anarchism (allthough i think the term \\"anarchism\\" is incorrect) that most books about anarchy are \\"heavy\\" and difficult to get through much less understand because they aim their content to readers that have a good backround of political understanding (its terminologies, its \\"schools\\" of thought, its currents and so forth..).If this happens to be your problem then this book will be ideal if you want to discover what this political philosophy stands for and what its issues are and, indeed, have been for a long time.Emma Goldman, a woman with as fiery a personality as they come, has put together here a number of essays about anarchy that are easy to comprehend and definately thought inspiring.Despite this book having been first published in 1917 it loses nothing of its importance in the current state affairs as all of the issues Goldman deals with not only remain unsolved but they have -in the meantime- become a social burden or a social disaster much worse than back in her time. Oh, and back in her time things already looked bad enough.What you get here is, summarily, the following:-anarchy, what is it and what does it stand for? Beyond the mainstream media cliches anarchy stands for personal and societal freedom of the highest conceivable order. A freedom, anarchists insist, that is not a utopia. It's basically a hard lesson in crushing your illusions and opening unthought of doors of perception of what freedom really means. That would be then something other than being in a cage and having food thrown in. Even if the cage is invisible..-Hard punching essays about the prison system and the everself-destructing notion of patriotism.. Funny how every line one reads in there could've been written yesterday. Not much has changed. After decades and decades of the imprisonment system has society become more law-abiding? That would be a thundering no. Why is that? As for patriotism, the incredible notion of dying for your country the same one that might be killing you slowly while draining you of all your resources and enslaving you in a wage system and a daily mindless-toil called \\"work\\" . here, Emma has to say a lot. There's always a reason to die if someone is going to make money out of it (that would be NOT you) and dress the whole \\"cause\\" up as patriotic..-The hypocrisy of puritanism as well as the seemingly eternal joke of marriage and \\"love\\" are also given the treatment they deserve. In a society based on hypocrisy alltogether, you have to start on a personal level. You have to lose your personal chains before you attempt to free others. Your personal chains begin with the things you've been taught to hold most sacred (as is generally the case). The morals that are not yours. Whom do they really serve? The institutions that everyone notices they have fail and yet most continue to serve them. Why? How can this possibly be?These are just some of the issues dealt with in Emma's essays.A classic book that will basically reprogram your brain if you honestly think about the issues in it. But reprogrammed into what? Well, it will only reprogram you into thinking for yourself. For once. If you do, you'll find that the illusion you've been living in does indeed serve someone. Your long hard road to becoming an individual will thus commence."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This is a good collection of essays by Emma Goldman; however, it is not the best one available. That would be _Red Emma Speaks_, which contains the best material in this volume as well as other excellent essays and excerpts from her entire life's work. In addition, all of this book is available on the Web. So I would have to recommend that those interested in Emma's work get _Red Emma Speaks_ instead of this one."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"Being historically one the more important yet obscure figures in American history, Emma Goldman's anarchist thought is as relevent today as it was when she wrote &quot;Anarchism, and Other Essays&quot;. In an age where political apathy, intellectual ignorance and spiritual corruption are the failings of modern civilzation, Emma Goldman's Enlightenment thought is illuminating in its message of the power of direct action as she so lucidly illustrates:&quot;Anarchism urges man to think, to investigate, to analyze every proposition... (Anarchism is the) philosophy of a new social order based on liberty unrestricted by man-made law; the theory that all forms of government rest on violence, and are therefore wrong and harmful, as well as unnecessary.&quot;The new social order rests, of course, on the materialistic basis of life; but while all Anarchists agree that the main evil today is an economic one, they maintain that the solution of that evil can be brought about only through the consideration of every phase of life,--individual, as well as the collective; the internal, as well as the external phases.&quot;A thorough perusal of the history of human development will disclose two elements in bitter conflict with each other; elements that are only now beginning to be understood, not as foreign to each other, but as closely related and truly harmonious, if only placed in proper environment: the individual and social instincts. The individual and society have waged a relentless and bloody battle for ages, each striving for supremacy, because each was blind to the value and importance of the other. The individual and social instincts,--the one a most potent factor for individual endeavor, for growth, aspiration, self-realization; the other an equally potent factor for mutual helpfulness and social well-being.&quot;From just that little exerpt it is easy to understand why any and all authority was terrified of Emma Goldman and why her important contributions to society have been muzzled from histories - down the &quot;memory hole&quot; to use an Orwellian expression.Again, &quot;Anarchism, and Other Essays&quot; is as relevent today as it was in Emma Goldman's day and necessary material for anyone truly interested or involved in altruistic direct action."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"The other reviewers are correct in stating this is not the best collection of Emma Goldman's work, but for an introduction to her thought it will serve that function perfectly. There are some of her best here, &quot;Anarchism: What it Really Stands For,&quot; &quot;Minorities vs. Majorities,&quot; &quot;Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure&quot; and &quot;Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty&quot; are some of the most powerful anarchist statements you will find. Much of the last half of the book deals with women's rights, Emma was also a feminist. Other books may be more complete, but if you want the other essays they are available all over the Internet.I also recommend Michael Bakunin's works, especially &quot;God and the State.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This is, as someone already pointed out, not THE best collection of Emma Goldman's essays; however, it is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about Emma Goldman, her life, her views and about Anarchism in general. It's a great read, completely relevant to today's world in light of Sept. 11 and the anti-globalization riots in Genoa a few months ago.

Few people lived as such an embodiment of radicalism as &quot;Red Emma&quot;.

By circumstance and our good fortune, a woman who could have spent a quiet middle class life turned into an idealistic firebrand, whose ideas and clarity of expression are still light years beyond many of the crackpots who have taken up her banner. This book deserves a serious look by anyone who wonders why politics never seem to get anywhere. It also refreshingly shows why government is wrong without also pandering to cigar chomping Babbits and their toadies."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. Not only is it an excellent introduction to anarchism, but it's also a must-read for feminists. Emma Goldman was truly ahead of her time, and her radical ideas resonate to this day. She artfully weaves the anarchist philosophy and its relationship to the fight for women's rights together in a strikingly powerful way.This is a truly brilliant collection of progressive essays with a little something for everyone. She covers quite a wide range of topics and addresses a number of women's issues: marriage reform, trafficking in women, birth control & free love, women's suffrage, the emancipation of women, and the women's movement.I also really enjoy the amazing, true accounts she gives of anarchist revolutionaries in their struggles. The tales she tells are incredibly powerful. Then again her own story is heartrending as she was blacklisted and incarcerated herself.This is a book that belongs on every free thinker's shelf. Emma will force you take a closer look at institutions we all take for granted and show you their dark underbellies. That's what I find so intriguing about anarchist philosophy. It makes you think about things, that we've all been trained to mindlessly accept, and dares you to reject them."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"These essays aren't centered on anarchism, she has essays about many different political opinions, but it's a good idea of what an author Goldman is.I say author, because that's what she is. She's an amazing author and speaker, and she really gets me fired up. Sometimes when I'm home alone, I like to read her stuff out loud, it get's me on the verge of screaming sometimes. She's no Kropotkin, but she presents her ideas in such a beautiful way. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in political activism/propoganda of the deed etc., or in the history of such phenomenon."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book. I'm into poli-sci and love the classics, so I went ahead and picked it up, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The author touches on a number of topics all written from an anarchist's perspective, and many of the topics are still timely like prison reform, political violence, race relations and minorities, women's rights, patriotism, and socialism just to name a few. She does an excellent job of presenting her ideas, which she does very matter-of-factly and most eloquently. If you are interested in political philosophy, I believe you will really enjoy this classic on anarchism. It's one of the few political ideologies that puts its trust in the people, and that alone makes it a strange and rare (and refreshing) thing."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in getting acquainted with anarchism. I think it's the perfect primer, because it covers a lot of ground. She has some very good ideas and makes a lot of great points.

Even governments set up to be small and unobtrusive always end up stepping far outside their bounds and causing more harm than good. Such is the nature of the beast. People will insist that we need government to protect us and our property, but seriously, more people have been robbed, oppressed, and killed by governments than anything else. Just something to think about... and this book will make you think.She tells some good stories about real people involved in the anarchist movement back in the day.

Emma wrote in readable English. By that, I mean she didn't have the annoying and iconic high diction of many authors of her time (compare to Ambrose Bierce). You aren't supposed to just agree with the whole book and all the ideas because anarchism is always changing, adapting, and new threats are added all the time. Emma probably could never have conceived of what the modern State has become - so don't use this as a handbook, and FFS, don't use this and become an armchair politician, or worse, an armchair insurrectionist. Please. There's enough. Just use Emma's work to open your mind to some new yet old ideas during the golden age of Anarchist theory."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"You don't have to be an anarchist to be able to take something away from this author.

This is essential reading for anyone interested in gender/sex issues, feminism, classism, capitalism, and government."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"A must read for any progressive or liberal minded person. The book describes the labor, political, social and military state of affairs in the United States from the late 1800's to the first couple of decades into the 1900's. It could have been written in 2012 to describe the current state of affairs. Goldman and other \\"anarchists\\" love of liberty, education of the young and true freedom are honest and purely from the heart. The anarchists seem to know that their lofty ideals are unreachable but that in placing those goals so unbelievably high that even getting half way there will improve the social condition greatly. Goldman's struggle with the corporate/military/political oligarchy that seems to have taken power away from the voting citizens of the united states is never ending. Her personal history and treatment as a pariah in society only made her realize even more that her beliefs were sound and valid. Which they were and still are. Not knowing much about anarchism or those who espoused it led me to purchase this book because Emma Goldman is the most recognizable of those who's belief she shares in America. The sweeping, lofty vision of the true anarchist are not those of the bomb thrower or the radical street thug who smashes the symbols of capitalism, but of love of life, education of the child, the arts and sciences. Goldman and her comrades strive to educate \\"wage slaves\\" on their own condition and the hope for future personal freedoms that corporations in league with the government and the military hold back from the citizens of america as well as the world in general. I commend Goldman and those who came before and after her on their ideals and hard work in reaching for a higher plain of existence for the common man. Their struggle should continue and their banner picked up and held high. Please read this book. It may change your life."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"The best way to approach this work is to put it into the context of the time that it was written in. Back in the late 19th century, fiery discourse and crude propoganda were the norm and as such, Anarchism And Other Essays offers an excellent snapshot of that era and its concerns. As a philosophical text though, I found it wanting. I don't think anyone will come away with a clearer understanding of the goals and nature of Anarchism after reading Goldman's essay since it, along with the other essays here, seem to be little more than crass sloganeering. The world today is crying out for something more substantial, crying out for analysis that intelligently dissects the problems of the world and offers at least a semblance of a solution. With that in mind, I cannot recommend this collection to anyone seeking that solution.Goldman writes good prose though even if her critiques of still-existent social diseases such as patriotism, marriage and puritanism have been dissected better elsewhere."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I downloaded this book to my Kindle, and just finished reading Emma's first article: \\"Anarchism -- What It Really Stands For.\\" I feel this is a perfect moment to review the book, as this first article should \\"set the stage\\" for the rest of her ideas and writings, especially since the book deals seriously with Anarchism, a contentious subject.Myself, I am a student of law, but not necessarily a \\"fan\\" of laws in general. I am open to new ideas, and happy to accept (at least while reading this book) Emma's view that statutory laws should be abolished because they are destructive to the human spirit and things that should lead naturally to a good, harmonious society. Fair enough. But Emma's argument contains two major flaws that ought to prevent one from burning his law school books in a fit of revolutionary frenzy!Firstly, Emma's writing suggests that 'crime' is artificial. No statutory laws = no burglary, no fraud, etc. She says the sheer number of criminals is proof that, on the whole, laws do not deter people from doing things which the law-maker dislikes. Only natural laws are obeyed, because nature demands it; e.g. the need for food, air and sex are natural laws. Emma says that prisons are abominations because of the human degradation they create inside (and I tend to agree), thus, they should be abolished since they serve only to create more wrong in society. However, if all this occurred, and we lived in a world without prisons, and only natural laws to guide us, then what would deter genuinely EVIL people from causing harm? Abolishing laws might solve the issue of burglary, fraud, etc., but what about rapists and killers, and violent people in general? If some nutcase hurts one of our family, is it not NATURAL to want revenge? Without prisons, vengeance can come only from acting on one's natural instincts. Therefore, Emma seems to assume that ALL CRIME would cease with the abolition of statutory laws, and that mankind would seldom act to hurt his neighbour.Secondly, Emma states that work should be fulfilling and enriching; based on the individual choice and desires of the worker. In other words, work should not be an instrument of modern slavery, whereby people work in horrid jobs simply to \\"keep going\\" in a society where the cards are stacked against them. Sounds great in theory, and similar even to the communist ideal. However, Emma seems to assume that, by removing the NECESSITY to work (by abolishing property, etc), then enough people would CHOOSE to collect the garbage, or clean public toilets, or flip burgers; i.e. The sort of jobs that NO ONE really wants to do, but get done because SOMEONE has to do it, and EVERYONE needs money.In fairness to Emma, she spent her life preaching the Anarchist ideal, and states in her article that it would take an entire VOLUME of books to answer every possible challenge about Anarchism. But, I believe the two points I raise are vitally important, and her article left me unsatisfied (like I couldn't defend Anarchism based on the information she provided). Not everything can be covered in a single article, granted, but if Emma dreamed of a day when her works would inspire revolution, she needed to address the primary fears of living in a world without government, and laws, etc. She fails to do that here. Still, I enjoy reading her ideas, and will give this interesting book its due by reading to the end."},{"Title":"Cisco Multicasting Routing & Switching","review":"The only thing this book is good for is explaining an overview of IP multicasting to a non-technical audience.

Ludwig has a positive, heartfelt vision of Catholic faith. If you are developing your own faith and that of your children, this is a good book to read and reflect on.Ludwig runs through the basic theologic concepts of the Church -- what is Grace and Faith, etc. He also tries to bring people out of a legalistic view of the Church to a view of its Sacramentality. This is a view that religious educators are trying to teach -- at least the 20,000 that are showing up at the Los Angeles Conference. I'm finding more books and resources that are trying to teach a more hopeful, spiritual Catholicism -- the religion that should be passed on rather than the legalistic, pessimistic faith that the mass of pre-Vatican Catholics were instilled with.If you are an former Catholic or are discourgaged with the institutional church, you should read this book because it will remind you of why the Catholic Faith is the Path. It does matter that you are Cathoic and that you continue to practice, even if it isn't as &quot;perfect&quot; as demanded by some parts.*By the way, I am not an RCIA teacher.

The intelligent baseball fan will find this, like his other books, to be unputdownable reading."},{"Title":"This Time Let's Not Eat the Bones: Bill James Without the Numbers","review":"A truly wonderful book. James writes profound essays on all aspects of baseball. He cuts through the nonsense that ignorant journalists write and say about baseball. He proves he can write intelligently on baseball without throwing statistics at the reader.The book is basically four parts: reviews of the state of the baseball teams in the 1980s which is somewhat obsolete, critical comments on baseball players and managers, various essays on all aspects of baseball, and various studies discussing issues like the platooning advantage and the effect of stolen bases on team performance. Disdaining baseball \\"purists\\" , he offers controversial ideas, some of which he continues to put forth in his recent New Historical Baseball Abstract.Even though this was written almost 20 years ago, it is still relevant today. If you are a fan of good baseball writing, you should pick this up ASAP."},{"Title":"This Time Let's Not Eat the Bones: Bill James Without the Numbers","review":"I am a Bill James fan, i admit - i enjoy most of his books and his writing style, and i find myself agreeing with most everything he has to say. Some of his lines have been classics, like the one about Greg Luzinski in his new Historical Abstract - thru this book, i can see how he was putting more anger and vitriol into his later abstracts and I understand why he stopped writing them.My big question is this, and i pose it to everyone - Bill James himself, his book publishers, Ballantine books, and just the whole book industry - if his yearly baseball abstracts were so good and so revolutionary then, including the early mimeographed versions, why hasn't anyone put them ALL into a complete book version? Why let them change hands, dog eared copies and all, thru various used book dealers and the sort, at outrageous prices, when I'm sure there are quite a few people who would love to buy them in a complete single book? I understand that this would be a big book at a pretty prohibitive price but i have always wanted to be able to read those earlier abstracts.This book is a good book but it feels like a magazine piece that was thrown together - the short tidbits are just that - short tidbits that generally want me leaving more.

It was difficult being that they were never that big in America. The book seems well researched & focuses on Phil Lynott's incessant touring & recording throughout his whole career. Philo has always been the main object of any Lizzy-related material, but I would think that Gorham or Downey might figure in a bit more. Call it morbid curiosity if you will, but I was hoping it would go a bit more into \\"the dirt\\" behind Phil's drug use and the reason & introduction behind it. Yet another horrible waste of talent & youth on drugs & alcohol. It seemed purposefully vague on this count & towards Gorham as well. Perhaps it was out of respect for Phil's mum? I guess since I just got through reading the Stephen Davis account of Jim Morrison \\"Life, Death, Legend\\" that I hoped it would be as interesting as that was; it isn't. Not quite as interesting to read, but I'm glad I got to because it gave a decent overview of Lizzy's career. Hope this review helps anyone who might be curious about the book."},{"Title":"Thin Lizzy: Soldiers of Fortune","review":"Not for the faint of heart...I must say.

I still see this incident as the beginning of the end, regardless of what anyone else thinks. Brian Robertson could never be replaced and Thin Lizzy became know as the revolving door for guitarists.Ultimately Phillip's demise was of his own accord and that is a hard pill to swallow. He lost everything he set out to achieve. Everything except his loving loyal family and fans. His achievements were many, I only wish he saw it that way."},{"Title":"Thin Lizzy: Soldiers of Fortune","review":"As a die hard Thin Lizzy fan, I felt that this material was only scratching the surface. The author would introduce an idea, give a quote, and that would be it. I kept hoping for more detail.

It would be nice if the author would go back and fill in all the gaps for the 2nd edition.Also, I didn't like the way he put the information. Too many quotes. it reminded me of a &quot;Behind the Music&quot; episode where the narrator, Jim Forbes, would say something and then they would show a clip of the guys giving a quote. Fine for a documentary, but a book should not be written in this way. I kept wishing I had interviewed the band and written a book as I think i could have put it together better than this.If you're a Lizzy fan, sure it will fill in some info (assuming it is correct) but the definitive biography has not been done!!

The main reason for the purchase is that the textbook for the class was inadequate to answer my questions as I studied for the course and I was looking for a good overall Java text to help cover the course material. I found an earlier version of this book in the library at UNM and liked what I saw so I purchased it from Amazon. Basically, this book does a great job covering just about all aspects of Java and is a great reference book for anyone learning about Java and Object Oriented Programming. It provides good examples as well, which a student really needs to help understand the concepts. My only criticism is that, because Java is such a rich language, a book this size (it's a large book!) cannot adequately cover the many different aspects with more than a few examples. Also, this is not meant to be a text book in the usual sense of the word in that there are no exercises and problems at the end of each chapter for the student to work through that would give added proficiency. Other than that I highly recommend this as a reference for anyone learning Java. Finally, I wish that people who write such books would put more comments ( ..//&lt;comment>} in the example codes they use. Every text book I've looked at in Java seems to have this problem. I guess they do this because there is not a lot of room to add such comments but it sure would help."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"As someone who had absolutely no experience with any kind of programming (including C++), I think this book does a nice job of breaking down java projects into manageable segments.

I would recommend this to someone who would like to learn Java using Eclipse."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"ReviewIt's usually a good sign of a book's popularity and usefulness when it goes into a second (or higher) edition. This is actually the fourth edition (title notwithstanding) of the book that started out as Exploring Java. The authors have done a good job in keeping the content current and relevant to how Java is being used in the real world.The progression of information presented here is logical and laid out very well. You start with a quick tutorial that covers the obligatory Hello World application. From there, you get into the core Java language syntax followed by information on threads and strings. Chapter 10 and 11 wrap up the basic info by covering the core utilities (like collections) along with I/O features.Chapters 12 through 14 move into more web-based application development using network programming, servlet, and web services concepts. Chapters 15 through 20 will cover what you need to know for designing graphical interfaces using AWT and Swing, while the rest of the book picks up a variety of other topics not covered earlier, like JavaBeans and XML.A few things I really like about this book... They do not try to cover absolutely everything, thereby swamping the new developer with concepts they are not ready for. The idea is to cover the basics in such a way that you can competently start to use those features. From there, you can move on to other Java titles that explore specific areas in a more comprehensive manner. I like this approach in that you may not be looking to develop graphical interfaces. You may be more interested in servlet-style programming.Another positive feature of this book is the de-emphasis on applet programming. For a long time, it seemed that Java and applets were synonymous with each other. All Java programming books had that as a main theme. Over time, the use of applets has diminished, and the authors have appropriately altered their text to place that in the right context.For the typical Lotus Notes/Domino developer, this is a good source of information on learning Java. While you won't see information on how to manipulate the Domino Object Model, you will learn the core aspects of the language, which will enable you to start writing Domino agents in Java as well as LotusScript.ConclusionI think that everyone learning Java should have at least two basic &quot;how to&quot; books on their desk. You can compare information if one doesn't make sense. While this book doesn't have the off-beat approach of &quot;Head First Java&quot;, it does a great job in covering all the information you need to know to become competent in Java. I would recommend you get a copy of this book if you are starting down the Java path."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"This book, as noted by one of the reviewrs, certainly does not deserve the title &quot;Learning Java&quot;. I didn't get any feeling of progress while going through the text: it simply describes abstract concepts and syntax twists without any real examples or applications. Examples are the weakest part of the book. Many fairly complex points are illustrated by mere bits and pieces of code full of &quot;...&quot; instead of working code. At way too many occasions I had to figure out how to organize source code in separate files and how to get it to run. Such complex topics, in my opinion, must be accompanied by numerous WORKING examples.Overall, it's good reference book if you'd like to refresh your understanding of some points or look up correct syntax.

It is pretty much everything I want in a language oriented text book these days - it doesn't require that I read through pages of over simplifications to find the information that I want. I'm using it mostly as a reference book, and it is from that use that I have come to my 5 star rating. It has everything I need and the language, examples, and diagrams all help to very clearly illustrate the concepts and topics being covered. I do have a good amount of experience in several programming languages including Java already, but this book is really helping me to easily extend my Java skill set. This book is actually a lot more convenient than dealing with looking up info on the Internet since I don't always have a connection when I feel like being productive and honestly it's (usually) easier to find relevant information in the book compared to look scavenging online.I would not recommend this to someone who has never programmed before, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone who knows even a single language to reasonable degree. The only 'criticism' I have is that this is much more of a textbook than some programming language guides, but this is what makes it so easy to find information when trying to troubleshoot a specific topic, so that could be a pro or a con depending on how the reader prefers to use programming language texts."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I had purchased \\"Learning Java\\" out of the conviction that some patience and thought was all that was needed to make sense of the book. \\"Learning Perl\\" (also published by O'Reilly) had a somewhat steep but manageable learning curve-I thought \\"Learning Java\\" would be more of the same. Unfortunately, I found \\"Learning Java\\" to be a disappointment. The book begins by creating a simple \\"Hello, Java!\\" pop-up box along with brief explanations of the basic concepts of Java (class, methods, etc). The book, however, then gives an overview of syntax and tools with no practice exercises. The book essentially went like this: \\"This is what a class is. This is what a method is. This is what an exception is.\\" And so on. The book spends a few paragraphs describing many important concepts of Java without adequate examples and no practice exercises. The author's organization and presentation of the materials made the book more of a dictionary than a tutorial.Don't get me wrong, the book does provide an excellent overview of Java's history and heritage. It also serves as a handy (but incomplete) reference, although \\"Java in a Nutshell\\" is a much more complete reference. However, like some reviewers, I believe that the title was a bit misleading for those wanting to actually learn to program in Java. This book is not for someone new to programming. \\"Learning Java\\" is actually more like an overview or tour of Java that introduces the program's features and tools. It is not a tutorial.My recommendation: See if you can get a hold of \\"Learning Java\\" and take a look at a few chapters. If you like the author's approach (and several reviewers did), then by all means purchase the book. I was originally going to recommend that only those with C or C++ programming experience give the book a try, but I've noticed several reviewers with such experience giving the book a poor review. If you are looking for a tutorial, try the deceptively named but excellent \\"Teach Yourself Java in 21 Days\\" by Laura Lemay."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Learning Java by O'Reilly is an excellent book for someone who already knows the basics of programming(i.e - knows about syntax, decision statements, and a cursory understanding of objects). However, as a teaching tool in a classroom this book does not cover in depth the basic ins and outs of a language that would really hit home the concepts necessary to a learn how to program or to use java for a beginner.Now from a professionals point of view or an college students point of view(I am both being an Engineer at RIT which has a coop program which is rotating work and school in your chosen field every quarter after your second year) this book gives a good explantion of the advanced topics such as Applets, Remote Method Invocation, sending seroalized objects, web programming, threads and a couple of others. So if you are looking to expand your programming base with a completely portable language this is the book for you or if you just want to get the background of the power house tools of Java this book is also for you!"},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I have experience in C but not C++.

In comparison this book is very refreshing and I feel I am learning new stuff really easily.This book is dense but motivates using simple code. Explanations may not be complete (esp in Chap 2) but really this is a good compromise.This is definitely for someone with a background in programming (preferably in C or C++). Ideally one should have a programmers editor on and keep trying the code snippets as one reads (which is why the online version at safari.orielly.com is handy). So, in a sense, this book is not for the uninititated. But for those who have some exposure this is well worth the money and effort.The author also has a useful open source tool (BeanShell) which suggests some depth.Some Tips for readers new to java on windows:1. Download and install jdk 1.4.x2. Get a simple programmers editor (editplus.com for example)3. Get Jikes compiler as a replacement for javac (copy it to the jdk bin directory) as its really fast and use it to compile within the editor.4. Make sure your classpath and path variables are set properly. The former could include the jdk jre/lib/rt.jar and . the current directory; the latter could include the jdk bin dir. in XP these can be set using the controlpanel advanced setting for environment variablesOnce you can experiment with the code as you read, it becomes more interesting.I would say the book deserves at least 4 stars; I am giving it a 5 to offset some really low ratings :-)"},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"This book came as a surprise. O'Reilly is generally great in the \\"learning\\" space (Learning C# and Practical C Programming are great), but Learning Java misses the mark by comparison. Learning Java is definitely not a new-to-Java text.This is not my first Java book, so I expected the first chapter to contain the ordinary byte code/virtual machine/OO discussion that is de rigeur. However, this text takes the opportunity to launch into a discussion of the class loader; Java's similarity to Smalltalk in that they are both statically typed, late-bound languages; threads; dynamic memory allocation et al. And yes, that's the *first* chapter.The complexity continues: the second chapter's \\"intro\\" program (the also de rigeur K&R; \\"Hello World\\") begins with a simple system.out.println and --- over the course of 20 pages --- adds a complete UI, two synchronized threads, a try-catch exception handling block and multiple classes. All this with minimal (a sentence or two) explanations of what's going on. At this point, I put the book down.It is apparent that the authors know the material and are excited about it. However, this is certainly no introductory highway to Learn Java.

This is not a book for someone who has not used Java before. If you have never used or seen Java before OR are not a very very comfortable C++ programmer(actually even that won't really help) this book is NOT for you. Explanations are very brief, concepts are not covered in depth and the examples concentrate on showing short cuts and 'tricks of the trade'. What good does that do when you don't know anything about JAVA? The author should have concentrated on teaching the basics of the language and explained things such as threading etc. much more thoroughly. An absolutely USELESS book."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Programmers who have learned such languages such as C++ will find that learning Java is easy, and somewhat painless since both use Object Oriented Programming. But what about those who do not have such experience?For those who have experience in O.O.Programming, this book will suit you just fine. However, for the rest of us, this book will be difficult to get through, let alone understand. You can read the book, understand the syntax, but unless you understand O.O.Programming, you will not be able to make effective use of this book.My other complaint for this book was the lack of problems for novices to try. Many other O'Reilly books on programming will put problems at the end of every chapter (e.g. Learning Perl, Practical C Programming, etc.) but not this one. I think that would help any new Java programmer immensely.One last complaint for this book was the first couple chapters. The authors tried to give you some code to try out (obviously to get new Java programmers excited about Java), but did so before even presenting Java concepts, so a reader will find himself frustrated from the start.I had to give this book 3 stars because the content overall was good, but was definitely assuming too much from the reader. For people with C++ background, you will definitely enjoy this book, but if not, you will find yourself most frustrated."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"This book addresses a pragmatic issue. The fact is that no one single textbook or reference can hope to cover all of the details and issues surrounding the enormous Java language. Bookstore shelves are replete with books, including many excellent ones, covering transitions from C/C++ to Java, or developing a major comprehensive project, or focusing upon a specific facet of the language, such as threading, or networking. The Internet can play a major role in this as well. The Sun Java and IBM Developer Domain sites, for example, contain a wealth of information and tutorials. Even personal (home) websites can be found, describing the syntax and basics of Java, so popular a language it is.A different approach is taken here. An intrepid beginner needs more than syntax, and already contains so much bubbling enthusiasm that personal projects will spring from imagination on their own. Two major questions are addressed in detail (albeit obliquely) in this book:1. Why was the Java language created, when earlier languages purportedly address the same issues?2. How have the designers formed the infrastructure of that particular aspect of Java, and how does an individual developer implement and expand upon it (at the lowest levels)?This is the function which this book serves, in an ocean of already-existing manuals, tutorials, and references.With this function now clearly defined, the form follows systematically. Some full program examples are provided, when necessary. However, frequently only a program fragment is all that is required, and in fact is ideal, because it removes extraneous distracting details from the flow of the chapter section. After all, even in the excellent O'Reilly \\"Java Examples In A Nutshell\\" book, do you not spend much of the time before and after writing the program, hunting around for 'the main key' that makes the program really work?Excellent graphs and class diagrams are provided, reminiscient of O'Reilly's \\"Java Foundation Classes In A Nutshell\\", along with developmental history and clear exposition on why that structuring was chosen above all others. Recreate the packages, classes, and relations yourself, independently, with pen and paper, and the utility of this book will quickly be realized: it serves as a bridge, between introductory works, and exhaustive focused references.This book may spend a month or three on your bookshelf after you first buy it. You may even question why you did get it to begin with. Its value will come to you when reflection is needed (self-reflection, that is, not just the Java kind).So, visit numerous websites...Download the .PDF files, and browse the .HTML references. Also, get books that this book supports, and not the other way around. This can include O'Reilly's \\"Java Examples In A Nutshell\\", and Wiley And Sons' \\"Effective VisualAge For Java Version 3\\". And whenever you need to slow down, and figure out how and why the inheritance and implementation was done the way it was, and which parts of a detailed program really make the gears mesh, dip into this book, write notes furiously, then put it back on the shelf until later, when you need it for succinct clarification once again."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Approaching this book as a C/C++ programmer with essentially no knowledge of Java, I was not disappointed. &quot;Learning Java&quot; provides a broad overview of the many facets of Java, and it makes sure to point to other resources when the coverage is superficial. While many topics *are* only covered superficially, the sheer size of the Java APIs makes this necessary; at 826 pages, the book is certainly not a piece of fluff.Contrary to many reviewers' opinions, I appreciated the conceptual overview that preceded the more concrete chapters; I find that addressing the 'why' first makes the 'how' more intuitive. If you disagree, just skip to Chapter 4 to get started with language constructs!This book does not always spoonfeed the material; some of the examples require analysis to 'get'; however, I found the accompanying explanations to be sufficient, and I learn more when I have to pay attention. There are plenty of other reference books out there that provide more fluff...My biggest complaint about &quot;Learning Java&quot; is the lack of attention paid to the examples. Several of them had small, silly errors that prevented them from working as written. For instance, one of the intro examples had a method call that didn't match the signature. In a later chapter, a variable was referenced by an incorrect name. In each case, I was able to fix the problem without difficulty, but it illustrates the lack of attention to detail. When one of the first examples in the book won't compile as written, you are bound to frustrate some readers.Also, formatting in the examples could be challenging. The coding style tends to be compact and perhaps confusing when learning the language. A few times, indentation was just plain wrong, making transcription and understanding difficult.Despite the weaknesses, I remain fond of this book. After reading it, I feel that I know Java well enough to dive into more complex topics on my own. A review by a careful and knowledgeable editor would probably win over some naysayers."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I bought this book a few weeks back and have read about half of it. I have about 5 yrs of C++ behind me, and I wanted to learn Java. This book really did it for me. I must agree with some other reviewers that this is not a book to learn Java as a first programming language, because it doesn't spend a lot of time on syntax and stuff. But it covers the language extremely well and give many tips and warns against some pitfalls.The book give an overview of all the base classes, so it's good to read it BEFORE you start coding. That way you will know all the Java classes and be able to pick the the best design right of the bat.There is also a good section on programming Java using the SDK directly as opposed to some IDE. Personally I think it's very important to understand how things are done under the hood.So a great book for learning Java, but some programming knowledge (preferably OO) is required to get the most of this book. If you liked other O'Reilly books, you'll like this one."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"One expects a certain amount of intellectual gravity and reliability with the O'Reilly \\"animal series\\" books on technical subjects. I bought the book based solely on the fact that I needed an intro book on Java, and have never been disappointed with an O'Reilly book. Well, now I have been disappointed.The book starts very well. The first two chapters take you through an engaging tutorial -- taking one idea in Java at a time, and slowly building up. However, after those first two chapters, the tutorial goes away and the book gets very dry. The organization of the content is not well thought-out for a beginner's book. Just for a couple of fairly trivial examples, the authors spend a few pages on the \\"assert\\" keyword before they explain arrays (a very fundamental concept). As a comparison, \\"Head First Java\\" (highly recommended, by the way) doesn't mention \\"assert\\" until an appendix, and only as one of the \\"Top Ten Things That Didn't Make it into The Book\\" list. Also, there is a wasted page on optimization and performance in chapter 6, which is about Subclassing and Inheritance. It would have been better for them to focus on getting code running, and doing what it's supposed to do, and leave optimization for an Appendix.Good points of the book include a lot of detailed explanation on some of the Java API, including Swing and JavaBeans, as well as explanations on how to use the two most popular IDEs: NetBeans and Eclipse. RMI and the natural relationship between Java and the web are covered well. And the 3rd edition of the book has been expanded to cover topics new in Java 5.The accompanying CD contains Eclipse, Tomcat, NetBeans, Ant, and other utilities -- all of which (except for scripting language written by one of the authors) are readily available from the web. So the CD doesn't really contain anything that you couldn't get by trolling the web for a half-hour and doing a few hundred MB of downloads. (Plus, getting the tools from the web ensures that you get the most up-to-date versions...)So, this book is another reference work, another way to explain Java, but it's nowhere near the best."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Hi guys,The book is pretty good so far - I like the way windowed programming is introduced at the get go instead of the console. I am not new to programming and I am familiar with C++, Linux scripts, PHP and Perl. I don't think it's an introduction to programming itself but is a good introduction to Java (if you already understand programming). The only qualm I have with this book (and almost every other book) is when they start a new concept, the author should set expectations first, introduce the code then follow it with a detailed explanation. This book does the last two well. You might want to brush up on Object Oriented Design and Programming before studying this book in earnest. Overall - money well spent.Buy it used and save a tree!"},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I really liked this book. It covers the Java language in detail, albeit very quickly. As others said it isn't for true beginners. It may be for Java newbies who have delved into other languages, but not true newbie programmer (for that I would recommend Head First Java). It seems like that it was almost intended for beginners because the first chapter starts with hello world, but it quickly picks up from there. I read other reviews so I knew what I was getting. I have been programming in java (not professionally) for about a year and have read some other books and dabbled in the language. I would say it is great for someone in-between beginner and intermediate as this is where I am and I feel like it is perfect for me. I just can't see a true beginner being able to follow some chapters, because it moves very quickly.In short great book, but not for true begginers."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"for those have some experenced in language,its has good concept and gental introduction to java"},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I read through some of the reviews for this book and I agree that this book is best for someone who is new to Java, but not new to object oriented programming.

I would recommend it to anyone switching from other languages, but with some idea of object oriented programming.However, I must say that the style of this book is rather boring, especially when it gets to the middle. Sure, any programming language is not necessarily a fun thing, but it can be MADE more fun, eg look at Martin Fowler's style.

Of course, you need to go through the examples slowly and make sure you understand everything before moving on.

This book is aimed towards a seasoned programmer (some C/C++ and java) and goes in-depth at some points in the book about the complier, garbage collection, etc. etc. and things that you normally wouldn't get out of a beginner's book. Most beginner books are syntax based and very example oriented.While this book gives numerous examples, they're very abstract in emphasizing the author's point. I find the book very readable even though I'm extremely new to Java. I've programmed mostly in server side scripting (ASP,PHP,CFM,JSP), I've done very little in C and I have some C++ experience, but it helps in understanding Java even more.

It's not a bad book, but I'm hoping there's a better one out there."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this is not a book for first time programmers. If you haven't programmed before, you should not buy this book. Probably, if you don't already feel comfortable with another procedural or object-oriented language (or the basics of Java itself), then you should not buy this book. I'm sure you'll be frustrated by the presentation, which is comprehensive, but assumes that readers either understand how to place all the information into context, or are willing to put a lot of work into doing so. As an example, for-loops and if-else-statements are finally fully defined in Chapter 4, almost 100 pages in. And that's after we've seen some sample programs, and after we've got the details for how java is compiled and packaged. The full discussion of Strings is even farther in -- Chapter 10, almost 300 pages in.This presentation makes sense, if you've already programmed and understand how to evaluate each of elements of the language in the larger context. For programmers like me, this style of is a feature, not a bug. And it marks a return to the rigorous O'Reilly style that was their trademark in the 90's.If you are an experienced programmer, and you want a book that will teach you in-depth the core of the language, this is an excellent read, and the best I've found so far. And like previous O'Reilly titles, it's borne up under repeated re-readings of selected material -- there's enough in here to get something fresh the next time around (though on extra readings, one does start to notice the verbosity a bit more).I might wish for certain advanced topics to be covered differently. The author understandably likes his own BeanShell utility, but I probably wouldn't have a use for it. I have largely skipped the 200 pages on Swing, although some people might find them useful (and perhaps I should read them as an example of how to craft a complicated API, even if I'm not likely to use the API in my work). And I'd say that adding in a bit of coverage on the core apache commons project modules would be useful -- for me, they're fast becoming an integral part of the language.But again, for comprehensive & readable explanation of the core language for working programmers, I haven't seen anything better out there. If you're starting fresh, consider instead O'Reilly's Head First Java book (by Kathy Sierra & Bert Bates), which is excellent. Then, after you've mastered that, come back to this and absorb the language again from the ground-up."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I found this to be a rather good book for learning Java in a courseenvironment.

As it is, Iused it mainly as a reference book to augment, and help clarify whatI learned in my course. Still, there were times when my professor'sspecification would require the use of a particular class that heexpected you to learn from the recommended text. The recommendedtext would have examples of these, but usually Learning Java, 2ndEd. did not.

You have to know considerably amount of Java before you can fully understand all the concepts in this book. The good thing is that they jump into OOP immediately, and explaining it very thoroughly.My last bad point about this book is that when they give you an example, usually about 2 pages long, and you have about 15% of an idea of what's going on. Fortunately, they do provide an explanation, however it's usually about 15 pages long.

After picking up O'Reilly's Learning Perl book, I was more than Dissappointed with this one. The chapters don't seem to follow any logical flow. Way too much concept and overhead for very little gain. They started explaining concepts and in depth details, before covering basic syntax. Most people who pick up these books have a basic understanding of programming, and are more interested in the syntax of a language. Once you know one language (the semantics), most other languages are fairly similar. Yet, the authors of this book wanted to explain inheritance (both Single inheritance and the ability of multiple inheritance via the implements opertor) when they haven't even covered the basic syntax of the language like strings and arrays. This is very illogical. It's almost as if they explained points a, and points F and tried to work their way to the middle."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I'm taking a Java class right now. The instructor was pretty cool about not mandating a specific text, and I can usually depend on O'Reilly titles for meeting both of my requirements for technical books (instructive and useful as a longer-term reference). This book meets neither of those needs.For learning, whether working to self-teach or follow along with a class, the book stinks. It makes no attempt to present the topics in a progressive order. The chapters definitely range from easy to hard, but the way it's arranged it seems more like it spans from the commonplace to the obscure without accounting for fundamental concepts that would qualify as obscure in the early chapters. As a tool for filling in the gaps of my teacher's notes, it stinks. The code samples are scant and don't build on a wider integration of concepts, which is something I really enjoy about the Flintstones and Gilligan's Island examples of O'Reilly's Perl series.As a reference, the book stinks. As mentioned above, it does little to give good examples of different ways to include the concepts it introduces into your code. I wouldn't keep it at work as a reference, because I'm no more than a web search away from anywhere in Sun's docs to find what I need. I have an older version of the 'Core Java' series that is far better. What's frustrating about this book is that it's thick as a brick, but the explanation and examples seem to be written from the perspective of an author who's trying to save space. It stinks. It does a horrible job of explaining JUnit and other intermediate programming concepts, and, considering it's the edition that introduces the Java 1.5 components, it does a stinky job of exposing them to both new and experienced Java programmers.Did I mention that this book stinks? It does. I hope O'Reilly doesn't continue this trend. Their books make up nearly 100% of my technical library, but they really missed the mark on this one. I'm selling mine and buying the latest of the Core Java series (which doesn't stink)."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I have studied Visual Basic programming for a year and a half. I bought this book and began reading it. By the 6th page of Chap. 2 (the first programming chapter) I realized that I had no idea what the author was talking about. If you already know Java this is may be the book for you, but as far as &quot;Learning Java&quot; from this book - forget it."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"It must be quite a challenge to compile a general reference book that covers a development platform as large as the Java SDK. Niemeyer and Knudsen have done a great job!There are many complete works dedicated to most of the topics covered in Learning Java including those dedicated to Swing, Threads, I/O classes, Socket classes, and Java 2D.

I will give \\"0\\" rate if it is available."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"The first book I bought from O'reilly publications was &quot;Programming Perl&quot;, by Larry Wall and I was very impressed with it. I not only learnt to program in Perl, but also used it as my only reference. So, I bought the book &quot;Learning Java&quot; from O'reilly, a couple of days ago. This book did not disappoint me. It is a great book for quickly learning Java. However, having experience in C/C++ is very essential to grasp the material in this book. (If you don't have any knowledge of C/C++ or don't know programming altogether, you may want to consider a book such as, &quot;Object-oriented programming in Java&quot;, by Stephen Gilbert and Bill McCarty.) I have read through the first 4 chapters of &quot;Learning Java&quot;, and I am impressed by the way the authors explained the concepts in a terse and lucid manner with short examples. (Well, I hate books that are too verbose and repetitive.) I am giving this 4 stars, for now, but if the said style continues for the rest of the book, I will come back and give it 5 stars.In short, I strongly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn Java, and has experience in C/C++."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I admit, I have read several other texts on Java and taken a couple of intro Java programming courses. Nonetheless, &quot;Learning Java&quot; appealed to me as I am just starting to use Java at work... I found this book helpful in distilling what I knew so far and focusing in on the practical aspects of object oriented software development. Lucid, elegant treatment of big concepts such as inheritance, as well as little gems such as the discussion of jar files. This book will be on my shelf for a long time to come!"},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I've been programming in Java for the last year and half, and Learning Java is the book I've been turning to most after picking up the rudiments from other sources. This 900+ page book is great for a reference on almost any Java topic. It is well written, and the authors generally do a very good job cutting through to the important aspects of each topic.Learning Java is NOT, as other reviewers here have pointed out, a good choice for a first book on Java (unless, perhaps, one is already an experienced object-oriented programmer). This is not to say it's overly technical - just that there are better books for the purpose of learning Java as something new. For beginners I'd recommend Head First Java as the best single book.As a deskside reference for Java topics, I find Learning Java more useful than Java in a Nutshell (Flanagan), Thinking In Java (Eckel), or Just Java (van der Linden). These other books each have their own strengths, but Learning Java has been a most worthwhile addition to my group of core Java books. I suspect that Learning Java would have a much wider following if only it had a different title."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Not up to the standards of &quot;Learning Python&quot; and many of the other exceptional O'Reilly titles. This book is not one to pick up and hope to learn the language. The authors concentrate heavily on idiosyncracies and skim over basic principles. In particular, the Swing chapters were a bitter disappointment - the JAPPLET example shows not the skeleton for a working JAPPLET, but how to run an applet inside a swing program. The Lister example combines JLIST and JCOMBOBOX into a garbled example. It's not easy for the novice to peel out one and convert it to a JAPPLET...If you know JAVA and want a reference, this book may help. If you want to know what's new in JAVA2, this book may be for you. I'm waiting for the update to JAVA Examples in a Nutshell and still looking for a good introductory book."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Almost by default, I love O'Reilly books, but not this one. It's good, but not great.First, despite the author's statements to the contrary, it's really targeted towards fluent C/C++ programmers. Non C/C++ programmers will benefit, but clearly it won't have the same impact.Second, I have issues with the structure and organization. It has the usual, &quot;Hello World&quot; early chapter, but it goes way too deep. It gets into threading and other issues that may intimidate some readers. Also, the authors repeatedly use a variation of the phrase, &quot;but we'll discuss that topic more in later chapters.&quot; Using that kind of phrase is okay from time to time. However, how often it's used in this book suggests that the authors don't have the material suitably organized for true beginners.Overall, the information seems well written, but not always well organized. It makes getting through this books more of a struggle than it needs to be."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"A very good book for learning the basics of the Java language. The biggest problem I had was with the suggested audience; the target audience should more appropriately be for programmers coming from a C or C++ background. The authors suggest you be familiar with the basic C syntax, but the frequent references in the text to C and C++ make it more of a requirement than an option. In their defense, this is not an introductory programming book so they shouldn't be expected to try to teach the reader everything.The book covers a wide range of topics and gives an excellent (if brief) introduction to almost all aspects of Java programming. The coverage includes not only the basic syntax but goes into some of the enterprise Java topics normally found in more advanced books. For those looking for a good introduction to the language this is an excellent choice. Individuals looking for more detailed coverage of fewer topics should look elsewhere.One of the best things about this book for experienced programmers is the fact that it does accept that you know loops and other control structures and does not spend any more time on them other than necessary to point out differences between Java and C/C++. This is a relief from those books that beat the subject to death for 3 chapters even when their target audience is experienced programmers.This book is an excellent introduction to the language for someone interested in finding out what Java has to offer as a programming language. This book will not teach you all of the ins and outs of the language nor does it go too in depth in its examples. It is, as the title suggests, a book to learn Java not to master it. The topics are written clearly and there are plenty of small, easily understood code samples throughout the text. The authors&#65533; style is clear and not too technical, overall it makes for an easily understood and comprehendible book."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"First off, I have experience with programming in C/C++ and a few other languages and I'm familiar with the basic ideas of object-oriented programming. But this book was not one I could start learning Java from. I ended up reading Dori Smith's Java 2 For The World Wide Web (the Visual QuickStart Guide) and had a much easier time figuring out the basics of Java. That book was easy to understand although it's extremely limited in scope.That said, I think the biggest problem I had with &quot;Learning Java&quot; was the steep learning curve at the beginning. The very first examples seem more complicated than they really need to be. That makes it very easy to give up and go looking for another book. If you already know a little bit about Java, then you probably won't be scared off but if this is your first time trying to learn Java, your best bet is to look elsewhere first and come back to this later."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Despite mixed reviews from several other readers, I can gaurantee you that this book will help you learn the Java programming language, hence the name &quot;Learning Java.&quot; Previous programming experience is required however, with knowledge of things such as operators, variables, conditionals, etc. Nothing too advanced is required, though.I bought this book as my first Java book, and it was excellent in guiding me through step-by-step, the process of learning the intricate language developed by Sun Microsystems. I had advanced knowledge of Perl and some C++ skills coming into this book (which by the way are both very similar to Java) and did fine. No Perl is needed, I just thought I'd mention that they were similar. C++ is recommended to get through this book, though, as it makes references to different operators in C++ as you go along.The book starts out with four examples, but little explaination. Don't worry though, the author is just kind of jumping the gun. The following sections take you step-by-step through the different functions and the ways of the syntax, with more examples scattered throughout.If you have some experience in C++ and have never used, or used little of before, I recommend buying this book now. Who knows, it may even make a great reference book for experienced Java programmers, but I'm not to that point yet."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"This book has just enough problems to make it a pretty frustrating read.To start with, the first couple of chapters are plagued with typos. For example, inline discussion of code and code samples do not agree with the example listings that they were taken from. This can cause quite a bit of confusion for readers new to Java.The second problem, is that topics such as inner classes and anonymous classes aren't explained very well. They really need more coverage then the book gave them. Programmers without OOP experience are likely to get lost pretty quickly.The book is loaded with short, contrived examples that don't have much application to real life programming tasks. It's often hard to see the big picture with this book. Often times, concepts are demonstrated only in short code fragments that are not runnable by themselves, and thus give no real clue as to how or why you would actually use the feature in a real program.Another issue... The authors have an annoying habit of randomly changing coding styles without giving any indication of why. For example, sometimes they use:foo.getContentPane().add(blah);And othertimes they use :Container content = foo.GetContentPane();content.add(blah);Both of these accomplish the same thing, and the authors randomly seem to switch back and forth between them with no explination as to why. This can confuse new users and leave them wondering what if any difference there is between the two styles.If you already know object oriented programming in another language, then this book will help get you up to speed on Java quickly. However, if you are new to programming, this book is going to be a tough read since it doesn't do a very good job of providing realistic examples of how components fit together, or in what situations you would want to use various parts of the language."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"Succinct presentation, the examples are way complicated for newbies.

This book doesn't come close to those four when the target audience is a newbie.

Niemeyer writes well, - he's more or less unique in this respect, - and he's very talented at explaining complex ideas simply; when you've read his book, you've really understood the fundamental ideas underpinning Java, many of which are only treated in advanced specialised texts. Difficult subjects, like method overriding, security and threads, become clear. When you've read the book, you'll have a real understanding of Java.I have 2 criticisms; his explanations are liberally illustrated with programmed examples, but, - and this is the real disappointment, - there are no exercises for the reader; its not a book that gives you hands-on experience. The second criticism is that he doesn't go far enough; the important subject of EJBs is not touched on.The ideal would be this book, with a certain number of extra subjects, such as EJBs, accompanied by a workbook with worked examples and exercises.Even without, its one of the best Java books around."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"It's such a good book that finally motivated me to write my first review at Amazon. After I browsed through the reviews, I was very surprised by so many negative reviews.The book explains the essence of Java in an accurate, concise and well refined way with a broad coverage on different facets of Java to let you know enough of everything about this language. I can feel the authors' effort to try to explain things in detail and depth but not to turn this book into a 5-inch thick \\"brick\\" and they achieved this goal very well. I would say that with the scale and complexity of Java (both the language and technology), it's not easy to achieve this kind of balance.The book not only tells you almost all the facets of Java and how to use it practically to avoid pitfalls, but also tells you WHYs in a very well written and easily understood way. This book includes numerous examples with \\"...\\"s that some folks might not like. But I consider examples as ways to augment the explanation of concepts and usages. They are not program printouts hence are not for serving the purpose of copy N' paste.If you intend to have a solid understanding of Java, both the language and technology, this is definitely the best book for you to start. Of course, you need to have some (not sure how much) programming experience and knowledge to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"I don't recommend this book for beginners because:1) Less no. of examples with more complexity.2) Object Oriented Concepts not covered very well.3) The way topics are discussed is not so comprehensive and lack continuity."},{"Title":"Learning Java (The Java Series)","review":"This book would have been hard to fault, had its authors sustained that narrative outlook which the early chapters displayed.

His briefcase in the possession of a Czech skater, who knows not its contents. Her price for handing it over is a safe passage to the U.S.The Mission: 6 elite Special Forces units parachute into Czechoslavakia from 35,000ft, a HAHO jump, while their plane is still in German airspace. The team lands at the drop zone, but the ambush is complete. Five of the six are gunned down there, but the sixth escapes. Frank Kessler means to survive, and complete the mission.Once reaching Prague, he finds the trail to the skater, whose suspicious actions show that she has the briefcase, but doesn't know its significance. Inside is one of the most incredible espionage ploys devised by the West to foil the Soviet missile systems. The skater will not deal with the American military man, but asks instead for a former lover, a playboy of sorts named Adrian Dulaney, who must receive a crash course in parachuting, arms usage, tactics and the mission parameters, before he is bailed out of a plane in a LALO jump to infiltrate Prague, recover the girl and the briefcase as best he may.The plot is wonderfully intricate, the characters intensely real, their motives purely human. This is among the most wonderful espionage books ever written, recommended in my graduate college curriculum in a management course. The author deserves status as a household name.His other books are suspect, somewhat hollow, but this one delivers as few others dare. Tom Clancy step aside, and let the true master raise this single torch aloft.An excellent, excellent book!"},{"Title":"Crossfire","review":"I read two of Mr. Pollock's books in the past, Centrifuge and Threat Case back in the mid 90's. Both books were well written, however at that time, the Cold War thriller genre seemed to be getting a bit stale.With movies like The Good Shepherd and The Company coming out recently, I thought I'd again read up on some Cold War fiction.Crossfire fit the bill perfectly. Again a well written book. The author really knows his subject matter. What is well known these days was cutting edge technology and method back in 1985. Very few people outside of the Special Operations community knew what a HAHO jump and LAP System were. Unlike a lot of similar type books written at that time (Rambo, Mack Bolan series), the characters in Crossfire seem real and authentic. They have weaknesses and vulnerabilities which the author often exploits.This book is very fast paced and keeps you interested.

Whether it's the common law, representative government or the immense heritage of English literature, one need only reflect for a moment on how important British culture has been on American life.This book covers familiar ground and those who have read THE ROOTS OF AMERICAN ORDER probably won't learn all that much. At the same time it is filled with interesting facts and provocative theories. For example, Kirk argues that that America's political institution owes little to the ancient world. It was from their English background that they learned representative government. Once independence was gained, the states carried over their institutions. Connecticut and Rhode Island transformed their Royal charters into constitutions, simply striking out references to the king. This is a familiar theme in Kirk: the American Revolution was essentially conservative."},{"Title":"America's British Culture (Library of Conservative Thought)","review":"A short, though not cursory, examination of the British culture that America has inherited and improved on gives the lie to those who claim the US is merely the polyglot combination of a thousand equal influences (if you were taught that the Iroquois gave us democracy, you know what I mean.).

Luminous and grand and down-to-earth all at once. Imagine Jane Eyre written by Shakespeare.It's an education in Victorian (upper-middle-class) England, and also the Victorian English infatuation with Italy.

It was a very easy read, great book for the beach."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"This book provides an interesting look at the world from a Seventh Day Adventist point of view.The book focusses on the identification of the beast descibed in Rev. 13; you know the one who prevents buying or selling by everyone who is not marked by the number 666. It identifies the beast as none other than the pope (actually all popes), based on a numerical calculation of &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; which it claims is a papal title. It goes on to say that the Catholic Church changed the Sabbath from Saturday to Sunday (it in fact did) and re-numbered the 10 commandments.The entire aim of the book is to convince the reader that world leaders will conspire with the pope to pass a &quot;National Sunday Law&quot; that requires all to worship on Sunday and therefore submit to the beast. Then the Second Coming?The book is chock full of Bible verses, footnotes, diagrams, and calculations. I really was about to become scared -- but then something struck me from high school Latin; &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot; didn't look right. It is supposed to mean &quot;Vicar of the Son of God,&quot; but wouldn't that be &quot;Vicarius de Filium Dei?&quot; Heck, that's 1169 not 666. Suspecting a rat, I checked a list of papal titles, and the only title resembling the one sited is &quot;Vicarius Christi&quot; (Vicar of Christ -- adds to 208 if your counting).Needless to say, I didn't buy the author's other arguments either.I recommend reading this book to gain an insight into the beliefs of the Seventh Day Adventists, and to understand why they dislike the Catholic Church, most other Protestant denominations, and especially the papacy.Save yourself the 4 bucks though, the Adventists hand these out like candy in major airports!"},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"It was to the point, exact and deserves maximum respect. I couldn't do better myself. May the good Lord bless and keep you always. It was a job well done.

One had to read pretty much the entire book, a feat consuming about 12 minutes, to determine what it has to say:1. The Catholic Church is illigimate.2. In fact, the Catholic Church is the \\"beast.\\" It is shown pictorially that the Pope's name is associated with the number 666 in what looks like a mathematical algorithm arrived at after many painstaking random tries.3. Sunday shouldn't be the Sabbath.Here's what my friends in the UK get out of the book:1. Yep, Americans are still wackos, and ignorant ones at that.Here's what I get out of the book:1. We have to take the bible literally,2. except when it is more convenient not to. Then \\"beast\\" becomes \\"nation,\\" \\"risen from the Earth\\" means \\"settled, not conquered,\\" etc. There is some adherence to the New Testament's alteration of concepts from the Law of Moses, such as the anthropomorphism of \\"angels\\" resulting because the concept of one unseen God is basically beyond the grasp of authors.Finally, this book is refreshing to me because it shows that certain Christians having bizarre, non-scientific world views and an inability to write clearly can be at odds with other Christians having other bizarre, non-scientific world views, effectively leaving the Jews alone for a change."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"The edition that I read was copyrighted 2007.This book subscribes to the historicist view of prophecy and Revelation.The author does an excellent job documenting the origin of Sunday worship.The Catholic church in it's own literature admits to changing the Sabbath to the veneral day of the Sun.This is explained in detail in this booklet.There is no scriptural basis for changing the Sabbath! On this point the book is correct.Dan.7:25 contains that prophecy.The book re-hashes some dubious history of the Catholic church;the Waldenses,strict penalties for owning a Bible,the Inquisition,etc...The definition and identification of the \\"Seal of God\\" and \\"Mark of the Beast\\" are interesting.The theory that the \\"Seal\\" is linked to the Sabbath makes sense when reading the Scriptures.The identification of the mother of harlots is not new,the identification of the \\"image of the beast\\" is a new one for me.Some of the points in this book are debatable however.Sacrificial law was indeed fulfilled by Yahusha's sacrifice. But that doesn't neccessarily translate into the seven Biblical festivals \\"no longer being required of us now\\". Zech.14:16 is an interesting passage regarding the Festival of Booths.The 666 math with the pope is highly questionable also.This book has a lot of Scriptural references and heavy quotations from Catholic literature. It is sure to upset many christians,Catholic and Protestant alike. There is a lot of truth in the pages,but some speculation also. The material on the Sabbath alone make this a book worth reading for anyone seeking the truth."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"I have to rate this book at less than one star (however the website won't allow me to. Computer says \\"No\\") after getting half a page of text into it and googling a news event about a stabbing murder in New York that creates the assumption that the murder occurred after 9/11. The author uses verbal imagery descriptive of 9/11 to create the illusion that the world is getting more violent and godless. He then definitively utilises a newspaper article to illustrate his beliefs. Unfortunately most folk won't do what I did and google the article where they would find out that it happened the year I was born, 1964! Absolutely no connection there! I will read the book in its entirety and post another review but I don't anticipate it will improve. People, verify the facts of what you read. PLEASE."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"A book suggesting a hyper-Sabbatarian interpretation of Revelation.The author declares that it is evident that the first beast in Revelation is Rome, and by extension, the Roman Catholic church. The second beast is the United States of America, which has a great Constitution and Declaration of Independence, but will soon bring forth the apocalypse.The author then goes through a particularly slanted view of history in which the Roman Catholic church unilaterally changes the day of assembling from Saturday to Sunday and begins killing everyone who disagrees with them. OK, so the church did kill those who disagreed with them, but there's second century testimony to Christians assembling on the first day.Regardless, the author then returns to Revelation, declaring that the mark of God is the Sabbath observance, and therefore the mark of the beast is to worship on Sunday. He is convinced that forces exist in America to establish a national Sunday Law which will lead to the persecution of anyone who does not worship on Sunday.The author maintains Evangelical positions on faith only and salvation but is hyper-Sabbatarian in outlook. He attempts in an appendix to dismiss the many examples of Christians assembling on the first day of the week and insists that Paul's custom of evangelizing in the synagogues among the Jews is evidence of Christians observing the Sabbath. No mention or comment is made regarding Hebrews 4:1-11 and its relevance to understanding the Sabbath. The author also promotes the suggestion that the Law of Moses can be divided into \\"moral\\" and \\"ceremonial\\" aspects, despite the fact that (a) the Bible never makes such a delineation of the Law, (b) the Law explicitly says that it's all or nothing (e.g. Deuteronomy 4:2), and (c) Hebrews 7:12-14 is hard to reconcile with such a view. He also suggests that the \\"sabbath\\" of Colossians 2:16 is really the seventh year Sabbath for the fields despite having no evidence whatsoever to show how Paul's declaration should be so limited, especially since Paul mentions the new moon, which is normally discussed in parallel with the seventh-day Sabbath observance (e.g. Isaiah 1:13).It's a sad little book, really; I'm sure the author will chalk this up to further \\"persecution,\\" but the suggestion that forces will combine to re-establish Sunday as a day of rest, especially in our secular world which loves the money made through people working on Sunday (and Saturday, for that matter), is quite hard to envision. I have no doubt that some people would like to see legislation mandating Sunday as a day of rest; it would also not surprise me if there were people who would like to legislate Saturday as the day of rest and be as guilty of persecution and intolerance as the author claims those who insist on Sunday would be.I have to agree with the author in that Sunday was never declared a day of rest, either; the Hebrew author makes it clear that the Sabbath rest for the Christian is in heaven and the resurrection (Hebrews 4:1-11). Ironically, his insistence on maintaining Old Testament legislation can be seen as a holdover from doctrinal developments promoted by none other than the Roman Catholic church so demonized by the author in the book. How often people condemn in others similar things of which they have swallowed themselves!In the end, the book is a great reminder of why it is so important to read the Bible in its context, to allow one's understanding of the New Testament to inform one's view of Revelation, not vice versa, and as a warning against making one's own pet issue *the* major issue in Scripture...because it's probably not the major issue of Scripture, and it just makes you look foolish."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"I am greatful to God for Jan Marcussen.

It's message is just like the apostolic revival sermons: confrontational,powerful,conscience awakening,Biblical and spirit filled.

I had the fortune to attend a non-church oriented prep school in my teens and was given the opportunity to delve deep into ancient history and western civilization...from what is considered Ancient and Medieval History,continuing forward through current modern history. I also learned the languages of Greek and Roman times and learned much translating from the original text.Interestingly enough, Dave's review is totally off-base. If you have never picked up just a real honest to goodness history book and read it to learn, I challenge you to try several available on Amazon among other places.History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, all six volumes, with active table of contents, improved Oct. 26, 2009, stay away from abridged modernized versions) that spans the time from the reign of Marcus Aurelius to the fall of Constantinople in 1453...a real eye opener for the unlearned. Another good book to read,The New Complete Works of Josephus...which gives one a much better understand of times after the death of Christ and the early Christian era. Usher's Chronology, Bible/Biblical Time Line & History is an excellent resource (find the original if possible, not the revised version that is on Amazon) for the unlearned to take history and the Bible and see if the Bible is accurate or not applicable as many \\"Christians\\" think of the old testament. The Bible is consistent from Genesis to Revelation, and doesn't contradict itself, but people do.In all my studies, coming from a skeptics approach to learning, I found that everything in the Bible ties exactly to historical facts and timelines. Prophecy have been filled with 100% accuracy. Example, the fall of Babylon and Nebechanezzar's dream...the image of many materials... head of gold was Babylon (currently in what we know of as Iraq). The arms and chest..Medo-Persia, brought down by Cyrus (who was predicted to do so by name long before his birth). Medo-Persia was the time of Xerxes and Esther.Next came major ruling power were the Greeks, represented by brass. Alexander the Great's empire fell as predicted by prophecy.Next came the Roman Empire (the iron age). Any scholar of Roman history will acknowledge and know what the rulers did to the Christians, and how by decree the day of worship was changed by Roman leaders, then later by the church in Rome. Those are historical facts. The Catholic mirror publication about this is on Amazon... it is calledRome's Challenge.After Rome fell, ten kingdoms came in what we know today in Europe. Only 7 survived to present day.My point is this...read the book. But ultimately one must depend on THE BOOK we call the BIBLE as the only source of truth. History backs it up 100%. That being said, the author does have the prophecies in line with scriptures. I challenge each of you to read and study (as directed to do by the Bible)and by doing so we will know what is true or not. Don't take any preacher's word for it...read the book for yourself.

The book actually goes further than this, and makes the claim that the \\"mark of the beast\\" is Sunday worship. How does that work out? Well, apparently there's going to be a Sunday law passed in order to resolve the economic crisis. (No, I don't know how doing that is supposed to help in the first place.) Other claims are that the beast out of the sea is the Papacy, the beast out of the earth is the United States, and that the image of the beast is Protestant America.How does the author support all this? Very badly. Passages from the Bible are given interpretations with little to no support. For instance, the author writes, \\"The lamb-like horns indicate youth, gentleness, and represent civil and religious freedom.\\" There is no attempt to justify this interpretation.The author also mangles history, claiming that Sunday worship arose by an act of Constantine. However, patristic sources prove that Christians worshiped on Sunday long before the time of Constantine. The New Testament evidence about this is dealt with incompletely and unsatisfactorily. Also, the book claims that when Constantine became a Christian, Christianity became the state religion. This is false.The author has a rather irritating style, and has the habit of exclaiming things like, \\"Incredible!\\"In short, if you don't want to be treated to bad writing, incorrect history, and silly interpretations of the Bible, avoid this book."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"well.. many of us choose to reject the &quot;TRUTH&quot; as it is and turn to ignorance. we know that the law of the sabbath is still binding toady as it was FROM the beginning. if we look at &quot;LUKE 4:16.&quot; we see that the sabbath was still being kept. some of us say that it was nailed to the cross but if we study &quot;LEV 23&quot; carefully, we'd see what was nailed to the croos. we also claim that everything God made is &quot;good&quot; for eating but i chose to say that everything that was created is &quot;good&quot; for it's &quot;PURPOSE.&quot;"},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"Would like to know some information about the author.What denomination or religion she is associated with.What god does she worship?Did she do her own research her self?Is she still alive?Will she write another book?Has her belief's changed?"},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"This book has amazing insights into the hiden agendas that the media neglects to reveal. For any serious Bible student this is highly recommended reading. I have no doubt this book will come under serious attack. The contents cover long forgotten subjects by the Christian world that seriously undermine many of it's modern beliefs. I found the frankness and accuracy quite startling. This book will either cause the reader to at once love it or attack it with all vehemence.Seeking corroboration on the facts presented I found many of the subjects in this book could not be proved out of modern texts and had to rely primarily on antiquated books. For instance, I found on the subject of 666 referring to &quot;Vicarius Filii Dei&quot;, a title of the Pope, no such title could be found in modern literature, however numerous instances could be found in much older references. (See Lucius Ferraris, &quot;Prompta Bibliotheca&quot;, art., &quot;Papa,&quot; II, Vol VI, p.43.)I commend the writer of this book for sticking his neck out and speaking on subjects that have become controversial in such a politically correct world.

Furthermore the seventh day adventist church was established primarily to address another sensationalized event; they predicted the end of the world at the turn of the twentieth century. So sensationalize this author will; it worked to build a herd of assuming poorly cathechised followersin the late 1800's.Establishment of the so called whore of Babylon church in Rome is entirely misrepresented and its true establishment and references to this is necessarily not included from the Holy Bible, this writers chief reference."},{"Title":"National Sunday Law","review":"This was an amusing, yet disjointed little read.

I would also like to refer the author to read the book of Colossians, in particular I refer to Colossians2:16, Let no man therefore judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of an holy day, or of the new moon, or of the sabbath days.

To their credit the authors have included VB procedures for use in tackling specific situations, and it's indexed well enough so you can find answers to particular questions.I liked the inclusion of the chapter on using Access as a front end for an Oracle database, since that approach is not widely discussed.My advice to readers of this book is to skip chapters 1 and 5. Chapter 1 was not well written and covers working with DAO. Chapter 5 was better written, but considering that ActiveX Data Objects (ADO) are becoming the industry standard, it seemed a bit odd that DAO received so much coverage up front. In any case, I'd treat those two chapters as appendixes, and start with chapter 2, which actually does provide a good overview of Access in the client/server environment."},{"Title":"Access 2000 Client/Server Solutions: The In-depth Guide to Developing Access Client/Server Systems","review":"Let me first start off by saying that this book is *NOT* meant for beginning Access/VB/VBA/SQL users. It is assumed that this book is geared towards intermediate Access/VB/VBA/SQL users.This book does one thing well in that it knows that DAO is not the future and that ADO is (for the time beginning). It spends plenty of time on detailing ADO for both Access and SQL Server.I like the fact that it deals with Access front-ends to SQL Server backends. It even takes a chapter from Kalen Delaney's masterful Inside SQL Server 7 book on SQL Server architecture.All in all, if you consider yourself at least on an intermediate programmer with the aforementioned technologies, this book will not gather dust on your bookshelf.All in all, a job well done."},{"Title":"The Memory System","review":"The Memory System is an EASY read!! and easy to follow...

Two, it contains only the Song of Solomon, so that you can read it on its own, separated completely from the rest of the Bible. And three, A.S.

His series (Survivalist, Defender, Track, etc.) depict the lone hero take on incredible odds.

During the 1st half of the book, Holden is training his family to defend itself from rampaging gangs of &quot;revolutionaries&quot;. In the 2nd half, when the training backfires, Holden goes into mourning and depression while his friends secretly begin to fight back against the terrorists. Holden is picked up by the police, suspected of knowing about his friends and their plans. This is definitely not the usual rampaging avenger fare. The situation is also different from most of the &quot;survivalist&quot; series because, at least in this episode, there is no nuclear holocaust or impending nuclear attack. The takeover of the US is slow and insidious. Interesting twist from a recognized master of the genre."},{"Title":"The Battle Begins (Defender (Americana))","review":"These macho pulp novels were the grown-up comic books or graphic novels of their day.

He did not feel comfortable living in London near the upper class and nobility. He preferred the country and the common person. He wrote several novels, short stories and poems and became a great classic Victorian author.His two novels The Mayor of Casterbridge, and The Return of the Native are supposed to be his best works.Both were slow starting. Thomas used lots and lots of scenery description and lots of build up in his characters. INMO a little too much as it slowed the novel down a bit. A lot of descriptive nothings. After getting by about 1/4 of this in The Mayor and 1/2 of this in the Native both stories pick up and become a good read.The Mayor of Casterbridge is so tragic. If you think you got problems in your life compare them to the problems of the main character Henchard. At a fair he is drunk and abusive to his wife and baby girl. He is depressed as he has little money and can't make something out of his life. He sells his wife and baby girl to a sailor for a few crown. The wife is hysterical and a little simple minded and believes the contract is valid and goes with the sailor. Later Henchard learns what he did and tries to find his wife and kid. He takes a 20 year oath to never drink again. 18 years later his wife comes back to him as she thinks her sailor husband drowned ( the Captain comes back alive looking for his wife and child) at sea and the baby now is grown up. Unfortunately we learn the baby died a few months after the mother and child left Henchard. For a while he is led to believe it is his child but after his wife's ( he remarries her) death he learns the daughter is the sailor's. Henchard gets much wealth and becomes the Mayor of the town. But losses everything and dies a total pauper while his best friend acquires everything of Henchard's. We see Henchard's last will as he is penniless...not to tell his step daughter anything, not to be buried in consecrated ground, no flowers, and all must forget him. Wow that is so tragic...a total loss of life, spirit and the soul.The return of the Native is about a son who returns from Paris to the Heath countryside of England. He has all kinds of problems. marries and losses his mother, and wife. His real sweetheart marries another man and he dies. Both his wife and the other man are drowned together, and his mom killed by an adder snake. The story goes back and forth to this and this married couple having bad feelings and mistakes made. Again lots of tragedy.Both stories let the reader gain empathy toward the common men and women of the 1800 period in country England. Be warned, both stories start slow and there is not lots of super action. If the reader has patience he/she will later have two nice tragic life stories. Many interesting characters with lots of twists and turns doing a lot of dumb things they later regret. After reading these two novels I realized I have problems in my life ( like we all do) but WOW it could be far worse.I subtracted 1/3 star as there was no introduction of the author. 1 page would of been nice. I had to look it up on the Internet. Also no listing of his other works in the back of the book. I would buy more of Thomas Hardy's works in used inexpensive books. Total 3 1/3 stars"},{"Title":"Urban Policy In 20th Century","review":"The delivery was quicker than I expected and the product was exactly as described. I was very pleased.

The book is frustrating because it spends so much time with the irrelevant Jasmin assembler and its syntax. You are interested in generating byte codes directly, not assembler. It leaves out much you must discover by experiment looking at generated class files, such as whether offsets are signed or absolute, where the base is etc. In its next revision, it should set the Jasmin aside in an appendix, and include examples and more precise documentation on the binary formats. The book is still valuable because it gives a fair bit of background exposition you will not find in the vmspec itself. You would use this book to understand the VM, then the vmspec to actually write code that generated or modified class files."},{"Title":"Java Virtual Machine (Java Series)","review":"This book provides a good tutorial introduction to the Java Virtual Machine.

Unfortunately, there are no exercises provided so that it takes a great deal of motivation and creativity to write JVM programs that will test your knowledge of the book's material.But by far the worst problem of this book is that it covers only the very first version of the JVM and the Java language.

This book does not. If you are looking to understand java bytecode and class file format better, this may be your book.

It uses a Problem - Solution - Discussion format instead of the usual academic \\"let's disect Access's capabilities, throw them at you in little bits, and let you figure out the WHY later\\" format. Even the table of contents is much more readable and understandable. You know the reason for reading the chapter right from the start, not at the end.Don't get me wrong. I'm not bashing the multitudes of other Access reference type books, it's just that we finally have a book that fills a BIG gap. Once you read this book, you'll have more use for the others. This book and the others complement each other nicely.The format of this book is not exactly new, however. Rob Krumm's programming for dummies books have used this format for years (albeit not as explicitly), which is why I enjoyed them so much and always hoped he would go beyond the beginner level Access programming books. Access Cookbook does exactly that, and in a very refreshing way.Two things about this book were a big surprise to me. 1. Ken Getz wrote it and 2. O'Reilly published it. I couldn't think of 2 better choices! Ken Getz takes his high level expertise and writing style and transforms it into a new book that opens up his experience to a much wider audience. THANK YOU! THANK YOU! THANK YOU! And then there's good ole O'Reilly publishing who have always had a talent for presenting a very academic subject to a less academic audience without loss of rigor.\\"Cookbook\\" is an ok word for the title I guess, but I think \\"Storybook\\" may be more fitting, because I find that when I start a section of a chapter, I just can't put down the book until I see how the section ends. Likewise, when I start reading a Discussion section, I have to read it all before I put the book down and hit the keyboard. I even use this book for bedtime reading!Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Access Cookbook (O'Reilly Windows)","review":"The Access Developer's Handbook Set (search ISBN: 0782140114) and in particular, Volume 1: Desktop Edition (search ISBN: 0782123708) is my definitive resource to approximately 4 years of Access development. I've got more stickies and highlights in this set than all other Access books combined. So when I came across the Access cookbook and realized that the same two indispensible authors (Getz & Litwin) put together a resource of Access developer solutions, I had to have it.This book has not let me down. It is certainly geared towards the intermediate to advanced Access professional developers who already understand the basics of Access and more importantly, who also understand the shortcomings of Access and the benefits of getting around those shortcomings. There are about 170 solutions in this book that are segmented into 18 chapters of high-level topics such as Queries, Forms, XML, UI, VBA, Windows APIs, even Smart Tags. I would be really surprised to find someone who picked up this text, thumbed through the solutions, and found that there was nothing they could get out of this book.I would say that if you are developing a professional Access front-end and/or database, you owe it to yourself to buy this book and review each solution before you release or ship your product.

In evaluating the MS Access cookbook, I will first offer what I liked about it and then what I didn't like. First, I liked HOW it was written. Other reviewers have commented on the ease of understanding acquired from such a complex topic, viz, one of computer programming and the Problem-Solution-Discussion framework approach in which the book was written and I agree. The book is written in a fashion that makes it very easy to grasp MS Access programming concepts. I also thought there was a diversity of topics covered which will (or should) stimulate the reader into tapping into his/her own creative potential when using Access. What I did NOT like about the book was that I thought it lacked overall practicality. While some of the topics discussed were practical answers to real programming issues in MS Access, I thought that most of the book was impractical for typical business operations. Perhaps another chapter could be added to the book that offered MORE practical solutions for small business. Would I have purchased the book had I known what I now know about it? Yes I would and that strongly suggests the book is worth purchasing. I believe that all books are the same relative to knowledge - no one book has all the answers. You read a variety of books and pull the bits and pieces that you like from each one to create an intrapersonal, collaborative framework of knowledge and wisdom. The MS Access cookbook is just that. A book from which you pull a few practical bits of programmming to add to your own repository of knowledge."},{"Title":"Access Cookbook (O'Reilly Windows)","review":"Access CookbookPublished by: O'ReillyFirst Edition, February, 2002The Access Cookbook really surprised me by how it covers topics regarding Microsoft Access that none of the other reference books talk about.

Getz, et al take us beyond instruction into actual working code, and explains the idea behind it. The examples are practical - I've put a number of them to work in daily business already. And with the accompanying CD, you can see these functions in action through live database examples. The help in the book is not overly technical so only an Access Guru can follow and replicate it. It's written for people who work with Access and are comfortable with it but want to take things to the next level. The book is organized into thematic chapters so you can delve into what you want or need to know and get the full range.

In a situation like that, you can have your internal users access the database using a well-designed Access application, which this book will give you some tricks on how to create.* In the alternative, you want to manage and analyze your data, and create print reports. That's where Access just as a stand-alone application gives a substantial advantage over any Web technology.For a ColdFusion developer, there are some topics in this book that probably wouldn't do much good:* Adding Smart Tags functionality to a database - if you're expanding beyond the reach of Microsoft Office, Smart Tags prove to be a nifty proprietary parlor trick* Using Access' security management tools to manage user rights to database objects. If I run a Windows server, I would use Challenge and Response to create NTFS based permissions on my pages in my application that manage data. Otherwise, I'll use application-based usernames and passwords, same net result.* Exporting Access data as XML using pre-defined schemas.

The author did a great job in pairing them up together as well as giving them great characteristics.However, I was disappointed that the second book, Midnight Lord, didn't match up with the characters and the story as the first book did. If this book was read first before Midnight Bride, I wouldn't blame readers to not read other books by Marlene Suson. For which I am glad that I read the first book first.The story was long and boring. Very mediocre. There wasn't much action to keep the story exciting, much less interesting. I only finish the book so that I can see how Rachel reacted to Stephen's return to London. Summing up the book, I can say, the book is about an English Lord who escapes from a plantation as an indentured servant and finds himself being helped by a woman and her young brother. He recovers and wants to go back to London and seek revenge on the person who gave him to a slave ship to die. During his stay with the woman, he develops a strong character within himself as well as falling in love with the woman who help him to health.I found Meg (Megan) to be annoying and has a low self-esteem throughout the book. She doesn't trust Stephen from the beginning. Not even til the very end of the book. Also, doesn't mention her love to him when Stephen confesses his love to her a couple of times. Says she went to London with him due to her love for him, yet I doubt that since she is married to him so has to do what he tells her to do. She even said that she can't love him if she doesn't trust him. So I doubt that she loved him til the very end when she realizes by others pointing that he was an Earl and not a murderer. When they did go to London, she then doubted his fidelity towards her since she thinks she's plain. I could understand her having some doubt and not trusting him in the beginning of the story but it dragged on til the end, which I find it annoying. He showed her a few times that he is one to be trusted. She didn't even thank him for saving her life from [drowning!!!]What I can't stand in Stephen is that he doesn't stand firm with Meg when he should have when she told him that she doesn't believe in him. It seems that he is only interested in her feelings rather than his, but I guess that's a good thing sometimes. But I don't think it was good in this book. He should have told her that after showing she could trust him, that if she can't trust him, then he'd rather be without her. It would have made the story interesting if that was done and then have them reunited so Meg can have a wakeup call that she has to trust or she'll be left alone due to her inability to trust others.I'm reading Midnight Bandit, and so far it's interesting. so do yourself a favor, read Midnight Bride and Midnight bandit first, then go to Midnight Lord if you really have to."},{"Title":"Midnight Lord","review":"This was a wonderful book that I couldn't put down. Because of this I had to write a review as there isn't any information here about the book (plot or previous reviews) which doesn't provide a person looking for information on a book assistance in deciding to get this book or not. And as this is out of print if you are like my friends and me, you go from an auction site to here to see what the book is about! So here goes my review:This is the 2nd book in a trilogy and though I haven't finished the 3rd book I love the suspense that builds throughout the story. Stephen Wingate, Earl of Arlington is your standard frivolous English rake that over indulges in everything that his station allows him and ignores all of his responsibilities. That was 2 years ago. The year is 1741 and having been kidnapped, striped of his identity and sold as a convicted murder in the colonies as an indentured servant, Stephen has finally escaped his brutish master. Barely alive he collapses in the Virginia wilderness on the doorstep of displaced Meg Blake (she has her own tale of woe) and her young brother Josh. Taking in a stranger who looks like an escaped convict was not exactly a responsibility that Meg needed with her already exhausting schedule but she was to soft hearted to leave him outside for the pack of wolves following his footsteps. Having talked in his feverish sleep; Meg is confused by the man who claims to have been kidnapped from England and is indeed \\"a well off gentleman \\" and his appearance-that of an escaped convict. As one thing leads to another the two characters begin to care for each other and when Josh is injured while hunting dinner, Stephen decides he cannot leave Meg with the harsh responsibilities of living in the wilderness. Thus for the first time in his life and despite the dangers to himself (of getting caught and returned to the plantation he escaped from) he stays beyond the time he needs to recover and Stephen puts the needs of another person before his own. He learns that there is more to life than chasing a beautiful woman, gambling and there is more than one type of education.Now, this is all fine and dandy but there are other events that are happening at the same time. Stephen wrote a letter requesting assistance to his younger brother (who was in the English army stationed in New York) for assistance in returning to England. Because of the delay in his brothers aide and the timely arrival of \\"bounty hunters\\" to take him back Stephen fears his brother is in league with his kidnappers. There is a shotgun wedding, and a return to England that was expected. I found myself entranced by the fear he would be recaptured and wanting to see him return to England with his new found love for all he had lost.Personally, I was a little TOO glued to the book and there where a couple of twists that (had I come up for air) in my reading probably would have expected (but did not). So if you happen to come across this book, I hope you will enjoy it as there are plenty of things that happen I desperately want to mention! If you want to read this book by itself I think you would thoroughly enjoy it. However if you read the first book \\"Midnight Bride\\" I think it will give some of the characters more endearing qualities (or disreputable) of the friends and family he has lost."},{"Title":"Midnight Lord","review":"Rate 3.5/5Midnight Lord by Marlene Suson is the second novel of her Midnight Trilogy. The setting of this historical romance is 1741, Virginia Frontier. The story begins with Stephen Wingate, Lord Arlington trying to escape his pursuers. Stephen had endured all the cruelty that fate offered him. He was kidnapped, robbed of his identity, and sold as an indentured servant in the colonies. When luck came his way, he took the opportunity to elude his sadistic master. Before he could reach a cabin he saw, he collapsed from exhaustion.Megan Drake and her younger brother Josh heard the noise outside. When they found Stephen, he was taken inside the cabin and was nursed back to health. Due to his physical appearance and marks on his body from severe whippings, Megan assumed he was a transported convict and not the person he claimed to be. Throughout the story, he tries to convince her that he is a gentleman of the upper class and was given the identity of an English convict.My ThoughtsThe author wrote a captivating story of Stephen falling in love with Megan, despite her lack of beauty. He was thoughtful, hardworking, and he also had a very protective nature. I found Megan rather annoying, especially when Stephen kept trying to convince her of his real identity. She was very doubtful of his fantastical story. \\"Midnight Lord\\" keeps the reader in suspense. Will Stephen be recaptured and returned to his cruel master?This is a light story that will keep you turning the pages to the end.

It is the story of Antoine, a man who purchases his own gravesite at the age of eighteen, and voluntarily moves into the Happy Days retirement home at thirty-five--effectively playing hooky from life.Problem is, the story never goes anywhere. It is filled with fatuous plot twists that are less than interesting, and it is rather hard to care what happens to any of the characters.

The author never actually made it to Belzec; she jumped from a transport en route. What she describes are fairly typical experiences of what a Jew had to go through. She was, I think, in her mid to late thirties when the war started and she, her husband and son fled to the Russian-occupied city of Tarnopol at the start of the war. After the Nazis invaded Tarnopol, Yaffa's entire family was killed one after another and she had to identify the bodies. Caught and placed on a death train, knowing the fate that awaited her there, she jumped off along with almost everyone in her car. From there she made it to Lvov, where a Righteous Gentile hid her until liberation.I wish Yaffa had provided more info as to her family background. She appears to have been an Orthodox Jew from a fairly well-to-do family, and her financial resources were of great help to her survival. After many narrow escapes she became convinced that God himself was looking out for her and intended her to survive.Worth reading, if you can get it -- there aren't too many Jewish memoirs out of Tarnopol and Lvov, simply because there were so few survivors. This book appears to have been privately translated and published and is available in just four U.S. libraries. Incidentally, the paper it's printed on is a kind I've never encountered before -- it has an odd waxy texture and leaves a funny smell on my hands."},{"Title":"School Experiences of Gay and Lesbian Youth: The Invisible Minority (Journal of Gay & Lesbian Social Services Series, Vol 7, No 4)","review":"Mary Harris's \\"School Experiences of Gay and Lesbian Youth\\" presents itself enigmatically. On the surface, I expected a chapter book, shifting from one major issue affecting Gay and Lesbian youth to the next major issue. Interestingly, I soon discovered it to be more like a mini-textbook, a collection of articles from distinct authors in diverse parts of the United States. Consequently, it was a bittersweet read, because I felt like Harris could have very well unified and commented on some of the overlapping concerns present throughout all of the articles. On the other hand, it was encouraging to have some literature addressing issues based on \\"sexual minorities.\\" As a result, I mentioned the word \\"enigmatically\\" because the volume adjusted itself from percentages and studies, to provocative expressions and voices of struggle. For example, some articles focused on the diverse negative experiences and behaviors these youth resorted to, including transferring schools, dropping out, use of drugs and alcohol and the number of suicide attempts. It also presents a number of diverse percentages, including the percentage of gay/lesbian students according to their race/ethnicity, the percentage of students who faced positive experiences and those who faced negative experiences. In these instances, it was a collection, rather than a stimulation. By contrast, in those instances when the voices of those sexually oppressed students are heard, it infuses anger, and immerses the war cries of justice. It was overwhelming to witness how many, if not the majority of these students are academically brilliant, only to face dead end options at the hands of oppressive, segregating institutions.Despite being a descriptively slim volume, it is nonetheless, an important book. The articles relate some of the unfortunate circumstances that lead many gay and lesbian students towards undesirable decisions. In school cultures where homophobic attitudes are held by the majority, an educational, academic environment becomes nothing more than a hostile environment. As a result, sexual minorities are deeply threatened and resort to disoriented actions. Also, it is no secret that many role models, teachers, counselors, principals, are irrational, narrow-minded and in many instances, simply cruel and discriminatory. Harris's, book expresses the voices of sexual minorities and their frustrations in reaching out to these illusionary campus leaders. In fact, it is inflamingly uplifting and displaceable to read how teachers, counselors and principals perceived the act of being gay, particularly addressing it as a \\"passing\\" phase, or ignoring it altogether. Here, I credit the book with a provocative stance. In fact, it is in those very moments when these credible youth express themselves that the book is at its most valuable.There are rare instances where these students relate some of the positive experiences in schools, and in these instances the reader may very well feel a sense of hope and support. However, change is more apparent when people feel like the well falls no deeper, when the patriarchal system overtly privileges those who need little privileging while oppressing those students who find themselves at wits end. In essence, Harris's text accounts for those themes of social alienation that are highly disregarded and consciously overlooked.The book will enlighten anyone who reads it, but I would deem it essential for educators, counselors, principals and all individuals working in today's schools. As open or as liberal as the topic of sexual minorities may seem, it is inevitably a hidden discourse when peering into the lives of gay and lesbian youth."},{"Title":"School Experiences of Gay and Lesbian Youth: The Invisible Minority (Journal of Gay & Lesbian Social Services Series, Vol 7, No 4)","review":"School Experiences of Gay and Lesbian Youth: The Invisible Minority is a 1997 anthology by Mary Harris consisting of 7 research articles about the experiences of adolescents in US schools. The chapters deal with gay and lesbian youth career decision making issues, disclosure vs. non-disclosure issues, homophobic and heterosexist attitudes as experienced by the victims and perpetrators, gay and lesbian adults remembering their coming out experiences, and school responses to the needs of Gays and lesbians.The title itself is very revealing. It tells the reader that gay and lesbian youth are invisible. In other words, nobody wants to acknowledge them or deal with the problems that they face. The research in the book suggests that while some adults are sympathetic to these adolescents, many, including their parents treat the issue as a phase that will pass and suggest to gays and lesbians that they work towards overcoming \\"their problem\\". Other adults may suggest that gays and lesbians keep their choice to themselves. Little do these adults know that they are inflicting psychological harm to children who already deal with the fact that they are considered social rejects. And because of their invisibility, the possibility of finding peers facing the same issues, and educated teachers and other school professionals that can properly guide them and advise them is slim.This book allows readers to see the tremendous loneliness, suffering and misperceptions that gay and lesbian youth must contend with. It suggests that public schools must create adequate and safe spaces for gays and lesbians, and educate staff and students to respect everybody's gender identity. Unfortunately, while this may be possible in some schools and communities, most public schools in the US are not ready to seriously address issues of gays and lesbians. In fact, the preferred approach has been to adopt the military's \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" policy. Unfortunately this approach continues to relegate gays and lesbians to a marginalized status, face, harassment, discrimination and physical and psychological harm.Since the book was published in 1997, there has been a little more openness about GLBTQ issues in the US thanks to the work of activists, and some public figures that have disclosed their gender preferences in the media. However, the status of GLBTQ remains considerably marginalize and GLBTQ continue to experience extreme discrimination, harassment, psychological and physical harm. At this point in time, this book can hopefully lead people to dialogue about the issue and create more awareness.The book has some shortcomings. The main one is that the data samples in the articles are often too small to draw experimentally valid conclusions about experiences of gays and lesbians. The small data samples reflect the fact that non-disclosure is the preferred policy of this minority and finding subjects willing to participate in research is very tough. Yet, those minimally familiar with GLBTQ know that even if the data samples are not large enough to draw experimentally valid conclusions, the conclusions drawn by the authors seem accurate.Another issue that requires more exploration is the fact that GLBTQ are not a monolithic group. Aside from having marginalized gender identities, they belong to various cultural, religious, economic and ethnic groups that may compound their problems. In other words, GLBTQ can be rich, middle-class or poor, White, Black, Hispanic, Christian, Muslim, Atheist, Buddhist, Asian, Jewish, etc. Coming out and living within the plurality of groups deserve additional research."},{"Title":"Discovery: The Autobiography of Vilhjalmur Stefansson","review":"What a story of survival in the Arctic!

However, it's still fully functional, listing the 3 persons verb tables in their 6 available tenses, as well as the 7 patterns of Hebrew verb root changes. Neither the 3 persons singular or plural are labled with subject headings, and it assumes previous user experience, unlike the 501. This will be confusing for the beginner (including me!), but they seem to be listed orderly. In the beginning is a detailed introduction to the Hebrew verb system given by the author. The verb indexes in the back are helpful as well as exhaustive.The previous reviewer suggests buying the 501, but I caution this. It is crammed full of info, and is a very hefty book at over 900 pages, this being held together by a mere softcover. That's why I bought the 201. It has a softcover too, but only 425 pages.

It became a major text in the Mahayana tradition.I read the actual prose edition of it, and was very impressed with Shantideva's skillful use of logic and his conclusions of how one should live and practice. The wisdom chapter is notable in particular, for its explications of some core doctrines that can be confusing (such as anatman or no-self). I decided to read a commentary on it in order to clarify some questions I had and to gain new insight into what it was he was saying.I picked up a copy of this book, and was fairly impressed by it. Some parts of it struck me as redundant and repetitive, but it could be argued that such repetition is important to planting wholesome seeds in the reader's head. Still, I think it would have benefited from omitting such parts.There are also some sections which make some fairly remarkable assertions (notably a discussion of reincarnation) and which attempt unsuccessfully (IMO) to support them with logic.There are a few other commentaries out there, such as the Dalai Lama's and Pema Chodron's. I have read neither, but the Dalai Lama's book would be worth checking out, as he is skilled at writing for the modern Western mind, and it is also maybe half the length of this book."},{"Title":"Conversations with Ernest Hemingway (Literary Conversations)","review":"I'm a big Hemingway fan, and have liked other volumes in this &quot;Conversations with&quot; series.

Unless you're a beginner with Hemingway, there's very little of interest here, except perhaps Hemingway's remark that he writes every novel as though he were going to die afterwards.

His extensive research, which led to the first version of this work published in 1988, was derived from archived records in Israel, England, the United States and the United Nations. Given the lapse of time since 1948 he found oral recollections inadequate and of dubious reliability. There is a torrent of detail in the book and there are hundreds of endnotes following each chapter.Many readers will be shocked by the numerous detailed descriptions of the violence exercised on Palestinian non-combatants by Zionist forces. Even the most pro-Zionist readers will no longer be able to deny that a massive ethnic cleansing occurred in 1948. In fact, there are repeated references to \\"cleansing\\" in orders given to Haganah units, sometimes explicitly giving instructions to kill adult males, expel the women and children and destroy their homes to prevent return. Often units were not faced with the onerous task of killing and expelling because the Arabs had fled in anticipation of violence. The infamous massacre at Deir Yassin was not unique; Morris states that there were some 20 massacres, two of which were revealed for the first time in the 1988 version of this book.About 700,000 persons (Morris's estimate) were displaced beyond the boundary of the part of Palestine allotted to the new state of Israel and beyond the additional area taken by Zionist arms. Figure 2 in the book is a map with some 392 numbered dots representing the Palestinian villages evacuated and destroyed. The legend to the map gives the Arab names of these former villages with estimates of the motivation for their abandonment.Morris recognizes that the motivation for Arab flight varied among different segments of the Palestinian population. In December 1947 and early 1948 the exodus began when those of the upper classes who had resources fled to safety in Arab cities outside Palestine. The loss of actual and potential leaders undermined Palestinian morale, already suffering deep divisions from the 1936-39 revolt against British rule. In spring 1948, Haganah, Irgun and Stern Gang operations began to terrorize the Arab population, and the massive outflow of all classes began. (Menachem Begin boasts in his book, Revolt, that without the instructive example of the Deir Yassin massacre by his Irgun boys there would be no Israel.) Murder, raping and looting by Jewish combatants shocked both Arabs and many Jews who witnessed it.Morris could find no evidence for the often-repeated claim that Arab leaders broadcast appeals to Palestinians to leave their homes to expedite the killing of Jews by Arab forces. The appeals from the largely feckless Arab leaders were contradictory and had little effect.Morris that argues that forced expulsion and destruction of homes and villages was not pre-planned by Zionist leaders, saying that Plan D of the Haganah, which prescribed exactly such measures, was not implemented until April 1948 in anticipation of attack by surrounding Arab states after the British leaving on May 15. He believes that it was opportunism driven by events, the seizing of a one-time chance to cleanse the new state of Arabs. Arabs, and some other Israeli historians, believe it was pre-planned. I'm not sure that there is an ethical difference whether ethnic cleansing was pre-planned or improvised. Certainly the idea of transfer of Arabs from Palestine was rife in Zionist circles before partition and Morris includes a chapter documenting this thinking.On the Zionist left voices were raised against the policy and there are diary entries of horrified Jewish observers, one of whom concluded, \\" I hide my face in shame.\\" However, David Ben-Gurion kept national unity intact by being careful not to expose in writing any draconian intentions and by telling different things to different people. In the case of the violent wholesale expulsions from Lydda and Ramle, a hand gesture to his staff conveyed his real intention.The Israelis were so taken with the success of Arab removal that they adopted a resolute policy of no return of the refugees. United Nations Moderator Count Folke Bernadotte was dismayed that Jews with their history of persecution would themselves act so unjustly. Morris reports a conversation in which Bernadotte was trying to persuade Moshe Sharett, then Israel's Foreign Minister, to make at least a gesture of conciliation by allowing a partial return. Sharett replied that such idealism had no place in a world dominated by men of action (such as himself, presumably), and that Israel would be regarded as foolish by such men if it discarded the favorable situation created by war. A day after the release of Bernadotte's report on refugees, men of action from the Stern Gang murdered him.This is not a history of the 1948 war, but Morris in summary blames the victims for their disastrous fate because, \\"They started the war\\", certainly a contentious conclusion considering that the refugees were mostly non-combatants, and furthermore had no voice in the partitioning of their country.It appears to this reader that Morris makes a strong case that the refugees were victims of Zionist drives for exclusivity and expansion of territory. As an historian Morris deserves great credit for his diligence in bringing light to this dark event whose legacy still troubles the region. An IDF intelligence officer observing the pathetic stream of refugees fleeing Lydda wrote, Occasionally you encountered a piercing look from one of the youngsters in the column, and the look said, \\"We have not surrendered. We shall return to fight you.\\""},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"The strength of this book lies in its meticulous detail and the thorough research of its author. Even after two decades this work still stands as one of the most important books to cover the beginnings of the refugee problem. It is authoritative and very detailed.Whether you agree with Mr. Morris or not, his book is a must read for any serious student of Israel, the conflict or the Middle East in general. I also feel that it is a testament to the evenhandedness of the author that the work has been derided by both camps. Only an honest attempt at analysis could make both sides so unhappy.The book starts out with a brief history of the region before partition, and then moves along chronologically from the early ideas of population transfer through the war and ends with the last cease fire and the following negotiations. The main chapters are based chronologically, but within the chapters they are broken up geographically. This allows the author to focus in on each location the experienced a demographic change. With great detail the author explains each transfer, and gives the reader a detailed analysis of why these people left. This is one of the big problems in trying to understand the birth of the refugee problem. There was a great variety of reasons why these people left their villages and cities. Some were told to leave by the authorities, some were explicitly forced out by the IDF, others left out of fear, and others left due to stories of atrocities and rumors of atrocities. This is the crux of the problem that was tackled by the author in this work, why each group of refugees left. The author structured his book perfectly to give readers the most detailed analysis of why each group left each specific area. He gives the Israeli response to each exodus, and gives an account of Israeli actions that may have precipitated that flight out of design and sometimes as an unintended consequence.Whether pro-Israel, pro-Palestinian or just someone trying to make sense out of this complicated area, Mr Morris' work is essential reading. It is a definitive work on the refugee problem. If you are interested in this topic you can't skip on this work.With that said I did have some major problems with the book. The way it was structured had some major benefits, but also some major drawbacks as well. The problem with structuring the work around each geographic location rather than using chronology is that it creates only isolated pictures of each location. Instead of understanding each exodus on the macro level the reader sees only the micro. This allows the author to go into great detail, but it also minimizes what was happening all over the country, and how those happenings affected the other areas. The author had to make a decision of how to structure this book, and he was going to encounter problems however he went about it so I don't take off for that, but I feel it incumbent to air my problems.Next I have never in my life encountered a work with so many brackets. They were everywhere. It seemed that almost every quote of any appreciable length would invariably contain at least one change made by the author. I can certainly see how Mr. Morris has opened himself up to charges of misquoting and taking things out of context. On page 558 Morris quotes Ethridge's view that Israel was \\"unwilling to negotiate\\", but Mr. Morris inserts that they were \\"unwilling to [meaningfully] negotiate\\". This simple addition by Morris changes the context of the quote quite a bit. I feel that the author used his discretion in good faith, and I don't feel that he knowingly attempted to mislead anywhere in his book, but the practice lends itself to criticism. The book would have been much better if this practice had not been so pervasive.Lastly the author's strength lies in his ability to research, but not so much in his writing style. The book is very dry which makes the length demonstrably harder to cope with. With that said, the book is a labor of love. If you are a history person then you have coped with dry reads before. If you are generally interested in the area then you have come across plenty of agenda driven works so that this one will be a breath of fresh air. While this book may be criticized by the extreme pro-Israel crowd that refuse to accept responsibility for even one refugee, and it may be criticized by the extreme pro-Palestinian crowd who want to see the Israelis as merciless, monsters killing all they could lay their hands, if you are a neutral observer just trying to understand this topic then this is the book for you. It isn't an easy read, but it is well worth the effort. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"A very thorough and detailed examination of the events surrounding the departure of the Arab community from the British Mandate territory of Palestine. At times, this book reads like a diary with very specific references to dates and times when particular events occured. A knowledge of the geography of the area, and a background in the political events unfolding at the time would be helpful in deciphering the numerous figures and reference points. Morris does succeed in conveying the variety of conflicting forces at play during this time and how they converged to create what was truly a chaotic situation for all parties in nascent Arab-Israeli conflict."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"This seminal book, an updated version of the original published in 1988, might have been better edited. It contains several repetitions, plus, weighs down the casual reader with far too many examples and details. Much better would have been to give the essential story, and to have added an appendix containing all additional examples and details that the more avid history buffs would indeed want included.That said, the importance of this book simply cannot be overstated. It documents, with crystal-clear and unassailable clarity, what caused 700,000 Palestinians to be displaced in 1947-48. And no honest observer, after reading this volume, could deny the bone-fide case Palestinians have against Israel - even though, as the book also constantly points out, the fledgling Jewish state was emotionally and materially unable to carry out a more just policy.This has much bearing on the political situation today. For one, it means it is totally unrealistic to look for a peace solution where Palestine formally recognizes Israel - a different model (perhaps along the lines of the Bermigo Plan) will need to be found. And second, the historical record, which this book so ably sets out, shames the kneejerk, self-righteous rightwing and center-right Jewish organizations who present the conflict as a tug of war between the eminently reasonable (the Israelis) and totally unreasonable (the Palestinians). The truth is far, far more complex.Finally, let readers differentiate between this completely apolitical and superbly researched historical volume, and Professor Benny Morris's personal political views - some of which are quite whacky. He is certainly not the first professor or top-rank researcher to present his findings - and then advise on a policy that his own findings scoff at."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"Morris is a unique seeker of truth and a punctilious historian and scholar who is not encumbered with the usual agenda that accompanies the vast majority of writers on this topic.Interestingly, Morris, an Israeli historian, is frequently quoted by Arab and anti-Israeli authors and sources, such as, the pseudo-academic, Norman Finkelstein, most often entirely out of context (as one examines the quotes), and he provides a breathtaking perspective of truth that embodies the absolute pathos of the dramatic history of this region, in stark contrast to the various fantasies that have been generated by both sides of the conflict.This book is an absolute must for any true student of this conflict"},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"In short, this book, by precisely detailing the exact origins of the Palestinian crisis-town by town-,holds Israel at least partially or perhaps fully responsible for the refugee crisis and, by implication, the entire war on terrorism. It has particular impact because Benny Morris is a tenured Jewish Israeli scholar and therefore cannot be summerly dismissed as anti-Semitic. Moreover it makes us wonder why it is that America, despite virtually no international support, came to so blindly enable and supply Israeli aggression rather than to support, with an easily assembled and very powerful international coalition, an imposed wall or peace fence at the UN established and internationally recognized 1948 or 1967 borders. The book is a long, detailed, and fully footnoted 600 pages, but if it makes us wonder if we should rethink or, more accurately, be brave enough to think for the first time about Israel and the war on terrorism, then it is well worth every page.

Given this contention, I ultimately intend to revisit the original work, in order to properly assess the current edition. Until then, let me just say that I found the original monograph to be well researched, convincing and, all in all, a must read for anyone intrigued by or otherwise invested in the tumultuous, dyadic history of Israel and Palestine. Interested parties would be well advised to seek out an older copy of the work in a large public or academic library."},{"Title":"The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited (Cambridge Middle East Studies)","review":"This book is an important book for sure; first it talks about the massacres the Israelis committed in 1947/1948, and indirectly shows the systematical methods the Israelis used to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians. This is well documented in Illan pappe's book The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine, and in the documentary film \\"The Sons of Eilaboun\\" ( http://www.SonsOfEilaboun.com )My problem with this book is the one sided research. The only source the author of the book uses, is Israeli documents, and interviews with Israeli soldiers that served in that time. The author did not use any Palestinian sources. Actually that does not surprise me at all knowing the authors extreme right Zionist views.Another problem with the book, it is full of factual mistakes, for example in the book he writes that Eilaboun (Eilabun ) is a Maronite Christian village, and the village was formed of two Christian communities, Catholic and Orthodox Christians, non of them was maronite Christian in the village. The second point, he claims that the heads of two Israelis were found in one of the houses in the village. And that is a complete nonsense. According to the UN report and to the documentary above, the heads were brought by the Arab forces to the village, and the villagers buried the head out of respect. According to the Israeli documents and to the UN report, the event happened in the summer, and the Israelis captured Eilaboun in 30 October, That makes the claim of the book that the heads were found in one of the houses ridicules. Was the mistake written to justify the massacre the Israelis committed in Eilaboun? or was it just a mistake?

M. Forster","review":"The other reviewer of this book completely missed the point of the story. THE CELESTIAL OMNIBUS is about the liberation of the Soul through Art, and is not meant to be a religious text at all. A young boy in a prosaic middle class suburb catches a glimpse of something otherworldly in an alley--an omnibus that travels 'To Heaven'. This is not the religious Heaven but the infinite world of the imagination. Great literature literally provides an escape for the boy, who has a poet's soul and is ridiculed for it by his family and their friends. In their view, Literature and Poetry exist only on library shelves, bound in red leather. It is the neighbor, who only concentrates on the physical manifestation of the writings, who 'dies on the earth' since he confuses the end with the means. It is more important to feel the spirit of a great writer than to worry about the binding on their books, while never understanding their meaning. The other stories in this collection are also memorable and deal with living the quiet life and leaving the rat race--in one case, literally. This is one of the most inspirational collections of short stories ever written and it is a shame that it is out of print."},{"Title":"The Celestial Omnibus and Other Stories by E. M.

The mature wanderer knows that you cannot demand the country change itself for you, but that one must adapt to the country to discover its riches and wonders. True enjoyment takes work.There truly are riches and wonders in this collection of six short stories, but to appreciate their essence, one is going to have to give up the hard boiled cynicism of the 21st century and embrace the romance, mystery, and pure wonder of fin de si&egrave;cle Great Britain. The mature reader who will let Forster speak for himself is surely in for a treat. In these tales you will meet a spoiled young man whose life is changed by a visit from an ancient god (The Story of a Panic), question whether life is a rat race or maybe something more (The Other Side of the Hedge). If you are willing to pay for the ticket, you'll visit a land where the works of great authors (if not the authors themselves) have a Heaven all their own (The Celestial Omnibus) and that classic myths can be repeated again and again (Other Kingdom) to great tragic effect. You'll also meet an irreverent faun who becomes the best friend of a reverent clergyman (The Curate's Friend) and discover that the call to wonder can be found in the strangest places (The Road from Colonus) as well as the price that must be paid to ignore it.So pack your bags and get ready for a trip.

I work in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, and the previous edition, which only claimed to cover Japanese, was still the most useful book on Chinese and Korean info processing that I ever found. With this new edition, the author has extended coverage to all Asian languages that use Chinese characters, or used to do so in the case of Vietnamese, as part of their writing systems.Thank goodness he has. The author, Ken Lunde, has an encyclopedic knowledge of this material. In addition, he is one of those people to whom anything less than strict, literal correctness is intolerable. Authors of this sort usually write in a style reminiscent of the federal tax code. Lunde manages to avoid this, creating one of those rare and delightful computer books that serve as a lucid tutorial the first time through, and as a strict and comprehensive reference thereafter.The principal reason I consider this book the bible for Asian language information processing is the extreme difficulty of getting most of this information via any other source. In fact, I'd be hard pressed to think of another computer book whose original source material is as scattered, poorly documented, and often unreliable as that Lunde had to gather to produce this book. His job of ferreting out the details, cross-checking, error correction, and organization into a single book makes this almost a work of journalism. If you do CJKV work, you'll need more than just this book, of course, but the book is full of references to other material, so this is the place to start.Lunde also provides a lot of usable source code in the book. This is not unusual in a computer book, but this code is special in two ways. First, it's available in C, Java, and Perl, not just in C. This is refreshing, given the increasingly prominent roles played by Java and Perl on the Internet--the place where multilingual computing arguably matters most.Second, his code serves as a great checklist for what has to be done by any similar code. This is one of those difficult types of programming where many bugs aren't easy to see, because of the large number of obscure &quot;gotchas&quot; and arcane details. Lunde doesn't miss much, and he revels in these arcane details. His code is not highly optimized, and he admits as much, but if his code does something, you need to do it, and if it doesn't, you (probably) don't need to, either. This fact alone justifies the cost of the book for any developer to whom bugs might have financial consequences.If you're going to do CJKV work, this is the bible.

But if you have only iconv and no knowledge on the East Asian background, you will not have enough confidence (and skills) to develop a proper software application. This book will demystify Chinese, Japanese, Korean & Vietnamese computing for you and will give you good start!"},{"Title":"CJKV Information Processing","review":"This book is an excellent guide to the pitfalls to avoid when doing software internationalization. Most books on the subject will warn you about the unwritten assumptions in coding for a single human language. This one also warns you about the many places you may be assuming that your characters are each 1 byte in length. Some of these are obvious enough, such as actual declarations. Some are subtler, such as regular expressions being one byte off in matching multibyte characters.If you are involved in software internationalization, buy this book. Even if you aren't shipping a product to Asia yet, it will save you from writing code that is just to painful to modify for multibyte character sets."},{"Title":"CJKV Information Processing","review":"I agree with all the postive comments posted here. Working in Japan, this book has saved me repeatedly.But I have a serious concern about the size, of 1000 pages there are 400 pages of tables, huge lists of Chinese characters which are of very little value and makes the book difficult to use."},{"Title":"CJKV Information Processing","review":"The programming world owes Ken Lunde a debt of gratitude for his masterful book on issues of internationalization.The information he has gathered is not easily found and it is indispensible.Internationalization is one of the hardest of all computer problems.

So I cannot help but assume that if I had the patience to figure out how to use it properly it would be worthwhile. BUT...Being somebody already reasonably familiar with using eastern languages on a computer, I have no desire to read the text in the book from the beginning. The majority of the book is code-page tables, which is an important reference. (They are actually of limited utility, since they are only indexed one way: code to character, with no reverse indexing. Understandable, since that would be very difficult, but still limiting.)But worst of all, the code page tables are laid out in a way that I do not understand. And I could not find an explanation of how these tables corresponded to byte-values in a data stream."},{"Title":"CJKV Information Processing","review":"Why amazon.com do not provide order for the Chinese version of &quot;CJKV Information Processing&quot;?

Many of the photos in this book also are displayed at the Monteverde Cloud Forest Reserve, near Santa Elena, in Central Costa Rica. Anyone who has been to a Central or South American rain forest or cloud forest will enjoy the ecological explanations -- similar to briefer explanations by guia naturalistas (guides) in the reserves -- and will especially enjoy the dramatic photos. Those who haven't visited the forest in person may be motivated to do so."},{"Title":"Portraits of the Rainforest","review":"This is an awesome pictorial with great editorial book that is awesome to read or simply thumb through to view some of the most beautiful rainforest's the world has to offer. Perfect for schools, to show kids who may have never been to or seen a rainforest what they are & why we need to protect them.Very young children will understand when explained the importance all rainforest's have for human survival, not to mention the survival of unique flora & fauna.This book would be helpful to science classes of all ages and teachers should have no problem creating study guides and exercises from it.Do not get me wrong, this book is perfect for adults too, makes a fantastic coffee table book for your guests to flip through. And would look striking on the coffee table of any home!I do not think anyone who purchases this would be disappointed. It is such a lovely book and simply gorgeous to view!"},{"Title":"Portraits of the Rainforest","review":"Many a showy coffee-table natural history book comes up short of the author's reputation and the price, but not this one. Having myself been privileged to spend some time hiking the cloud-forest trails at Monteverde, I can say that this exceptionally good book by a true authority is of surpassing virtue. The photographs are of flawlessly superior quality, and the writing is absolutely superb. Whether you ever witness a rainforest firsthand or not, you should read and learn from the beautiful synthesis that is this top-notch book."},{"Title":"Portraits of the Rainforest","review":"I was very fortunate to find a used copy from the library. The pictures are not only remarkable but the information included make it very valuable. The truth hurts and there is plenty of facts in here about how we as a people are destroying our Earth. If this book moves one person to care about the effects of their actions.. then maybe it's served its purpose."},{"Title":"Time Closets","review":"From the first sentence, this book gets your rapt attention as it propels you along on a journey through monsters of the mind and heart. Especially frightening are the childhood gremlins we all have faced (open closet door, dark void under the bed, etc). But this story also chronicles the universal struggle between good and bad in the persons of two men who have unknowlingly battled for centuries. Though the book is relatively short in length, it packs a terrific punch which left me wanting more."},{"Title":"Sonnets to Orpheus Bilingual Edition","review":"The Sonnets to Orpheus was written by Rilke over a few days' period during his winter visit to Switzerland. It came to form almost magically, &quot;with no doubts in any of the words&quot; in Rilke's introduction.The Sonnets tell the classical Greek tragedy of Orpheus, who with his gift of music on the lyre charmed death to give his love back from the underworld, only to lose her forever when he broke his promise and looked back to see if she was still with him.This work is considered an interesting development in German poetry because of its improvisational creativity of the author, and is difficult to translate because of the liberties taken in the writing. In my opinion this translation is best one to date: in contrast to the popular translation by M. D. Herter Norton, which strived for accuracy at the cost of eloquence.Charming, entertaining, bittersweet, and always the contradiction between optimism and tragedy in a fatalistic touch, this is one of my favourite literary work to date."},{"Title":"Sonnets to Orpheus Bilingual Edition","review":"Edward Snow, who has earned multiple awards for his translations, applies his gift to the original German poems written almost a century ago by master poet Rainer Maria Rilke in Sonnets To Orpheus. A bilingual German/English edition each poem in both languages on every two-page spread, Sonnets To Orpheus resonates with introspective contemplation on the finality of time, transition, change, and death; Rilke wrote it only four years before his own passing. A classic work that remains vividly relevant today. Does it really exist, Time the Destroyer? / When, on the peaceful mountain, does it crush the fortress? / And this heart, always the gods' possession, / when does the Demiurge pillage it?"},{"Title":"Sonnets to Orpheus Bilingual Edition","review":"Rilke is generally regarded as Romantic so the use of \\"mystic\\" in describing this work slightly misuses terms. But I use it to describe his \\"inspired\\" groping towards something \\"beyond\\". This specific translation may not appeal to everyone as it is firmly couched within the academic style of its period, and being thirty-eight years removed from the original publication, admirably expresses the original's language. C.F. MacIntyre's introduction is both scholarly and contextualizing, de-mystifying Rilke's prophetic-like \\"entrustment\\" of these songs by linking them up to a larger contemporary literary context."},{"Title":"Using Visual Interdev 6 (Special Edition Using...)","review":"The book is a mess.

It's goal is admirable, but its content doesn't let it reach the goal. I would guess that most developers like me want to buy a book that's going to cut down the learning curve (without having to pay $1K for a class). But if you want to get anything out of the book, you have to do the work. The examples seem to skip steps and don't take into consideration what is and isn't installed on the client and/or server.

An 1800s Wyoming rancher, Will Sherman, visits his sister in New York to cope with the death of his 19-year-old son from a horse accident. He is accosted by a young Irish street thug in a robbery attempt. After coldcocking the young man, he suggests to the judge that the young man, Tom Callaghan, be sentenced to work on Will's ranch for a year. They depart New York for the wide open spaces. Tough Tom finds more than he can deal with between Will's headstrong daughter, Ellen, and a developing range war. The reckoning comes between Tom and the range war enemies of his benefactor.The author is a very competent writer. The plot was excellent, leaving the reader hanging until the very last sentence. The pace moved quickly and setting, characters and dialogue were most descriptive and unique.

I wasn't disappointed with the book and again found it packed with useful information, and important time and money saving tips. this edition looks as if it too will prove invaluable to me as I find my way around America and the Americans.

There were a lot of prejudices and distorted views (most Swiss are rich, the country is sort of made of chocolate, banks and cheese, etc.), but there were so many practical information not easily found elsewhere in the country. With this new title the good practical information is now almost completely lost among his prejudices and negative views of America. The book will certainly almost scare the naive reader. The data is not always accurate and he seemed to have ignored the current economic boom in America (albeit his updated version). Worse, he seems to be totally ignorant of many aspects of life and work in America and of the American society itself. He has now also written books about buying homes in some southern European countries and about living and working in Australia and Britain (Canada was skipped...). Hopefully the good things of his Switzerland book will prevail somewhere in his writing, while the others will eventually disappear. Yet this one book on America shows quite the opposite.

However when you reach the sections on American culture it is very easy to find out biases creeping out of the book. These comments are written from a largely British or Commonwealth perspective (which is not surprising since Mr Hampshire himself is British). In the assessment about the American electoral system Mr Hampshire thinks the (continental) European proportional representative system is superior to &quot;Winners take all&quot; system that America uses. Ironically in his home country the Parliament (forget the Scottish and Welsh assemblies) is elected using the &quot;First past the post&quot; system - which is identical to the American electoral system.The bottom line is: provided you are from New Zealand, Australia or Britain have a look at this book. If you are from countries with minimal British cultural heritage such as Russia, Germany, Indonesia or Taiwan, forget it.

Let's just get that fact out of the way so that you won't be dissapointed when you open this novel and find the complex, multifaceted and realistic portrayal of the Grateful Dead scene that serves as the backdrop to this story.The primary reason to read this book is for the characters. Melanie, the brassy one-armed runaway, is unique to the world of fiction, and counters Jason's charming naivety and wide-eyed trust in fate with her cunning and wit. Also serving as a foil to Jason is the ever-hacking Harry, who beneath the surly quips and malcontented one-liners is a generous and complicated man who never quite figured out what to do with himself, but left an interesting past trying. This novel explores the issues of loyalty and dependence among characters who are living in a universe in which there is no reliable moral yardstick, but who manage to maintain their sense of humanity regardless."},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"Max Ludington has written a remarkable book in \\"Tiger in a Trance,\\" his insiders look into the cult of the Grateful Dead.There are lines that stopped me cold in this book, such as in the scene where the protagonist, Jason, has just administered a hit of killer dope and immediately makes for the toilet. \\"I read the legend inscribed at the top of the porcelain bowl: American Standard. I nodded my head, feeling, as LSD had taught me sometimes to feel, that wisdom was being imparted to me in ways I was only occasionally aware of.\\"One gets the feeling of what it was to be \\"on tour\\" during the mid \`80s with the Dead. The drab sameness of American cities, the phenomena of a Hartford or a Worcester being transformed into a special place for the two days the Dead were in town, then returning to its mundane 9 to 5 existence. Ludington successfully renders the time and place perfectly in this book as he, quite believably, traces Jason's descent from rather privileged Deadhead lifestyle into serious drug use and the dangers that lifestyle entails. When Jason loses his pal Randy (who made their way through the tours selling t-shirts), he loses his moral compass - a point that is made clear late in the book when Jason remembers driving with Randy years before, heading to another Dead show at Alpine Valley, when a perfectly rendered bluegrass gospel song comes on the radio: \\"We listened not looking at each other, trying to contain the charge arcing between the music and the green triumph of the Iowa summer. We didn't talk about it afterward. The song ended and Randy shut off the radio, and we let it dissipate for a few miles.\\"I saw the Dead a number of times during the years Ludington describes and I can readily attest to the changes in the scene as the years went by, such as when \\"Touch of Grey\\" became so big and brought with it a lot of newcomers - I experienced this up in Maine at the Oxford Speedway shows - and the disappointing (to Deadheads, anyway) Dylan/Dead series of concerts. I never went \`on tour' and only saw the Dead when they came my way (and never after Brent died) - so \\"Tiger in a Trance\\" gave me a good idea as to what was going on in the lives of all these people that I would see, that seemed to have found something in life worth getting excited about - no small feat in the America of the \`80s.What I was hoping for in this book, and did not quite get, was some examination of why the music of the Grateful Dead was able to take over the lives of so many people - why no other band had ever inspired people to changes their lives. I think I found the answer in a book on an entirely different topic when I read the following passage and the Deadheads I mixed with immediately came to mind: \\"Attended by a motley crew of men and women who were shockingly ordinary, unremarkable for intellectual acumen, social grace, wit or quickness...\\"This description of first followers of Jesus, written by Donald Spoto in his book \\"The Hidden Life of Jesus,\\" to me perfectly describes the fans of the Grateful Dead. When I ran into this passage in Spoto's book, it brought to mind a nascent thought that was beginning to gather steam - that Jerry Garcia was, in many ways, an American Jesus. Just as Christ's followers followed him from place to place to hear him preach, so did the Deadheads follow the Grateful Dead (mostly for Jerry) from place to place, hoping for the band's alchemy to spark and provide that window from which they would achieve a moment of grace, an awakening of the spirit within them, as a group, however fleeting it may have been (or fueled by the intake of narcotics).America changed significantly when Jerry died. Something vital in its spirit was cauterized, and we will not likely see its like again in our lifetime. The magic of the Dead was the magic that is found in rare moments - when things suddenly come together and life makes sense, and the good Dead moments provided this magic in a way that is completely ineffable. The Grateful Dead played primarily to an audience that was, for the most part, incapable of examining closely what is was they were experiencing. They just knew when it was there and when it was not, and were very grateful for those moments when it was there.Music alone provides the means be which we may get a glimpse of the spiritual nature that we know is inside of us (and which is buried entirely by the impedimenta of our day-to-day lives) and the Dead, despite their lapses and faults, were the only vehicle providing this window of opportunity for the masses. Bless the Deadheads, for they were the true seekers of our times, and Ludington's book gets close to nailing what is was like inside this peculiarly American quest for enlightenment."},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"Max Ludington can write. The book is filled with quick and vivid descriptions. He also can handle a back and forth plotline. The story? Meh. A preppie deadhead quits school, hits succesive GD tours, meets women, loses friends, gets smack habit.

Come to think of it, it is one of the best novels I have read period. Not only does the author have a beautiful command of the poetic possibilities of prose, but his characters and scenes are so finely etched that they burn in the imagination. The material that takes place at Dead shows is wonderfully handled; beautifully written and unsentimental. The second half of the book takes a dark turn but it is fully realized and totally satisfying. Once I picked it up I could not put this book down. There is a sense of strangeness and mystery in this novel (especially in the last half) that only the best writers can capture. I highly recomend this book to anyone interested in compulsively readable serious literature."},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"So, I actually know the author Max Luddington, and at times we ran in the same circles during the Grateful Dead days. While a lot of the characters in his book are fictional, there are a few who are based on real people who we both knew. The others could have easily been people who we knew. Max did an amazing job of capturing the spontaneity of life living on the road following the Grateful Dead, the community, and how many of us transitioned from psychedelics into using harder drugs. It was fun and sometimes very painful reading this book as it brought back a lot of memories of the life I used to live that was amazing and full of light at times, but also skirted life and death and became much darker in the end. I am not sure how Max was able to remember so many details as this life is very foggy to me, but he did so with a very rich writing style. While I had a specific reason for reading this book, I do think that other readers who have a passion for music and enjoy learning about interesting subcultures would find this book a very interesting read."},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"It's a first novel, with many of the characteristics of such books--a fascination with late adolescence, a romanticization of young infatuation and sexuality, a desire to provide a cautionary tale. Ludington isn't the real thing--yet. His plot is far from original, and the characters don't really live; many of the names pass through, like faces you might see at a Dead show, identifiable only by one major quirk (she's one-armed, he's from Philly, he shoots heroin). I suspect Ludington wanted to capture the swirl of people that buzzed around &quot;tour.&quot; Pynchon's short story &quot;Entropy&quot; achieves this effect in a more condensed fashion.Where the novel is good, though, is where it looks to its models (Whitman and Kerouac, especially). Ludington has a nice ability to get lyrical about landscape, about experience, even about drug highs. I'd like to see a more interior novel from him eventually; this would play to his strengths. It's a road novel, and though the road part of it gets old (except for Deadheads, perhaps, who might be able to nod knowingly at the names of civic arenas) the narration of the experience of being on the road is appealing.Ultimately, this novel is quite promising but rarely transcends that. It bears the earnestness of privileged twenty-year-olds memorializing their dabbling with the dangerous side of life. I suspect Ludington has a very good novel in him, but like Franzen's or Lethem's or Chabon's earlier books (THE TWENTY-SEVENTH CITY or MOTHERLESS BROOKLYN or MYSTERIES OF PITTSBURGH) this feels like a personal story, grounded in a personal place, that he needs to get out before he can get on with the business of writing his real &quot;Great American Novel.&quot;"},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"Fantistic read, a great escape to that familiar festy goer.

I enjoyed it tremendously, and I know very little about the Grateful Dead or about the drug culture surrounding the band. If anything, it's a great intro into that history, for someone who did not experience it whatsoever.Some have criticized this book as being less than *other* Dead literature out there. Well, I have not read other Dead literature. Never had a desire to. But this book I enjoyed.Others have criticized the story as not being terribly exciting. Well, the story is mostly true (according to Max: it's all true, except for the the sex [much less in real life]). Therefore, it's not surprising that the book has great character development, but does not race through an exciting plot. Isn't that how life usually goes?"},{"Title":"Tiger in a Trance: A Novel","review":"Tiger in a Trance (repeating Just Say No to itself over and over)? I don't think so.

Much of it had its origin in politically motivated slander by former associate John Wilkes, another fascinating character. Mannix's book is an enjoyable read, but don't take it too seriously since, as with most who have written about Dashwood's \\"Hell Fie Club,\\" he didn't want any real research (and possible attendant debunking) to get in the way of any good stories.

The American Revolution was spawned at its meetings. This little power-packed paperback is dynamite! Full of rich history you won't find in the school texts. I read it in 3 days. Take a second look at \\"history\\". I was well pleased. You couldn't make this stuff up."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules of Order: Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies (Little Books of Wisdom)","review":"Why the distinction? Because while Robert's Rules are unquestionably the Gold Standard when it comes to parliamentary procedure and while this IS a genuine copy of Robert's Rules, it is a genuine copy of the FIRST edition of 1876. Parliamentary procedure has continued to change and evolve over the subsequent one hundred and thirty-five years, and Robert's Rules have changed and evolved with them. The CURRENT edition of Robert's Rules is the eleventh edition of 2011, available in both hardbackRobert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, 11th editionand paperbackRobert's Rules of Order Newly Revised, 11th edition. Thus, while this first edition certainly could still be used to organize, conduct, and participate in modern meetings, it would be rather foolish to do so except in an emergency, as foolish as trying to organize, conduct, and participate in a sporting event with an obsolete rulebook.Note: As you'd probably expect, the eleventh edition is a lot longer than the first: 816 pages versus 120. If you find that a bit intimidating,Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised In Brief, 2nd editioncovers all the rules you'll need to organize, conduct, and participate in meetings most of the time. Anyone serious about doing this on a regular basis is going to need a copy of the complete rules, but in most cases you will be able to leave the big one in your car and only bring this 208 page user friendly outline into the meeting.So does this mean there is nothing to be gained from reading the first edition? Au contraire! Frankly I was a little leery about reading this at first, having little need for or interest in a guide to parliamentary procedure at present, but it turned out to be a much better read than I feared. For a book this old it is remarkably well organized, divided into two parts, a much more detailed Part I for the more experienced parliamentarian and a simpler Part II for the novice, followed by a well arranged table of rules relating to motions.It's easy to see why it so quickly became the universal standard, and it might be interesting to compare and contrast it with the current edition.Note: Amazon has grouped together reviews of several different editions of this book; this review is forRobert's Rules of Order (Little Books of Wisdom).Note: One could complain that this edition is available online for free. Well, yes, what part of in the public domain do you not understand? However, trying to get away with giving someone a printout as a gift will earn you the nickname of cheapskate. If all you want to do is read it yourself, then by all means stick to the free sites. However, if you are looking for a way to get through to someone else, you are better off buying a copy, and a solitary sawbuck for this sturdy pocket-sized reprint is going to be tough to beat. The chief virtue of it being online is your ability to read it first and make sure that this is the book you want to give before ordering it.Note: Applewood Books has produced a nice looking inexpensive series of sturdy pocket-sized reprints of important American books, documents, speeches, pamphlets, and poems, the Little Books of Wisdom, uniform with this volume, that are ideal for gifting to doctors, lawyers, teachers, business professionals, and students of same:The Way to Wealth,George Washington's Rules of Civility & Decent Behavior in Company and Conversation,On the Art of Teaching,The Poems of Abraham Lincoln,The Strenuous Life,The Bill of Rights with Writings That Formed Its Foundation, The Path of the Law, The Constitution of the Confederate States of America, The Jefferson Bible: The Life and Morals of Jesus of Nazareth, A Message to Garcia, A Declaration of Sentiments, Good Citizenship, On Being Human, A Discourse Upon the Duties of a Physician, The Declaration of Independence with Short Biographies of Its Signers, Teamwork, Stick-To-Itiveness, Opportunity, & You, The Wants of Man, George Washington's Farewell Address, Universal Declaration of Human Rights, The Speech of Chief Seattle, Common Sense, The Articles of Confederation, The Emancipation Proclamation, and The Gospel of Wealth.Some selected volumes are also available in boxed sets: Books of American Wisdom Boxed Set, CEO's Gift Box of Wisdom, Doctor's Gift Box of Wisdom, Lawyer's Gift Box of Wisdom, New Citizen's Gift Box of Wisdom, and Teacher's Gift Box of Wisdom.And some have been published in Spanish: Un Mensaje a Garcia and Constitucion de Los Estados Unidos."},{"Title":"Robert's Rules of Order: Pocket Manual of Rules of Order for Deliberative Assemblies (Little Books of Wisdom)","review":"This small pocket manual I have used in monthly meetings to follow motions from introduction to disposition.

Yes, some facts stated in the book are not true (at least not any more) but despite the fact this book is not up-to-date (not to say 'obsolete') I found it informative and usefull.

The chapter on large database is flatly insufficient. Just a copy of the standard documentation. The subject on performance and reorganisations is quiet handy and usefull."},{"Title":"Oracle SAP Administration (O'Reilly Oracle)","review":"This is a much-needed book in the SAP marketplace, but in its current form, this edition isn't it. As an experienced R/3 administrator, hoping to expand my understanding of the R/3 - Oracle integration points, I bought this book with high hopes. The author lost a great deal of credibility in my eyes with the number of glaring errors when discussing R/3. It is obvious that no R/3 Basis Administrator was asked to review the text for accuracy. Based on the number of errors I discovered in the first few chapters on R/3, I couldn't trust that the remainder of the text would be correct, as the subject matter advanced to topics I had less expertise on (i.e. Oracle). I do not question the authors expertise with Oracle. I do question his ability to write a book that creeps outside his area of expertise without outside assistance.I understand that this book is targeted towards Oracle DBAs who are pushed into an SAP environment where the world as they know it turns upside down, and not necessarily for SAP Basis Administrators looking to learn more Oracle skills. Still, I think this book could have been so much more for the author and SAP administrators worldwide.It is still a much needed book in the SAP market, and I reluctantly recommend buying it, but only after visiting OReilly's web site for the errata."},{"Title":"Oracle SAP Administration (O'Reilly Oracle)","review":"The author has definately tried take advantage of the fact that SAP System Admin Documentation is not so thorough and extensive.It is clear that he has never worked with SAP before. The book is full of mistakes that even a Basis Administrator with 6 months experience would know. For example, the author says that the SAP SID must be 3 characters long, must start with the letter S followed by any other 2 characters, with SAP being the exception, like we all know this is a load of hogwash. Save your money, because in my opinion the author's only intention is to make some money out of you, despite his dismal inexperience in SAP. I will never buy another book written by the author."},{"Title":"Oracle SAP Administration (O'Reilly Oracle)","review":"I read this book primarily for its reorganization and tuning aspects. There were good ideas that nudged me in the right direction, but there was an unacceptable amount of technical incorrectness.

The book is filled with information that will help you hit the ground running. This book goes beyond the topic of SAP and covers Oracle concepts such as free lists that provide a foundation to better understand performance and tuning considerations. The examples provide sufficient implementation detail. The authors style of writing transforms the technical jargon into easy reading without losing the technical content. An easy to read reference manual."},{"Title":"Oracle SAP Administration (O'Reilly Oracle)","review":"If you are a knowledgeable Oracle DBA and you need to understand some more about R/3 running on Oracle then I totally recommend this book. If you are an experience R/3 basis consultant looking for some great tuning tips and advice on running an Oracle database on R/3 then again I recommend this book. If you neither know Oracle nor R/3 then don't buy it, it's not for beginners, have a look around are some bigger more weightier beginner volumes more suited to your needs.After reading this book it is clearly obvious that the author Donald K. Burlenson, has a fantastic understanding of Oracle and Database Management, not just from a high level perspective but from someone who has real experience with countless real-life production systems. After reading this book you will definitely have a much better understanding of how to configure your Oracle system for best performance for R/3 ( thus avoiding trouble latter). Another strong point of this book, is the scripts and tools to monitor and identify problems, these are not so much simple tips and checks but the basics of a oracle management framework you can use implement to manage your real-life R/3 production system. After all, clear and controlled management (who, what, where, when) that identifies a true professional from the mediocre.For criticism, Burlenson does not understand R/3 basis an well as well as he knows Oracle resulting in naEe statements about R/3 and some missed opportunities to deliver performance improvement for Oracle DB's particular with customized reporting (a area of BIG problems). Another chapter focussing on customizing ABAP (native SQL etc) for best oracle performance would be a worthy addition to this book. That's my opinion anyway!Overall a great book well worth the cover price, easy and quick to read, offering real help and understanding. If you manage R/3 on Oracle, a great buy!"},{"Title":"Oracle SAP Administration (O'Reilly Oracle)","review":"This book gave me a host of valuable information about the basic configuration of the SAP database for Oracle.

He laments its lack of social and \\"welfarist\\" features and argues that a system created by market forces to serve market forces can only exacerbate existing inequities. His dry, academic tone still reveals a little emotion, making it clear that Schiller is no cheerleader for the neo-liberal orientation he perceives on the Internet. Is there an overt political slant to the book? You might say that.

Lucy and Elvis have been together for awhile and now Elvis is getting closer to Ben. Suddenly Ben is kidnapped from Elvis' home. There seems to be a connection between Elvis' Vietnam War years and the motive for the kidnapping. The flashbacks to Cole's experiences in Vietnam are absolutely riveting...a little reminiscent of Black Hawk Down, but even better. Joe Pike is back after suffering significant injuries eight months earlier. He is still not 100%. Will he be able to help Cole save Ben? The ending is tension filled with non-stop action (took me half an hour after I finished the book to get my neck muscles to relax). An excellent addition to the Elvis Cole series."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Things are not so funny when his girlfriend's son is kidnapped right from under his nose. Gone are the wisecracks, but rightly so - this case has got to be solved ASAP. Cole's time in Vietnam is focused here - also not too funny. Excellent Cole/Pike adventure."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Picking back up with the long running and very enjoyable character of Elvis Cole, author Robert Crais is back with the latest installment of the series entitled The Last Detective. However, with several books featuring other characters and writing styles having been published from this author in the meantime, this latest Elvis Cole is written in a far different style than usual.As the book opens, Elvis is babysitting his girlfriend's ten-year-old son, Ben. Lucy, his mother and Ben moved from Louisiana to be with Elvis and since they came there has been a series of problems. (Many of these are detailed full in the preceding novel of this series L. A. Requiem and as such will not be detailed here for space reasons as well as to not ruin things for readers new to the series). Lucy is still very unsettled over those events and when Ben suddenly vanishes without a trace, it brings those past events as well as current problems to the surface.Along with the terror of losing a child, Lucy becomes filled with self recriminations as well as wondering if Elvis' less than stellar past is coming back to haunt them again. As a private investigator, as well as a few other things, Elvis moves in the shadows and has made quite a few enemies along the way. Ben's kidnapper works on that fear by claiming that he is doing this as revenge for something Elvis did in Vietnam. As Lucy cracks under the strain, Elvis is left feeling responsible and alone with everyone convinced that he did the unthinkable.With his old friend Joe Pike, who himself is dealing with the trauma of the recent and distant past, Elvis decides despite all objections to work the case himself. He begins to unravel a dark conspiracy that has him at the center in an elaborate plan to make him the fall guy. Ben is a pawn and as events spin out of control, the stakes climb and Elvis becomes Ben's only chance at survival.While enjoyable, this novel is written far differently than the other novels in the series. Not only is the overall plot and storyline less complicated than earlier novels, Elvis himself is different. While it is hard to pin down and some no doubt will criticize me for being unacceptably vague, the character of Elvis just does not read like right. I really do not know how to explain it, but there is a style and tone in the Elvis sections that does not read the way Elvis always did.That might be worsened by the constant point of view shifts used in this novel. Traditionally, the Elvis Cole novels have been written from the viewpoint of the Elvis character and have rarely strayed from that viewpoint. However, in this novel, various kidnappers' points of view are presented, along with Joe Pike's, Lucy, Richard (her ex husband), Ben's, and many others. This multi point of view becomes rather distracting with the constant shifts, especially as the climatic scene takes place at the end of the book and the violent confrontation is depicted from every conceivable angle.However, while there are some negatives with this book, overall it is another enjoyable installment of the series. Some of the back-story which was alluded to in previous novels concerning Elvis is fully discussed as Elvis is forced to confront his dark past. It will be interesting to see with several loose ends resolved where the author chooses to take this complicated character. At the same time, this could be the end to this character and while one hopes not, it very well could be the finish."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"...with my hands waving up and down in the air in humble admiration of the KING of detectives, Elvis Cole and his hunka burning love side-kick, Joe Pike. You guys are da bomb. This is the best detective novel I've read in years and years, bar none. The plot moved at a lightning pace and never once slowed down. Learning about Elvis's and Joe's childhoods was an added plus to this excellent story. I cried like a baby reading about the young Elvis and the last page blew me away. I read it five times and then cried again. Thanks, Mr. Crais, for a super book. And I laughed out loud for 10 minutes after reading your remark about Katie Couric. You're a master of the genre and I love you!!!! Keep 'em coming!!!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The only complaint I have with this book is that is too short. I wanted the story to keep going. That is how enjoyable it was. I am a big Robert Crais fan and have read all his books. This rates right up there with all the other Elvis Cole novels. The MVP of the story goes to Joe Pike. He has to be the most indelible character in fiction. If I ever would want a bodyguard, Joe would be it. For those that have not read The Last Detective yet.......Does Joe meet his match? Do not miss reading this book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I really enjoyed this book so much. I am such a fan of Mr. Crais's and especially his Elvis Cole books. This one does not disappoint. I loved that Mr. Crais gave us more glimpses of Elvis and Joe, and we know that deal Joe made will come back and haunt him...Great, exciting read.Another excellent addition to this great series."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective is both the most satisfying and most emotionally draining novel I've read in the past few years. Crais's clear and straightforward writing is a perfect match for the most intense Elvis Cole story he has told.Crais combines the first-person perspective of a private eye novel with the third-person perspective of a thriller, as he did in the highly regarded L. A. Requiem. In The Last Detective, the combination allows Crais to enhance the emotional depth of the story without sacrificing any of its momentum. As a fan of first-person storytelling, I'm often skeptical about an author's decision to leave the protagonist's point of view. But The Last Detective would tell a much smaller story if limited to Elvis's vantage point.Elvis's experience is still the core of the novel, though. He's hobbled by his own vulnerabilities, and even the relative weakness of partner Joe Pike (still recovering from wounds received in L. A. Requiem), when up against a villain more skillful (and certainly more ruthless) than he. One of the novels more chilling moments is when Elvis first realizes what kind of man he's facing.Fair warning: the book is quite violent (though far from the most violent I've read), and focused on a child in extreme danger. I thought Crais handled it well, and that both of those things drove the intensity of the novel. But it might not be for everyone. My wife, who has read the other Elvis Cole novels, does not plan to read this one."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis and Joe are back.

She and Elvis bond; Joe Pike is back from an Alaskan trip where a grizzly almost gets our Joe!The last few chapters of this book are worth the price of admission and nail biting. Robert Crais remains 'the man'! Excellent book - try to put it down!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This was a fast paced thriller that is sure to be one of Robert Crais' best books. It grabbed my senses from the very beginning and didn't let up until I finished reading the exciting ending. I think that it is probably one of the darkest books in the series, and it is fascinating how it explores Elvis' past, and Joe Pike's hidden insecurities. I couldn't put the book down and I read it over a two evening period. The only disappointment was the solution of the kidnapping...a little bit contrived and unrealistic in my mind. Still, this is a roller coaster read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis Cole used to be more of a smartass and, I hate to say it, I miss the old smartass days. Now, everything is deathly serious and I'm having trouble enjoying Crais' books as much. It's a pity, too, because he's a good writer. It seems like, from time to time, writers write really great books and then get \\"serious\\" about their craft not realizing that the humor leavens the work and without it the writing pulls the reader down. This book puts people close and dear to Elvis in proximity to dangerous, evil people, subject matter much too grim for no smiles at all."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective is a fabulous emotional ride -- the most grabbing pageturner I can remember reading. I was right there in that book, feeling Elvis Cole's fear and his pain. I cried several times and the tension was absolutely incredible. The real world was left behind as I read this novel with record-breaking speed. Without a doubt, the BEST novel I have read in a LONG time."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Being a huge fan of Robert Crais, I craved for his next book and placed the order for Last Detective in August 2002. Of course, after much anticipation, I was a little disappointed. This is a completely different format then the previous Elvis Cole novels. Crais constantly shifts points of view from Elvis to Pike, Elvis&#65533; assistant, and to Ben, the young kidnapped boy. I did not favor this change in narration. Elvis Cole is an excellent character and his antics and dialogue are essential to Crais&#65533; private detective theme. I also found it unrealistic that Ben, who witnesses such atrocities, does not need psychiatric assistance. Can a young man see a murder and be unscathed? Although this was not his best, I still long for the next Elvis Cole novel. I strongly recommend reading the previous novels for a flavor of Crais&#65533; true writing."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I thought the early Elvis Cole books were pretty light reading. Cole spent most of the books getting off one liners while doing detective work for a series of quirky clients and Joe Pike was always there to save his bacon if real muscle was needed.It was the sort of thing you would grab in paperback for an airplane ride, but not the type of book you would invest hardcover money in. Well, with his three most recent books, LA Requiem, The Hostage and Demolition Angel, Robert Crais became an author worth reading. He continues his growth with his latest in the Cole series. In this story, Cole's girlfriends 12 year old son is kidnapped while in Cole's care. Why he was kidnapped and by whom becomes the focus of the ensuing investigation and the answers do not come easily. The kidnappers seem to know about some dark secret in Cole's service as an Army Ranger in Viet Nam. As the clues are uncovered the story gets more convoluted and the reader becomes more and more involved in the plot. Crais reintroduces LAPD Detective Carol Starkey from Demolition Angel in this book and we get the feeling that we will be seeing her again. I continue to look forward to this author's development and so should you."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Crais is just a half step behind LA Reqiuem here. THe book isn't quite up to his masterpiece, but is easily the 2nd best of the Cole novels. As many reviewers have noted, it does not have the huge surprise ending to the mystery, I figured it out much earlier. Still, the book works because it is focused so tightly on the kidnapping AND on Cole's early life. We finally learn more details about Cole and Vietnam (which might have been a fine novel right there). Pike is rare form, esp. at the beginning with the bear. These are two men who have deepened as Crais has. Lucy is back and while Ben's kidnapping makes for a great story, there relationship just isn't working. I was never a big fan of hers, although I am not quite sure why. Starkey is back and even cooler than in Demolition Angel. John Chen is back as well and continues to crack me up with constant search for women (and still he fails). Also, there is a wonderful nod to Harry Bosch in the middle when Elvis sees Bosch at the Hollywood Station turning in his retirement papers. Michael Connelly would return the nod with a much shorter sequence in one his later books. I wonder if Cole and Bosch ever teamed up...my two favorite detectives....oh my dreaming is getting ahead--although Cole does hint that he thinks Bosch would understand him, and indeed he would. Oh well. I love when writers tip their caps to each other. I've now read all but the Forgotten Man. Crais is great, but I do wish, as he has done for the last 4 books, find a different technique besides the overlapping narratives from different viewpoints. It works, but is getting stale. Still, one of the best."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Just a fantastic read - another entry in the life of Elvis Cole. Elvis has to deal with the abduction of Ben, the 10 year old son of Lucy Chenier his lover. As you might expect, Elvis is slowly freaking out as things fall apart around him, so obviously not as much humor here as in other entries in the series. The multiple points of view from Elvis, Pike, and Ben in Last Detective were also a refreshing change and added another dimension to the story. Too bad there were none from Lucy.In the last few novels, I feel that Crais has made an effort to give more than just the same wise-cracking Spenser-esque detective and his silent and forbidding sidekick by exploring Cole and Pike's background and character. I've enjoyed all of his books, but his writing beginning with LA Requiem seems to have more depth. It'll be interesting to see which direction Crais goes with the next novel.Trivia time: look for Cole's brief encounter with Michael Connelly's Hieronymous Bosch outside the police station about halfway through the book!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Once again Robert Crais has managed to produce another page turning thriller with the characters he started with, Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. What's so great about Crais is he manages to churn out nail biting suspense while at the same time revealing more of the personalities and personal demons of his characters. For those who have never read him before, you could read this as a stand alone, but the experience is much deeper if you've read all the previous Cole novels. In this one, Lucy Chenier's son Ben is kidnapped by a man who is bent on revenge for something Cole had done in his past. Elvis with the help of a worn and recovering Joe Pike hunts him down. Fast paced with plenty of twists, my only fault with the book, is that it was over too soon."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"It was worth the four-year wait for Elvis Cole to return in \\"The Last Detective\\" by Robert Crais. I read it in less than 24 hours.The plot catapults at a relentless pace. Down-to-earth, practical detective work is what solves the crime in this ticking clock child kidnapping. Since the child is the son of Elvis Cole's girl friend, the hunt is both personal and professional&#65533;and therefore all the more chilling,The point of view switches between the characters (Elvis is in the first person) and is smooth as silk and most engaging.The reader learns the clues as they unfold for Elvis, going thru the stages of frustration to hope to possibility to solution with Elvis and his archangel Joe Pike.The supporting cast, especially Carol Starkey (from \\"Demolition Angel\\") is outstanding.We learn a lot of Elvis' past via flashbacks that propel the plot. The scene from his Vietnam days is as intense as any I have read.It is a compelling novel that truly showcases depth of Robert Crais as a writer.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Crais' books seem to be either real bad or real good and I'm happy to say this is real good. As others have noted, not as good as \\"L.A. Requiem\\" but certainly good enough to keep me glued from beginning to end. The characters here are not too subtle -- they're either really really evil or really really noble. And the kid's just a little too precocious. But, all in all, it was a very entertaining, engrossing read. I like Crais and will continue to look forward to his offerings. (Interestingly, Crais salutes fellow author Michael Connelly by having Cole bump into Harry Bosch, who lives down the road from Cole. They promise to get together for a beer. Very nice touch!)"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"First things first - this is an excellent work - and the reader of the book on tape format was absolutely great. First rate job. I found myself taking the tapes with me and taking advantage of any chance to listen (while showering, housework, etc.).'The Last Detective' is the 9th installment of the Elvis Cole series but it really is the sequel to 'L.A. Requiem.' Not that the bad guys return, but rather Crais continues to show the readers insight into the mechanics of our duo - Pike and Cole. In 'Requiem' we were treated to the psyche of Pike. This time it is Cole.I would not recommend this book as a stand-alone since it spends so much time delving into the heart and soul and past of Cole. This means a lot to the fans of the series but most likely means little to newcomers.Plot descriptions are easily found up above, but suffice it to say that this one is great. I give this one an A+."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"thing in this book is...oh!..wait ...there isn't any...this book is absolutely..how can i put it...AMAZING...you would think it might not be interesting because it is about a kid being kidnapped..but trust me...it is an excellent read..the events ...the paste...the description..the details...wow, wow, wow..."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"We've been slowly reading Crais' bibliography, and now wish we had done so in order, as in this book, the same Lucy leading man (PI) Elvis Cole met in Voodoo River has now moved to be with Elvis in California. When Lucy's son Ben is abducted while Elvis is babysitting, and soon a threat is made regarding Elvis' past exploits long ago in Viet Nam, it mars their relationship to say the least. When Lucy's ex-husband Richard gets involved, with his own \\"security\\" forces and apparently unlimited resources, things get hairy in the hunt for the bad guys and the hoped for return of the kid. Before long, Elvis calls his buddy Joe Pike to ask for his help, and the plot is on.Frankly, we were disappointed in this tale. Elvis was in no way his usual wise-cracking self, and some stream of consciousness segments throughout, including a long foreword and after-word, were confusing and somehow hardly relevant. We also did not care for the many scene changes and shifts from the point-of-view of many different characters, so that the same scenes were sometimes replayed several times from each character's vantage point. It was almost like Crais was trying harder to write a screen-play than a crime novel. We also thought the otherwise straight-line plot was almost over-the-top violent compared to other entries in the series.While we thought Crais was destined to be a new favorite, now we're not too sure, as so far we're not as endeared to Cole and Pike as we thought we would be, and this particular story was not exactly up our alley. We'll give Crais and company one more try and then decide."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"And Pike say \\"Bears.\\" I will laugh at that statement until the day I die.I found it an interesting read with the POV shifts. I think it told a lot about the connection between Joe and Elvis and as always we get small glimpses into Pike's psyche. I loved the beginning."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"this guy is currently (and for the last year or so) one of my top 10 all time authors! This whole series of Joe Pike and Elvis Cole are incredibly well drawn, witty and in the cawe of Joe Pike, fascinating to read about. Great, if unusual characters that one gets very involved with. Love Elvis' sarcasm and wry wit. Love Joes' stoicism.This book along with L.A. Requiem are, to me, probably the best out of them all.Well up there with Asimovs Robot series just to give you a idea what I truly think about (these) book(s)Wanta be entertained with a book you cannot! put down?

Moving on to the next in the very entertaining series."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I have no idea if Crais has served in a Ranger Company or in Nam but the back story action of his Elvis character on patrol was tuned in and on the mark of my own experience in Nam 40 odd years ago. What a flashback! The book itself is gripping and the story believably real in a nonfantasy style I simply could not lay it aside. For several years I've been a fan of RA Salvatore and his Drizzit series. In Crais I have found a more realistic and believable series that I can now relate to. I'm gonna download everyone and read them in order. Congratulations Robert, you now have a solid fan and I'm going to go over to your web site and cruise so see what's coming next. BTW Robert - I've known men like Elvis and Joe Pike, I've served with them and love every one still today. To me Elvis and Joe are real people."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This novel is plotted well and moves quickly. It's a great read and it was imposible to put down. It\`s a well written book. One of the best Detective titles I\`ve red.If you\`re realy a fanatic of detective books you can't go without these:The Mysterious Affair at StylesThe Secret Adversary: A Tommy and Tuppence Mystery!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Life doesn't imitate art but maybe at times it should. With THE LAST DETECTIVE Robert Crais offers up a better Private Eye; one with the kind of morals, motivation, style, personal courage and ethics we want whenever we need someone to champion our causes.Maybe it's just me but some of the real life PI's I've come across tend to remind me of those sleazy little suckers who scooped up the excess change from the ground after the schoolyard bully shook you down for your milk money in grade school.I'd call them SOBs but there's no need to hurt a dog's feelings. Anyway, with the Elvis Cole series we find the evolution of the better PI with each book offering up more of his background and more of how he came to be what and who he is. THE LAST DETECTIVE adds more substance and depth to Cole's life with Crais' well placed humor and targeted storyline focus. It's fiction, of course but good fiction that provides a novel and convincing story that fulfills the promise of the book's premise while occasionally helping us to recover some of lost faith in humanity.A good deal for the cover price, not to mention getting Joe Pike in the process. Knights errant with slightly dented armor.A new Elvis Cole book is always a welcome fit into the reading rotation process."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis Cole has been taking care of his girlfriend Lucy's 10-year old son Ben for a couple of days while she has been out of town. The same afternoon that Lucy is coming back, Ben disappears. We soon find out that he was kidnapped while playing in the small canyon behind the house.The Los Angeles police are called in, but in parallel Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike conduct an investigation of their own. There are almost no leads at all, but Elvis and Joe go to work on what little they have. To complicate things further, Lucy's wealthy ex-husband Richard flies in with investigators of his own.This is a real page-turner novel, with good detective work by Elvis and Joe. A kidnapping case makes for a good thriller, and the sense of urgency here is heightened by the chapter titles, each stating the hours and minutes that Ben has been missing for.This was the first novel by Robert Crais that I've read, and it left me wanting to read more by him.As it happens, this book has a lot of similarities withThe Hard Wayby Lee Child, which I read not long ago. Both books are kidnapping dramas, featuring ex-military men as the investigators (and both of them feature atrocities committed in Africa). In both of them, the protagonists track the kidnappers by working the few clues available - something that in my mind is done very well in both books. And they both feature action-packed final show-downs (they wouldn't be thrillers if they didn't).I liked both of them, but with a slight edge for THE HARD WAY. So if you liked this one, check out THE HARD WAY by Lee Child as well."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I stumbled upon my first Elvis Cole story earlier this year and ever since I have read five more. The Last Detective is fast moving and thrilling and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The plot was tightly crafted, the characters were distinct and believable. Very thrilling. Gritty realism without being overly gory. Crais is a master of this genre!My first Crais novel was the Watchman and I really enjoyed Pike and Cole in that story. It was good to see them both in this story also. I look forward to more Crais novels in the Kindle store!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"After Demolition Angel, I have tried to love subsequent books by Mr. Crais, but none - for me - have come anywhere close to meeting the standards set in the first Starkey book. I picked up The Last Detective because of Starkey's role in it, but I simply couldn't get into the book. I've tried twice, and I swear I'm going to try again. But the book just failed to pull me in."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This story is terrible. I don't even know where to start, so I'll sum it up with this: The dialogue is a joke (it's like these characters are robots programmed to say the most obvious, dry thing they can), the plot is awful, and the suspense is non-existent. I read this book because other readers of Dennis Lehane (who's had masterpieces like \\"Mystic River,\\" \\"Gone, Baby, Gone,\\" \\"Darkness, Take my Hand,\\" \\"Sacred,\\" and \\"Prayers for Rain\\") recommended Robert Crais.This is my first Robert Crais book, and it's most certainly my last. If you enjoy mystery novels with no suspense, by all means, read away. If you want something fresh and exciting with life like characters, I recommend anything Lehane's written over this piece of garbage."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Did anyone else find it weird that Cole says in the beginning of Chapter 6 that he had never met Richard before, when Richard and one of his henchmen tossed Elvis' office in Indigo Slam and threatened Cole to stay away from Lucy and Ben? The entire time I read the book I couldn't get past that. Seems to me a big detail to overlook. Not much new to add to the series. Maybe Crais should take a page out of George Pelecanos' book and start a new series with another set of characters..."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Robert Crais came highly recommended to me by several fans of his, so I read 'The Last Detective.' I was so disappointed. I could not believe that Elvis Cole had no idea or clue who kidnapped Ben! Robert Crais had that telegraphed from the first page!! I was also disappointed in the military descriptions--very many telling mistakes. I was most disappointed in the very many grammatical mistakes that were made by the author. He could definitely use a college level writing class to improve his grammar. He writes as though he has no understanding of the English language. I was very disappointed in this book. I will read no more of this author; he does not deserve my time."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I bought this book by relying on the first fourcustomer reviews, all five stars. This was a sillytale without any strong characters. Having justfinished &quot;The Vanishing Man&quot; and &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;,I can't give this book more than one star. Whoeverwrote about tension and suspense, I could not findany of them. The book was too predictable, and Elvislacks the smarts to be a half decent P.I."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I love the Elvis Cole Series by Robert Crais. I am not reviewing the author or the book, but my purchase. My CD was incomplete. It covered the first chapter, 31 minutes. The rest of the audio was deleted, or just wasn't there. I was very disappointed.The Last Detective (Elvis Cole) [Abridged][Audiobook] (Audio CD)Alvin"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I love all the Elvis Cole novels - apart from this one. Very disappointed - very few witty one liners, Joe Pike not really doing much, the bird from Demolition Angel popping up, Elvis's unhappy childhood. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Skimmed through it in no time at all, didn't chuckle once. Boring and generic are the words that spring to mind. Will I read another one? - probably, but won't fork out top dollar for the large format paperback."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The latest installment in author Robert Crais' series featuring private detective Elvis Cole has it all: likeable good guys coping with current crises and echoes of the past, really mean bad guys, fast-moving narration, snappy dialogue, and real detective work. Unfortunately, it was obvious very early on \\"whodunit\\" with only the most token efforts at misdirection - too bad, because I really wanted to like this book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Crais, thats why I was VERY SURPRIZED with The Last Detective. I was dissapointed at its length at first, 300 pages, but James Lee Burke can write a great book in just 300 pages, so, maybe can Crais. I was wrong! Very dissapointing. And what was the bear thing all about?"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I love Crais' Elvis Cole mysteries. His stand alones are good, but his Cole mysteries are spectacular. In this one, Elvis is going without sleep to track down his girlfriend's son. Ben Chenier has been kidnapped while in Elvis' care and it seems to be connected to Elvis' past, but nothing is ever as it appears.Joe Pike is back, too, recovered from his wounds from his previous adventure and trying to get back in the groove of investigations.Tension builds quickly and stays taut all the way through.Don't miss the return of Elvis!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Robert Crais has created a very interesting series with the tough and quiet Joe Pike and the outrageous and outspoken Elvis Cole. The Series has come to a crossroads with this novel and Crais has masterfully maneuvered himself into a terrific situation. The always cracking wise and smart mouth of Elvis Cole is gagged for this book and the serious side of Cole and the caring side of Pike are moved to the forefront. When Ben, Lucy's son is kidnapped and Richard (Lucy's ex) comes into town to put the blame directly on Lucy and Cole, the thrills begin and the story unfolds quickly. But woven into the story are flashbacks into Cole's life that we have never been allowed to see previously.The writing is crisp and the story taunt. We again get to see Carol Starkey (Demolition Angel) and she adds another interesting character to the series. There is even a cameo appearance of another of my favorite detectives of Michael Connelly fame.This story has it all and is not easy to put down."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective was virtually impossible to put down. Crais grabs the reader in the first few pages and takes him on a fast-paced journey until the final pages. I have read a number of Crais' works, but prior to this novel, the only one I had read that featured Elvis Cole and Joe Pike was The Watchman. That book was fantastic and so was the Last Detective. Cole and Pike are tremendous characters. Each carries the physical and emotional scars of a somewhat tortured past, while also epitomizing internal fortitude, perseverance, courage and dedication. In this story, Crais presents the kidnapping of a young boy who just happens to be the son of Cole's girlfriend. This nightmare situation for any parent becomes personal for Cole. Throughout the novel, Crais effectively uses flashbacks to provide depth to the characters and intensity to the story. Although Crais has some solid standalone novels, he clearly is in the zone with Cole and Pike. I need to tackle more of the works with these signature characters."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Not as good as LA Requiem or Demolition Angel. There's far too little of Joe Pike and too much of Elvis Cole. Also Crais uses the tired vehicle of The Threatened Child to add emotional grab. The bad guy is impressive but barely shows up. Oddly, the best scenes are side-story vignettes set in Alaska (with Pike) and Vietnam (with Cole). But it's still a good read, especially if you know westside LA."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Last detective tells the story of Elvis Cole, a detective who must take the law into his own hands when his girlfriend's son Ben is kidnapped. Along with his trusty friend Pike, he discovers that the kidnapping is not to take revenge against him (as is interpreted by everybody because of a phone call); but much more.A fairly predictable thriller, but told well using the first person view (of Elvis) and the standard third person view. The climax also seemed a bit cliched and hurried, but otherwise an excellent read. Recommended for anyone who loves detective stories."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I read this one to the end and enjoyed it even though I knew probably a third of the way into the story what was going on. He writes well and makes you feel for his emotionally damaged heroes."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The last two Elvis Coles had been almost boring because of the taming effect his new relationship had on him. But this one brought him back with a vengeance . . . with Pike struggling to come back from serious injuries from the last outing. This gave the excellent character Joe Pike a lot more depth. Thoroughly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis Cole, LA private inspector, is baby-sitting his girlfriend's son, when all of a sudden the child disappears. Elvis's goal is to find the child, all the while working with tight lipped partner, the LA cops, his girlfriend's ex husband, and many other goons and low-lifes.While not a literary masterpiece, this book is a fun page turner. The action and fluidity is constant, the plot is well conceived, and the stand-offs between Elvis and everyone else keeps things interesting. Though the plot is pretty standard, the unraveling of the plot is magnificent. Crais could have turned the book into a sappy kid story, but instead concentrated on the kidnapping hunt.This is a great page turning read. One of those books where before you know, you've reached the end."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"One of the most eagerly awaited novels this year is the latest by Bob Crais. It is another in the Elvis Cole series. Bob has taken a hiatus from the series in which he wrote two stand alones. However, Carol Starkey, the FBI heroine of DEMOLITION ANGEL returns.Elvis is watching Ben Chenier, the ten year old son of Elvis' girlfriend, Lucy Chenier. While playing in the back of Elvis' house, Ben is kidnapped. The person who abducted Ben calls and blames the kidnapping on revenge for something Elvis did in Vietnam. Working with his partner, the mysterious Joe Pike, as well as, Carol Starkey of the FBI, Cole will stop at nothing to get Ben back safely.A riveting plot, overall strong characterizations and realistic descriptions make this one of the more gripping reads of the year. There is not much new or original in the ideas used in the story. Kidnappings have a vast representation in the mystery and crime genre. The plot of this book really is nothing special. It is the use of familiar sympathetic characters and the smooth lyrical writing that sets this work apart. THE LAST DETECTIVE should prove hugely popular with the book buying public. It is good to see Elvis Cole and friends back again."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I've read all of Robert Crais' work in the last few months, but had put off reading L. A. Requiem and The Last Detective because I knew the relationship between Lucy and Cole was deteriorating. Considering that Robert Crais is the author, I should have known better. I whipped through LAR and am almost done with The Last Detective and think they are probably the best of the series. One reason is that you learn so much more of the background of Pike in LAR and about Cole in the Last Detective, which goes far towards explaining why these characters are the way they are today. There are some sad and heart wrenching moments in both books, but I was riveted throughout and would give 10 stars if I could. Elvis and Joe can move next door to me anyday."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The return of Elvis Cole is well worth the wait. Robert Crais moves Elvis right into action during the first chapter. He is caring for his girlfriend's son and in just one moment the boy disappears. The ensuing search for the boy centers upon's Elvis's Vietnam memories, and a box hidden in his closet that contains medals and pictures. This is not a mystery solved easily- lots of turns and tangles. Old nemesis and the return of Carol Stanger from a previous novel keep this storyline fresh and right on the edge of your seat. Action and deep thought are all a part of the story. Elvis digs deep to keep his relationship with the boy's mom on an even keel, but this may bethe last chance that won't work out. The return of Det. Stangergives us renewed hope that she will be part of Elvis Cole's nextcase and maybe a new romance..."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"As a long-time Crais fan, this return to the Elvis Cole series is a welcome addition. The added bonus is the return of Carol Starkey (heroine of Demolition Angel--a stand-alone, non Cole title I enjoyed enormously) in a supporting role. The plotting is tight as a tick, the narrative races along with a few nice twists. Cole is more lugubrious this time out (as is long-time sidekick Joe Pike). However, given the seriousness of the plot, Cole's somberness is more than acceptable. This is a book that reads at the speed of light and is highly entertaining, and exceedingly violent. It works, though, because of Crais' great gift of characterization. What doesn't work, and is even mildly embarrassing, is the use of italicized front- and end-pieces that are, essentially, about finding one's &quot;inner child.&quot; It's a bit too new-agey, a bit too sentimental (even maudlin) for everything Crais has structured in this book. That aside, though, it doesn't seriously detract from a well-wrought book. It's not Crais at his best but it's a long, long way from his worst (that would be Hostage).Recommended."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Since LA Requiem, the last Elvis/Pike book, Crais has found his writer's voice...blending the local LA color and sharp eye of Chandler with the classic relentlessness of Jeffrey Household's Rogue Male...add a first-hand knowledge of Ranger tactics and tools and you end up with an outstanding example of the action/detective genre. I've been reading Elvis Cole since the first book and it only gets better with each new adventure. I'm an avid reader, and for me, Roger Crais is simply one the very best American writers today."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"...and am I ever glad he's back after a long hiatus. In this one Elvis' girlfriend's son, Ben, is kidnapped! Who'd have thought? The plucky little guy is abducted by some evil evil men and all signs point to our man Elvis as the reason for the heinous act. Or so it would seem. Some real thorough detective work is done in this book, some really bad characters are involved, and we learn a lot more about Elvis' mysterious childhood and Vietnam experience. There are cracks in the iron shield surrounding Joe Pike. Girlfriend Lucy's ex-husband is also featured here . The violence is turned up all the way to \\"high\\" on the dial. It's fast, suspenseful reading,and I recommend it to every Elvis Cole fan out there, but beware, the violence is extreme. I was pleasantly surprised by a not-unexpected little twist in the story line and am looking forward to Robert Crais' next book(s) featuring Elvis and Joe. They are such great characters, I love them both, and the descriptions of Los Angeles are so well done. I have to say I enjoyed the earlier books in the series more, but The Last Detective is very well done and if you're an Elvis Cole fan, you will be greatly rewarded."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Bob Crais has done it again! I have long been an Elvis Cole fan and have watched him get better and better since \\"The Monkey's Raincoat\\". \\"L.A. Requiem\\" was a bell-weather book for Cole and his enigmatic sidekick Joe Pike. Then just to prove he could, Crais wrote two terrific stand alone books with nary a mention of Cole or Pike.With \\"The Last Detective\\", Cole and Pike are back with a vengeance. As Cole and Pike race to rescue Lucy Chenier's son Ben we see some of the old wisecracking Elvis, but also see him in a new light. This book fills in some of Cole's backstory in much the same way that \\"L.A. Requiem\\" did for Joe Pike.Also present are some pretty scary mercenaries, Lucy's former husband, Richard, and his goons from Baton Rouge and an incredibly drawn Carol Starkey, fresh from \\"Demolition Angel.\\"Crais throws in enough twist and turns to keep you guessing right up to the end. As always, his eye for detail and ability to describe action scenes is unparalleled. His shift between characters and narrative styles is so smooth, you hardly notice.Serious fans of this genre will laugh out loud at the insider joke Crais throws in on page 95 when Elvis Cole crosses paths with an unidentified Harry Bosch!\\"The Last Detective\\" takes it's title from a throw-away line uttered by Lucy Chenier and one can only hope that Crais didn't mean it literally!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Bette Davis' caveat to an Academy Award crowd years ago is still good medicine for this brilliant effort by the &quot;on-again&quot; and &quot;really on-again&quot; but never &quot;off-again&quot; Robert Crais. One of the reviewers entitled the review with 'strap yourself in,' and I literally did that, on a flight from the midwest to London with time to spare.Elvis Cole, not as committed to solitude as the enigmatic, self exiled Joe Pike, struggles in his relationship with the attractive lawyer Lucy Chenier. Read Bob Segar's line, &quot; . . . working on mysteries without any clues.&quot; Lucy struggles with her motherhood to the ten year old (thank God he's got a small part; tough mystery-noir authors have a tough time mimicking &quot;kid-speak.&quot;) Ben, and Joe, clearly an all time best friend in the tradition of Damion and Pythias, struggles with the loss of the one thing he could always count on, the resiliancy of his body, disobediant after taking a bullet in the shoulder in his last fracas. (The opening chapter with Joe alone hunting the giant bear would falter on the runway and never get off the ground in the hands of anyone but Crais but Crais scared the hell out of me!)The boy is kidnapped while Elvis is the resident adult in charge. So it happens on his watch. He is to blame. Lucy doesn't say so but what would any mother think?Elements of DeMille's brilliant &quot;Word of Honor&quot; begin to surface. Misconduct in the line of fire while Elvis was a battle hardened NCO with the US Army Rangers. Unexplained deaths.What I found to be extremely well done was the story. It did not require Elvis' stand-up monologue of quips . . . so Crais had him mute. We learn more about Pike's true feelings about friendship and loyalty than we ever did before. Likewise, we learn about Elvis' dark past. And everybody pays a price. The consequences of your acts is a haunting theme and Robert Crais plays it well. Even the reader pays a price.Just a real good, hard, 5 star book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Title: The Last DetectiveAuthor: Robert CraisPublisher: DoubledayGenre: Detective Mystery SeriesISBN 0-385-50426-8Rating: RI approached \\"The Last Detective,\\" by Robert Crais with mixed emotions. After what happened in LA Requiem I knew that this wouldn't be the \\"Monkey's Raincoat\\" all over again, as a matter of fact, it will probably never be the \\"Monkey's Raincoat\\" again. While knowing that change is a necessary part of life, it's not always my favorite part. And I worried, what does he mean \\"The Last Detective?\\" Are we going to say good-bye to Elvis Cole forever? But eagerness overcame trepidation and I plunged in.Then everything else fell away. The setup sends chills up your spine, like a movie scene where the music stops and nothing moves but the hero, headed towards unknown but certain disaster. Then back to normal for a brief moment, and you wonder why your heart is beating so fast.Is there anything that could be more frightening than losing your child? The answer is yes; losing someone else's child, a child who was entrusted to your care. And that's what the spine chilling and heart racing were all about. As Cole nears the end of his week with Ben, someone snatches the 10-year old son of Elvis Cole's girlfriend, Lucille Chenier. One minute he and Elvis are talking dinner, the next minute Ben is gone.What follows is a story that will shake you on many levels. It will shake your beliefs about family, love, war and revenge. It will take you to the edge of fear, frustration and frailty. It will force you to look at what you expect from your heroes. It will teach you that finding out that they are real does not lessen them but makes their deeds even more heroic. To accomplish this, Crais pulls out all stops as his writing style catapults into the literary stratosphere. Without losing any of his familiar crispness, he layers on depth and dimension through the use of flashbacks and narrative perspective that could only succeed in the hands of a pro.We've also come to expect a strong supporting cast of players to accompany Elvis Cole and are not disappointed. Joe Pike, not fully recovered from his near-death experience is back on the job none-the-less. And the irony of these two Zen-ish guys breaking down doors, freaking out and kickin' a** was definitely not lost! On the other hand, Lucy Chenier does not have her finest hour as we see her shrewish, whiney side emerge under fire. And the Chenster, re-appears, John Chen horny crime scene investigator who still can't get a girl ... even with his nifty silver Porche.Often the best books push the boundaries of genre as well. Suspense, mystery and humor in one book pack a powerful punch. And I especially love a thriller in the hands of a mystery writer because it doesn't blindside the reader with some supernatural resolution. Also, Crais kindly allows us to discover the perpetrators along with Elvis and Joe, maybe even before Elvis and Joe if we're really paying attention! You don't get that kind of thrill in your average suspense novel.There's all this and more that telling would spoil...and I'd never do that. As I recommended with LA Requiem, read a couple of the early stories in the series first to get the full impact of The Last Detective by Robert Crais.About the Reviewer: Maggie Harding is a substance abuse counselor in Phoenix, AZ. who wanted to be Brenda Starr before life intervened.

I've read a few reviews and tend to echo the thoughts of the positive ones and will try to add something more to what has already been said.Time clearly passes in Crais' Los Angeles, and with it, the lives of his principal characters. Joe Pike, Elvis' partner and otherwise near-superman, is no longer quite so indestructible. Elvis too, is undergoing changes, which become more apparent as the story progresses.This is good, and a hallmark of good writing, for without change in the characters, the story would essentially remain the same.Crais reprises several characters from previous novels - most notably Carol Starkey (Demolition Angel) and John Chen the crime scene investigator with an adolescent's obssession with sex. However, it is not necessary to have read previous novels to accept these characters and enjoy their contribution to the tale.Lucy Chenier, whose kidnapped son Ben is the crux of the plot is not so prominent, for reasons that will become clear by the end of the book.Pace, as always, is tremendous in Crais' latest work, and there are patches of descriptive prose that convey emotion and location so well. Unusually for Crais, these patches are infrequent, as if he was in two different minds when he wrote certain parts of the book. Also as a criticism is his use of the word \\"leaked\\": rain clouds leak rain, eyes leak tears, and so forth. This was noticeable and distracting.One of the hardest things to do is write from a child's perspective. J. V. Jones does this very, very well, and Crais is not far behind, if at all. The parts of the story where the world is given from Ben's point of view are very well done.Although I suspected which direction the story would move a fair way before the denouement, it was no less thrilling and shocking. Suffice to say, the resolution was satisfying.So, I learned more about the characters and got to see them change. I read the book very quickly, never once stumbling through a sentence or wondering about the author's intent. Again, this is a characteristic of a good writer. Suspension of disbelief was no problem either.Crais obviously pays attention to detail, writes well, crafts his plot with care and ensures there are no loose ends to be tied.I look forward to his next effort."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Several centuries ago in his \\"Essays:Of Studies\\",Francis Bacon wrote:\\"Some books are to be tasted,others to be swallowed;and some few to be chewed and digested\\". Robert Crais's \\"The Last Detective\\" eaily falls in the realm of the third category with its explosive suspense,taut language and a cutting edge. This is a colossal suspense thriller that reflects the contemporary American author's exemplar of grouping inexplicable facets of suspense and gifting them the shape and size of words. This is a great thriller that would keep the reader on tenterhooks for a long,long time.Elvis Cole is a private investigator who has made Los Angeles his abode and is spending some quite and refreshing days with Ben Chenier,his girlfriend Lucy Chenier's 10-year-old son. But all fantasies of smoothness and placidity escape out of the window when Ben mysteriously disappears from his house and is confirmed to be kidnapped. A beliguered mother,a hysterical father(Richard Chenier) and the distrust of the concerned authorities were never enough obstacles for Elvis to contend with in his race against time to recover the boy but when his past rushes catastrophically to his present and haunt him severely,Elvis comprehends that it's a trifle too much to undertake the adventure on his own and invokes Joe Pike,his trusted but enigmatic friend who also happens to be an ex-Marine.Teaming up with Joe and the Juvenile Section detective Carol Starkey,Elvis decides to brush the kidnappers' threat aside and safely claw out Ben from their net. But it was never easy,it's never so and neither will it ever be and as Elvis turns over the pages of his very own history,he's mystified and aghast at his army days. He can't fathom the validity of the atrocity that the kidnappers allege he committed during the Vietnam War but time teaches him that it's all a decoy. Joe,Elvis and Carol piece out the puzzle but realise that they must be discreet and on top of teir game to master a criminal who's turning out to be an international criminal.....This is Elvis and Joe's ninth case together and is really a genuine jewel for all fanatics of suspense thrillers. But \\"The Last Detective\\" isn't just a regular thriller steeped in one-dimensional perspective;Robert Crais lends,and lends successfully,a pluraristic touch to his novel. The maddening,and at times flattering,grief of a father whose son has been kidnapped,the petrified image of a mother whose child is amidst uncertain propositins and a man's desperation to undo his guilt are superbly mirrored in the principle characters of the book. Crais's graphic portrayal of the terrifying images of the Vietnam War framed in a woodwork of guilty reflections accentuates yet another dimension to his work.\\"The Last Detective\\" is a fantastic mystery book deeply soaked in hair-raising adventure. Every word---and virtually every letter---sends around a rippling sense of awe and apprehension and there's not a line that's out of the context. Robert Crais is focussed,ambitious and clear in his work decipher a disdain of anticlimax when the solution comes out into the daylight before the end of the book,he should confess that the ation that follows thereafter augments to the book's charm. \\"The Last Detective\\" is a superbly drawn thriller,one that is to be read,and re-read and savour."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"While sitting in on a reading by Robert Crais this past month I found it sad yet understandable why a writer would need to move a character like Elvis Cole into a new direction. Some fans of the wisecracking, leave the bull at the door, Elvis Cole might find the need to write this story in a more serious, less smart-mouth tone an unwanted departure. But all is not lost, underneath the harsh tone of this mystery still seethes the true Elvis we all fell in love with. At first I was taken by surprise. But after looking at fatherly love through Cole's eyes, I realized that Robert was merely being honest with Cole's emotions as well as his own. How could Elvis be his glib self while facing his most heart-wrenching case yet: the abduction of his girlfriend's son, 10-year-old Ben Chenier, who was visiting with Elvis when he was abducted. How could he not feel responsible? How could it not change him? How can it not alter how we perceive Elvis from this story on? Cole now has responsibilities beyond himself and Pike. His wisecracks can no longer serve as his battle armor now that having a loving family to protect is his underbelly.Hints of the author himself surfaces as he finds ways to blend Cole's first-person narration with third-person passages that represent other points of view--a perilous method of getting some personal views across. But Robert manages this artfully by drawing us into the case by making us understand what a stolen child feels like in a broken mother's heart, and how empty a feeling it is for someone like Elvis, who has to accept the abduction as his responsibility.Over all, another slam dunk best seller by Robert Crais. He's a man of his words and through Elvis Cole speaks them to us, loudly, clearly, but with just a little less wisecracking as Elvis evolves into the family man-private eye.Karl J. Niemiec, author of Mammoth Towers Mysteries (Apartment 101)"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I don't understand the negative reviews. It was a bit of a departure from some of his other Elvis Cole books, mainly because it was more emotional, but given the circumstances, it was well done. Cole acted as any human would. I thought the book was excellent , certainly exciting. I recommend it with no reservations."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Poor plot, gave the original bad guy away very early, he wept and cried several times, but he's become very sharing/caring/sensitive. How precious."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I read a large print version from the library. Had it finished in 2 days - zoom it was done. Lots of tension and a bit of sadness I'm afraid, but overall it's a 5 star mystery for me. I will say this, I was able to suspect the correct premise mid-way through, but only suspect, which is not always right. It's still a great story.Please don't let that hold anyone back. Read it!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"It's a mystery and so once we know who did it, the rest is boring and I didn't read the last 3rd of the book. I also I didn't think the gory details were necessary or the part about the detective's time in Nam. But without those I guess it would have been too short a story. There were other parts I skimmed, too.To me the most real part was the description of the gullies and vegetation the detectives have to climb thru to find evidence. But more detail would have over done it.I am ordering another book by Crais and hope it is better.In the end I really cared little about any of the characters other than the detective and the boy. The others were one dimensional."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"A kidnapping all wrong.Another great read from Robert Crais. The Last Detective is about a kidnapping that is all wrong. Things just do not add up for the dynamic duo of Detective Elvis Cole and his partner Joe Pike from the get-go. Still the two persist to find the missing son of Cole's current lawyer girl friend. One twist leads to another turn as the crime becomes more and more confounding. Along the way we learn a great deal about just who Cole and Pike really are. Their military covert backgrounds are reviewed and come in very handy to solve the mystery of just who kidnapped the boy and why. Great climatic conclusion to an extremely well done detective story. 5 Stars all around for a terrific story that was tough to put down.No gratuitous sex, language or violence. One scene is quite graphic but artfully done.Character development was superb. I liked how we learned more and more about the two main protagonists Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. Mr. Crais is a master storyteller who brings all his characters to life with depth of background. I especially like how he wove Harry Bosch, of Michael Connelly literary fame, into one scene in the book. That was a touch of pure class that gave the story rich depth. Well done sir.Strong must read recommend. All of Robert Crais' stories are terrific and interrelated which gives the reader continuity. I feel like I am reading a biographical epic. I'm Looking forward to my next Crais novel with relish. Keep up the good writing Mr. Crais and Bravo for The Last Detective!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Crais' work resonates with me. Am reading all of them in as close to chronological order as possible. Enjoy each and every one."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I really enjoyed this novel by Crais. I think the thing that was great was the way that he weaves the past into the present. I have read several of his newer books and enjoy Elvis Cole and Joe Pike. They make a great team, but who are they? What brought them to this point in life?While developing the story of the kidnapping of Ben Chenier, the ten year old son of Lucy, Elvis new girlfriend, we have several backstories that are coming into play. The best of which is a historical review of Elvis Cole's childhood and days as an Army Ranger in Vietnam. I enjoyed learning more about what made Elvis the man he is today.The bonus is learning more about Joe Pike and how he developed into the fighting machine that he is. Pike is quiet, hard to read, and dangerous. But what comes to the top is the fact that he loves people deeply and loyally, just not that many.Elvis and Cole are willing to give their lives to rescue Ben and bring him home. But the odds are stacked against them, the men who kidnapped Ben are professional soilders and good at their trade craft. It makes Joe nervous because they may even be better than him, nobody should be better than him.The next twist, these men are wanted for international war crimes. The things they have done are hard to believe.So who hired them to kidnapp Ben, and what do they really want. Crass does a wonderful job of building the suspense and keeping you guessing. But in the end love and loyalty will rule the day.Enjoy."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"My first Crais novel. If you are a fan of this genre then it is a good read.

He has no idea what the kidnapper is talking about but the clock is ticking and Ben's time could run out.

I have read all the Crais novels, including Demolition Angel and Hostage, and, like Hostage, this is more of a script than an Elvis Cole novel. And it's not a mystery either. The average reader will figure out &quot;who done it&quot; right out of the gate.I think the author has toned down Elvis a little too much. Hey, this is fiction so it's okay if the main character is a character. It isn't necessary from him to be PC - in touch with his inner self. The early Cole novels seemed more colorful and descriptive. The Last Detective is all business from the beginning - as if it had to fit in the 90 minutes the studio will allow."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"After rattling off 7 humorous books, Robert Crais obviously got tired of writing snappy one-liners and witty slapstick and decided to get more serious with the Elvis Cole series. LA Requiem proved that he was heading in a new direction and the somber tone gets even darker with The Last Detective. The only problem is, the book is so damn somber that readers will be grabbing for the whisky bottle or the handgun (for suicide purposes) so often during this book that it's difficult to call this novel \\"enjoyable.\\"Robert Crais writing a serious book is somewhat like Jim Carrey trying to do a serious movie. In some ways it works and in some ways it doesn't. Crais is competent enough to pull it off to a certain extent, but fans of the witty Elvis Cole will find little to smile about during this story of kidnapping, Vietnam flashbacks, war crimes, family neglect and personal anguish. If you want a fun read, avoid this book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"A tough guy who loves Disney collectables and kids.

Wow. Also,they blamed me for attracting trouble?? In the previous book Joe almost got killed due to something related to the kid. Those two Cajuns were the cause of the trouble and blamed me!!

This is the Cole/Pike series, not the Cole/Pike series with a foul mouthed female Carol Starkey thrown in for good measure. After waiting several years for the series to pick up where it left off after L.A. Requiem I expected more from the book then what it offered. Joe Pike should have received more focus in the book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"First of all, I've been a huge fan of Elvis Cole and Robert Crais since I read The Monkey's Raincoat. This series has been incredibly enjoyable, to say the least. The turn that Crais took at LA Requiem was probably necessary to breath new life into the series and, in fact, that was my favorite of the bunch. The problem is that I miss the lighthearted banter! The new Elvis too closely resembles the real world, a world I'm trying to escape by reading these books in the first place. The biggest flaw with The Last Detective is the simple fact that I knew who done it the minute I read the story outline prior to actually reading the book. That occured while I was reading Indigo Slam a year ago! This is the first time ever in my experience that I knew who the guilty party in a mystery was before I even read the book. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it sure is incomprehesible to me that Elvis wouldn't have been immediately aware of who done it right away too. This book was written for new readers of the series who never picked up an Elvis Cole book prior to this. I enjoyed alot of the elements of this story but couldn't get past this part. The story would have been every bit as accessable to all potential readers if Elvis would have openly suspected the bad guy right from the start and then worked to prove him culpable. When his character walks around oblivious as to who done it, especially in light of many elements of the last 2 or 3 novels that point directly at the bad guy, this story lost alot for me. It's my least favorite in the franchise."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Robert Crais is there. This is his best Elvis Cole novel to date and it's just about perfect. I like a little more retribution when it's called for and I would have added another dab or two of the old ultra-violence, but that's a small cavil. The plotting is exquisite, the characterization touching, and the themes resonant and pulsating. I don't want to spoil anything, but the rearrangement of part of Elvis' life with a look ahead to future plots is wonderfully clever.I am one who thought (as he himself feared) that Crais revealed too much about Joe in the previous novel but the revelations about Elvis here are apt. They work very well, as do further revelations about Joe.Reader warning: this is not the joking, wisecracking Elvis of yore. Things are far more serious this time and the unrelenting plot and dark, driving tone are sustained throughout.Powerful stuff.

Although not the usual wisecracking Elvis (with good reason), perhaps, no definitly the best Elvis book yet. Amazingly intense. Great story on so many levels - the story itself of course, but also the depth of it. The story may be about a kidnapping (don't worry, you read about that in the first few pages!), but it is really &quot;about&quot; Elvis.I won't say much more about the story, cause since I'm the first reviewer (!), I don't want to spoil the enjoyment I had for anyone.

I AM CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE LAST DETECTIVE."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I would have given this five stars except for one thing. I saw the plot coming from the first.Still, it's exceptionally well written. Like the best mystery writers (Robert Barnard, Dick Francis, Robert B. Parker), Crais depends more on character than plot.His characters and quips sing.Elvis Cole and Joe Pike are the greatest twosome since Huck and Jim.And Crais handles well that perennial problem of the detective writer: What to Do with the Girlfriend?Leslie Fiedler, in Love and Death in the American Novel, was right. The classic American novels have no room for women. They are boys' stories--usually tight tight sidekicks.The same goes even more for detective stories, which are simply urban Westerns.Crais does a great job of getting rid of Cole's girlfriend, and making you still care about him and her.The best Cole book is still L.A. Requiem. But this is a close second.By the way, the set piece on Cole's experience in Viet Nam--A Bad Day at the Office--is spectacular."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis Cole is a private detective. He has a past--and until now, it's been a mystery. But someone is dragging Cole through his own dirt, and revealing the skeletons in his closet.Cole's girlfriend's son, Ben, has just been kidnapped. Whoever did it is a professional...he is used to stalking humans, and is NOT one for failure. Cole, along with his silent-but-deadly partner/friend Joe Pike, is about to enter a world where no one can be trusted, where danger lurks around every corner...and where hope may only be an illusion.Robert Crais is a great writer. Though he has written other novels with different characters (Carol Starkey, who appeared in his novel DEMOLITION ANGEL, plays a role here), his best have always been his Elvis Cole mysteries. An engaging and multi-leveled character, Elvis Cole is often overlooked in today's reading world...but shouldn't be. And neither should Crais. THE LAST DETECTIVE is a great, thrilling read by a great, engaging author."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I've just completed &quot;The Last Detective&quot;, and I'm sad it's over, yet satisfied I've just read a very good book. The struggling insights into himself Cole is wrestling out of his experiences and the further development of Pike's cracking rigidity make the story of a kidnapping far more than routine. There is a lot hidden within the lines of a well written story. I recommmend it highly. If you can read them in order, (the Elvis Cole stories - check the copyright dates for the order of publication)the full evolution of the series comes to light easier. However, each book loses nothing when read out of sequence."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Definitively RC is a six stars writer, the way he explains what are thinking all the characters at the same action in the book is excellent, the way he combine the characters of L.A. Requiem and Demolition Angel and explain them the easiest way so you don't have to read these books to understand this one is also excellent.The story of the kidnap and the way everybody is related to that won't let you put the book down until you finish it, but when the book is done, you will ask for more."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"One of the things Crais uses to add tension in this excellent book is the use of a running timeline. Each chapter begins with a reminder of how long it has been since 10 year old Ben, the son of Elvis's girlfriend, has disappeared. Elvis Cole feels particularly responsible, since Ben was under his care at the time. Then the kidnapper starts communicating mysterious messages referring to Elvis's Vietnam experience.The ending of this exciting tale is stunning. The motive behind the kidnapping turns out to be very dramatic, and the final scene with the kidnappers is one of the most exciting ones ever written. You will not be disappointed with this fast paced book."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"If you haven't discovered Elvis Cole yet, this may not be the best one for you to start with (but buy it and put it aside for when you finish the rest of the series.) This is one of the darkest books in the the series, but is fascinating in it's exploration of Elvis' past, Joe Pike's hidden insecurities (who knew?!), and how one man's overwhelming desire to have his way can lead to frightening consequences. I have to admit I saw where the story was going pretty early on - but despite that, I couldn't put the book down. I read it straight through and I think I'll probably read it again soon to pick up the finer details I zoomed past in my desire to see what happened next. As good as Spenser in his finer hours, this book is definitely worthy of a place in your library."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"See book summary above.A fast paced thriller that is sure to be one of Robert Crais' best. It hooks you at the beginning and doesn't let up until it's riveting conclusion. Most likely a book you'll read in one or two sessions.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I waited what seemed like an eternity for the release of this book and, like all truly great things, it was worth the wait.Lucy Chenier, you may recall, has moved from LA to L.A. to be with Elvis Cole, \\"the world's greatest detective\\", and then one fine afternoon while Lucy is away and Elvis and Ben, Lucy's 10-year-old son, are getting along famously, Ben vanishes. And Elvis soon falls into a maelstrom of evil as he searches for the missing boy with the aid of the singular Joe Pike and LAPD detective Carol Starkey (who you may remember from \\"Demolition Angel\\").The atmosphere is spine-tingling and the suspense is all but unbearable as Elvis and Joe put the pieces together to figure out who has Ben and why. The level of violence may even be kicked up a notch from Elvis's previous outings, and that is saying something. A complete tour de force would be an apt description of this novel. And then some. My only complaint is that it came, I gobbled it up, and now I have to wait a whole dang year for another Elvis fix.For my money, Robert Crais is the undisputed king of the hard-boiled detective genre. Long live the king!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I have loved this series since the first book, but with the last two, Crais has changed direction. Darker, deeper, more disturbing, nary a joke nor a one-liner in the entire novel. I can't say I'm altogether pleased. This book, quite frankly, is not as much fun as the first few in the series, but still, it works very well. Lucy says to Elvis that, &quot;These things don't happen to normal people.&quot; Of course, she's right. The reader has the option of accepting that Elvis and Joe are entirely not normal, or else concluding that the plots are contrived and unrealistic. I'm willing to go with the former. A writer as good as Crais deserves some poetic license, and I'm looking forward to many more volumes of Elvis and Joe in the not too distant future."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Kudos to Robert Crais for delivering another slam-bang Elvis Cole novel. This time around Elvis is searching for the kidnapped son of his girlfriend which is somehow linked to his time spent in Vietnam. This book is fabulous! I can't wait to read it again and I can't wait for the next one. Write faster, Robert!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis' girlfriend's son, Ben, gets kidnapped from the back of Elvis' house. The kidnapper calls and says it's because of Elvis' actions in Vietnam that the boy was taken. Elvis and Pike team-up again to find out who took Ben and get him back alive. Elvis is not his usual wise-cracking self, instead he's determined to do whatever it takes to get Ben back. The reader finds out more about Elvis' background in this outing, especially his military experiences in Vietnam. We also meet Carol Starkley, who readily agrees to help Elvis. Crais really ratchets up the intensity in this one. Even though the plot is a bit too predictable, the gunfight, at the end, is totally worth it!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I received this as a free audio book, so I should not complain. It was more of a MAN's mystery than I am use to reading. All characters were very predictable. The only females were overly emotional or sexual. The \\"mystery of the book\\" I had figured out really early so there was no really surprise element to this book. It had an excellent flash back to Vietnam, I got the feeling that the author was there. All in all, not a bad book, I'm glad I listened to it."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"as with the other Cole books, the book isan excellent fast read. I read it in one day.The story moves fast and the tone is darker thansome of the other Cole books.It does become obvious to the reader what is reallyhappening long before the characters in the book see it, butit is still a fun ride."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Robert Crais has had an arc to his career that has been interesting, to say the least. Crais started out writing cute, relatively straightforward, violent private eye novels. He's sort of grown into a more serious novelist, an introspective, careful writer whose characters are deep and interesting. He mad the break some years ago with L.A. Requiem, which gave us a good deal of background on Joe Pike, the partner of the main character and narrator of the books, Elvis Cole. Since, he's written a couple of stand alone novels. This latest book is a return to Pike and Cole, and it's the companion to L.A. Requiem, except this time we learn stuff about Cole rather than Pike.Several books ago, Cole developed a girlfriend from New Orleans. Lucy has a son, and they moved to L.A. to be with Cole. Elvis is watching the son, Ben, one day, and he goes to do something; when he returns, Ben is nowhere to be seen. When Elvis begins to look for her, he becomes convinced that the people who took Ben are more clever or well-trained than any one else initially suspected.The one quibble I had with the book was the switching points of view. I don't like this writing technique. I know that it's difficult to write from the first person perspective, and I know this is a stylish choice to make, and a big temptation: it allows you to tell the story with more dimensions to it. It doesn't matter to me: I still hate it.Other than that, I enjoyed the book immensely, and would recommend it."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"In this Elvis Cole mystery we are greeted with a much more serious Elvis than in previous books. Gone is the playful, eyebrow wiggling, wisecracking detective and in his place is a more introspective desperate man. Of course, the case he is working on has a lot to do with this after his girlfriend's son, 10 year old Ben, is kidnapped.During the desperate search for clues as to who has taken Ben we are treated to a detailed look into Elvis' past. The emphasis is definitely on a sober accounting of his past as his actions of many years ago are called into question. Meanwhile, back to the present day, Elvis not only has to deal with the kidnappers, he is hampered from all sides by just about everyone, from the Hollywood detectives, to his girlfriend's ex-husband. He finds an ally in one of the detectives, Carol Starkey, the protagonist in an earlier Crais book, Demolition Angel.I thought this was an excellent and much needed get to know you story for all long time Elvis Cole fans. It probably won't mean as much to those who've never tried an Elvis Cole book before, but it still contains a fine thriller that should satisfy most readers."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective is the first Robert Crais novel I've ever read, but I have a feeling it won't be my last. The novel is a gripping, compelling read--the story of a young boy's kidnapping and the desperate search by those who love him to get him back. Elvis Cole is watching his girl friend's son Ben while she is away travelling when Ben mysteriously disappears. Has he been kidnapped, or has he merely run away? Do the kidnappers have anything to do with Elvis' past, or is it something else? These are some of the questions Elvis and co. struggle with while trying to find Ben. The novel is well-written, full of smart dialogue, very enjoyable. Have fun."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I've read all the series.. I would recommend this as being the best. The theme of The Last Detective is kidnapping. A story line, in which the past events in the lives of Joe and, in particular, Elvis cleverly intermingle. How Elvis was landed with his Christian name and a harrowing account of what happened on a tour of duty in Vietnam. I think that these further insights into their characters are due and very worthwhile. Gone is the structured routine of question and interviews by Elvis, in his previous role as the wise cracking PI. Instead he is under the cosh right from the start as blame is laid onto him for the kidnapping of his girlfriend's young son. It would seem, that someone from Elvis's past is responsible. Joe Pike is much more involved in the action in The Last Detective. Rather than just making fleeting \\"guest\\" appearances as in the previous books. And the pressure is really on. Not only to clear the name of Elvis, but to locate the missing child. The pair working together, ducking and diving the bullets, make a tough combination. It has a cracking ending. Exciting, loaded with suspense."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I first stumbled across Robert Crais and his hero Elvis Cole (yes I know goofy name, but all will be explained) a few years ago. As an avid reader, it was one of those moments where I put down the book (Monkey's Raincoat) and knew that I had discovered a new favorite author. This guy just knows his stuff. His latest \\"The Last Detective\\" is no exception. Elvis is caught in a frantic struggle to rescue his girlfriend's young son, and his captors are as good as (or maybe better than) Joe Pike and Elvis himself. As you are nearing the last chapters of this book, find a quiet place and turn off the phones....and take some deep breaths!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"If you haven't read any of the Elvis Cole mysteries, you will enjoy meeting &quot;The Last Detective.&quot; If you are familiar with Elvis, the wisecracking private eye, and his enigmatic partner Joe Pike, you may be surprised by the somber tone of the newest installment of Robert Crais's excellent series. Either way, strap yourself in. This is one hell of a read.Continuing the themes (and form) of &quot;L.A. Requiem,&quot; Crais explores the past of his protagonist, fleshing out two of the more complex characters in genre literature. Cole and Pike are revealed in scene after tension-filled scene. The subtle moments never slow down the plot. From the dread-filled prologue on, &quot;The Last Detective&quot; is relentless.And no tidy endings. There are real consequences for everyone.The best &quot;thrillers&quot; convince the reader to share the &quot;thrill.&quot; Crais runs that through an amp, turning up the volume until we cringe, because- and here's the trick- we care about his characters. &quot;The Last Detective&quot; gave me an emotional hangover that lasted two days. Part mystery, part thriller, part Greek tragedy, this book takes an honored place on my &quot;favorites&quot; shelf."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Compared to the other books in the Elvis Cole series, this was not as suspenseful. Maybe Crais was wanting to show a different side of Cole and Joe Pike, but I had got used to their personalities and complementary natures.This was not a book to put down, however, and with the ending, I expect Crais has given us a cliff hanger to the next in the series.Recommend to buy, but wait till paperback."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Robert Crais is best known for his signature character, L.A. Private Investigator Elvis Cole. Crais, however, is too talented a craftsman to rely on a single character, as demonstrated by his recent successes with the brilliant DEMOLITION ANGEL and HOSTAGE. Still, Crais could not keep Cole away forever and, at long last, has given us THE LAST DETECTIVE, a new Elvis Cole novel that will not only sate the appetites of Cole's fan base but also anyone who is a fan of the suspense genre. This is a book that will make you happy that someone took the time to teach you how to read.Crais wastes very little time in setting things up in THE LAST DETECTIVE. Cole's relationship with longtime love Lucy Chenier, already strained by the violence that plagues Cole's life, is further sundered when Chenier's son, Ben, disappears while Cole is babysitting him. Cole initially believes that Ben has temporarily run away due to the strain between Cole and Chenier, but a menacing telephone call soon demonstrates that Ben has been deliberately abducted for reasons of revenge having to do with Cole's dark past. At the same time, Cole's partner, Joe Pike, is dealing with the aftermath of injuries he sustained during the events of L.A. REQUIEM and finds himself unsure of his limits and abilities at a time when they, and he, will be tested to their utmost.Complicating matters further is the arrival of Richard Chenier, Lucy's ex-husband, a wealthy and obnoxious industrialist who attempts to take over the investigation. A surprise and welcome return also occurs with the prominent reappearance of Carol Starkey, introduced in DEMOLITION ANGEL and now working in the LAPD Juvenile Division. As Cole and Pike, the police and Richard Chenier conduct their investigations, often at cross-purposes, into Ben's disappearance, Cole is forced to confront his history and his life --- and how these elements affect those whom he loves. Crais, meanwhile, writes as if he is working against the stopwatch, ratcheting the suspense level up, up, up until it is almost painful. You won't get even a quarter of the way through this book without putting the completion of reading it on the top of your &quot;to do&quot; list.Be forewarned: this is a dark tale, one that eschews the wisecracking Cole of old. There is no humor here, no happy ending. The reader is given new insight not only into Cole, but also into Pike, perhaps one of the most interesting secondary characters in detective fiction since Robert Parker's Hawk. Pike is one of those people who would frighten you, even if he was on your side. God help you if he was coming for you. Seemingly invincible in previous Elvis Cole novels, Pike is slower, more vulnerable and, ultimately, more believable in THE LAST DETECTIVE. He is all the more frightening for it.If you haven't read anything by Crais for a while, or if you have never encountered him before, THE LAST DETECTIVE is a great place to begin the experience. Just leave some time to explore the backlist of this underrated author who is slowly but inexorably receiving the attention he has so long deserved. Highly recommended.--- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"\\"The Last Detective\\" is a bit of a departure from Robert Crais' standard Elvis Cole fare. The usually wisecracking Cole is subdued; the unflappable Joe Pike at times uncertain and and even shaken. The plot, centered around the kidnapping of Cole-girlfriend Lucy Chenier's young son, explains the somber tone, as few scenarios are more disturbing than one in which a child's life is in jeopardy. The author's treatment of the characters is more developed than in previous installments, dispassionately exposing the brutal and troubled pasts of both Cole and Pike. Considering the deteriorating relationship between Cole and Chenier, LAPD inter-office politics, the arrogant and scheming father of the boy, and a trio of truly bad... criminals, this is one dark and foreboding tale. There is ample mystery and some intersting twists, complemented by some very convincing crime scene forensics and detective work. Crais pulls this all off with his usual efficient grace and style, spinning a tight drama that once underway builds to a riveting and non-formulaic conclusion.If there is a criticism - and this is minor - it is a unsettling sense that with the number of important issues uncovered, there were simply not enough pages allowed to adequately address them all. I couldn't help feeling that an over zealous editor stripped away much of the author's intended content which, while not confusing the story, leaves a vaguely unfinished feeling to some of the most important messages Crais apparently wants to convey.But don't let this put you off. \\"The Last Detective\\" is a solid and fast read, unique in the series, and well worth the investment of time and money. As always, I'll be anxiously awaiting his next effort."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Wow, I was totally blown away by The Last Detective. This is easily the best book I have read this year, and one of the best detective novels I have read in the last 5 years. After two stand alone novels, Demolition Angel, and Hostage, Crais goes back to his signature character Elvis Cole and delivers a powerful story you will not soon forget. The Last Detective has everything you look for in a crime novel, plot, suspense, twists, dialog, character development, and action. Robert Crais again proves he is one of the top authors in the genre."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Although there are thousands of books called &quot;Thrillers,&quot; veryfew really are. But this one is one of those rare ones wherethe label is deserved. The author weaves a complex story withmany characters and multiple story lines, and this is a storythat is genuinely difficult to put down in the middle.Hero Elvis Cole is about to settle down with his love interestand her young son, and he has probably never been happier, whensuddenly the boy disappears. Cole tries not to panic, but can'tquite succeed, and he calls his partner and buddy, Joe Pike, tohelp. Pike is a major character alone, and his contributionto this story is almost a novel in itself.And the bad guys.....They are depraved almost beyond reality,but we realize, with fear, that some people do exist who thinkand act like these, and we share Cole's feeling that time isrunning out on the young boy we are searching for.Plus, the bad guys, who are bad enough, seem to be getting someinside information that makes the job Cole and Pike have to dobecome almost impossible. The cops are suspicious of all thedetails the criminals have access to, and they are too quick toblame Cole and Pike, and, as usual, they try to keep these twoPIs out of the action and investigation.But only Cole has the information and the ability to analyzewhat is going on and to be able to reach for the boy, whilecombatting experienced killers.His girl friend's ex- is quickly on the scene, causing allsorts of trouble with his wild accusations, coupled with moneyand influence, and he misdirects the investigation because ofhis own feelings, and the story gets more complex as it goes on.But this is a story that is quite engaging, and it is difficultto lay aside in the middle.Very interesting as a thriller and as a novel delving into thepsychology of people and their incredibly complex internal motivations.Quite recommended."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I could not stop reading! This is the first Robert Crais book I have ever read and can't wait to get my hands on the rest. Few books make me actually cry and cheer.Damn, this was good!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective by the amazing Robert Crais, is another Elvis Cole and Joe Pike action packed, suspense, thriller. It just doesn't get any better than this.Elvis Cole is taking care Lucy's son Ben (10 years old), when is disappears of the patio. He searches for Ben but to no avail. Shortly thereafter, Elvis receives a call saying that Ben has been kidnapped. This is an excellent story with Elvis and Joe investigating, kicking ass, shooting, fighting...the whole ball of wax.. A brilliant page-turner filled with suspense. This is a must read."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I always enjoy an Elvis Cole novel, and I enjoyed this one. I don't share the disappointment that others have expressed over the lack of one-liners and offbeat characters in this novel; I think that their absence is completely in character with the stakes being too personally high for humor.Crais has made one very serious mistake, though. In Indigo Slam, Lucy's ex-husband Richard comes to Cole's office with an investigator who works for his company. Richard is a lawyer, his company is involved in international oil, but Richard is not.However, in The Last Detective, Richard is now the owner of an international natural gas company, not a lawyer. OK, I could handle that perhaps he'd swindled his way into ownership of a company without the readers being informed, but in Last, when Cole first goes to Lucy's apartment to meet with the detectives, he knocks and the door is answered \\"by someone [he'd] never met before, Lucy's ex-husband, Richard Chenier.\\"I HATE it when writers forget plot points and have characters saying or doing things that are inconsistent with things revealed in earlier books, but I have to say that this is one of the most glaring such mistakes that I have ever come across. Whoever proofreads and edits Robert Crais' books for these issues should be fired."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Having read the books before and after this, I'm writing my review from that perspective. But reading to book at the time, I really enjoyed it just as it was -- not knowing what would come later.This book focused on Elvis Cole but really brought in more of his partner, Joe Pike (my personal favorite). Elvis is in love. He's watching his lover's son, Ben, when the boy is kidnapped. Naturally, his girlfriend blames him and starts to see all his flaws, as well as what a \\"violent\\" person he is, along with Joe, even though only the two of them can save young Ben. You really have to feel for Elvis, because he truly loves this woman (though I found her rather annoying) and, without giving away any spoilers, none of this was his fault.This was a good installment in the series. Again, Robert Crais manages to write a book with enough backstory that you don't have to be a regular reader to pick up this book. You can start anywhere in the series and understand what's going on. At the same time, he doesn't annoy his regular readers with too much backstory, but gives a little more history of the characters each time. You really saw Elvis suffer this time, and the complexity of the relationship between him and Joe Pike.Do yourself a favor and read every Robert Crais novel you can. And then read them again. I think I've read \\"L.A. Requiem\\" three times, at least."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This was my first Robert Crais book...he was recommended to me by my BFF who is an avid reader of his.I live in L.A., so maybe that's why I connected with it so easily... but this was also just one of those books I could NOT bear to put down. His character Elvis had me so intrigued as to what lengths he would go to rescue that kidnapped boy, I just had to keep going with it!It will be fun now too, to go back and see what I missed in Elvis' earlier adventures. Thanks Mr. Crais...well done!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"THE LAST DETECTIVE is the ninth book in Robert Crais's \\"Elvis Cole\\" series dealing with the adventures of a private detective working in Los Angeles. While not nearly as great as LA REQUIEM, the prior installment, this is still a very well done thriller.This is pretty much a kidnapping drama, involving the young son of Elvis Cole's girlfriend, Lucy Chenier. Soon after the boy is kidnapped, the kidnappers announce that they are kidnapping the child to pay Cole back for atrocities he committed in Vietnam. This plot development gives Crais an excuse to delve into Cole's childhood and his experiences as a young soldier. These flashback scenes, which really flesh out Cole as a character, are probably the best part of the novel.THE LAST DETECTIVE has the same serious tone as LA REQUIEM, and lacks the cartoonish nature of the earlier Cole books. The writing is crisp, and Crais does a good job of ratcheting up the tension. The only major downside of this novel is that the final twist is highly predictable, and Crais gets a little too cute by sticking a character from another one of his novels (DEMOLITION ANGEL) in a thankless supporting role.All things considered, THE LAST DETECTIVE is yet another solid entry in the Elvis Cole series. It's worth delving into, although I would recommend reading LA REQUIEM first, if you haven't already done so."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Crais is a favorite of mine because he takes chances and seems to grow with his characters. For four years, fans have been waiting for a new Elvis Cole book -- and this tense, fast paced story will not disappoint many!Be prepared for the darker tone we saw in L.A. Requiem; there is little for Elvis to wisecrack about; no one has brought him a case to strategically solve, instead he's vilified as the party responsible for the kidnap of Ben Chenier. Crais gives us strong dialogue and emotion, change ups in the story's point of view, some blind alleys and some down right insightful detective work.Layers of Elvis' past evolve, and, for the first time, we see Joe Pike as vulnerable and unsure. Crais adds Carol Starkey, tough cop from &quot;Demolition Angel&quot; as the Juvenile cop assigned to the case. Starkey and Elvis are a potent mix.True responsibility for the kidnapping is somewhat easy to guess, but Crais makes up for it by insuring that the story ends in a way that much of life does...everybody loses, but some lose more than most.If there is a better writer in this genre today than Crais, please let me know who he/she is! Crais' work is outstanding...Highly recommended, but more so if you've read previous novels in the Cole series. You can't invest as much in Elvis and Joe as characterized here, unless you've glimpsed the past."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"What can I say about Robert Crais and his Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series that I haven't said before? In my opinion, he is simply the greatest author out there and I knew I didn't have to wonder about whether I would enjoy THE LAST DETECTIVE. It was simply excellent!Elvis is watching his girlfriend Lucy's 10 year old son Ben while she is out of town, and in a matter of minutes he vanishes. After searching for him and having no luck he gets a phone call from someone telling him that the boy has been kidnapped as &quot;payback for what he did.&quot; Poor Elvis has no idea who this person is and contacts the police, but you can bet he is determined to find Ben himself with Joe Pike's help and of course there is never a dull moment. I read it in less than a day because I could not bring myself to put it down.Robert Crais reveals a part of Elvis that we've never known, and around that writes an excellent story that gives the reader an example of how important having family and friends in our everyday lives is. Although it is filled with the usual suspence of a Crais novel, it is at the same time a touching story.Add this novel to your MUST READ list now. If you are a Robert Crais fan, or have never read his novels before, you will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"It was worth the four-year wait for Elvis Cole to return in \\"The Last Detective\\" by Robert Crais. I read it in less than 24 hours.The plot catapults at a relentless pace. Down-to-earth, practical detective work is what solves the crime in this ticking clock child kidnapping. Since the child is the son of Elvis Cole's girl friend, the hunt is both personal and professional...and therefore all the more chilling,The point of view switches between the characters (Elvis is in the first person) is smooth as silk and most engaging.The reader learns the clues as they unfold for Elvis, going thru the stages of frustration to hope to possibility to solution with Elvis and his archangel Joe Pike.The supporting cast, especially Carol Starkey (from \\"Demolition Angel\\") is outstanding.We learn a lot of Elvis' past via flashbacks that propel the plot. The scene from his Vietnam days is as intense as any I have read.It is a compelling novel that truly showcases depth of Robert Crais as a writer.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I have been a fan of Robert Crais since I was first captured by Crais's unique and enjoyable style in &quot;Freefall&quot; in the early 90's. &quot;Freefall&quot; was my first Elvis Cole novel, and I was immediately hooked. He quickly became one of my favorite authors. I went on to read every other Cole book I could find, and was sad to see &quot;Hostage&quot; and &quot;Demolition Angel&quot; come out in place of another Elvis story. I was, however, NOT disappointed in either book, as for stand alone novels, these were top notch, well done, fast paced stories that kept you on the edge of your seat.I was beyond thrilled to hear that Crais was working on another Cole story. But when I got the hard copy of &quot;The Last Detective&quot; in my hands after a very long 4 year wait, I am sorry to say I was highly disappointed.Gone from this book was Elvis's witty one liners, his fun sense of humor and cast of quirky, odd-ball secondary characters. The thing I've always loved about Elvis is that lying underneath his good-natured humor was a man with good morals, who was absolutely dead serious about getting the job done. Every Elvis book in the past has dealt with serious issues, but not once did Elvis loose the light hearted way in which he dealt with these issues. Unfortunately, that is not the case with &quot;The Last Detective&quot;.There is absolutely no humor in this book, and it is full of darkness, moodiness and a lot of military psycho-babble, which is hard to follow at times and a bit dry. The story is a bit slow, and jumps back and forth from being told in first to third person, making the pace of an already choppy book even choppier. Although I enjoyed &quot;Demolition Angel&quot; and did sympathize with Carol Starkey's dark, moody and foul-mouthed character, and while I applaud Crais's decision to intertwine Starkey with Elvis, I do not think they would make a good romantic pairing, which it appears (if the end of &quot;The Last Detective&quot; is any indication) that Crais is considering for future Cole novels.The one good part of this book was learning more of Elvis's past. Though that is something I've been longing to be revealed, I would have preferred it to have been done differently somehow, perhaps within in-depth, soul-searching discussions between Elvis and Lucy, or even Elvis and Pike.All of this said, I am still a huge Crais fan, and will anticipate Crais's next Elvis Cole release. I can only hope that future stories will revert back to his older style of writing, the one which we've come to know and love."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Private investigator Elvis Cole and his longtime girlfriend Lucy Chenier are having a tough time making their relationship work. Lucy left her life in Louisiana to be with Elvis in Los Angeles even though she knew the transition would be a hard one, especially for her ten year-old son Ben, but she never dreamed the violence of the city would touch her.While Lucy is away on business, Elvis is left in charge of Ben, and after a week of quality bonding time, Ben disappears without a trace. Confused as to what has happened, Elvis believes the boy ran away, until a mysterious phone call explains a much more sinister scenario...The caller states that he has the boy and it's payback for what Elvis has done.Now with the help of his partner Joe Pike and LAPD Detective Carol Starkey, Elvis must race the clock to save Ben and the key to doing this is a long buried secret from his past.The highly anticipated \`The Last Detective' is easily the best novel yet from Robert Crais, and that's saying a lot! From page one I was held captive by the gripping plot, well drawn characters and shocking twists. Readers of the previous Cole novels will see this as his best outing, and fans of \`Demolition Angel' will welcome the appearance of Carol Starkey.Robert Crais is one of our finest writers of suspense fiction, and with each new novel he gets better and better. With a writing style that is sharp and smooth, pacing that is pitch perfect and plots so tight and suspenseful, Crais creates novels that are intense reading experiences.Expect to see \`The Last Detective' on all the bestseller lists. This truly is a MUST read page-turner, one that I finished in one sitting.Nick Gonnella"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective was the first Elvis Cole book that I read. I enjoyed the author's previous two novels, Demolition Angel and Hostage, and I thought that I'd give this one a try despite the fact that I had not read any of the previous Elvis Cole books. Usually, if I'm reading a series, I like to read them in order, but I never felt lost or uninformed when I was reading this one, even though there are eight books before it. If you haven't read anything in this series, you can pick this book up and read it as a stand-alone - it's that good.This novel is plotted well and moves quickly. Probably the thing I enjoyed the most about it was the idea that the kidnapping was solved through realistic detective work rather than convoluted coincidences and luck. Also, I usually don't like books that revolve around a child kidnapping, since its really an easy way to create false suspense, but The Last Detective rises above the typical kidnapping story.Crais also switches point of view between at least four people throughout the story. The same event is seen through the eyes of several characters, though Cole is the only one who reads as in first person. There are not many authors who can pull this off, and the result for those who try is usually confusion and unnecessary repetition. However, Crais switches back and forth seamlessly and his use of multiple points of view actually adds to the story. It's interesting, for example, to read about the same event through the eyes of Cole, then get a different perspective on the same thing through the eyes of Ben, a child.This is a series that I now look forward to reading. The characters are worthwhile and compelling, especially Pike. I was often reminded of James Patterson's Alex Cross series, with the interplay between Cole and Pike comparable to that between Cross and Sampson. If you enjoy those books, you'd enjoy this one. While Patterson relies on action and violence, Crais' work contains more police procedural work. He's like a mix of Patterson and Michael Connelly. In all, this book is certainly worth your time."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This was my first read of a Robert Crais novel; a recommendation from a friend. It won't be my last Crais novel and I owe that friend dinner. Crais' lexicon is the requisite tough \\"private dick-speak\\" but his storyline is elegant and intellectual. No offense to Mr. Spillane or Mr. Simmons but THE LAST DETECTIVE has overtones of a Mike Hammer or Joe Kurtz but is stratafied cerebrally higher. And, who can't love a hero named Elvis?In strange fashion, particularly to a new reader of Crais, the prologue begins with a test of man against beast. The reader is introduced (RE-introduced for Crais vets) to Pike, who is in Alaska laser-focused on killing what is believed to be a rabid bear. The short prologue is intense but disjointed until later in the book.As the book begins...Our hero, Elvis Cole, is in a romantic relationship with Lucy (Luce) Chenier, an attorney cum TV personality. When Lucy takes an out-of-town assignment, she asks Elvis to sit for her 10-year old son, Ben. Before the reader is through the first few pages (subsequent to the prologue), Ben is kidnapped from the backyard of Elvis' house. Soon, Elvis receives a phone call from the kidnapper who tells him he's taken Ben as \\"payback\\" for \\"what you did\\" when Elvis was part of an Army Ranger outfit in Vietnam.When the police arrive, Detective Carole Starkey and Elvis explore the slope behind his house and discover Ben's footprints stop abruptly. Upon closer inspection, Elvis finds a single heel print left in the soil by the kidnapper. As Cole continues his search, he realizes the kidnapper is extremely dangerous and will be difficult to corner. Why? Because, based on the lack of tracks or signs of struggle, Cole believes the kidnapper has a military background similar to his own, something scaring Cole to extreme levels. It's at this point Elvis summons his dark friend, Joe Pike.Elvis and Lucy's relationship begins to disintegrate quickly when Lucy's super-rich ex-husband shows up and another telephone call from the kidnapper is placed, this time to Lucy. The kidnapper contends that Ben's kidnapping is Cole's fault and retribution for his atrocities in Vietnam. This immediately puts a dark spotlight on Cole generating doubt from Lucy, anger from Lucy's ex, and scrutiny from the police. Cole painfully disregards the kidnapper's allegations and sinks his teeth into the investigation with his lethal sidekick, Pike.The climax of this book takes the reader into an abyss of adrenaline. Although a relatively short book, Crais has mastered the art of grabbing the reader by the heart and squeezing until the very end. Crais definitely has set the ending toward another installment in the Cole series albeit different as the relationship between Elvis and Lucy is dubious at best.This is a five-star book however, there were any number of passages alludign to Cole's childhood that somewhat 'cluttered' the book. Now, this background expose may have been important to seasoned readers of Crais but to a new reader, it was filler. However, I am open to the fact that had I read the Cole novels chronologically, this may have been poignant. Regardless, this is an incredibly fast-paced, intoxicating novel, which I highly recommend."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I have read nearly all of Crais' novels, and found this the least enjoyable. Not only was it very dark and lacking in humor, but the plot was simplistic and the person ultimately responsible for the kidnapping was faily obvious early on."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Would I buy this book? Yes. Why? I came in with and admit I struggled through Voodoo River. This one is just a lot better. Crais had a tough time setting up the Elvis Cole/ Lucy Chernier relationship the former novel, subsequent work seems to have made the writer comfortable with the device, and he works it into the plot structure (I don't think it gives anything away to reveal that by the end of the novel we learn that Lucy's ex is a good/bad guy. Could he reprise?) Joe Pike and Elvis Cole also develop as characters via flashbacks to childhood, wartime and other experiences entangled with plot events . In all of this Crais' prose is clear and driving toward the conclusion. There is little wasted space in this novel. No philosophizing a la Tom Clancy over nature of BAD/bad guys nor confrontation by forces of good with suchlike. ( I thought that ground was covered in &quot;The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence&quot;) Cole and Pike smite the wicked. Curiously, however, as Cole becomes more human he loses some charm. The wisecracking,rogue &quot;world's greatest detective&quot; is now more the world's toughest detective. This may be as far as this can go without Crais losing the character, but for the time being, ENJOY."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"all i can say is, this book was damn worth the wait and the delay. A compelling, very fast-paced book, this is an immensely welcome return to his brilliant duo (probably the best detective team in all fiction) Elvis Cole and Joe Pike.An approximation of the plot is quite simple: Ben Chenier, son of Elvis's longterm girlfriend Lucy, goes missing, and then they recieve a sinister phonecall rom the kidnappers, clearly signalling that the disapperance is an act of terribly vengeance for something that Elvis did when he was a young solider in Vietnam...Of course, things are slightly more complicated than that. Richard, Lucy's ex-husband and Ben's father, has never liked her relationship with Elvis, convinced that it can only put his son into danger, and he blazes into town from Louisianna, and desperately tries to close Elvis out from the case. Cue much squabbling, arguing, and going it alone.We also see the return of Carol Starkey (of Demolition Angel fame), whose now working on the uvenile services unit. Coarse and hared edged as ever, she goes above and beyond the call of duty trying to keep Elvis and Joe in the loop as they desperately seek clues concerning Ben's disappearance.This is a long-awaited novel, and it delivers everything that is expected of it. While L.A. Requiem was really Joe Pike's book, The Last Detective is really about Elvis, and there are some incredibly moving insights into his past re Vietnam and his boyhood. One or two scenes may even lead long-term readers of the series who have grown to care immeaureably for Elvis, the PI who dont like to grow up, yet who is older than his years, to shed a few tears.It's very fast-paced, exciting, and very well written. If anything, im slightly disappointed that i let myself read it so quickly, because now i know i have quite a long an torturous while to wait for a new Elvis and Joe adventure!If you've not read anything in the series before, what are you waiting for??? Go to \\"The Monkey's Raincoat\\" and devour your way through. If you're an existing fan, what are you waiting for??? This is another Elvis and Joe book, for heavens sake!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"ExcellentThis review requires that I write ten more words.

Enjoy."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Elvis and Joe present a clear and compelling picture of what it's like to be in the world of crime / lowlifes. Despite the best intentions of trying to have a normal relationship, factors enter in to force one to examine all the possible effects of the other parts of your life. Might not be the best of the series, but it still makes quick turning of the pages a requirement to real enjoyment. Book was well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"This was my first book by Robert Crais and I love it. It was good from start to finish. His writing style seems similar to Michael Connelly and just a good. Love it when I find another author to add to my favorites!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"There is no excess in the book... Lean and mean. Ready to go and go it does. Within five minutes Crais takes the reader on a roller coaster chase for a kidnapped child. I can see the movie already.About the people in the book: people don't change. They get more like they always were. Good guys, bad guys and all the others, too. What they do and how they do it all fit with who they are and what drives them.This was a great sit down and read the whole thing cover to cover book. Later you think about the people."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective is my fourth Robert Crais novel and my second Elvis Cole novel. I read the Cole novels based on the audiobook availability at the library, so I ended up reading The Forgotten Man before The Last Detective. In The Forgotten Man, you find out the major twist in The Last Detective. I actually enjoyed The Last Detective knowing the twist that was to come and trying to pick out the clues and red herrings given by Crais.The Last Detective on its own is a great novel. I've only read two in the series, but already know so much about Cole and his sidekick Joe Pike. Crais uses flashbacks to describe Cole's time in Vietnam. The use of flashbacks could be frowned upon as taking away from the plot, but in this novel, they are so vivid, and so real, that they are quite enjoyable.This novel begins when Elvis is nearing the end of a 5-day babysitting job with his girlfriend Lucy's son, Ben. Lucy is on her way home when Elvis can't find Ben. Elvis quickly discovers that Ben is missing. Later that evening, with the police (Carol Starkey from Demolition Angel) and Lucy present, Elvis gets a call from the kidnappers saying they have Ben and they took him to punish Cole for the atrocities he committed in Viet Nam. Ben's wealthy father, Richard, arrives with his entourage of security personnel and Richard declares he will find Ben himself. Richard hates Cole for taking Lucy and his son away from him.You can feel Lucy and Cole's desparation to find Ben. The fear and panic are real. Crais stumbles a bit on the timeline regarding how the kidnappers handled Ben. Not a major complaint, but did the kid ever eat or go to the bathroom. This novel is fast paced and enjoyable and strong enough to wet my appetite for more Cole and Pike novels."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Having never read a novel by Crais, my comments don't relate to prior Elvis Cole books. But this book stands on its own as an interesting and attention demanding distraction. The overall plot turns out to be one that relies on the unlikely events that happen in an action film, rather than the character depth of a superior novel. That's ok by me because the pace is great and the asides on the backgrounds of Fallon, Cole, and Pike are really well done."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Pretty tired story line with a few cosmetic changes. I became impatient with the switch of story from character to character. It didn't seem to be any more effective than straight telling.At the end, I skimmed because of the switching, predictable ending, etc."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Read it in a morning.....and lots I was supposed to do, too. I may have to seek a higher power.....Now, we have to wait another year for the next one....."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I haven't read The Last detective yet, but I'm concerned about an error in the Publisher's Weekly review. It says we haven't seen Elvis since Indigo Slam. That's incorrect, but other people may have that misperception because IS was recently re-released after years out of print. The last Elvis book was LA Requiem, and, as others have said here, LOTS happened in that book to change Elvis and Joe Pike's characters. So, if you are the kind of person who likes to read stories in order, make sure to read publication dates carefully. It's worth it, to get Elvis's story straight in your head...happy reading!"},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Mr. Crais is a very good writer, unfortunately this in not his best effort. I believe the publish date was pushed back --- should have been pushed back further. Read all his other books and save this one for last. Not one of those to recommend or read again."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"Please note the rating is provisional - I suspect it will bump up to a five by the time I finish...I have been waiting a long time to read this book, a continuation of the Elvis Cole/Joe Pike series. In addition to the resolution of the mystery and the smart-ass humor, I've always appreciated how the friendship of Elvis and Joe has been explored in each book.The Last Detective further develops the character of Elvis Cole: the mysteries of his upbringing and his Vietnam experiences, all filtered through the search for Ben Chenier, son of Cole's girlfriend, Lucy.So far, I have already been moved to tears by descriptions of the young Elvis, the battle scene is harrowing, and although I hope for a happy ending, I can't see where Crais is leading me in this story. I'm grateful for that fact. He also has a way of making the reader care about his characters, even those who might only appear for a few pages. They grow and develop; no cardboard people here. He even makes LA look good to this native San Franciscan!Be sure to read (or re-read) LA Requiem; events in The Last Detective are influenced by the previous book. And if you have never read Robert Crais, begin with The Monkey's Raincoat and read the series in order. You'll read straight through and I promise you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"I LOVE Robert Crais and Elvis and especially Joe, but this one was so much like some of the others, I kept thinking &quot;have I already read this book?&quot; Same old, same old. Crais needs to get away from bad guys stalking Elvis' girlfriend and her son in so many books, and get back to what he used to do so well...detective stories with strange characters that highlight Elvis' intelligence and Joe Pike coming to the rescue."},{"Title":"Last Detective","review":"The Last Detective is, indeed, compelling reading from the first page...fast-paced, brutal at times, always pure Crais/Cole! The only disappointment was the solution of the kidnapping...a little bit contrived/unrealistic in my mind...but it's the kind of solution that satisfies the reader's human nature, too!"},{"Title":"Silver Star","review":"It's hard to believe I purchased this novel over 14 years ago and that I continue to read and greatly enjoy it almost every year but such was Stirling Silliphant's writing skills.What makes this story and the two that came before so appealing is the main character's use of first person narrative to explain what happens as he,John Locke, learns he has a half-Vietnamese son living in Hanoi who Locke feels must be rescued from the &quot;Workers' Paradise&quot;.Silver Star's strength and attraction come from the way the author combines this primary cause with several other reasons for Locke to sail his beloved vessel Steel Tiger from Indonesia to Thailand and then,with the help of many unusual and colorful individuals you can only find living in the &quot;weird&quot; spots of Southeast Asia,penetrate into Laos and Vietnam to get his son away from Hanoi.If you want action,adventure and messy violence,this is an excellent literary path to trend.On the other hand,this manuscript will give you emotional concepts well worth contemplating,humor and the kind of understanding and love for a part of the world that can only be fully displayed by those who have spent time there as more than two-week tourists.Many things have changed since this story was written all those years ago but what remains is the author's unique skills with plot,geography,culture and the most endearing of characterization.Purchase this masterpiece, read and enter the thinking man's nirvanna that will also make you dream of thick jungles and sailing ships skimming the waters of the Third World."},{"Title":"Silver Star","review":"It's so sad that Silliphant never wrote another Locke novel after this one. This is the third in the series, and I have reread the three many times over the years. This masterpiece of adventure writing is well worth whatever you pay to get it. For adventure lovers, this is as good as it gets!"},{"Title":"The Game","review":"This is one of the best baseball books out there, for my money better than books by the likes of Bob Costas and George Will. Why? Because this is a book about the actual pleasures of the game: playing it, teaching it to children, watching and keeping score of live games, and so forth. Most books about baseball become treatises on the metaphysics of the game. This one is about the sport itself, as it is actually played on sandlots and in professional stadiums. Robert Benson writes about just a few ordinary games and a several extraordinary memories and thus avoids the tedious abstractions that infect the prose of many writers on the sport (excluding the likes of Gammons and Boswell, and a few others). There is no other American sports book quite like this one. The closest book I can compare it to would be Nick Hornby's FEVER PITCH, which is a classic exploration of what life is like for a sports fan (in this case, an English soccer fan). Benson's book does the same thing, in my opinion, for baseball, which is the highest praise I can give it."},{"Title":"The Game","review":"I eagerly awaited this new release from Robert Benson, having savored his two previous non-fiction books and the prayer book he had published. At first, though, I was disappointed: I was waiting for some of his customary spiritual autobiography based on baseball themes, but did not get any. Instead, Benson charts the understanding of his life through the plot of a nine inning baseball game that he sat through at Greer Stadium in Nashville. Each chapter reports what Benson saw at the game, and proceeds to record his ruminations about his life, sparked by the events of the game. Also thrown in are several quotations from Bartlett Giamatti, the esteemed former commissioner of baseball. A word of caution: If you are seeking to buy this book for spiritual insight, you might stick with a rereading of Living Prayer or Between the Dreaming and the Coming True. But if you want to read a book for the pure pleasure of Benson's masterful prose, then you cannot go wrong with this selection; his prose gets better and better the more he publishes. After getting over my initial frustration (which was my fault; not Benson's), I read the book in one night and was very satisfied. I strongly recommend this book to all baseball fans and to fans of Robert Benson. I gave the book four stars instead of five only because I felt that when Benson applied his insights to life he became too moralistic and determinative, instead of the usual open-ended application I have come to expect from him."},{"Title":"The Game","review":"That's the title of late baseball commissioner &amp; renaissance scholar Bart Giamatti's collected baseball essays, and it also summarizes Robert Benson's passion for the game. Giamatti clearly is one of Benson's heroes, not least for the grace and elegant simplicity of style that both bring to their reflections on our national pastime. This is a baseball book, but more than that it is a book about passion itself. The life-lessons Benson extracts from the game's routine and ritual are profound; his manner of conveying them is sweet and appealing, especially to those of us who (like the author) also share a passion for baseball with our children and believe in what ex-Yankee (and ex-Nashville Sound) Don Mattingly called the pleasure of &quot;passing stuff along.&quot; This is a special treat for fans of the minor league game and for Nashville's Greer Stadium faithful in particular. Just one glitch worth mentioning: it was Jack Buck, not Vin Scully, who reported Kirk Gibson's legendarily improbable pinch-homer in the '88 World Series with the exclamation &quot;I don't believe what I just saw!&quot; But that's hardly worth mentioning and I wouldn't, if I weren't a Jack Buck fan. Anyway, thanks Mr. Benson. See you at the ballpark!"},{"Title":"The Game","review":"Although I enjoyed this book's leisurely stroll through one man's relationship with baseball, I was disturbed by some serious screwups.First, Benson gets wrong the year Roger Maris' single season record for home runs was broken. Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa pursued and passed Maris in 1998, not 1999. This is an almost unbelievable error. Only three seasons after the fact, a baseball author making this mistake is like an American historian writing about the original twelve colonies.Six pages later we read about the famous home run hit by&quot;a light hitting infielder named Bobby Thomson&quot; in 1951. Thomson was an outfielder and finished tied for fourth (with Stan Musial) in the National League in home runs that year with 32.Since Benson's book is built on his lifelong love of the game, mistakes like this diminish our trust even if they don't make us doubt the depth of his feeling. His sincerity seems very real, and his writing is smooth, personal and appealing.Mistakes aside, it's nice to read a baseball book by a fan who is a writer first."},{"Title":"The Game","review":"the human drama plays on, even with the world's greatest baseball player and his friends...."},{"Title":"The Game","review":"I love baseball, and I am very sentimental about the roll baseball has played in my close relationship with my father. For this reason, I was excited about this book.While the book was generally well-written and, at times, the story-telling was captivating, I expected more. The attempt to intertwine the game and the life story didn't always work for me. I was also shocked by the obvious factual errors. There was a page devoted to Vin Scully and his famous \\"I don't believe what I just saw\\" call of Kirk Gibson's classic home run. Of course, it was the late Jack Buck--not Vin Scully--who made this famous call. As a lifelong Jack Buck fan, I was upset by this factual mistake.Overall, this is a quick and enjoyable read. I recommend it for baseball fans who enjoy good literature. It isn't for everyone."},{"Title":"The Game","review":"Let's point out a couple other factual errors about Mr. Benson's book. First of all he claims Harry Caray's signature home run call is, &quot;It could be, it might be, it is!&quot;Actually, Harry used to say, &quot;It might be, it could be, it is!&quot;I'm sure this is pretty trivial, but I've heard Harry call it this way hundreds of times and I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to point this out. Benson makes this mistake a few times in this book, and it's annoying.Benson also claims to be at Wrigley Field one day in May to see a young phenom by the name of Kerry Wood face the author's favorite team the Braves. At that game, Benson and his wife and the rest of the crowd are led in a rendition of &quot;Take Me Out to the Ballgame&quot; by none other than Harry Caray.Well, Harry died in February of 1998, and Kerry Wood didn't make his major league debut until 4/12/1998 (Easter Sunday) against the Expos.The reason why I bring this up is because I often wondered what Harry would have said had he been alive during Wood's 20 strikeout performance against the Astros and the remarkable 1998 season that we all enjoyed as Cubs fans.These are just a couple of annoying factual errors that I encounter in Benson's book. Other than that, I love the book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys baseball and doesn't view it as just a sport, but as a way of life.Despite the errors mentioned above, Mr. Benson, I would love to play catch or have you hit fungoes to me anytime."},{"Title":"Henrietta and the Golden Eggs","review":"We raise backyard chickens at our home so this book was great for our kids. I love the photos as well as the story."},{"Title":"Henrietta and the Golden Eggs","review":"Dang it! I hate it when this happens. Have you ever picked up a book that you really really wanted to like and found, instead, that you couldn't stomach it? Or worse, that it had some really wonderful elements but you had difficulty separating them from the book's problems? Well welcome to my reaction to &quot;Henrietta and the Golden Eggs&quot;. Winner of the 2003 Mildred Batchelder Honor for the best translation of a foreign children's book, I had placed high hopes on this puppy. And while there were great things about this creation, something got seriously lost in translation. Though it's inoffensive enough, the book just doesn't make a lot of sense.In this story we meet Henrietta. As one of the three thousand three hundred and thirty-three chickens kept in a seriously unsanitary chicken house, Henrietta is not yet fully grown. She hasn't started to lay eggs yet, but she knows that when she does they'll be golden. The other chickens ridicule little Henrietta, but when she successfully pecks a hole in the wall of the chicken house, all three thousand three hundred and thirty-three are quick to join her in the wild outdoors. After several such escapes (and recaptures by the farm employees) a solution is reached. The chicken house is extended to allow the birds to travel both in and out of doors. And when Henrietta finally lays her egg, it's just a plain brown one. The end.I've actually summarized this plot as well as I could, but I?ve taken the liberty of giving the book a little more semblence of order than it actually contains. It's perfectly possible that in the original German, this book made sense. In the English version, however, there are just some elements that don't. For example, Henrietta is constantly telling the older chickens that someday she'll prove them all wrong and be able to sing/fly/swim/lay golden eggs/etc. She never does a single one of these things and when the chickens point out at the end that she laid a brown rather than a gold egg saying, &quot;You didn't even need to bother trying&quot;, her reply is, &quot;Did you really believe that a chicken could lay golden eggs?&quot;. Huh? The whole book is like this. I didn't understand the moral and I didn't understand exactly what it was the author was getting at.Now for all the flaws of the narrative, the illustrations by Kathi Bhend almost make the book worth purchasing alone. Drawn in the most delicate of pen and inks, Bhend has given her chickens irony, sophistication, and wry good humor. Everything that the text lacks. When Henrietta first scratches a hole in the chicken coop wall we see a delightful shot of a frog climbing sturdy blades of grass. The pictures in the book are so detailed that you can make out every single tiny feather on the chickens as they cluck and strut. I was especially fond of the picture of Henrietta's egg. While everything else is all blacks and whites, the egg sits there glowing a soft brown color. For pure pleasure alone I just flipped through this book without reading a word and I had a marvelous time. I highly suggest you do the same.Maybe someday this book will be translated differently. Maybe when it is it'll make sense and people will come to enjoy it. Until that happy day arrives, however, this book is simple to describe. Plot so-so. Pictures good."},{"Title":"Henrietta and the Golden Eggs","review":"I ordered this book because we have 4 backyard chickens and I thought it would be a good book to read the kids (4 1/2 & 2 years old).

The questions in the end of each chapter helps to understand tricky points in SQL 7 (helpful for even non test-takers). Most answers have good explainations (some are not detailed enough). Use this book together with OL book. Also play with the product itself A LOT, A LOT, A LOT. Anyway, this book does let me feel SQL 7 less overwhelming.The book is not for SQL 7 beginers.

Too many paper MCSEs (or wannabes) expect to get the answers to the test before taking the test. The purpose of these exams is to test your knowledge of the product and not how well you memorized the questions from practice exams. Using a book like this, BOL, and the product, you should be able to pass the exam.

I took the Beta Exam for Administration and noted the following shortcomings in this book:Almost nothing on roles, permissions, etc. The Beta exam had 13 out of 113 questions on this and they were very detailed. This book is too general. Never addressed moving users around.Nothing on Windows 98 as a server or client and connectivity. Beta Exam beat this to death.Over abundance of fill in the blank questions in the book. None of the questions took the format of the real exam.BCP is so lightly covered as to be laughable.Nothing about determining space requirements on a Database.Nothing on how to accomplish tasks that are normally done by wizards without using the wizard.Nothing about options when you perform these tasks. Beta Exam asked a lot about this.I could go on but you get the picture. Just wish the authors had taken the Beta Exam so the book would have done a better job. If they did take the exam they failed to incorporate lessons learned.If you buy the book do so knowing it will tell you some good stuff about SQL Server 7.0 but it will not get you ready for the exam.Cheers"},{"Title":"The Joyous Cosmology.

I read it over thirty years ago and had to hunt down another copy to add to my bookshelf and read it again. The foreword is by Timothy Leary and Richard Alpert. A true classic, and timely, considering the resurgence of interest in \\" the chemistry of consciousness\\"."},{"Title":"The Great Midland","review":"Ignored by its publisher and the public (except by federal agents) when it was first published in 1948, \\"The Great Midland\\" will still be avoided by those who think it's no more than a novel by a Communist writer about Communists laborers. That would be shame, since the book is far more nuanced than the usual agitprop from the era. While several of the main characters are indeed Communist \\"agitators\\", the book is a multigenerational saga about American labor, racial strife, and ethnic communities. And it's an atypically realistic love story.The plot of \\"The Great Midland\\" frequently recalls Steinbeck's early labor novels; Saxton slyly quotes both the \\"in dubious battle\\" passage from \\"Paradise Lost\\" and \\"grapes of wrath\\" stanza from the \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic.\\" In Saxton's book, activists (some Communist, some not) struggle to organize Chicago railroad labor against both the callousness of the corporate structure, the hostility of law enforcement, and the unresponsiveness of the union. Unlike most novels at either end of the political spectrum (such as the pro-capitalist manifestos of Ayn Rand or the pro-labor sermonizing of \\"In Dubious Battle\\"), \\"The Great Midland\\" does not offer easy answers, and it does not portray its many heroes, Communist or not, as faultless. Saxton's characters have very human failings, they often bring their own bad luck on themselves, and the path to the utopia they envision is fraught with danger, dashed hopes, and the potential for abuse. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about the bosses or the police, whose menace approaches caricature and whose motives or personal lives are never explored.At the center of the tale are Dave Spaas and Stephanie Koviak--married, separated, and reunited as they attempt to balance their individual desires and societal concerns, to resolve the battle between the personal and the political. They have entirely different, often clashing worldviews: while Dave fights to allow people \\"to live better and longer,\\" often to his own neglect, Stephanie believes people should \\"cram into each individual enough living to last for eternity.\\" One of the more memorable characters in the novel, their friend Pledger McAdams, most successfully achieves a balance between these two opposing aims--in spite of the fact that, as a black, he faces daily discrimination. Unfortunately, the wheels of commerce, bigotry, and corruption conspire to rob Pledger of his well-earned status and happiness.In sum, \\"The Great Midland\\" deserves to be read as much for its historical interest and for its realistic portrayal of the human condition as for its political message."},{"Title":"Peacock and Other Poems","review":"With a sly nod to W.B. Yeats' \\"The Peacock\\" from \\"Responsibilities and Other Poems,\\" this new collection of 26 brief poems by the late American poet Valerie Worth, beautifully follows in the footprints of her admired \\"Small Poems\\" books. She obviously delighted in the process of crafting free verse about common objects from umbrellas and clouds to a delicious ode to ice cream. Her inviting, melodious rhythm is deceptively simple. For sophisticated readers, her spare, zen-like words will evoke the senses with meditative thoughts. For young readers, they paint mysterious pictures that gently stir the imagination and coax to sleep."},{"Title":"Windows 98 6-in-1","review":"While the &quot;Dummies&quot; books might be somewhat moreentertaining, this book gives you far more information. This bookprovided me answers to most all the questions I had, while keeping it simple. I'm no guru, so I needed some education in Win98, as I was using Win 3.11. Some of the other books I've read just leave me wanting a little bit more information. I didn't feel that way after studying this book. It is well laid out and makes an excellent reference while also giving short tutorials.The one complaint I had was with some of the screen shots. Often there where screen shots that showed two or more different ways of viewing the same information. An example would be viewing your files using the Win95 &quot;classic&quot; view or with the new &quot;active desktop&quot; web view. The book would have a screen shot with each view, but often different things were shown in each shot, so it was hard to compare the actual differences between the two viewing methods.All in all, I found this book to be an excellent resource."},{"Title":"Smallcreep's Day","review":"It was a little slow but so strange I kept on going.

However, don't be fooled into thinking that all books in the same series are going to be of the same quality. Although the basis of these books is the material taken from US forces instruction manuals not all authors follow the guidelines so closely. Some will include phonetic transcription of the dialogues some won't. Also, not all courses come with adequate audio material. Some of the courses I have used have had really bad audio material come with them, so much so that it renders the pronunciation practice and listening exercises impossible. Some of them, as this does, only come with a limited number of cassettes. Most courses come with six cassettes which is enough to cover the first twelve units of each course sufficiently. This course had only three cassettes which I assumed meant there were relatively few listening exercises and only a small chapter for pronunciation. Unfortunately I was dead wrong. The course contains the same number of exercises as the others but does not have the audio to cover it rendering it pointless. If I had known this I would not have bothered buying only three cassettes. I would return this to be honest except for the fact it would cost more money to return it from England. In all the book would be quite useful if a native speaker were to hand throughout the course as the instruction book suggests. However, for most people buying this (like myself) I doubt there will be any native speakers for miles around."},{"Title":"The third paradigm: God and government in the 21st century","review":"Ludwig's Third Paradigm brings much-needed conceptual insight and simplification to politics. The governments of past and present fit into one of three categories: monarchy, where an individual determines law (the codification of right and wrong), representative government (republics, democracies), where individuals collectively, through voting, make the law, and theocracy, where divinely revealed law is the standard of morality.Anyone trying to think through the principles of human organization from a foundational viewpoint should read this book."},{"Title":"The third paradigm: God and government in the 21st century","review":"This great book is about how the first paradigm (divine monarchy, or god-kings) has failed, how the second paradigm (representative government, which we are currently using in America and other countries) is failing, and how the third paradigm (theocracy, or God's law) will work once implemented. Author, Ludwig, describes how a government truly under God will operate, how self government will be implemented, and more!First, he gives you a brief history lesson on how the first paradigm operated, was implemented, and how it was finally discarded for the sake of the second paradigm. Then he shows how the second paradigm began, and where it is heading. Sooner or later people will lose respect for the second paradigm just like they did with the first paradigm, and will begin looking for something better. That's where the third paradigm comes in. Under the law of the Bible, criminals will be punished fairly according to their crimes. There will be no more need for jails, or even police. For example, a thief would have to repay the owner 4-5 times the item's value if the item has been sold or damaged, but if the item is found unharmed and still in his possession he will only have to restore double. This creates a strong deterrent against stealing something, and giving incentive both to take care of the item and to confess. But changes like this won't happen overnight. It will take a reformation of people's hearts and minds before it can truly be implemented.I thought reading this was a very worthwhile use of my time. I learned some history that I didn't know before. It is really interesting how God's laws will work, and how, unlike some people think, His laws have not passed away. I would highly recommend it to someone who is tired with where representative government is leading us, and is wondering if there is anything better to be had. There is."},{"Title":"The third paradigm: God and government in the 21st century","review":"Mark A.

It is about a girl who leaves for America because of the awful treatment the have in Russia. Rifka and her family must sneak off on a train. Rifka has been given the job of distracting the guards because they will search all the boxcars. Rifka's family is hiding in those boxcars. They're depending on a little girl. Even though she only has to distract them until her uncle comes and reports that someone has robed his shop. He actually did that so that her family could safely make it out of Russia. They made it safely to the polish border. But they could enter Poland. A doctor had to inspect them first. They were allowed back on the train after the doctor inspected him. But first they were sprayed with something vile. This substance burned Rifka's skin and scalp. Rifka had taken her mother's candlesticks with her along in her rucksack and the Polish took them. When they arrived in Motviz, Rifka's head pounded and her body hurt as if the train had run her over. She had typhus. After a little while her mom, dad, and brother Nathan where all taken to the hospital because they were infected so bad. Saul had to take care of Rifka. After they all got better they left for Warsaw. On the train she goes for a walk and sees a girl with a baby. She starts talking to the girl. The girl is going to see her sister. Rifka decides to set her to make her look nice and when she is doing that she notices red sores all over the girls head. They reached there departing point and before you could buy a ticket a doctor had to inspect them. Rifka was not allowed to go. She found out she had ringworm and was not allowed to enter America. There was a treatment but it would take months. So her parents met with a lady from HIAS (Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society) says Rifka must go to Belgium. There she will get a family to stay with and will be treated for ringworm. Before she left for Belgium her mom gave Rifka her golden locket and her dad gave Rifka his tallis. When she gets to Antwerp Belgium she stays with a couple. She calls them Gaston and Marie. Rifka gets a letter from her dad saying that they have settled in New York City. Then her birthday came and she decided not to tell Gaston and Marie because she wanted to celebrate this birthday in America. Early on the morning of her birthday she crept downstairs and took the broken strands form broom. She went back upstairs and wove the strands in a golden Star of David. Rifka becomes completely bald. For her treatments she must walk to the convent every day and there Sister Katrina washes her head with a green soap, then puts her head under a violet light, and after it is dry she sprinkles powder on Rifka's head. Before Rifka can where her kerchiefs Sister Katrina must boil and dry them. Finally Rifka's ringworm had healed and she was allowed to enter America. Even though her hair had not started to grow. So she leaves on a ship. On the ship she meets a young sailor named Pieter. There is a terrible storm at sea and only one sailor died Pieter. They soon arrive at Ellis Island but still Rifka is not allowed to enter America. The doctors are afraid that her hair will not grow back, which means she will not get a husband. Then the government will have to view her as a social responsibility. While staying in the hospital she makes a friend. A young Russian peasant whose parents died. Saul comes to visit and breaks the Star of David that she had made. Then Rifka's mom came to visit her. The day came when the doctors would look at her case and see if she would be allowed to enter America. The doctors said she was allowed to leave and everybody started to hug and kiss her. Rifka felt her kerchief slip and her head had been itching. She did not want to show her head. She was too late tying it on. Saul and the doctor saw something and made her remove her kerchief. There was hair growing back again! On a scale of one to ten I give this book a 10 because I learned about how everybody was treated in Russia.

They start when in 1919, to avoid persecution, Rifka and her parents and two older brothers have to suddenly leave Russia in the middle of the night with just a small backpack and the clothes on her back. One of these few possessions is a book of Pushkin's poetry given to her by her cousin Tovah. Their destination is the United States where two of her brothers already live.To calm her fears and give her something to do during the lonely hours of travel, Rifka starts to write letters to Tovah in the blank spaces in the book. The story evolves through these letters which Rifka knows she will not be able to mail until she reaches the US. In the book, each letter is preceded by a quote from a Pushkin poem.Rifka's trip is not easy. She gets separated from her family and it takes over a year before she learns if she will be reunited with them. At a time when Jewish children are normally surrounded with family celebrating their coming of age, Rifka is alone and in charge of her own destiny.The book excels in character development, historic accuracy, and plot. I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in immigration stories, Jewish history, or young women's literature."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"This is one of my favorite books. One of the reasons that I like it so much is because you can acually imagine yourself as Rifka. You can feel the way that she does and you just want to read on and on and on. This book tells you about how the Russians treated the Jews. This book is so exciting clear until the end. It doesn't all of a sudden stop either, like some other books I've read.I would definitely reccommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Written as a series of letters from Rifka to a cousin back in Russia, this book tells the story of a Jewish girl's tortured path of emigrating to the US. Rifka and her family leave Russia in 1919 after her brothers flee from the Russian army, where Jewish draftees are abused and often killed. Rifka is the only girl and is a key part of their escape, and then must call on even more resources when illness leads to her being left behind in Poland, having to follow on her own after she recovers.The letter format made this a quick and easy read and very inspiring too, especially after the words from the author reveal that the story is based on the true story of what one of her relatives endured in emigrating to America. It's a great read for 9-13 year olds interested in immigration and history, and especially for girls as it portrays an independent and resourceful heroine who is able to first help her whole family escape from Russia and then travel on her own the majority of the way to the United States. Not an easily forgotten story, even for this adult reader."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Hi this year i got into reading. When I heard my mom got a book called letters from rifka i was not at all intressted but on the wekend i had nothing to do so i picked up that book and I was not able to put it down after i started.My favorite part was when rifka got ringworm on her scalp.This was the best book i read all year..If you want to read a short book about escaping Russia during the time of the pogroms and immigration to America this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"This was the best book I have ever read. Written in diary format, it has tragedy, suspence, and happiness. Rifka and her Jewish family are running away from Russia. Rifka only has a few articles of clothing, candlesticks, and a poetry book from her best friend, Tovah. She writes about her adventures to America in the blank pages of the poetry book. Rifka's adventures include a thief who is stealing her food, getting ring worm, and being left behind while her family goes to America. When Rifka is finally on the boat she makes a new friend but something happens to him during a storm. When the doctors in America have to decide whether or not she can stay in America..."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters from Rifka by Karen Hesse is an amazing epic of a young girl's journey form Russia during the First World War. Rifka is a young Jewish girl whose family is forced to flee to America. Because Rifka does not look Jewish, she is the decoy of her family. Rifka shows amazing courage throughout everything and comes through for her family but her family does not come through for her. Complications arise and Rifka is forced to face a new land. She puts on a brave face to the world but confides her secrets and fears to you through letters to her cousin, Tovah. I recommend this book to you because it was well written as well as exciting. The author paints vivid pictures in your mind. You really feel as if you have gotten to know the compassionate and brave person that Rifka is. Rifka's story is really one to remember and Karen Hesse tells the story wonderfully. In the beginning, when Rifka must distract the anti-Semitic soldiers while her family boards the train to Poland, The guards become suspicious and Rifka becomes frantic. You really feel the tenseness in the air. The author makes you relive the adventures that Rifka writes of. There are many more exciting adventures such as this one. I could not put the book down when complications arose at Ellis Island. This is an exciting and compelling story of the courage of a young girl and the faith she had in herself and Hesse tells the story beautifully. People of a religion other than Judaism may not be interested in a book about a Jewish family, but the book is well written portrait of anti-Semitism in the early 1920's. It is an important topic for people of all faiths to learn about. The hate expressed towards Jews at that time was nothing to ignore. If people are educated on this subject, then history will not repeat itself. In a way you are learning, but you are learning in a fun way. And anyway, the story is not about Rifka's religion; it's about the risks he must take because of it. The book is wonderful and I loved it."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"I absolutely loved this book so much that I had to read the entire thing all at once. This is a (partially) true story about a 12-13 year-old Jewish Russian girl who immigrates to America with her family during WWI. The author was very descriptive of immigrants' hardships on their voyages to America, which is part of why I loved the story so much. The other reason I enjoyed the book was because Rifka had a great personality and she wrote not only about the world around her, but her own life in letters to her cousin Tovah. She didn't actually send the letters, she just kept a diary in a poetry book by Pushkin which Tovah had given her as a gift. I enjoyed this book thoroughly, and I recommend it to anyone who loves history or loves a great story."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"not too graphic and that is the way I like it. I read this book to my children for our unit study and they liked it also. There are plenty of books out there that do their share of describing and I like those too but sometimes we just need to know there a few happy endings and this one is one of those books.Rifka and her family set out on a trip to leave their homeland that hates them to a place called America. Rifka ends up being left behind for health reasons and so starts her own journey to America. She grows and has matured by the time she makes it to Ellis Island. Her family reunion is a good one and the very last surprise is a sweet addition to the ending!"},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"At 12, Rifka's had quite a year. She, her parents and two older brothers fled Russia, where they were victimized because they were Jewish. Their goal is to immigrate into America, where they will join Rifka's two eldest brothers.Yet even after almost getting killed during the initial escape, there are still obstacles to overcome. While in Poland, the entire family gets typhoid, which delays their progress. Then, when it seems they will finally get to board a ship, it's discovered that Rifka has ringworm and will have to stay behind until it clears.Devastated, Rifka knows she has no choice but to stay brave and hopeful. She spends almost a year in Belgium with a kind elderly couple who treat her like a daughter. Still, Rifka yearns to be reunited with her family. She notes her life in letter format to her cousin Tovah, back home...scribbling along the back pages of a Pushkin book, which she plans to mail back as soon as she's in America.But even after Rifka's given the OK to leave the country, the folks at Ellis Island aren't so sure about letting her in. Although Rifka doesn't have any sign of ringworm anymore, her hair stubbornly refuses to grow back. Ultimately, she's caught in the worst of hells...so close to her family, yet unable to rejoin them.This book provides a fascinating look at 1920s immigration, through the eyes of a plucky adolescent. Readers will commiserate with Rifka, and heartily wish her dreams to be realized."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters From Rifka. About a girl trying to get toAmerica their are some speed bumps in the road. She gets sick and some people die. But she finally gets a ride to America but she has to go to a hospital before she can go to her family. And to pass the time she teaches a boy to read,and takes care of a baby with typhus because she already had it and can't get it again.The message in this book is to Never Give Up Hope even when things get tough. People should be like Rifka and be brave when bad things happen to good people.I connect with this book because her life is hard and my life is hard too.I have a great opinion of this book."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters from Rifka was about a girl named Rifka who was a jewish 12 year old who had to help her family make it to America. She was stuck in Russia trying to make it to Poland. This was at the time of the holicoast. She had to pretend to be Russian to help her family board the trains. She risked her own life.During the ride she gets a deadly disease that ends her journey to America and for her family. Will her family and herself survive from the deadly disease?? Will she ever make it to america?? Read the book to find out!!Letters from Rifka was a book the I would tell anyone to read who is over the age of 9, and who understands the holicost.

It was pretty grose how she got those red sours on her head. The lady was so grose how the author described her it seemed like she just was not taken care of at all. How she got over it, it was so real I mean that really is how they live these days. I just loved it so much!!!"},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters from Rifka is not the best book I've read, but it's pretty close up there. I like the way the author told the stories through the letters; you don't see that very often in books. Also I like how the author based it on her real great-aunt Lucy but most likely changed bits and peices of it. For you who don't know about this book, Letters from Rifka is a book about a Jewish escapee from Russia writing to her Cousin Tovah about her journey to America. While she cannot go back to Russia or she will lose her life, she keeps getting held back and barely getting towards America. Through rough times, she keeps her spirits up and always finds a way out of them. Brave and clever, Rifka is a wonderful character."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"This diary-style historical work is a fantastic read for students between grades 4 & 6, when I read it for the first time. I thoroughly enjoyed the chance to re-visit this work and relive a small part of my childhood reading list. &#34;Letters From Rifka&#34; would do very well as a classroom discussion book, leading to interactive discussion of the period of world history and conflict, including WWII and the challenges of immigrants entering the United States at that time.It is especially important to read the author's afterword at the end of the novel. Although Rifka did not truly exist, the work was based on her own family history, adding a personal touch that may not have been possible in other, similarly written works without extensive research.All in all &#34;Letters&#34; is a wonderful piece of literature, both for the classroom and those students who desire to read more on their own after discovering other literature written for the same time period, such as &#34;The Giver&#34;, &#34;Number the Stars&#34; and &#34;Diary of Anne Frank&#34;."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"This is a truly amazing wonderful book about the true way of the 1919-1920 s I love this book and would like you all to read the book.Justin Sweeney"},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"I chose this rating because it is so adventurous to me!

I made a card.Olivia"},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Although this is a compelling and suspenseful story, the epistolary/diary format really doesn't work. It's very hard to get those to work right, and in this case it has the usual problem: the narrative is WAY too detailed to make a convincing letter.There is also the problem of Rifka writing facts in her letters that the reader doesn't know, but which her cousin clearly would -- like, listing the names of her brothers, when in a real letter she would just say \\"My brothers,\\" and also explaining about pogroms and the Russian government drafting Jewish boys as soldiers -- which her cousin, being a Russian Jew, would not need to be told. The author could have been more smooth in imparting necessary information, perhaps in a foreword.Maybe most people aren't bothered by that sort of thing, but it bothers me."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"When my 12 year-old daughter was assigned to read this book for school, I read it myself so I could discuss it with her. She and I both loved it!This fascinating tale chronicles the dangers and hardships of a 12 year-old Jewish girl, Rifka, as she fled from World War I era Russia to seek an oppression-free life in America. The young Rifka's experiences along her travels are both shocking and tragic. But also very inspirational.I told my daughter that I wished Rifka hadn't encountered so many heartbreaks along the way and she reminded me, \\"It has to be that way because it is based on a true story.\\"In the end, the book left me feeling both grateful and proud to be living in a country free of political, religious, and sexist oppression. I am glad it was assigned to my daughter so she can become aware of those precious freedoms . . . and recognize that not everybody enjoys them like she does.A quick easy read . . . that sticks with you for a long time!"},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"I've owned the softcover book for years.

Awesome book!! Great for girls (and guys) 10-13."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters from Rifka is a very well written book. I read the last 45 pages all today. I just couldn't put it down. I had to laugh because Rifka had never heard of bananas or ice cream until she went to Belguim. On the ship to America Rifka makes friends with a ship worker, Pieter, who she loves to joke around with. One time Pieter bent over and kissed Rifka. Then a couple of days later there is a terrible storm at sea. During the storm Pieter gets tossed overboard and drowns. Rifka was very upset and cried until her eyes got dry. If you wish to know more about this book, you must get a copy and read it yourself. The first 20 pages aren't very exciting but after a while it's so exciting it will keep you up to the edge of your seat. This is one of the best books I've read in my life. I never remember reading so much of a book in one day like I did this one."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"The name of the book I read Is called Letters From Rifka,which Is historical fiction. The main character of the book Is Rifka who tries to escape froom the Russian guards that are cruel to Jews.I rated this book as a 4 because It had a lot of things I can relate to. For example,In letters from Rifka her mom sees that Rifka becomes friends withIlya and her mom's disappointed because Ilya Is Russian and because the Russians are cruel to Jews. I can relate to that situation when my mom saw a friend of mine and she doesn't like her because of the way she acts. The two situations are different because Rifka mother was commenting about how her daughter was friends with a Russian and my mother was making a decision on how my friends act. But the two situations are also similar because the two parents are worried about who are their children hanging out with.What I learned from this Is when my I'm a parent I'll let my children be friends with anybody they want to as long as my children don't do bad things like the other children do."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"I chose Letters from Rifka by Karen Hesse because it is very inspiring. It shows how a family will do anything for survival. One thing that I don't like is how the Russians treat the jews. One way they are treated badly is they take away their belongings but if the Jews refuse to then, the Rusians will take it by force. The only way to survive is by going to America.But the the only way to get there is by taking train that leads to a ship that goes to America.But Russian soldiers heavily guard the way. The only hope rthe family has lies on the hands of one girl. She is the only one with blond hair in the family and is the only one who can speak in the Russian language, and her name is \`Rifka. But there is a problem on the boat. The doctor says she can't board because she is infected by ringworm so she has to stay behind.So she must stay behind and her family must leave without her.

It is about this girl named Rifka, she is 12 yrs. old. Rifka and her family are fleeing from Russia to America in 1919.The main characters are her brothers Saul and Nathan, Papa, Mama, Tahova, Rifka and Sister Katrina. They are going to America on a train.Rifka writes letters in the margins of her favorite book her mom got her called Puskin. Tahova, her cousin still in Russia, is the person she is writing too in the book. Rifka and Tahova have a very serious relationship, even though Rifka knows that Tahova will never get her letters she insists on writing to him. In the letters she writes, she talks about the illnesses that she got along the way and the things she had to do to get to America.My opinion about this book is very strong because it teaches a lot about how cruel the Germans were to the Jewish people. I also like this book because it shows you that just because you have a different religion doesn't mean that you are different from anybody else. Does Rifka make it to America is still a mystery, but read this book and you will find out."},{"Title":"Letters from Rifka","review":"Letters From Rifka is one of the best books i've ever read!

The author's literary language was very descriptive and breathtaking. I felt like I was watching an action moving and I kept wondering what was going to happen next. While reading the book, I imagined that I was setting right next to Rifka, and experiencing her struggles along side of her.I could not put it down this book down. I was so captivated by Rifka's courage and bravery and the obstacles that she encountered along the journey. Hesse's use of langauge was very captivating as well. I thought the letter format of the book made the story very personable, I could see the journey through Rifka's eyes.Overall I thought that this book was amazing and an excellent example of bravery of a young Russian girl during the early 1900's.

It is an informational yet page-turning, fun book. The author describes the main character, Rifka's, emotions and thoughts very well. You feel, as you read the book, that you become a part of Rifka. You are absorbed into a journey of struggle,happiness, and sorrow as Rifka journies her way to America. I recommend this book to girls of all ages. Some books make World War 2 seem boring but this book is excellant.

It is September of 1919 when her Jewish family must leave their town of Berdichev for the Russian army is searching for a deserter: her brother, Nathan, who had put the entire family at risk. Tucked away in her backpack are Mama's prized candlesticks and Rifka's precious volume of Pushkin. Enduring the humiliation of crude medical examinations several times, she travels by train through Poland to reach Warsaw.Many challenges test Rifka's courage, cleverness and spirit when she is denied passage to America because of her terrible head ringworm problem. How will she fare without herloving and protective parents during a long separation? How can she survive 7 months on her own in Belgium? She even considers risking all to return to her village, where she herself, as well as her uncle's family, could be punished. At least in Belgium she is not hated for being Jewish.Using her Pushkin book for stationery she writes many letters to her dear cousin, Tovah, though never knowing when the girl will actually read what she has written about her arduous trip-a Coming-of-Age journey as it turns out. Fortunately Pushkin's poetry encourages her in unexpected ways as well. Reading the poems is a comfort, but later they inspire her to write her own free verse poems in English. It also serves as at textbook for a little Russian boy who is shy to speak before adults.The protracted delay at Ellis Island reveals Rikfa's inclination for nursing, as well as her budding literary talent. Most important she shows compassion for others less fortunate and prevents a grave injustice from occurring.When it is her turn to be on immigration trial she must prove resourceful and brave, declaring that she will get a husband even is she has no hair! Rifka proves that she IS indeed a clever girl--even without her golden ringlets. She realizes that in the past year she learned something very important: that she has grown to be an American even before setting foot on US soil. Neveer udnerestimate t he influece of Pushkin!

Jewish boys are enlisted into the Russian army against their will, forced to do hard menial labor such as digging latrines. Jewish families are terrorized, and are generally afraid for their safety. The only way out is to leave the country, and go to America.A clever girl, Rifka keeps a record of the journey by writing letters to her cousin in a book of Pushkin's poetry. Each new letter starts with a quote from a Pushkin poem, and each snippet neatly fits the events described in that letter. I normally don't care for poetry, but the quotes added an authentic feel to the letters, and really set the mood for me.The main story follows Rifka and her family as they flee for America, and the family runs into several problems on their journey. First typhus, then ringworm strike, and Rifka is separated from her family for over a year to undergo treatment. Sent to Belgium while the rest of her family goes to America, Rifka experiences a degree of independence she'd never before known. When she finally reaches Ellis Island, Rifka is tested yet again. Will she be able to join her family in America?\\"Letters from Rifka\\" is a good introductory book for children interested in Jewish history, and particularly for girls.

The book unfolds in many places ranging from Russia to Ellis Island in New York Harbor. The main idea of the book is that Rifka, A Russian, Jewish; immigrant has to overcome many obstacles on her voyage to America. She left because she is a Jew.One of the obstacles is that Rifka and her family prepared to go to America was that Rifka comes down with a contagious disease, she is asked to leave her family to be taken care of by a lady that is a nun who helps the sick. (The HIAS group) Every day for a year the HIAS lady treats the disease. After a year, Rifka was sent to Ellis Island where she is to enter New York. But, since the disease left Rifka bald, Mr. Fargate, (the man in charge) forbid Rifka from entering America. Yet again, Rifka suffers another setback.I really liked this book, I believe the moral is never to give up hope, and also that being clever is better than depending on looks.

Then there are those like Tim Unsworth who feel the term \\"Catholic\\" needs more flexibility.\\"Catholics on the Edge\\" is a book about people who consider themselves Catholic, but who find themselves marginalized within their own Church. His heroes and heroines are those who find their consciences at odds with Church teaching or practice. Patty Crowley, who was part of Pope Paul VI's mid-1960's commission to study birth control, feels that the real-life experience of faithful Catholics was ignored when the Church formulated its doctrines on the issue. In spite of heartaches and setbacks, Barbara Blaine, founder of SNAP (Survivors' Network of those Abused by Priests), works with those abused by clergy, victims who have been seen as the enemy by some chanceries. Other Catholics -- former priests, those with non-traditional views on euthanisia, women seeking admission to the priesthood -- find voice in Unsworth's compassionate prose, expressing their desire to reform the Church.Unger's subjects are sincere individuals striving for the truth the best they know how. It bothers them that they can't reconcile the truth of their experience with the truth proclaimed by the Church. In some cases, their truth may prophetically confronts the Church, embodying the voice of the Holy Spirit to adapt its teaching to new times. In other cases, their truth is theirs alone -- springing from lack of understading, or from inevitable reactions to physical abuse or abuse of trust.The book has weaknesses. It should not be assumed that those who disagree with the Church are necessarly on the side of truth and right. Neither does this book present a thorough debate of the issues. And by presenting only people with problems, it might lead some readers to believe that those who agree with the Church are a small and mean-spirited minority. But agree with them or not, one's heart goes out to those who carry the burden of wrestling with truth -- not in the pure air of the abstract theologian, but in the fetid miasma that is life on the front lines. It is a battlefield where truth is often less than clear and where answers prescribed from afar can seem positively diabolical."},{"Title":"EL ASTILLERO","review":"Length:: 0:32 Mins"},{"Title":"The Petroleum Shipping Industry: A Nontechnical Overview (Penwell Books.

By reading this book you'll gain a very good understanding of the types of vessels, what they are most appropriate for, the economics, the trading patterns of crude, products, LPG and LNG, Oil spill liabilities and the history of the petroleum shipping industry.The only thing that prevents me to give it a five stars ranks: Some of the graphics illustrating the concepts are not easy to read (why 3D?) Some of the clear descriptions of the vessels hardware would be much clear if illustrated with pictures or drawings.

The author touches on a broad range of disabilities, both physical and psychological. In defining disability, Smart clearly differentiates disadvantages from disability. Insight from several disabled people is included to give readers a first person perspective. The author goes into detail about legislation relating to the disabled, particularly the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) signed into effect by George Bush in 1990. The ADA has facilitated the access of people with disabilities into many aspects of public life. She mentions that it has also inspired several advances in current technology, assisting even those without disability.The purpose of this book is to introduce readers to how the viewpoints from society and a person with a disability are related. This book provides an introduction to this complex, but important topic. The first two chapters are about defining disabilities, the models of disability, and also list six reasons why there are more disabilities today then ever before. Chapters three through six are about sources of prejudices, effects of discrimination, and examples of these effects. Chapters seven through nine discuss the amount of severity, degree of visibility, the presence of chronic pain, and the stigma and prejudice, and how that affects the individuals with disabilities. Disability is a multifaceted topic, and people need to be more aware of its dimensions. This book is a good starting point."},{"Title":"Disability, Society, and the Individual","review":"The author covered nearly everything needed in the course content, truly comprehensive.

Scarisbrick doesn't limit herself to the typical earrings, necklaces, tiaras, and so on--there are bejeweled ceremonial swords, stomachers, chatelaines, cups and boxes, and more.One of Scarisbrick's real accomplishments is to juxtapose photographs of jewelry alone with a photograph of the jewelry being worn in an oil portrait, or showing a piece being worn first as a head ornament and then later as a necklace (a common practice with tiaras, which could often be broken down into smaller parts and used as earrings, brooches, and so on).The jewels are fantastic, as is the photography. Although I would have preferred that more of the photographs were in color, that's a small quibble when even the black-and-white pictures are so crisp and filled with telling detail. Beyond this, Scarisbrick is to be commended for providing a concise, accurate, and broad overview of British jewelry history. The book is eminently readable, and the pictures are fascinating.One of the most fascinating parts of the book is the appendix, tellingly entitled \\"Where Are They Now? Dispersal, Transformation, and Theft.\\" Here Scarisbrick delves into the sometimes shady, sometimes ignoble histories and reputations of dozens of gem-encrusted objects. She quotes here from Anthony Trollope's peerless novel \\"The Eustace Diamonds\\" when she writes: \\" . . . family treasures were preserved 'not so much for the protection of property but for the more picturesque idea of maintaining chivalric associations. Heirlooms have become so, not that future owners of them may be assured of so much wealth whatever the value of the things so settled may be--but that the son or grandson may enjoy the satisfaction of saying my father or grandfather or ancestor sat in that chair or looked as he now looks in that picture or was graced by wearing on his breast that very ornament which you see lying beneath the glass.' \\"Scarisbrick understands, as did Trollope, how the aristocracy works and how it clings to the thought of itself as being somehow better than the rest of the world. Scarisbrick's accomplishment here is to show us a history of a rarefied group of people through the splendid adornments chosen by its very privileged members."},{"Title":"Ancestral Jewels","review":"This is an older book, from 1990, so most of the photos are in black and white. However, since most of the photos are old, they were in black and white anyway. There are some jewels and some paintings shown in color photos, too. It's nice that I haven't seen these jewels reproduced anywhere else (except for a few in Royal Jewels, this book's sequel).It's nice that the backs of some pieces are shown, which are as lovely as the fronts and sometimes include inscriptions. There are paintings and photos of people wearing the jewels. The text and the jewels are on the same page or close to it.There's also a \\"Where are they now?\\" chapter, which is interesting, but again, only covers up to the 1980's.I found this book to be much superior to its sequel, \\"Royal Jewels.\\"Since this book is out of print, I bought a used library copy through \\"available from these sellers\\" link."},{"Title":"Conversations with Truman Capote (Literary Conversations)","review":"Truman Capote once said that he loved talking more than anything else. Inge's book is a collection of interviews with the great talker himself, covering the period from 1948, when Capote burst on the literary scene with his first novel, &quot;Other Voices, Other Rooms,&quot; to a 1980 self-interview from &quot;Music for Chameleons.&quot; It includes the complete texts of George Plimpton's important &quot;New York Times Book Review&quot; interview upon the publication of Capote's masterpiece &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and Eric Norden's lengthy 1968 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, both involving Capote's claim to have invented a new literary form, the &quot;nonfiction novel.&quot; These interviews make clear why we must sometimes take Capote with a grain of salt, and why we must take his work as seriously as he took it himself."},{"Title":"Conversations with Truman Capote (Literary Conversations)","review":"I was very impressed with everything involved in the ordering, shipping, delivery and the product itself.

Jade Brennan suffered a car accident and lay in a coma. After two years, she's come home to claim her two year old daughter that she's never seen. Jade comes home a day early only to find that her brother is not willing to give up custody. A strange man shows up at her door asking about the necklace she's wearing and then gets her involved in a revival ceremony. The ceremony revives Connor MacKenzie, the previous owner of her brother's apartment building, who died in 1886. Connor and Jade marry to help Jade gain custody of her daughter Sabrina. It isn't long before Jade is falling in love with Connor and he with her. It's a funny and touching book with loveable characters. My only complaint is that the author has Sabrina, a two year old, talking like she's four at times. Otherwise, I loved the book. This is the first book I've read by this author and I can't wait to explore more of her work."},{"Title":"Jade","review":"Loved this book. I could not put it down. A really fast read.

I prefer the newer suspense type. But I was pleasantly suprised by Jade. The chemistry between Connor and Jade was very entertaining to read. The gall of Jade's brother and sister-in-law at the beginning of the book seriously had me tense with anger. They refused to let Jade even see her 2 year old daughter, Sabrina, whom Jade had never seen before. I could totally understand Jade's frustration and anger, her despair. Its a lovely story with roiling emotions that'll make your swear and laugh with a wonderfully beautiful ending. I throughly enjoyed this book.

While not terribly dense or detailed, it reads easily and wraps the reader up in a special universe with intriguing interactions between characters, especially between generations. It is a magical, light book that will have you chuckling and sighing with sadness. It is about power, greed, lost romantic relationships, about the joy of acceptance, and the collision between people of different time periods. A fascinating story that has few parallels."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I've heard from many people who are interested in reading books about anarchism (allthough i think the term \\"anarchism\\" is incorrect) that most books about anarchy are \\"heavy\\" and difficult to get through much less understand because they aim their content to readers that have a good backround of political understanding (its terminologies, its \\"schools\\" of thought, its currents and so forth..).If this happens to be your problem then this book will be ideal if you want to discover what this political philosophy stands for and what its issues are and, indeed, have been for a long time.Emma Goldman, a woman with as fiery a personality as they come, has put together here a number of essays about anarchy that are easy to comprehend and definately thought inspiring.Despite this book having been first published in 1917 it loses nothing of its importance in the current state affairs as all of the issues Goldman deals with not only remain unsolved but they have -in the meantime- become a social burden or a social disaster much worse than back in her time. Oh, and back in her time things already looked bad enough.What you get here is, summarily, the following:-anarchy, what is it and what does it stand for? Beyond the mainstream media cliches anarchy stands for personal and societal freedom of the highest conceivable order. A freedom, anarchists insist, that is not a utopia. It's basically a hard lesson in crushing your illusions and opening unthought of doors of perception of what freedom really means. That would be then something other than being in a cage and having food thrown in. Even if the cage is invisible..-Hard punching essays about the prison system and the everself-destructing notion of patriotism.. Funny how every line one reads in there could've been written yesterday. Not much has changed. After decades and decades of the imprisonment system has society become more law-abiding? That would be a thundering no. Why is that? As for patriotism, the incredible notion of dying for your country the same one that might be killing you slowly while draining you of all your resources and enslaving you in a wage system and a daily mindless-toil called \\"work\\" . here, Emma has to say a lot. There's always a reason to die if someone is going to make money out of it (that would be NOT you) and dress the whole \\"cause\\" up as patriotic..-The hypocrisy of puritanism as well as the seemingly eternal joke of marriage and \\"love\\" are also given the treatment they deserve. In a society based on hypocrisy alltogether, you have to start on a personal level. You have to lose your personal chains before you attempt to free others. Your personal chains begin with the things you've been taught to hold most sacred (as is generally the case). The morals that are not yours. Whom do they really serve? The institutions that everyone notices they have fail and yet most continue to serve them. Why? How can this possibly be?These are just some of the issues dealt with in Emma's essays.A classic book that will basically reprogram your brain if you honestly think about the issues in it. But reprogrammed into what? Well, it will only reprogram you into thinking for yourself. For once. If you do, you'll find that the illusion you've been living in does indeed serve someone. Your long hard road to becoming an individual will thus commence."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This is a good collection of essays by Emma Goldman; however, it is not the best one available. That would be _Red Emma Speaks_, which contains the best material in this volume as well as other excellent essays and excerpts from her entire life's work. In addition, all of this book is available on the Web. So I would have to recommend that those interested in Emma's work get _Red Emma Speaks_ instead of this one."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"Being historically one the more important yet obscure figures in American history, Emma Goldman's anarchist thought is as relevent today as it was when she wrote &quot;Anarchism, and Other Essays&quot;. In an age where political apathy, intellectual ignorance and spiritual corruption are the failings of modern civilzation, Emma Goldman's Enlightenment thought is illuminating in its message of the power of direct action as she so lucidly illustrates:&quot;Anarchism urges man to think, to investigate, to analyze every proposition... (Anarchism is the) philosophy of a new social order based on liberty unrestricted by man-made law; the theory that all forms of government rest on violence, and are therefore wrong and harmful, as well as unnecessary.&quot;The new social order rests, of course, on the materialistic basis of life; but while all Anarchists agree that the main evil today is an economic one, they maintain that the solution of that evil can be brought about only through the consideration of every phase of life,--individual, as well as the collective; the internal, as well as the external phases.&quot;A thorough perusal of the history of human development will disclose two elements in bitter conflict with each other; elements that are only now beginning to be understood, not as foreign to each other, but as closely related and truly harmonious, if only placed in proper environment: the individual and social instincts. The individual and society have waged a relentless and bloody battle for ages, each striving for supremacy, because each was blind to the value and importance of the other. The individual and social instincts,--the one a most potent factor for individual endeavor, for growth, aspiration, self-realization; the other an equally potent factor for mutual helpfulness and social well-being.&quot;From just that little exerpt it is easy to understand why any and all authority was terrified of Emma Goldman and why her important contributions to society have been muzzled from histories - down the &quot;memory hole&quot; to use an Orwellian expression.Again, &quot;Anarchism, and Other Essays&quot; is as relevent today as it was in Emma Goldman's day and necessary material for anyone truly interested or involved in altruistic direct action."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"The other reviewers are correct in stating this is not the best collection of Emma Goldman's work, but for an introduction to her thought it will serve that function perfectly. There are some of her best here, &quot;Anarchism: What it Really Stands For,&quot; &quot;Minorities vs. Majorities,&quot; &quot;Prisons: A Social Crime and Failure&quot; and &quot;Patriotism: A Menace to Liberty&quot; are some of the most powerful anarchist statements you will find. Much of the last half of the book deals with women's rights, Emma was also a feminist. Other books may be more complete, but if you want the other essays they are available all over the Internet.I also recommend Michael Bakunin's works, especially &quot;God and the State.&quot;"},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This is, as someone already pointed out, not THE best collection of Emma Goldman's essays; however, it is a great starting point for anyone who wants to learn more about Emma Goldman, her life, her views and about Anarchism in general. It's a great read, completely relevant to today's world in light of Sept. 11 and the anti-globalization riots in Genoa a few months ago. I highly recommend this book to new readers of Emma's work and for those already aquainted with &quot;Red&quot; Emma."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This book nicely sums up Emma Goldman's anarchistic views and gives you a good sense of her as a person. Few people lived as such an embodiment of radicalism as &quot;Red Emma&quot;.

Also check out Alexander Berkman and Peter kropotkin, 2 famous anarchists of the era."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"A masterpiece, pure and simple- that's the best way to describe this book. Emma Goldman was a great champion of freedom, and a martyr for it, as well.America's near silence regarding this great hero is shameful.Read this book- and see the movie &quot;Reds&quot; and you'll know why.Of course, you'll find things to disagree with in this book, but the woman's committment to true freedom is undeniable."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"Emma Goldman is like the black sheep of the family in a lot of regards. America wants to turn its back and forget her contributions to our culture and society. Many worker rights and unions owe something to Goldman. Anarchism and Other Essays is a collection of some of her best writing. Her insight on gender equality, workers rights and even the theatre are appealing. I do not agree with everything she wrote but I feel like I gained something from allowing my mind to be challenged by her thoughts. Read this book. Just dont let Jesse Helms know about it."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"Anyone interested in anarchism should definitely read this book first."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"Emma Goldman was that most rare individual, someone with great intelligence, sensitivity and personal power who did not lust after power over others. By circumstance and our good fortune, a woman who could have spent a quiet middle class life turned into an idealistic firebrand, whose ideas and clarity of expression are still light years beyond many of the crackpots who have taken up her banner. This book deserves a serious look by anyone who wonders why politics never seem to get anywhere. It also refreshingly shows why government is wrong without also pandering to cigar chomping Babbits and their toadies."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. Not only is it an excellent introduction to anarchism, but it's also a must-read for feminists. Emma Goldman was truly ahead of her time, and her radical ideas resonate to this day. She artfully weaves the anarchist philosophy and its relationship to the fight for women's rights together in a strikingly powerful way.This is a truly brilliant collection of progressive essays with a little something for everyone. She covers quite a wide range of topics and addresses a number of women's issues: marriage reform, trafficking in women, birth control & free love, women's suffrage, the emancipation of women, and the women's movement.I also really enjoy the amazing, true accounts she gives of anarchist revolutionaries in their struggles. The tales she tells are incredibly powerful. Then again her own story is heartrending as she was blacklisted and incarcerated herself.This is a book that belongs on every free thinker's shelf. Emma will force you take a closer look at institutions we all take for granted and show you their dark underbellies. That's what I find so intriguing about anarchist philosophy. It makes you think about things, that we've all been trained to mindlessly accept, and dares you to reject them."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"These essays aren't centered on anarchism, she has essays about many different political opinions, but it's a good idea of what an author Goldman is.I say author, because that's what she is. She's an amazing author and speaker, and she really gets me fired up. Sometimes when I'm home alone, I like to read her stuff out loud, it get's me on the verge of screaming sometimes. She's no Kropotkin, but she presents her ideas in such a beautiful way. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in political activism/propoganda of the deed etc., or in the history of such phenomenon."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book. I'm into poli-sci and love the classics, so I went ahead and picked it up, and I must say I really enjoyed it. The author touches on a number of topics all written from an anarchist's perspective, and many of the topics are still timely like prison reform, political violence, race relations and minorities, women's rights, patriotism, and socialism just to name a few. She does an excellent job of presenting her ideas, which she does very matter-of-factly and most eloquently. If you are interested in political philosophy, I believe you will really enjoy this classic on anarchism. It's one of the few political ideologies that puts its trust in the people, and that alone makes it a strange and rare (and refreshing) thing."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I recommend this book to anyone interested in getting acquainted with anarchism.

Even governments set up to be small and unobtrusive always end up stepping far outside their bounds and causing more harm than good. Such is the nature of the beast. People will insist that we need government to protect us and our property, but seriously, more people have been robbed, oppressed, and killed by governments than anything else.

Emma wrote in readable English. By that, I mean she didn't have the annoying and iconic high diction of many authors of her time (compare to Ambrose Bierce). You aren't supposed to just agree with the whole book and all the ideas because anarchism is always changing, adapting, and new threats are added all the time. Emma probably could never have conceived of what the modern State has become - so don't use this as a handbook, and FFS, don't use this and become an armchair politician, or worse, an armchair insurrectionist. Please. There's enough.

The book describes the labor, political, social and military state of affairs in the United States from the late 1800's to the first couple of decades into the 1900's. It could have been written in 2012 to describe the current state of affairs. Goldman and other \\"anarchists\\" love of liberty, education of the young and true freedom are honest and purely from the heart. The anarchists seem to know that their lofty ideals are unreachable but that in placing those goals so unbelievably high that even getting half way there will improve the social condition greatly. Goldman's struggle with the corporate/military/political oligarchy that seems to have taken power away from the voting citizens of the united states is never ending. Her personal history and treatment as a pariah in society only made her realize even more that her beliefs were sound and valid. Which they were and still are. Not knowing much about anarchism or those who espoused it led me to purchase this book because Emma Goldman is the most recognizable of those who's belief she shares in America. The sweeping, lofty vision of the true anarchist are not those of the bomb thrower or the radical street thug who smashes the symbols of capitalism, but of love of life, education of the child, the arts and sciences. Goldman and her comrades strive to educate \\"wage slaves\\" on their own condition and the hope for future personal freedoms that corporations in league with the government and the military hold back from the citizens of america as well as the world in general. I commend Goldman and those who came before and after her on their ideals and hard work in reaching for a higher plain of existence for the common man. Their struggle should continue and their banner picked up and held high. Please read this book. It may change your life."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"The best way to approach this work is to put it into the context of the time that it was written in. Back in the late 19th century, fiery discourse and crude propoganda were the norm and as such, Anarchism And Other Essays offers an excellent snapshot of that era and its concerns. As a philosophical text though, I found it wanting. I don't think anyone will come away with a clearer understanding of the goals and nature of Anarchism after reading Goldman's essay since it, along with the other essays here, seem to be little more than crass sloganeering. The world today is crying out for something more substantial, crying out for analysis that intelligently dissects the problems of the world and offers at least a semblance of a solution. With that in mind, I cannot recommend this collection to anyone seeking that solution.Goldman writes good prose though even if her critiques of still-existent social diseases such as patriotism, marriage and puritanism have been dissected better elsewhere."},{"Title":"Anarchism and other essays","review":"I downloaded this book to my Kindle, and just finished reading Emma's first article: \\"Anarchism -- What It Really Stands For.\\" I feel this is a perfect moment to review the book, as this first article should \\"set the stage\\" for the rest of her ideas and writings, especially since the book deals seriously with Anarchism, a contentious subject.Myself, I am a student of law, but not necessarily a \\"fan\\" of laws in general. I am open to new ideas, and happy to accept (at least while reading this book) Emma's view that statutory laws should be abolished because they are destructive to the human spirit and things that should lead naturally to a good, harmonious society. Fair enough. But Emma's argument contains two major flaws that ought to prevent one from burning his law school books in a fit of revolutionary frenzy!Firstly, Emma's writing suggests that 'crime' is artificial. No statutory laws = no burglary, no fraud, etc. She says the sheer number of criminals is proof that, on the whole, laws do not deter people from doing things which the law-maker dislikes. Only natural laws are obeyed, because nature demands it; e.g. the need for food, air and sex are natural laws. Emma says that prisons are abominations because of the human degradation they create inside (and I tend to agree), thus, they should be abolished since they serve only to create more wrong in society. However, if all this occurred, and we lived in a world without prisons, and only natural laws to guide us, then what would deter genuinely EVIL people from causing harm? Abolishing laws might solve the issue of burglary, fraud, etc., but what about rapists and killers, and violent people in general? If some nutcase hurts one of our family, is it not NATURAL to want revenge? Without prisons, vengeance can come only from acting on one's natural instincts. Therefore, Emma seems to assume that ALL CRIME would cease with the abolition of statutory laws, and that mankind would seldom act to hurt his neighbour.Secondly, Emma states that work should be fulfilling and enriching; based on the individual choice and desires of the worker. In other words, work should not be an instrument of modern slavery, whereby people work in horrid jobs simply to \\"keep going\\" in a society where the cards are stacked against them. Sounds great in theory, and similar even to the communist ideal. However, Emma seems to assume that, by removing the NECESSITY to work (by abolishing property, etc), then enough people would CHOOSE to collect the garbage, or clean public toilets, or flip burgers; i.e. The sort of jobs that NO ONE really wants to do, but get done because SOMEONE has to do it, and EVERYONE needs money.In fairness to Emma, she spent her life preaching the Anarchist ideal, and states in her article that it would take an entire VOLUME of books to answer every possible challenge about Anarchism. But, I believe the two points I raise are vitally important, and her article left me unsatisfied (like I couldn't defend Anarchism based on the information she provided). Not everything can be covered in a single article, granted, but if Emma dreamed of a day when her works would inspire revolution, she needed to address the primary fears of living in a world without government, and laws, etc. She fails to do that here. Still, I enjoy reading her ideas, and will give this interesting book its due by reading to the end."},{"Title":"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth","review":"If you have any interest in R.

Although what I ended up with is a 136-page double-spaced \\"overview\\" by Buckminster Fuller, a sort of \\"history and future of the Earth in 5,000 words or less, bracketed by a *wonderful* introduction by grandchild Jamie Snyder, an index, a two-page resource guides, and some photos and illustrations including the Fuller Projections of the Earth.First, the \\"core quote\\" that I can never seem to find when I need it:OUR MISSION IS \\"To make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological offense or the disadvantage of anyone.\\" Inside front cover.The introduction is a treat--I note \\"impressive\\" and appreciate the many insights that could only come from a grandchild of and lifelong apprentice to Buckminster Fuller.Highlights for me:Founder of Design Science, a company by that name is now led by Medard Gabel who served as his #2 for so long. I just attended one of their summer laboratories and was blown away by the creativity and insights. It is a life-changing experience for those with a passion for Earth.He imagined an inventory of global data. I am just now coming into contact with all of this great man's ideas, but my third book,Information Operations: All Information, All Languages, All the Time, also online at the Strategic Studies Institute in very short monograph form, is totally in harmony with this man's vision for a global inventory of global data.\\"Sovereignness\\" was for him a ridiculous idea, and a much later work out of Cambridge agrees, Philip Allot tells us the Treaty of Westphalia was a huge wrong turn in his bookThe Health of Nations: Society and Law beyond the State.\\"Great Pirates\\" that mastered the oceans as the means of linking far-flung lands with diversity of offerings was the beginning of global commerce and also the beginning of the separation between globalists who knew the whole, and specialists whom Buckminster Fuller scathingly describes as an advanced form of slave.He was frustrated with the phrases \\"sunrise\\" and sunset\\" as they are inaccurate, and finally settled for \\"sunsight\\" and \\"suneclipse\\" to more properly describe the fact that it is the Earth that is moving around the sun, not the other way around.In 1927 he concluded that it is possible for forecast with some accuracy 25 years in advance, and I find this remarkably consist with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan's view that it takes 25 years to move the beast--see for instanceMiles to Go: A Personal History of Social Policy.He has an excellent discussion of the failure of politics and the ignorance of kings and courtiers, noting that our core problem is that everyone over-estimates the cost of doing good and under-estimates the cost of doing bad, i.e. we will fund war but not peace.He described how World War I killed off the Great Pirates and introduces a competition among scientists empowered by war, politicians, and religions. He says the Great Pirates, accustomed to the physical challenges, could not comprehend the electromagnetic spectrum.He states that man's challenge is to comprehend the metaphysical whole, and much of the book is focused on the fact, in his view, that computers are the salvation of mankind in that they can take over all the automaton work, and free man to think, experiment, and innovate. He is particularly forceful in his view that unemployed people should be given academic scholarships, not have to worry about food or shelter, and unleash their innovation. I am reminded of Barry Carter'sInfinite Wealth: A New World of Collaboration and Abundance in the Knowledge Eraas well as Thomas Stewart'sThe Wealth of Knowledge: Intellectual Capital and the Twenty-first Century Organization.There is a fascinating discussion of two disconnected scholars, one studying the extinction of human groups, the other the extinction of animal species, and when someone brings them together, they discover that precisely the same cause applied to both: over-specialization and a loss of diversity.Synergy is the uniqueness of the whole, unpredictable from the sum of the parts or any part individually.On page 87 he forecasts in 1969 when this book was first published, both the Bush and the Obama Administration's ease in finding trillions for war and the economic crisis, while refusing to recognize that we must address the needs of the \\"have nots\\" or be in eternal war. I quote:\\"The adequately macro-comprehensive and micro-incisive solutions to any and all problems never cost too much.\\"I agree. I drove to Des Moines and got a memo under Obama's hotel door recommending that he open up to all those not represented by the two party crime family, and also providing him with the strategic analytic model developed by the Earth Intelligence Network. Obviously he did not attend, and today he is a pale reflection of Bush. See the images I have loaded, andObama: The Postmodern Coup - Making of a Manchurian Candidate.Early on he identified \\"information pollution\\" as co-equal to physical pollution, I am totally taken with this phrase (see my own illustration of \\"data pathologies\\" in the image above). I recognize that Buckminster Fuller was about feedback loops and the integrity of all the feedback loops, and this is one explanation for why US Presidents fail: they live in \\"closed circles\\" and are more or less \\"captive\\" and held hostage by their party and their advisor who fear and block all iconoclasts less they lose their parking spot at the White House.Most interestingly, and consistent with the book I just read the other day,Fighting Identity: Sacred War and World Change (The Changing Face of War), he concludes that wars recycle industry and reinvigorate science, and concludes that every 25 years is about right for a \\"scorched earth\\" recycling of forces.He observes that we must preserve our fossil fuels as the \\"battery\\" of our Spaceship Earth, and focus on creating our true \\"engine,\\" regenerative renewable life and energy.He joins with Will Durant inStory of Philosophy: The Lives and Opinions of the World's Greatest Philosophers: education is our most formidable task.I am astonished to have him explain why the Pacific coast of the US is so avant guarde and innovative (as well as loony). He states that the US has been a melting pot for centuries, and that the West Coast is where two completely different cultural and racial patterns integrated, one from Africa and the east, the other from the Pacific and the west.I learn that he owned 54 cars in his lifetime, and kept leaving them at airports and forgetting when and where. He migrated to renting, and concluded that \\"possession\\" is burdensome.See also:Ecological Economics: Principles And ApplicationsPlan B 3.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization (Substantially Revised)"},{"Title":"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth","review":"This is inspiring reading. Buckminster Fuller's was a mind decades ahead of its time. His specific ideas for preserving &#34;Spaceship Earth&#34; are no longer surprising -- they're common sense. But more interesting to me in this book are the glimpses of his thought process, and the way he cultivates visionary thinking in himself and others. After repeated failures early in adulthood, he came close to suicide. Yet he was able to recast his &#34;failures&#34; into a positive, imaginative approach to life and thinking."},{"Title":"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth","review":"I was drawn to this book by its wonderful title and the recognition that I'd collected a number of quotations by its author without really knowing anything about him.I found this book to be something of a curate's egg. In places it uses language to develop ideas in a really clear way. In other parts the language and structure of the description seems to make the ideas rather impenetrable. On balance, however, the ideas win through.(Having found out a little more about R. Buckminster Fuller I have learned both that this is one of his more accessible volumes, and that his other books may well be worth the challenge.)It is a book with some wonderful ideas, not least the one captured in the title, that the Earth is a spaceship travelling through space escorted by the Moon and following its mother ship, the Sun. Though written in the 1970 this metaphor, or perhaps its simply a realisation, provides a framework which encompasses many of the problems of sustainable living we are currently grappling with.Equally the book has some very vivid and enlightening imagery with which to entice the reader to see and begin to challenge their current paradigm. It for example begins with a story of Global Pirates which is used to describe the recent history of western civilisation, its creation of empires and the division of the world into those that have and those that have not. In a dozen pages or so it describes our current paradigm for how the world works and some of the key characteristics of our environment and the thinking this has created.For example our understanding of need and scarcity, the role of nationality, the use of knowledge. I found the description very thought provoking and began questioning many of the assumptions that drive my, and possibly our current behaviour. He outlined the assumptions that there will always be shortages of resources and food, which underpin a view of haves' and have-not's and our need to protect what we have, often at much greater cost than sharing what we have.This is a thought provoking book, which though in parts challenging, is concise enough to warrant some re-reading. The ideas may shake your understanding and beliefs, which may be one of the most powerful ways of enabling change."},{"Title":"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth","review":"The \\"manual\\" is not philosophy. Its system engineering. Its operand is not Truth, Good, Love,...System engineering can be reduced to one word: efficiency. During the reader I kept thinking this is the stuff that generals read, and I am only a lieutenant. Which is not to say generals are better. It's just that lieutenant's deal with more human problems. While the generals deal with the big picture.For example, when discussing Einstein's Relativity Fuller keeps invoking the equation E=MC^2. This is the over arching general relation between energy and matter. It's the great answer. But to me what is wonderful about Relativity is the equation distance=sqrt(x^2+y^2+z^2+(it)^2). Here time is in the imaginary direction. What is that? We often say we have 4 dimensions. But that is not quite right with this equation. In the small pictures I find delight.In some ways Fuller reminds me of Marx in its grand scheme. Marx has his historical materialism. Fuller has its metaphor of the \\"manual\\". But of course Fuller will have nothing of Marxism. For him Marxism will be dead dogmatic metaphysics to be avoided."},{"Title":"Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth","review":"This is the clearest I've ever known this man to be.

This book makes much more sense than any government plan that I know of. We all need to read this book."},{"Title":"Developing Windows Error Messages","review":"Ben's book is well-written and well-edited and provides a number of useful ideas on how to write effective error handlers and error messages in the Windows environment. It's focus may seem strange to nonprogrammers, but programmers appreciate this sort of guidance on details.However, Ben does repeat some saws or maxims which need to be deconstructed.One is that at one time, error messages were overly terse because &quot;there was not enough storage&quot; to make them useful.I find this disingenuous, because the dreamtime to which Ben is referring to is probably the early 1980s. In the early 1980s, I was as a former IBM 1401 programmer (whose first machine ten years prior had 8000 characters of storage) in awe of the possibilities of the primitive disk and tape systems then available.On the 1401 I had developed a system which used an &quot;overlay&quot; and a supplemental manual procedure to provide a user with fully expounded error messages in English, and by the early 1980s, providing my users with English error messages was not a problem.The idea that at any time &quot;we are limited by the gear available&quot; is to me a confession that a certain need is not important enough to warrant our time. Basically, the need of users for error messages has always been triaged and continues to be triaged in an unconscious binary opposition between the &quot;serious&quot; and MALE tasks of programming, and the &quot;not serious&quot; FEMALE task of communication. To me the first mistake was to divide these tasks.Another old saw Ben repeats is that &quot;programmers&quot;, in inverse proportion to their skill level or interest in being &quot;programmers&quot; do not like to write, or cannot write.This saw exists in a logical dependence on an idea from outside programming which is that there is such a thing as a content-free &quot;skill in communication&quot;. Although a convenient corporate reification, useful for example in getting rid of racial minorities, women, and older employees on the basis that they are mistreated because of a generalized lack of &quot;communications skills&quot;, the very idea that we can speak of communication without discussing content, or for that matter simple morality, is nonsense.&quot;Poor communicator&quot; may be a true generalization as applied to the actual population of programmers in the United States. However, it is belied by a maxim of hero computer scientist Edsger Dijsktra, which is that programming ability is indicated by command of the language.To the extent that programmers write overly terse error messages they may actually be, while statistically representative of American programmers considered highly qualified, less well-qualified than they could be.This is because the only evidence we have that the programmer understands his system is something outside code.Ben Ezzell himself shows he's qualified by not only writing good examples of error messages but also by being aware of what the user probably needs. He does so as a programmer who can code, and it is a false humility of his to say that programming skill has nothing to do with communications skill.Managers love to give programmers books such as Who Moved my Cheese? and The Elements of Style, probably because these books rigorously exclude the content of the programmer's work from consideration. This may be useful in some cases but basically it is an attempt to deprofessionalize, for it denies that the programmer has learned anything worthwhile.The managerial saw is that by definition &quot;mere programmers&quot; do not know enough to communicate with users and require by definition an interface consisting of people who do things like review, or actually compose, error messages. But inside the corporation, resources are allocated by non-market means despite the commitment to the free market, and the practical result is that most corporate employees seek first to avoid blame and are therefore not likely to compose forceful and hard-hitting error messages because in the corporation, the messenger is killed for bad news.I am not dismissing the need for people to perhaps specialise in technical writing or even the composition of error messages...especially for international systems. It would almost be too much to expect programmers to know multiple human languages. What I don't like is the ideology implicit in saying that we must cultivate a content free communications style. I like Ben's book because it is ABOUT both programming and communicating.The genuine quality of this book, together with its genuine aporias, indicates a need for a definition, outside corporate hegemony, of programming. This definition is needed because if programming is implicitly defined ONLY as MIS programming, it becomes impossible to develop effective systems for the public good...as evidenced by the real problems government and not for profits have in implementing systems; because of omnipresent cost considerations, many such organizations are forced to use off-the-shelf packages which encapsulate (at a deep level) assumptions valid only for private, for profit businesses in what are called &quot;business rules.&quot;A critical theory would define programming, not just writing error messages or documentation, as writing and not mathematical, while at the same time realizing that many practitioners seriously underestimate the applied mathematics of programming. In the present arrangements in the US, programming is considered mathematical and numerical in some sense, thereby excluding many people who could make a contribution, while in another sense, any form of real mathematics and real logic is excluded at the critical point in the development of many systems, usually when cost constraints can be used to justify hand-waving.If I understood what Claude Levi-Strauss was talking about in expounding a way to read a myth against its own grain rather than literally, I would be able to conclude that American programming praxis is a form of systematically misreading an Enlightenment myth. This would help me to understand why such genuine talent and ability such as Ben's is on display in books from publishers like O'Reilly whereas in practice error messages STILL confuse genuine end users."},{"Title":"Developing Windows Error Messages","review":"This book contains very little meat for my taste. I can't believe that, as a book devoted to Windows error messages, it does not even mention the Windows NT Event Log anywhere! I'm returning the book since I can't find much in the book that adds to my experience.Perhaps new programmers can learn a thing or two from this book such as the three elements of good error messages. But as an experienced developer, I'm totally disappointed with this book and would not recommend it to any of my peers."},{"Title":"Developing Windows Error Messages","review":"I would agree with other comments that this book is more philosophical than technical, but I think that is a good thing. When planning a program the error handling side should be more thoroughly planned, and this book helps with just that. I found much of the book obvious, and could flip through 5 or so pages at a time, but the bits that are not so obvious are worth searching for.If programs are written using the style of error messages and/or the error message handling process suggested within this book I feel that the user term \\"User Friendly\\" (at least in relation to errors) would actually be deserved. For instance, how many times have you come across an error that only has one action that you can take \\"OK\\"? Is it okay that the error happened? Is it okay that you can't do what you were trying to do?Therefore I would say that this book holds much more value to the project manager/project leader/planners than programmers.Much of what is spoken about is not OS specific (besides a bit of code). It seems that it is directly aimed at Windows 95, which is why there is no talk of NT error logs.I found the supplied code (2 DLLs) to be a bit old but it was a simple enough to use it as a template and build on them. The dialogs within the sample code are quite user and programmer friendly and did not need altering. Using code I already had, I added database error lookup/logging, screen and system capturing, NT Event Logging, email support and COM Interface within a day. HOWEVER I feel that the supplied code is of little value to any programmer who is not planning on altering the code in some way, so it may not be much use if you don't know C++."},{"Title":"Developing Windows Error Messages","review":"Overall, I recommend this book to anyone trying to improve their error message reporting. The book includes a CD containing a first rate message reporting DLL. This code is itself worth the price of the book.The author's writing style is somewhat verbose for my tastes, and is filled with irrelevant and pointless footnotes and personal asides. Thanks to the excellent formatting and editing of O'Reilly books though, this doesn't seem to get in the way of reading the book."},{"Title":"Developing Windows Error Messages","review":"The book covers an interesting and previously un-covered topic. Depending on your experience it may prove to have some good ideas too. There's something to pick other than ideas too--it shows how to use the &quot;html browser&quot; control, which if you haven't yet found out how to from somewhere else, is helpful to learn from here.At the same time, there are shortcomings. An example of a rather minor one is questionable opinions presented as indubitable truths: &quot;html-based docs are always nicer than rtf-based ones.&quot; (Really? W/o looking at the file extension, how'd one tell the difference? ) At times I had a feeling that wrong words were used to express something. More importantly, the book is very wordy--I constantly catch myself skipping lines impatiently and in irritation. The book could have been half the size (and definitely half the price.) Finally, and most importantly, the book's most prominent failing is a gush of artificial, absolutely pathetic, never-successful and always-nauseating attempts at humour--the typical MSPress-style of phony writing. I have a funny feeling about that because in the past I'd read quite a few O'Reilly unix books and there was none of it there. I'd also read another, earlier book by the same author--there was none of it either. Who makes them write like that all of a sudden? My (conspiracy &lt;g&gt;) theory is, it's MS's propaganda department. If you know the truth--send me a note, I _am_ curious.I so far has refrained from highlighting anything in this book. I have a premonition: I'll send it back. After all: speak English, dudes.

Overall, I am disappointed with this book, considering the publisher and price paid for it. Most likely, this expensive book is getting returned.If you have no experience with creating suitable user interfaces for error messages and/or error handling, this book is a good place to start. It provides solid information on when and how to interrupt the user for various error types, and describes the various error types extensively. However, as an experienced programmer, I was looking for specific and new information about generating error messages. I really didn't find anything that was of any use to me that was related solely to error messages. Don't get me wrong - there is good information in this book, but most of it is based upon general, common sense ideas about user interfaces and error handling.The thing that annoyed me the most was that the writing was too verbose and the book too long for the limited content found in it. I frequently found myself skipping over the personal vignettes looking for nuggets of useful information, and the &quot;humor&quot; was artificial and contrived - isn't this supposed to be a professional volume? The content in this book would be more useful and accessible if it were distilled and placed as a couple of chapters in a more general introduction to user interfaces book."},{"Title":"Toddler Talk: The First Signs of Intelligent Life","review":"This book is ideal for parents of infants who want to enchance the ability to communicate precisely with their child before the child is able to vocalize.

The justification is clearly detailed, yet fun to read. The instructions for signs are clear as well.

Quick snapshot biographies of thirty-five writers with Wisconsin roots. From the truly famous such as Edna Ferber, Robert Bloch and Thornton Wilder -- to the once famous like Sterling North, Hamlin Garland and John Muir. Also represented are regional writers such as Zona Gale, August Derleth and Edna Meudt; genre writers Clifford Simak, Peter Straub and William Steuber; as well as a sprinkling of writers I had never heard of (Jacquelyn Mitchard, Marya Zaturenska, Kelly Cherry).All the biographies are told with vigor and exactitude. James P. Roberts has met many of the writers profiled, and the more historical personages have been well reseached. It might be argued whether some of the authors included are truly \\"Wisconsin\\" writers (both Iowa and South Dakota claim Hamlin Garland, for example, and he actually didn't start writing until he lived in Massachusetts), but Roberts makes a good case for every name he included.All in all, this book matches up quite well with August Derleth's book WISCONSIN WRITERS AND WRITING. Amazon should consider doing one of their \\"two for one price\\" deals with the two books. They would go together well.I have only two complaints against the book. The first being that amazon.com does not have it listed (as of 7/1/02) under its correct title. This (of course) was not the fault of the author, but it did make it very hard to find, even by someone who knew of the book and was looking for it. Hopefully the listing can get corrected.My other complaint is that there is one glaring absence from Roberts' FAMOUS WISCONSIN AUTHORS. Probably the most famous and bestselling contemporary Wisconsin author (from Oregon, Wisconsin - graduate of the University of Wisconsin) is nowhere to be found. Kevin J. Anderson should have been included.I do recommend this book however. Especially to anyone with an interest in authors of the upper Midwest and the literary environment of Wisconsin. Wisconsin has always produced more than its share of writers, architects, scientists, artists and other intelligentsia. It was fun to spend a day in the company of such men and women as inhabit James P. Roberts' book FAMOUS WISCONSIN AUTHORS."},{"Title":"Cats' Letters To Santa","review":"What could a cat pawsibly want for Christmas?

Its texts and exercises tell the story of a Danish farm family, with a son named Ole. Not long after I started reading the book I was having lunch in a restaurant and three young women sat at the table right next to me. They spoke what I was sure was Danish. So I decided to try out what I learned from the book: &quot;Er du dansk?&quot; Which means, &quot;Are you Danish?&quot; They had no idea what I was saying, but one thing led to another and one of them became my wife. She comes from a Danish farm, just like the family in the book, and even has a brother named Ole. Over the years, from listening to what she says to me, I've picked up a few other Danish terms (for example, &quot;idiot&quot;), but this is the book that got me going.The text starts simple but, even early on, gives a real feel for what Danish culture is like. The typical chapter has a short dialogue, glossary, grammatical notes, and exercises, as well as &quot;ordsprog&quot; and &quot;talemaader,&quot; proverbs and sayings which give you a great introduction to the sly and ironic Danish sense of humor. The book provides an especially clear grasp of the &quot;Jysk folkekarakter,&quot; the character of the people of Jutland, which is pretty impressive for an introductory language-learning text. If you work at it, after a while you even come to bits and pieces of the Ugly Duckling in Danish, the language of Hans Christian Andersen.

Her early family life marked her out from the begining as one different from the others, a lost cause, but the arrival of the lovely Eva to work in the museum canteen promises to change all that.The two narratives intertwine with each other. The tragic story of Gert's formative years is hilariously told and will strike many satisfying chords with anyone who's ever felt 'a bit different', invisible or even 'the devil incarnate'. In the present, Gert's tentative pursuit of Eva is punctuated by letters from her estranged mother and weird telepathic messages from twin brother Frank.This book is very moving and terribly funny. The reader is never quite clear what is real and what is not, comedy and tragedy are so firmly entwined you don't even notice them strangling each other. Yes, everything about this book was brilliant - the humour, the narrative, the characters and even that rare thing - a satisfying plot structure."},{"Title":"Crocodile Soup","review":"A little quirky, a little odd... but loveable and readable and recommendable! Gert is somewhat of a social outcast, reclusive and shy, and her story just deserves to be read. You will read wanting to jump into the pages and help with her mother, her attempts at romance, and life in general. Different, but great."},{"Title":"Crocodile Soup","review":"If you are interested in lesbian coming of age stories this one is of a higher quality than most others. It's funny and moving but also satisfyingly complex. You'll love it."},{"Title":"Crocodile Soup","review":"A great story interspersed with the Gert of now, who works hard at being invisible at a museum, with the Gert of her childhood. As a little girl she was frowned upon as an odd child and was relegated to sleep in the attic which she believed housed a ghost.I am surprised poor Gert made it through her childhood! What a funny story it was! A distant mother, an odd twin, Frank, who she can telepathise with and a father who spends his time building a boat, and then sails off, never to return!Life isn't easy for the adult Gert, but through friends in unlikely places she begins to come out of her shy self."},{"Title":"Crocodile Soup","review":"I'm still slightly unsure of why this book was entitled Crocodile Soup in the first place, and I guess I felt some confusion throughout the whole book. Though the author's voice is definitely quirky, and humorous, I found her style a bit difficult to follow at times. I did not tear through this book, but rather found myself wanting to finish it but having a tough time doing so. It was thought-provoking in that I felt like I had to concentrate to keep the plot and characters straight (is that a pun?) in my mind, which in a way seemed to be what Gert was doing. I did like the characters, particularly Harry, George, and Gert, and enjoyed the manner in which Julia Darling described scenarios in such a unique manner. I would only recommend this book to people who are looking for something &quot;different&quot; to read this summer!"},{"Title":"Crocodile Soup","review":"This work is utterly unique and unlike anything I have ever read. Mixing surrealism and magic realism with the stark confronting realities of heartbreak and hardship, 'Crocodile Soup' is a magnificant and addictive little read and a individual find amongst lesbian centred fiction. It is particularly important to note that it is set in England, which gives it a unique and humourous voice amongst the predominantly American lesbian canon of literature.The writing is quite poetically beautiful and somewhat reminscient of Lia Block's 'Dangerous Angels' series, though generally more pointed and less whimsical. I adored the short little chapters, which made this work quite a fast and enticingly simple but important read.Additionally, the characters are utterly charming, whether they are likable or not. All the characters border on insanity (and some become so) and this lends the work an air of wonderful chaos and discord. They really are exceptional characterisations, and it is perhaps for this reason Darling's work is so successful.Overall, a magical, wonderfully addictive and beautiful book which I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Martha Grimes follows up her MAN WITH A LOAD OF MISCHIEF with THE ANODYNE NECKLACE. A story of murder, missing jewels, new interests, delightful off-beat characters and an unforgetable tour of London's East Side.Richard Jury is investigating a murder, but Lady Jenny Kennington is a lady with real problems. My favorite character was Mrs. Pennystevens who never beamed Sir Miles as I would have like to have done.

There is Plant and Tree, Wiggins and Biggins; then an obsession with cats and pubs, people's blue eyes and local dialect. After a while, it all gets a bit tedious. There are some amusing moments but outside of Melrose Plant or Emily-Louse, or perhaps Sir Miles Bodenheim (except for the constant egg on his lapel, tie or ascot) , the characters are not all that interesting. The plot and resolution struck me as contrived - a mysterious map which to me was completely unnecessary, a necklace that was easy to hide but took a year to be retrieved. The culprit was pretty obvious to me from about the middle of the book.I checked inside another of this series and it seemed to be almost identical to this one.Give me Agatha Christie any time!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Compared to the John Sanford prey series or the Michael Connelley Detective Harry Bosch seriesthis is pretty dull. There is no getting into the mind of the criminal at all. I also felt no intimaterelation with Detective Jury; there is very little about his life problems or what he is thinking as hetries to solve the murder. It is just aplodding questioning of suspects with little if any real police procedure or scientific analysisof evidence. If you like British dialogue with weird names of streets and towns then this may appealto you. Some of the characters were interesting but that is it."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"The series could use ore dynamic character development between the main characters.

The first novel in the series is Man With a Load of Mischief and the second is Old Fox Deceived. Each book in this long running series is named after an actual pub in Great Britain.The character development is the best feature of this book, with my favorite character being Melrose Plant, oft-put-upon by his thoroughly nasty aunt by marriage, Lady Agatha Ardry.Melrose gave up his title as Lord Ardry, still lives in his family's ancestral manor, Ardry End, and he doesn't stop his aunt from blatantly pilfering treasures from his home.Oh yes, there is a murder, of a young lady whose fingers are cut off. Another young girl is knocked on the head as she plays violin in a subway station, and she is in a coma. Someone has crafted a treasure map, and a very valuable emerald has been stolen.Get busy, Richard Jury and volunteer detective Melrose Plant, and solve this case!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Katie O'Brien plays the violin at a tube station to earn money for fashionable clothes. Playing a theme from EVITA she is hit on the back of the head. Racer calls to tell Jury he is going to go to Hertford, not Northants, for the weekend. The reader finds Melrose Plant drinking shooting sherry with his aunt, Agatha Ardry, as he tries to sneak off to join Jury in the murder investigation. It seems that a sort of bird watching fanatic, Ernestine Craigie, has spotted the dead body looking through her binoculars. The body of the murder victim rests in the vicinity of an overgrown public footpath in the Horndean woods.The violinist ends up in the hospital in a coma. She is the daughter of the female publican of the village, Mary O'Brien. The pub is called the Bold Blue Boy. The identity of the homicide victim is Cora Binns. There are connections. The girl in a coma comes from the village where Cora Binns's body is discovered. She was playing at the tube station, Wembley Knotts, from which Cora Binns departed to travel to Littlebourne. After a far amount of dithering, Melrose Plant and Richard Jury meet up at the pub, the Bold Blue Boy. It is learned that the girl in the coma, Katie, gave a child a book just in case. The child, Emily, gives the book to Melrose Plant.Then there is another incident occurring at a village fete. It seems the two homicide victims worked at the same secretarial agency. A valuable necklace, stolen previously from one of the inhabitants of Littlebourne, is discovered in a crevice at the Wembley Knotts Underground Station. Katie dies. Her violin teacher plays Pavanne for a Dead Princess at the site, the station. There is a sting operation resulting in the capture of the wrongdoer.Polly Praed and Jenny Kennington are minor characters in this adventure. The title, of course, is the name of another pub having significance to the mystery and neatly coinciding, (necklace=necklace), with one of the clues to the three deaths."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Honestly, I have no idea why Martha Grimes is so popular. This is the only novel by her that I managed to slog through, and I hope it isn't characteristic of how this author usually writes. This was one of the most boring attempts at a mystery that I have ever encountered. The plot is pretty much non-existent, the characters are completely one-dimensional and often practically indistinguishable. There are endless attempts at very tortured jokes that are supposed to pass for a sense of humor.The only reason I forced myself to finish this horrible book is because I really wanted to know what is it that makes so many people like this writer. Nevertheless, I still have no answer to this question."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"I now have all of Martha Grimes' books. This was just as good as all the others."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"When I first read the Jury and Plant series, all the books named after Pubs, I was shocked to learn she was American. She just does Brit droll humor to a T. I was even more shocked when later I learned that Grimes was actually dropped by Knopf Publishing, saying she was not making her advance back on the Jury series. Well, she has gone on to make them eat those words as every one is now a bestseller. I absolutely love to read, but in this instance, I actually prefer to enjoy the audio tapes simply because they are done by the great Tim Curry. As Grimes does Brit humor to perfection, Tim brings Richard Plant, Melrose Plant and his indomitable Aunt Agatha so perfectly. Curry slips into one character after another with such panache - right down to children. The combination of Grimes and Curry is just not to be missed.In the Anodyne Necklace, a violin, an ancent emerald necklace and a severed finger are clue to solving the ghastly murder in the wood of Littlebourne. The town is filled with dotty birdwatchers, a pretentious Peer, and more suspects than Jury can handle. Naturally, the ever-so-helpful, Melrose Plant, a Peer who has shun his titles, tags along to aid his friend - actually, to escape his Aunt Agatha who refuses to let Melrose give up his titles. The key unriddling the Littlebourne mystery is hidden in coded treasure map.It's great full all they way, and an absolutely must for Curry fans! Martha loves the old saying he who laughs last...she has been having one big giggle on the shortsightedness of Knopf ever since!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"This is the book that began the Jury/Plant series, where all of the books are named after pubs. This is one of the very few books in my experience where I remember who the muderer was because it was a flawless mystery, perfectly logical, nothing held back, but still I couldn't guess the culprit! Definitely NOT the &quot;had I but known&quot; school. There are some wonderfully gory scenes, if you appreciate that in your mudrer mysteries, in adition to wonderful character moments and real humor. I found this book to be the best of all of M.Grimes's marvelous books. I hope they republish! I read this book for the first time when I was nine (child of a mystery reader)and it has not lost its charm with successive readings over the years. My old copy finally fell to bits!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"This early Richard Jury novel is more comic than most of the others in this series--the scenes in Littlebourne, despite the fact that this is a mystery, are quite funny, with stock characters who end up being likeable and affecting. However, the strength of this book is in the scenes in The Anodyne Necklace and its surrounding London slum neighborhood, which is full of eccentrics, odd as can be, but fully enjoying their sordid lives.The murderer is a surprise here as well.This is also the novel that introduces Jenny Kennington, who is as enigmatic at the beginning of this series as she is later on. I am not sure of her appeal for Richard Jury!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"This book was absolutely awesome. I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading it! I definately suggest any of the Richard Jury books to anyone who likes mystery books!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"The Anodyne Necklace,by Martha Grimes, is actually the third book in this great series.

The original copyright is 1983, so don't be surprised by the reference to Princess Di. The settings for the novel are London and the small suburban town of Littlebourne. The Anodyne Necklace is the name of a working class pub in London.The storyline is interesting, with a mugging and a couple of murders that have to be drawn together. The story revolves around a valuable stolen emerald, set into a necklace. The thief, who had been a trusted personal secretary to the moderately wealthy owner, was killed in an accident shortly after the theft. He left a clue to the location where he concealed the jewelry, but the clue itself became concealed.Now it is a year later. People who might have knowledge about the necklace are being assaulted and killed. There appears to be an unknown accomplice to the theft. Richard Jury and Melrose Plant track down the information, and leads take them in various directions, including a Wizards snd Warriors game. It seems that the deceased thief was a master of the game, and the clue seems to be in a game map.The plot is complex and seems, perhaps, to be overly contrived in places. The author seems to have a fixation on flashers (they have shown up in other novels), and in this novel we have Ash the Flash and his young son, Friendly. The flashers seem peripheral to the main plot.The novel has a surprise ending when the identity of the accomplice is revealed. It is not great literature, but provides an interesting whodunit for light reading.A previous reviewer is incorrect in stating that this is the first novel in the Jury/Plant series. The first novel in the series is \\"The Man with a Load of Mischief.\\" I believe that this is the third novel in the series (there is a Listmania listing available, prepared by a different reviewer). A local bookseller has recently stocked the full series, so I believe the full series has been reissued."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Second book in a row read by me and third book in the series..Still a very good read, though this one wasn't such a pager turner for me but the atmosphere and the charm is still there, and the story/mystery is very interesting.

I'm about to read the first one in a series and wonder if i find a kid there too!"},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"This is the third in the mystery series starring Richard Jury of Scotland Yard, newly promoted to Superintendent (though he seems to spend his time doing the sort of investigative legwork any DC would do, and appears to have no administrative duties at all), and his buddy, ex-earl Melrose Plant. This time the victims (they're always multiple in this series) include a dead woman found with severed fingers in a wood near a village frequented by birdwatchers, a dealer in antique jewelry from a neighboring town, and a teenage violinist trying to earn a few extra bob playing in a London Underground station. It all ties in to the theft of a valuable emerald necklace -- and a treasure map. There's also a precocious twelve-year-old girl who's good both with horses and with retailing information for a consideration (precocious kids are also obviously a staple character type in this series), and a whole family of stereotypical East Enders. The mystery itself is well thought out (and not telegraphed by sloppy writing) but much of the enjoyment in the book comes from Grimes's dry wit and the interplay between Jury and Plant."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"Each mystery takes place around a pub with an unusual name. The reason for the name is explained within the story. This is a grand piece of British pub history. The stories themselves are twisty and turny and hard to solve ahead of the denouement. Supt. Jury and his partner Sgt. Wiggins are fascinating personalities. Add Melrose Plant, Lord Ardry and his Aunt Agatha and you're set for a great read."},{"Title":"The Anodyne Necklace","review":"I love the Richard Jury series...witty and challenging to those of us who are mystery buffs...trying to figure out who did it. His friend Melrose Plant, who is a wealthy earl who &#34;threw away his titles&#34;....very enjoyable."},{"Title":"Lives Through Literature: A Thematic Anthology","review":"This thematic anthology of literature is wonderful. The selections revolve around a number of different myths, folktales, fairy tales, and bible stories. The editors have collected short stories, poems, and plays that allude to the myths, etc. They've organized these wonderful selections (for example, the myth of Persephone and Demeter, along with Robert Hayden's \\"Pomegranate\\" and Louise Gluck's \\"The Pomegranate\\")to allow students to explore uses of myth and folktale in literature. Even for the non-lit types, this collection offers a way in because it begins with familiar childhood stories.It is unfortunate that a previous reviewer of this textbook has chosen to rate his professor (one of the book's editors) rather than evaluate the book itself. I don't know Professor Helane Levine Keating, but the single poem of her own that she includes, \\"The Envious Heart,\\" alludes to \\"Snow White,\\" and is a beautiful piece."},{"Title":"World of Bonsai","review":"The World Book of Bonsai is a very beautiful book.

Each page has one line of the song (only the main verse, not the extended songs you see here and there).The only things I wish were different:1. The button is a little hard to push. It takes more pressure than I would like. My daughter can still handle it, but it takes a bit more effort from her than I expected.2. The song playback itself is a bit fast. My expectation of the song is a little slower tempo. It does run through the song twice, though."},{"Title":"Daughters of the Great Star","review":"I was thrilled with this book and the one before it.

If you like a women centered book where the heroines are women warriors with mystical powers, a book that is full of mystery, high adventure, and courage. You must start with Journey to Zelindar : The Personal Account of Sair of Semasi, then Daughters of the Great Star, and The Hydra.

Very clear, very direct, well ordered, easy to find information in, including images where images are necessary.The only downside in my case - which will definitely NOT be the case for everyone - is that the book doesn't have any tutorials or exercises that we can practice with, or have students practice with. I usually use the &quot;Around the Clock&quot; series in my classes, simply because they have a decent (no more than that) tutorial in the end. If this book had one, I'd completely switch to it in a heartbeat.Thus, if you have some notion of Quark, and want to learn more, get this book; if you know most of Quark, get this book so you can learn more; and, if you think you know all of it, get it and be surprised.

The author takes a clear-eyed look at the statistics that have been floated before us in dozens of newspaper and magazine articles, in television programs, and other popular venues. Nimmons rightly protests that the statistics have for the most part been interpeted with a preconceived conclusion by popular writers. He also digs up other statistics that have definitely not been presented, because they do not jibe with the prevailing attitudes about his subject-- the subculture of gay men. He offers his own take on what these statistics and patterns mean, refusing to accept the pronouncements of other people without being convinced by the data.He presents information about several aspects of the behavior of gay men as a group. The police logs tell us that violence in gay bars, Pride parades, and other gatherings of celebrating and often intoxicated gays is far lower than in heterosexual gatherings such as pubs, sporting events, and parades. The incidence of gay domestic violence, distorted in the popular media, is in fact equivalent to the incidence amongst the straight community. In fact, conflation of lesbian and gay domestic violence rates may make gay men seem more prone to domestic violence than they actually are.Nimmons examines the rates of volunteerism amongst gay and straight men and find both monetary and time donations to be significantly higher in the former group. He hypothesizes that an ethos of caring informs not only the frequency with which gay men volunteer for both gay-related and gay-unrelated causes, but also informs the higher representation of gay men in service-connected careers like healthcare, social service, etc.The author considers what it might mean that gay men handle relationships of all kinds differently than heterosexual men. He cites mostly anecdotal information in this topic, hypothesizing that the gay modes of managing interpersonal relations-- male-male friendships, male-female friendships, and romantic relationships-- may be of benefit to our society as it evolves. He wonders how the \\"traditional\\" family concept can be held as a yardstick when only 25% of families contain a mother, a father, and children.He also presents a refutation that behavior-modification efforts targeting safer sex have been failing with gay men. Nimmons looks at the rates of safe sex amongst various groups, and finds that gay men have changed their actions most, with an approximate 2/3 rule: 66% or so of gay men have substantially altered their sexual practices toward the safer, while heterosexuals have done so at a small fraction of this rate.Shorter thought pieces are included: the place of ecstatic or spiritual practices in gay men's modes of celebrating; the sensitivity to beauty and art that gay men demonstrate; the effects of negative social influences that erode what gay men do best and how they feel about themselves.Nimmons' new ideas about gay theory are intriguing and important. When he uses concrete data, he makes strong cases. At times he ignores possible confounding factors (for example, perhaps gay men don't utilize police services as frequently as other groups because of a reluctance to face societal derision or authority indifference). At other times he relies as much on hypothesis as on hard data. Nevertheless, his assertions are at least as valid as what passes for the hard journalism most of us must rely on.Perhaps the biggest complaint with the book is in the writing. Nimmons starts off with a blithe attitude, attempting to use humor that, unfortunately, distracts from the important message he is making. He returns to the humor periodically and it continues to be jarring. Also, he is repetitious in foreshadowing his points, in making deductive conclusions, in summing up his hypotheses. A more heavily edited book would have been more cogent, making its points succinctly and with greater impact. The Soul Beneath The Skin is, however, a conceptual accomplishment for this iconoclast-- recommended highly for humanists, feminists, religious leaders, and anyone concerned with the state of our society. It stands alongside The Myth Of Male Power as a fresh way of looking at the world in which we live."},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"This is a much needed and long awaited POSITIVE study of the contemporary gay male. This book should have been written years ago as it puts into proper perspective the many important contributions gay males have made to our society and how these contributions have been ignored, dismissed or overlooked. It exposes the myths and lies about gay male lives, and opens up to all who read this book the true accomplishments gay men have made in this world. It's an optimistic presentation and a valuable text for gay studies courses, or for anyone interested in the lives of gay men. It's intelligently written, yet an easily understandable book for anyone to read, learn from, and enjoy.This book explains how gay men have developed a culture where violence is almost nonexistent; where new forms of friendship, intimacy, and relationships have been developed with less sexual jealousy; where gay men and straight women have forged lasting relationships; and where volunteerism for both straight and gay causes is much higher than other segments of the population.THE SOUL BENEATH THE SKIN was a positive joy to read. It offers hope for those who are disappointed, and disillusioned with \\"the gay community\\" as it now stands. This book is surely \\"the light at the end of the tunnel\\". Hopefully, it will be read by all, gay and straight, so that a more appreciative understanding can be forged between all of us. All of the thanks goes to David Nimmons for taking the time and effort to do such an in-depth study of gay men's lives and the positive contributions they have made to society. A NEW BEGINNING!Joe Hanssen"},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"Rarely has a book written by a gay man for gay men reached such depth and inspired to such new heights in an easy to read and accessible story-line.Can gay men become the healers of the world, showing straight men that violence and insane war-mongering are no longer necessary? Has the gift of the gay spirit evolved to such a point that we can be shamans of the world, teaching community living and loving? David Nimmons' book reveals the gay soul in a way never captured before.You'll want to read this book if you want to understand how the \\"curse of homosexuality\\" has become \\"a gift to the world.\\" Never before have the voices of so many millions of gay men been able to influence the future of society as it can now. Nimmons shows us, in many different areas, where overcoming the gay challenges makes our personal experiences an asset for the modern world.A delightful book, written in the gay voice. Inspiring. A must read for gay leaders and the community minded."},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"David Nimmons' extraordinary new book about gay men and gay culture is refreshing, honest and meaningful in a way that most books about us are not. It is meaningful because it is about us, our lives as gay men. He has observed and researched the very things that make gay culture, gay culture. In the process he de-bunks some myths and creates new understandings about gay culture. It is significant that the focus of this book is about our lives, our love individually and communally and our ability to shape our and the world's future.His understandings of the traits, habits and mores of gay men are newly stated realities of sometimes hidden understandings of who we are. What is most wonderful for me, someone who has written about, studied and worked in gay male cultures for the past 30 years is the central question that is presented in the book. While he talks of our commitment to non violence, our ability to deal with the HIV epidemic ( and safer sex) better than any people on the globe and our unsurpassed capability of for using love and compassion in our daily lives, he constantly asks, \\"Why is it that we don't know these good things about ourselves.\\" This is the challenge and the opportunity that is presented in this book. He tells us about us and suggests ways that we can create the world we want as gay men. It is a first!This is the best book about Gay Culture and Gay Men in almost fifteen years. It doesn't focus on the political but the personal which is where I believe we need to be. It is the successor to the work of Mark Thompson, et. al in Gay Spirit and Gay Soul, the real grandson of the writings of Harry Hay and the only book since Judy Grahn's Another Mother Tongue to talk about who we really are.What a wonderful addition to the literature. It is must reading for all gay men and for all those who love them. It should be required for anyone wishing to do AIDS education and prevention work with gay men. And of course non gay people should definitely read this bookAbsolutely fabulous darling!"},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"No matter what one's sexual orientation, this book should be read by anyone who is critical of the ways we relate to one another in the US culture, such as our embrace of violence and tolerance of abuse, the me-centered individualism, and the \`men are from Mars, women from Venus' gender divide. David Nimmons posits that while not all gay men are saints, they have created a subculture that is largely peaceful, abhors violence, and has little physical abuse either in relationships or in public bar fights. Even when gathering in massive numbers at Pride parades there is seldom any cause for police intervention, a fact noted by researching several police records in urban areas. He notes as well that, the strong emphasis on community service and volunteerism, especially, but not limited to, the many ways the gay community gives so unselfishly in the fight against Hiv/AIDS and those impacted by it. The author acknowledges the lack of research on these positive elements of the subculture but documents all of his hypotheses through persuasive anecdotal evidence.As for intimate relationships, he notes the lack of jealousy, the open relationships in the vast majority of couples, and the willingness to incorporate former partners into new configurations of family. This breadth of community with its intimate connections and support is usually unknown among heterosexuals. In addition, the ways most gay men comfortably interact with heterosexual women suggests not only that the lack of female fear of male predation is operative, but that by not adopting the machismo and stereotyped male ways of being, gay men have learned a more compassionate and relational way of being to which women respond. Straight men might well learn some great lessons from their brothers.As a social activist and clergy it is clear to me that the warm openness and focus on intimacy and relationship in the gay male subculture offers us clues to how to become better neighbors with one another, male to male, male to female, regardless of orientation or relationship status. Gay men, perhaps by the necessity created from marginalization, have worked out ways of being in the world that deserve greater attention if not emulation by the rest of us. The problem for the author is that few gay men recognize nor give themselves credit for what they have created."},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book hoping that it would be discussing how gay men experience spiritual things. Instead, I got yet another book that reinforces the stereotype of gay men as promiscuous, hedonistic and adolescent. The author tries to justify the so-called gay lifestyle by claiming that promiscuousness is a form of spiritual fellowship and that hedonism is the search for enlightenment. He also tries to convince the reader that gay men are superior to straight men, even though he states several times that this is not what he is doing, his tone makes it obvious. Gay men are more charitable (Chapter #3), peaceful (Chapter #2) and fun to be around (Chapter #6) than heterosexual men are. He writes a whole chapter to explain why straight women prefer our company to that of straight men (Chapter #7). Chapter #8 explains the tribal bonding of the circuit, the dance, the drugs and, of course, the sex.This brings me to the main thing that I did not like about this book. It's supposed to be about gay men's souls and there is no mention of religion or G-d. This may be his soul, but it is not mine. There is nothing wrong, per se, with being promiscuous, hedonistic or adolescent, but please do not try to give it spiritual significance or portray it as something that defines our soul. At this point, the book left me depressed and sorry that I had even started reading it.However, in Chapter #9, Mr. Nimmons does hit the nail right on the head. I have never read a more accurate portrayal of the gay world that I have experienced. Gay men, especially in the milieu of a gay bar, can be catty, rejecting, and superficial. In Chapter #10, Mr. Nimmons makes a plug for his organization that seeks to offer an alternative to Chapter #8 and #9. I wish him the best of luck in his endeavor. He is a visionary, but I fear, his vision will fall on eyes distracted by the next cute guy. It has been my experience that gay men are the way they are because that is how they want to be. But what we do not want to be is another stereotype. Just like everything else, our lifestyle has its good points and its bad points. It does not need an apology, an excuse, a justification, a change, or an elevation to a \\"higher\\" level. It is what it is; but take heed, it is not our soul."},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"the premise of this book suggested that there might be some interesting ideas in there. what a disappointment-there are none. the book is basically a brochure for the authors movement(?)of manifestlove (as he calls it). it all reads a bit new-age, and very american...with little idea or appreciation of a whole other gay world out there beyond the u.s.a. what makes the book ultimately pointless is that nimmons has no new ideas - he spends the best part of the book outlining what is wrong (or underappreciated) with gay men and their lives (all seen through rose-tinted glasses...especially the chapter on gay men-straight women friends...yuck!!!!!!), and then trots out some of his manifestlove ideas at the end. and consumers...since you are now hooked, you are supposed to sign up for one of his courses/camps or whatever. it is a very cynical approach to write a book to promote your own industry...and as such should be avoided! spend your money elsewhere! or better...just go for a walk on a beach at sunset and enjoy the view and the sounds of the waves...it will do you a lot more good...and make you feel way better than this book!!!"},{"Title":"The Soul Beneath the Skin: The Unseen Hearts and Habits of Gay Men","review":"Cutsey and annoying writing wrapped around appealing, but ultimately empty ideas.

The book's chief merit is that it doesn't deny their existence, but its chief defect is that it attempts, largely unsuccessfully, to try to interpret these characteristics in a more favorable light. I agree that some of these favorable interpretations are reasonable: for example, I agree that the greater amoralism of gays opens up certain aesthetic or artistic possibilities, at least given a certain understanding of art. But from the point of view that is most interesting to me, as someone trying to assess the romantic possibilities, I disagree that something very good can be built on such things."},{"Title":"Webster's English-Pinyin-Chinese Dictionary, Level One for Beginners Using Traditional Characters: Easy-To-Read Edition for Everyday Practical Use","review":"This book only has two or three items on every page.When they say over 100 items (words, phrases, ORsentences), they mean it.

It has many wonderful pictures of the many varieties of dwarf cichlids, both New World and African. However, the lack of content makes it not very valuble for the advanced aquarian. It tells very little about the habitats needed by the different types of dwarf cichlids. It does not tell what tank size each type of cichlid needs, nor does it address the Ph and hardness needed by the various cichlids. The pictures, while clearly labeled, are not with the descriptions of the dwarf cichlids they show.

Sometimes, the best, and most satisfying, literary experience comes from reading an old childhood standby. While some may find that statement childish, and myself immature for making it, it is true nonetheless. As C. S. Lewis pointed out, the mark of true maturity is being able to enjoy good books regardless of what type or kind they may be.Currently, I am in the process of collecting the entire set of *Encyclopedia Brown* books, and have made my way through three of them. Since the books are so similar in structure, the only difference being the sets of actual four to five page long \\"cases\\" in each book, I can basically review all of them by reviewing one of them.The protagonist is a ten year old boy named Leroy Brown. Due to his near-perfect memory, and love of learning, everyone other than his parents and teachers call him \\"Encyclopedia\\". His father is the Chief of Police of their small, fictional town of Idaville. Joining Encyclopedia is his best friend, and bodyguard, Sally Kimball. Sally is described as pretty, tough, a great fighter, and almost as smart as Encyclopedia himself.Whether helping his father with a case, or helping his friends for the fee of \\"25 cents per day, plus expenses\\", the boy detective goes about the solutions in the same way. He carefully looks for any inconsistency in the stories or mannerisms of potential antagonists, and exposes them when he notices them.Often, the solutions that Encyclopedia and Sally give are solid, and the bad guy is soundly caught. Other times, the solutions are a bit more subjective, but the perpetrator confesses out of panic. What is neat about this aspect is the realism of it. I read a statistic a while back that the vast majority of criminal convictions are won on the basis of the criminal confessing to their crimes. This is not always because the criminal is caught red-handed, but because he was caught in a lie. He confesses when he realizes he can not get away with the crime.The most enjoyable part of the series, other than the nostalgia factor of remembering my boyhood, is the way that the \\"end\\" of the story is placed in the back of the book. After Encyclopedia (or Sally) declares the answer to the problem, the author asks how they came to that conclusion. At the end of the book is a special section telling readers the solution and what happened in the story after the case was solved. It is a lot of fun to try to solve the cases myself.These books, written by Donald J. Sobol, are enjoyable and engaging. They will never be considered classical literature, but sometimes it's neat to read something just for the fun of it. Recommended for those who want such a fun read."},{"Title":"ENCYCLOPEDIA/PITCH (America's Sherlock Holmes in Sneakers, No. 2)","review":"Short puzzle mysteries are one of the best ways to exercise and strengthen the intellectual equivalent of the biceps muscles.

It offers solutions to our children concerning interpretation skills in the highly competitive information age.What we see in America normally is a weird intermingling of high ideals with gross materialism, the lofty and vulgar cheek to cheek. The people who detest USA take a look at this odd conjunction and assume the materialistic America is the real America. The real America, they insist, is the resource wasting, TV-drenched unreflective part of the earth. The President's talk about freedom, the high toned language is just a cover, they say, for the quest for oil. Desire for riches, dominion and war.Viewed in this context, the recent magnum opus of Dr. Peter S Whybrow's \\"American Mania-- When More Is Not Enough\\" is a wonderful and comprehensive analysis of the disease that afflicts us all. Drawing upon detailed case studies and alarming statistics of obesity, depression, and panic disorders, offers compassionate guidance offers compassionate guidance. Interestingly, he suggests that our immigrant heritage accounts for our compulsion to push for more. Migrants are by nature risk takers and reward seekers, and we've concentrated tens of millions of them in America. The shared mythology in USA is that we can each enjoy fame and fortune and live in opulence at the top of the social pyramid. All can be first and all can be wealthy.Why is America at the leading edge of this? Why do we seem to be more maniacal than other countries? We are definitely out there in front, whatever index you use --- the amount we work, the amount we spend, how much we eat. Only 2 percent of the world's population moves in the migrant sense. Most people die within 50 miles of where they were born.He explains succinctly how food is a symptom of our dysphoria --- it's easy to know when you're hungry but not when your satiated. The average time in McDonald's is 11 minutes, even if you eat there. So there's this urgency, and you go right past your ability to tell whether you're hungry or not, and before you know it, you've eaten too much. After analyzing dysphoria, he comes to affluence. Extraordinary choice itself is affluence. Extraordinary amounts of information coming in through a little handheld instrument . . . how many people do you know who are checking their e-mail every 10 minutes?The reason for that is that the body has no real upper limits. It's not like going to the gas station and you put the pump into the tank and it automatically shuts off when it's full. We don't have anything like that in the human body. Humans aren't physically set up to deal with affluence. Our body hasn't evolved much in 10,000 years --- minor exceptions, very minor adaptations. So we're really running with a genome that was designed for the hunter-gatherer, who lived under frugal circumstances, was very cunning, worked in social groups and managed their lives pretty effectively. And now we live in incredible affluence, we take virtually no exercise, and we compete with each other continually.\\"Tom\\" is an entrepreneur in Whybrow's book who says he was once \\"the world's most frequent flier,\\" a frenzied businessman who flew around the world at least once a month. Tom is reformed now, having watched his business addiction destroy his personal life. TOM is also an acronym for \\"Toward Optimum Mindfulness\\".The four \\"rules of Tom\\" : 1. Your time is yours, so use it wisely, 2. Make technology work for you, not vice-versa, 3. Eat responsibly and in company, 4. Honor your body are solutions to the accelerated and disorganizing effect of manic behavior.Prof. Robert Cloninger's TCI (Temperament and Character Inventory) described on pp 80, our search for the edge delineated on pp 121, the obesity pandemic dealt with on pp 154, are all nice and novel insights. The difference in meaning of \`happiness' and \`pleasure' in English and French is a nice distinction. Fundamental to personal happiness is the emotional insight gained from living honestly in the moment. The fact that clocks disrupt the harmonious rhythms of inner time is elaborately dealt with in pp 238. Finding an optimum balance between self and society is a matter of personal responsibility. Time, technology, appetites and activity are considered in a new light for finding balance on pp 241.To find balance in life, the author Peter Whybrow divides his time between the urban frenzy of Los Angeles and the solitude of Plainfield, New Hampshire. No wonder.This book is a golden mine of information for people willing to accept the disturbing truths regarding USA and proceed toward optimum mindfulness.

Later, I left academia and immersed myself in the world of international commerce and finance. My experience has left me hard to impress. I am impressed with Dr. Peter Whybrow's book, American Mania: When More is Not Enough. I found it insightful, challenging and ultimately empowering.Dr. Whybrow invites us to look at where we have arrived after three incredible centuries, to contemplate the paradoxes of our unique prosperity and its current effects on our physical health, our state of mind, the quality of our social relations, and the future direction of our nation. He does so from a unique perspective derived from his expertise in medicine, neuroscience and evolutionary biology. His deep concern is that the \\"fabulous\\" turbo-paced, technologically driven society we Americans have built is outpacing our physiological abilities to adjust and may therefore be unsustainable. Presenting facts and provocative case studies, he offers a convincing argument that, \\"In our compulsive drive for more, we are making ourselves sick.\\"As a people we are suffering from obesity, the burdens of debt, and shallow social relations fractured by unbridled self-interest. As a result, we are taking an increasing amount of drugs in a desperate attempt to treat stress-related diseases, depression, and high blood pressure. \\"We are sleeping less, working longer, spending less time with our families in the manic rush to earn more money to buy more goods that leave us wanting more.\\"At least one critic has implied that Dr. Whybrow is a Luddite, clinging to the past and disdaining technology and technological progress, in fact, Dr. Whybrow is a staunch advocate of the benefits technology and has used it to address a variety of medical illnesses. He has played a prominent role in the development of modern technologies to better understand how the brain works and has pioneered innovative treatments for some of the more malignant forms of manic-depressive illness. He has dedicated his book to his brother, John Whybrow, a leader of technologically driven enterprises. If you look on the web, you will see that John Whybrow was the Executive Vice President of Royal Philips Electronics in Holland. He is currently the Chairman of the Board of Blue Tooth, wireless technologies.The author of American Mania knows what he is talking about as a result of his academic background and medical expertise. He also knows what he is talking about as a result of his own personal experience in striving and achieving within the force fields presented by American institutions. He is the Director of one of the world's most prominent Institutes of Neuroscience and Human behavior with a yearly budget of 250 million dollars and a faculty and staff of 3,800 people dedicated to research, teaching and care-giving. Combating the comment of one critic, I would suggest that is hardly a stress free job in a \\"rarified habitat.\\"Nor is his a condescending voice that touts the superiority of the \\"Old Europe\\" and longs for its traditions. On the contrary, Dr. Whybrow himself is among those ambitious, hard working, curiosity-driven, risk taking, competitive migrants whom he sees as having had an incredible impact on the formation of the American temperament. He is one of the 2% of the world population that chose to move further than 50 miles from where he was born.Dr. Whybrow migrated from London in the mid-sixties and became a US citizen in the early seventies. As such, he is among those Americans whom he describes as, \\"a self-selected group of hard-working opportunists with an insatiable hunger for self-improvement.\\" In an interesting argument, he attributes the insatiable hunger to our genetic heritage. Whybrow proposes that immigrants actually have a \\"higher frequency of the exploratory and novelty seeking D4-7 allele in the dopamine reward system of the brain.\\"As a cultural anthropologist, my strong bias is to steer away from too close a linkage between genes and behavior. However, YC Ding and others in the Department of Biological Chemistry, College of Medicine, at the University of California have conducted some intriguing research that indicates that this allele, associated with \\"attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and the personality trait of novelty seeking,\\" originated as a rare mutation that \\"increased to high frequency in human populations by positive selection.\\"Although Whybrow believes that the \\"American Experiment\\" is genetic as well as social, his book is not another simplistic approach to genetic determinism handcuffed to socio-biology. As a practicing doctor, trained in endocrinology and neuropsychiatry, he knows that genes, though a contributing factor, are not the blame, as some other reviewers presuppose. In fact, he is not placing blame; he is attempting to help us understand and urging each of us as individuals to take back control of our lives from the merchants and an economic system whose goal is not to make us healthy and happy but to sell us more.What he does so well throughout the book is try to help us unravel and question how our insatiable drives for security, betterment, material affluence and positive affirmation- fueled by the reward system of our uniquely affluent society-have reached a level that is making us perpetually anxious and fearsome as individuals and confused as a nation. An interesting review by Peder Zane thinks that the book, \\"speaks to an unease with American Life that can be heard on the left and the right.\\"This is not a happy book. The author presents some hard facts that some might find a bitter pill to swallow. We Americans tend to have pretty thin skins when it comes to serious social commentary and criticism. The label anti-American pops up too easily. Arthur Miller's Death of a Salesman (1949), which questioned how the American Dream played out for the legion of failed battlers like Willy Loman, got him in a lot of trouble with the House Committee on Un-American Activities. We seem to be more open to searching criticism if it is delivered by humorists like: Mark Twain, Art Buchwald, Bill Maher or Homer Simpson who says, \\"Good things don't end in eum, they end in mania or teria.\\"I believe that if we are going to keep the \\"American Experiment\\" on track we need to listen to thinkers like Peter Whybrow, Jared Diamond and Robert D. Kaplan. They demonstrate how the group can provoke individuals within it to behave in ways that are ultimately self destructive. Peer pressures, cultural norms and expectations generate maladaptive behavior that becomes self-perpetuating. Even those afflicted don't realize that there might be a problem. Dr. Whybrow does an enormous service in making us more aware of the problems and in so doing gives us a chance to find individually appropriate solutions.In the last chapter he clearly states that we as individuals are equally responsible for the decisions we make and the society we construct. Contrary to the criticism levied by one another reviewer, he is not calling for new government programs and social engineering. He argues that each one of us can do something about \\"too much fat, too little sleep, too much dept, too little time with our families\\" and that small changes in our own behavior can make a big difference.I know that this may seem naive and futile to some. But, I am reminded of an early winter morning jogging on the beach in Del Mar, California. A freak tide had left tens of thousands of small fish stranded and gasping for air on the sand. I saw a man stop, stoop over, pick up a fish and throw it back into the Pacific. I stopped and watched him do this over and over again. Finally, I walked up to him, smiled knowingly, and said, \\"You know that really doesn't make any difference.\\" He stooped over, picked up a fish and as he threw it into the water, and said, \\"It does to this one.\\""},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"The thesis of Whybrow's book is one that rings true, \\"In our relentless pursuit of happiness, we have overshot the target and spawned a manic society with an insatiable appetite for more.\\" He does a great job of clearly identifying the problem as he sets down an indictment of American society, suggesting America's supercharged free-market capitalism shackles us to a treadmill of overconsumption, fraying the family and leaving us anxious, alienated and overweight.In attempting to diagnose the 'why' behind the 'what', Whybrow suggests \\"the dopamine reward systems of the brain are... hijacked, and genes are to blame: programmed to crave material rewards on the austere savanna, they go bananas in an economy of superabundance. Americans are particularly susceptible because they are descended from immigrants with a higher frequency of the \\"exploratory and novelty-seeking D4-7 allele\\" in the dopamine receptor system, which predisposes them to impulsivity and addiction.\\"I'm not convinced about this. America is too big a melting pot for such a seemingly broad-sweeping, all-inclusive answer. Furthermore, I question the science behind the assertion.However, I believe he's spot on when he writes, \\"The mind is prone to addiction,\\" Whybrow claims, \\"Everybody is capable of becoming addicted to something - wine, sex, food, exercise, the very pursuit of happiness. Paradoxically, freedom without restraint is enervating, not liberating. There's a difference between pleasure and happiness; happiness depends on limits.\\"'Here is the greatest contribution of the book. His statement is something which is unpopular, and at the same time corresponds with the human condition. \\"Happiness depends on limits.\\" This is where I believe Whybrow breaks through, but at the same time leaves the reader asking for more. Where are those limits to be placed? What functions in society should determine limits? Are boundaries objective - applying to all people, in all times, and in all places? Do they move from individual to individual? Does God exist? If so, does His will/perspective determine where the boundaries of the creation are set? These are the questions I wish Whybrow had explored in order to make this book so much more."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"this is a rich and loving book. yes, its a cautionary tale... but its told from the perspective of a wise person of our culture, someone who wants to preserve its best elements, and wants to steer us clear of potential hazards. this is a book for anyone who loves what is great about america, who wants to celebrate america, who wants to preserve its best elements, and im afraid anyone who wants to reduce it to america bashing is missing a great gift.im not an academic, or a big tent thinker.... but this writer clearly is. in a culture when you get airtime by either being a narrow specialist or spewing easy wide ideas from a narrow foundation, how lucky we are to have a man like peter whybrow join the national discussion. here is a man who is a scientist, a historian, who has passion for music and culture, who loves both city and country, a wise observer of the everyday, and most importantly, a man who chose america as his place to shine.this book is not only for academics, but for anyone who is interested in community building and making the place they live a better one.whybrow never says that the mania he describes is relegated to america only, but because if its intellectual and cultural history, america is on the leading edge of this phenomenon the mania he describes as a \\"high\\" is in fact, achieved in a society that aspires to high accomplishment. but who can doubt his diagnosis? we are, in fact, a manic society.and it is precisely because this county is on the leading edge of the diagnosis that we can be on the leading edge of the solution. we can take this wise man's prescription and pull ourselves back from a brink we don't want. to analyze our values. to control our own destiny, not have history and genetics control it for us. i loved this book and was inspired by it. i hope others pick it up and feel the same.this is a great read, not just for academics but for social and community leaders, thinking individuals, people who want to gently nudge this country in to a place of strength built out of sanity and love."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"I started this book with anticipation and the further I went the more disappointed I became. Whybrow makes an interesting arguement that Americans are slamming up against limits they refuse to recognize - biological limits like how much change the mind and body can absorb. He calls this the Fast Society and his argument builds upon earlier historians who noted the psychological effect of the closing of the frontier in the 1870's.Whybrow's primary hypothesis, however, is that there is something GENETICALLY special about Americans because we are descended from restless people. He traces both innovation (good) and inability to handle limits (bad) to this genetic material.There are two big problems with this thesis: First, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Australia, and Canada are all immigrant societies, too. For Whybrow's hypothesis to hold, they must also manifest these traits - irrespective of their political and social institutions. Whybrow does not think to ask.Second, Whybrow quotes deTocqueville's Democracy in America at least three dozen times in defence of the special (genetically based) character of Americans. Yet deTocqueville's most passionate (and perhaps famous) chapter compares the people living on both sides of the Ohio River, in Ohio and Kentucky. Tocqueville notes that these are ethnically the very same people - often closely related, yet the two societies differed drastically with respect to innovation, industriousness, independence and initiative. He was disturbed by the slovenly habits of Kentuckians, their disdain for work, their lack of initiative or enterprise.From this observation, deTocqueville argued that slave-owning was profoundly enervating and corrupting, even of the vast majority who owned no slaves. That Ohio and other parts of America owed their creativity and restless energy to democracy itself - and that the slave-owning south was not completely democratic, but stunted.This is one of DeTocqueville's most famous arguments and it directly contradicts Whybrow's hypothesis. Whybrow never confronts this. After awhile I started to wonder if he really had read DeTocqueville, or whether some graduate student was supplying him with quotes.Finally, Whybrow appears unfamiliar with previous (famous) critics of the soul-destroying aspects of American society - Whyte's Organization Man and Roszak's Where the Wasteland Ends come to mind."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"This book is quite thought provoking. The author, a psychiatrist, has observed manic behavior in today's society, comparable to the manic behavior observed in his patients. The driving force of this mania is today's fast paced economic engine. There is much to be learned here, as the topics cover a wide range of subjects from economics to brain chemistry.The book is a well written, especially the beginning chapter, which is a brilliant expose of the author's theory on American society. By the end of the journey, I suppose the lesson is pretty simple: People need to slow down and take time for each other. There is also another important lesson, concerning the negative impact that large American mega corporations have on local community economics and foreign cultures.My one complaint is minor, regarding the ending of the book and \\"The Rules of T.O.M.\\". Tom is a real person and an American Manic. He is a former Olympic level athlete, an Ivy League graduate, and a deal maker always living on the edge. By the end of the book, Tom has changed his ways, now putting his energies into curing people of their manic ways. These anecdotal rules are not the type of ending that I was hoping for. I felt that this was like a plot contrivance to \\"wrap things up\\", and it came across as a bit too neat. Had Tom truly experienced an epiphany of sorts? Had Tom \\"gone to Hell and back\\" and truly reformed his manic ways? Or is Tom someone who saw an opportunity to make money curing this newly identified American social illness?Dr. Whybrow's thoughts concerning the need for human empathy are profound. He writes that empathetic skills are learned behavior, and it is a parent's responsibility to foster a child's development of empathetic behavior. This is becoming increasingly more difficult as the media promotes self-centered behavior. I've also read similar books of this genre, such as \\"The Closing of the American Mind\\", that reinforce many of these same ideas."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"In these troubling days of American narcissism and self-perceived supremacy, the charge of \\"anti-Americanism\\" has gone to such laughably ridiculous lengths (\\"Freedom Fries\\") that it's no surprise that such a charge would be slung toward this book and its author for daring to scientifically, psychologically -- and yes, morally and socially -- question the current status quo.That the CITIZENS of this great nation-experiment called America were long ago renamed and reclassified as mere CONSUMERS, and by the corporate culture that now controls every facet of our lives and well being -- to ME, that is what is TRULY \\"anti-American,\\" my friend. Too many of us have unthinkingly, willingly accepted it, despite the dysfunctional, personal results (obesity, anxiety, depression, etc.) that are outlined in this book. It appears that we have adapted our definition of \\"the pursuit of happiness\\" toward working our self-centered butts off, no matter the personal costs of physical or mental health, so that we can \\"shop till we drop\\" and \\"accumulate\\" -- and all the while becoming isolated from family, neighbors and community -- the very social fabric that once defined the substance and strength of this great nation.Having rejected the current model some time ago, refocusing and recommitting my life toward active involvement in the social and community relationships that have redefined \\"happiness and success\\" for me, this book simply resonates with reality and truth. Further, and most importantly, it not only explains why, as descendants and members of America's \\"immigrant culture,\\" we are predisposed to the \\"addiction to more\\" that once held me in its grip, but it proposes the very cure I discovered through my own agonized searching -- a recommitment and active involvement in neighbor/community relationships.Dr. Whybrow states, \\"Ironically, the same tools and technologies that have enabled America to achieve Adam Smith's \`universal opulence' have also compromised the social anchors that the old philosopher took for granted.\\"Yes, Adam Smith, the god of free market capitalism, wrote about more than \\"Wealth of Nations\\" -- and in fact, that entire volume presupposed a continued structure, membership, and concern with the COMMUNITY ENTITY.\\" \`The man whom we naturally love the most,' Smith wrote in The Theory of Moral Sentiments - the book that established his reputation as a thinker - \`is he who joins to...his own original and selfish feelings, the most exquisite sensibility...and sympathetic feelings of others'.\\"The very fact that Adam Smith's name is more easily and closely associated with \\"Wealth of Nations\\" than with \\"The Theory of Moral Sentiments\\" is a telling indictment of our current culture. That we might, everyone, re-read \\"Moral Sentiments\\" followed by an equally careful read of \\"American Mania\\"...\\"No man is an island unto himself\\" are words whose proof we are now living.For those of you who are uncomfortable, but can't put your finger on \\"why,\\" I cannot recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"\\"America is the riches country in the world but ranks only in the middle range among nations when it comes to happiness.

It summarizes the entire book rather well. I think this book is a must read for people who are heavy in debt as almost all such people are there because of an attempt to find happiness where happiness is not found.

I do feel that it's worth it.Tom Carpenter, Author CWNA, CWSP, Wireless# Certification Official Study Guides."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"I was drawn into reading this book as it promised to add interesting insights to a fascinating area: namely, contemporary culture and the human being's ability to keep pace with an accelerating society.I have given a critical review, but I have also put some thought into it and would not have bothered unless I thought his ideas had potential.The author has some worthwhile points to make in genetics, human biology, psychology, etc.But ultimately I was left thinking about his ideas while wishing he had taken them further.Specific aspects of his writing style frustrated his message.He plasters his arguments with overly dramatic descriptors of modern cultural phenomena as if he is writing a press release.\\"McDonald's steamrollering globalization\\" is typical of the sort of florid style that works to the detriment of his presentation, and he uses it throughout the book.We should be presented with data in context. We might agree with his conclusions if we are allowed to compare apples with apples. For example, when talking about the decline of traditional jobs that offered lifetime employment, he states, \\"A 1999 study found that 21% of California workers had been in their jobs for more than 10 years.\\" There is no benchmark given for this statistic (that is, how about previous years or decades? How about for other states? For the nation as a whole?). In the same paragraph he gives us another statistic about an alarming increase in bankruptcies. Supposedly this strengthens his findings of the perilous lot of the modern-day worker. I am not saying that I disagree with him. Just that if anything, it muddies rather than clarifies his argument to use these sensational statistics plucked from disparate sources and not presented in a cohesive and logical scheme. This happens all through the book. It suggests that he is trying to slant his comparisons to bolster his case, but surely if his case is good enough (and I have no reason to believe it isn't) he doesn't need to use these journalistic tactics.That is a shame, because I do believe he has some excellent insights that could stand up to the cold hard light of day.Perhaps if he had worked with a person having a certain statistical rigor as a collaborator/editor/critic, these weaknesses would not have diminished the impact of his message.For me the worst aspect of the book is that he does not realize that the reader can remember. We get the same thing served up to us over and over throughout the book, as if we didn't get it the first time.I was eager to read more of his thoughts on connections between genetics and societal patterns, or deeper analysis of the specific examples he cites so many times, or even wild speculative guesses.He relates the sagas of a certain three Americans: a rat-race-refugee guru, a salt of the earth type, and a corporate victim. They could have been key in shedding light on the puzzle. But only Tom offers a couple of pages of suggestions, which really might have been photocopied out of a Zen Buddhist self-help manual from 1976. Peanut, the traditionalist, has no part to play in the future of America? He is only presented as an icon of \\"what was\\". Kim experienced the Mania and stepped back, for her own sanity, but what has she learned that adds to our understanding of a way forward? Their value as messengers seems limited - they are not \\"going anywhere\\".Given his professional qualifications, I was looking for more. Perhaps a glimpse of how humans might cope in the future with the increasingly pressing challenges of modern life. It seems he is mostly a descriptive writer, however, and doesn't go into deep analysis despite the size of this book.In a nutshell, he could have expressed the key ideas in a 10-page article.--Murray J Og."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"Peter Whybrow's finest moments are to be found at the beginning and at the end of this book, in which he provides an eloquent, impassioned and highly quotable critique of contemporary American society. Ideally, these two sections should be treated as independent essays, because they really don't deserve to go down with the rest of the ship - which, in this case, is a very long exposition of an error-ridden, poorly (though lengthily) defended, and, well, just plain wrong, hypothesis. The short version of Whybrow's thesis is that Americans are \\"manic\\" because America was populated by migrants who were curiosity-driven, risk-takers, and that, somehow, this resulted in changes in neurobiology which in turn perpetuate (and perhaps create - this was vague) the inability to be satisfied with \\"enough.\\" One might expect this kind of individualistic theory from a psychiatrist, which is a profession that frequently misses the larger picture. What one doesn't expect is the degree to which Whybrow explores the migrant \\"mind-set\\" without offering a shred of evidence for its existence. (No \\"evidence\\" can be offered. Most of these early migrants are quite thoroughly dead.) Notwithstanding the fact that a significant proportion of migrants came to America against their will (Africans, Chinese, and most women to name a few) there simply is no means to evaluate whether any migrant group anywhere experiences a shift in the activity of neurochemicals. Simply put, the claim is sheer nonsense.Whybrow makes a grand attempt at supporting his claims by drawing from venerable old dinosaurs. Although Whybrow quotes Adam Smith at considerable length--giving the reader the false impression that Whybrow actually understands economics--he does not analyze America's manic spending with any kind of depth. Instead, he offers a series of broad, well-known statistics about wealth distribution, economic trends, etc, which tell us very little about the actual psychology involved in our supposed spending frenzy.All this could be forgiven had there been an adequate amount of thought put into the central tenets which form the bulk the book. But here again, Whybrow falls short. He tends to rely on popular prejudices more than actual research. His blithe claim that the fall of Soviet Russia signaled the triumph of laissez faire capitalism over communism stands as one of the more ridiculous statements in the book. (Not withstanding the very obvious communist elephant in the room - China - no reputable economist in the past 200 years has actually treated laissez faire capitalism as anything more than a quaint myth.) His assumption that obesity is somehow related to unbridled greed is equally absurd. When was the last time you saw an obese CEO? A simple comparative field trip to a McDonald's, and let's say, a high-end French restaurant on the upper east side would have added a vital piece of factual information so deplorably missing from Whybrow's analysis. For, unlike the exec-moms and financial wiz-kids who Whybrow seems to think are representative samples of \\"America\\" your average wage-earner does not suffer from \\"over-scheduled\\" children, jet-lagged interpersonal relations, and turbo-charged consumption.If are looking for an exposition of some of the unfounded myths \\"explaining\\" contemporary America, then this book is for you. However, if you'd rather sink your teeth into something thoughtful and well researched, then read Jared Diamond, Kevin Phillips, and Chalmers Johnson."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"Whybrow's book does a good job of discusssing free market economies and globalization. There are several references to Adam Smith and Alexis de Tocqueville's classic book \\"democracy in America.\\" He feels that Smith would be upset with our current situation. For instance, Whybrow points out that Smith felt that potential downfalls of free markets, such as greed, would be kept in check by a desire to be accepted in the local community. Now that we live in the \\"global village,\\" the checks on self-centered behaviors have disappeared. Early in the book, Whybrow discusses the biological reasons why people and specifically Americans are most vulnerable to globalization and a consumer based society. Our ancient ancestors lived through extreme periods of feast and famine. These conditions bread the tendency to over consume when the recourses were available. Now we live in a continual state of abundance. Americans are unique because they are a collection of adventurous, risk taking migrants. Most all of our families have only been in America for a few generations. It obviously takes a certain type of person to leave their country in hopes of a better life. Whybrow speaks of the brain chemistry that is present in these individuals. Levels of seretonin, dopamine and the numbers of certain receptors that can characterize personality. These characteristics can explain why we work harder, have more debt, and save less than anyone else in the world. Personally, I feel he makes good points, but neglects the effects of television and advertising. Whybrow focuses the later part of the book on the consequencies in this type of lifestye, which is not suited to our anatomy. Less time with family members and friends as well as a lack of exercise and health problems. He concludes that there is no changing the \\"Fast New World,\\" but there is hope to live a healthy life outside work.

He also explains how things have gone awry in regard to having too much of a good thing. In his argument, he draws on evolutionary biology, neurology, economics and many other resources. This book is well researched.American Mania illustrates the personal and cultural problems that arise when our rate of technological advancement outpaces our ability to evolve. The bottom line is that mechanisms that once served us and helped us to survive become self destructive. For example, a craving for fats and sweet things was good 100,000 years ago, but not so good now when we have all kinds of food available to us all the time and lead more sedentary lifestyles.This book is wonderful for looking the implication of all of the above within the individual and at the level of culture. It is great food for thought. It will help anyone who is looking for balance to put things in perspective and understand why we have a tendency to err in the directions that we so often do as individuals and as a society."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"Whybrow presents an interesting, thought provoking, plausible hypothesis about a combination of culture and physiology that promotes maniacal behavior but after clearly describing the ball he will carry he keeps on running and running with it...almost maniacally (sorry, I couldn't resist). The long drawn out example of \\"Peanut\\" and the table conversation with three other people left me yawning. It's as if Whybrow were dealing with a not-very-bright reader, leading them slowly along the path of explanation when his whole point could be clearly made in one chapter.His writing style is very pleasant, I can well imagine him as an engaging and thoughtful man in conversation and as a psychiatrist speaking with empathy to a patient. For such a disturbing theory, the book is a comfortable read yet I kept asking myself - why is it necessary for someone to read a book like this? Leaving aside the causes for our frantic society, isn't it clear to us that we aren't doing ourselves any good in our frenzy?We have worked ourselves into the present situation for which our physical evolution has not prepared us. Technology has left genetics far behind.But doesn't common sense tell us that we are not in a healthy pursuit?As Paul Simon sang:Kid you better look aroundHow long you think that you can run that body down?How many nights you think that you can do what you been doing?Who you think you're foolin'?There are contradictions to equating mania with the way we live. Is sitting in front of a TV for hours mania - or apathy? Is exercising to keep the body in good condition mania - or good sense, it could be one or the other.I believe it is more a case of our being in a trance from which we cannot awaken than of our genes driving us to excess. It just might be that most people don't know what to do with themselves - they have no clear purpose in life so simply drudge from day to day heading to work, eating, flopping back. People who find a real self-fulfilling purpose in life have joy - THAT is the rarity. One could, I believe, as easily make the case for depression as mania and Whybrow does talk of manic/depressive behavior.Perhaps this book is the kindly Dr. Whybrow's way of giving a slap to the face so we can say, \\"thanks, we needed that!\\""},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"Whybrow convincingly explains that Americans in general are biologically hardwired to be restless and oriented towards distant goals- and our condition is inimical to the very well-being that we hope to find through our activity.As a student of Urbanism, I found this book fascinating. One of the distinctive characteristics of the American built environment- a pattern that repeats everywhere you look- is the instrumentalization of all things for some other material end. Whybrow explains (to my understanding) the mentality behind the landscape.Whoever you are, whatever your interests or profession, this book is a must read if you want to better understand your country!!"},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"\\"American Mania - When more is not enough\\" - was a tough read, reminiscent of a textbook, but I'm glad I read it cover to cover.Dr. Whybrow spends a lot of time on the immigrant nature of the United States - defining the cultural and genetic nature of this country as one built on the individualism, curiosity, adventure, and self-sufficiency of the migrant. My conservative friends may well revel in this idea. The fact the he quotes Adam Smith more times than I can count should have them eager to read the book.However, the book also covers the negative aspects of self-interest taken to the extreme - hurting the individual, the society, and the country. The lack of happiness is reflected in the stressed-out, burnt-out, overweight, gun toting crazies that we see all around us if not in the mirror.Dr. Whybrow explains that in addition to the self-interest and curiosity driving Adam Smith's economic engine there is a very important balance that he thought was just as critical - societal responsibility to maintain a strong local society to curb to the greed and self-interest of the individual. Dr. Whybrow explains how the balance between the individual and the group was required our survival through the ages - that we have been built for such balance down to our genes. I agree with him and believe that there is also a spiritual component of that balance - which he does not express in the book.Getting back to his main man Adam Smith - Dr. Whybrow says that he \\"distrusted large organizations - be they government or corporate - as forces that foster greed, distorting and suppressing the dynamic market exchange and social intimacy that are essential to fair dealing\\".Without preaching - we would be better to focus less on getting more stuff and focus more on building local communities and economies. This may hurt the mega corporations and unseen executives but we will be healthier - happier - better adjusted rather than succumb to the mania of wanting more and more so that more is not enough.But this is just what I think - read the book and decide yourself."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"I appreciate how Dr. Whybrow gathered information from various realms of science to support our American over-consumerism.

He describes the need to take stock in what is meanfuling in our lives and how we might remain mindful of our choices. Truly, we have choices.

It's killing us."},{"Title":"American Mania: When More is Not Enough","review":"American Mania by Peter Whybrow, MD - Exploitive Misnomer?More, more, more...what the hell are we all morticians?e.e. cummings.The fundamental premise of American Mania is that despite the affluence, the epidemic of stress, anxiety, depression, obesity and hurried sickness is addictive Americanism. Whybrow's lays the cause to internal instinctual \\"self interest\\" and offers external social engineering as the solution.American Mania is misnomer reflecting, in my opinion, the virulent (though euphemized in multi syllabic words) Anti-Americanism of the author.More Mania would be more precise.And More Mania is neither American, French, British, Russian etc.Man's instinctual fear of extinction has led to his primary strategy of acquisition to hinder, delay, defraud the inevitable demise of the body. The God of Acquisition is the illusory strategy - genuflected to as the savior or at least palliative to man's inescapable passing.The God of Acquisition is not limited to the current currency (money) but may be position, ideas (particularly in academia), etc.The story of Cain (in Hebrew Cain means \\"acquisition) and Abel is the first story in the Judaic Christian ethic of the struggle between More vs. Enough.God (El Shaddai) choose Abel over Cain.Abel offered El Shaddai \\"the first yearlings\\" - the first fruits.Cain offered three truck loads from Krogers - after he knew he had a profit.Shaddai means \\"God, God almighty, God all sufficient,\\" in Hebrew.Abel, offered \\"off the top\\" the first yearlings as Shaddai was Enough regardless of profit.Cain, acquisition, waited for his profit and loss statement - as his God was first material acquisition.The question is: is this acquisition More Mania uniquely American and or just magnified by the American culture?More, whether in capitalism, socialism, and or communism, is acquisition's (Cain's) progeny - derivative. These different strains merely reflect how the pie is cut between the American individualists (including latte swilling self loathing SUV driving Americans on the left), European hereditary unearned unmerited privilege or the Communist politburo. As for magnification - this is the argument of two kids in the school yard alternatively spewing, \\"you are worse, no you are worse, no you are.\\" The magnification question is one of who is doing the wrong thing worse - a doubtful exercise to begin with. As long as acquisition (More) is the prime strategy to questionably palliate the fear of extinction, the tradeoffs between the different Moreon strains (capitalist, communist, socialist, etc systems in cutting up the pie) is just a question of doing the incorrect better.In contrast to the virulent pejorative anti American spewing about American cowboy uncouth culture (regardless how sanitized with professorial language), it seems, the old systems of Europe (slower but unearned unmerited hereditary privilege by social order rather than merit) - are inferred as idyllically preferable. Where was the social and economic mobility during those times of elite social class suppression and \\"knowing one's place?\\" And relative to dictatorships and communism - what have these pie cutting sytems yielded?So the question is not American Mania but rather More mania.There is a disconnect in Dr. Whybrow's thesis that American Mania is instinctual yet his prescription is external.If changing this misnomer American Mania was just a question of external social engineering modifications then money (how it is distributed) and education, for example, would be cures to crime and social \\"diseases.\\" Yet, North Dakota, with one of the lowest incomes per capital, has one of the lowest crime rates. And Washington DC, with over $15,000 per capita spent on public education, has the lowest education test scores.The cure for More Mania is not externalized disconnected social engineering which curiously veils an elite, aloof, arrogant virulent loathing directed at America by a doctor \\"who divides his time between the urban frenzy of Los Angeles and the solitude of Plainfield, New Hampshire.\\"The question is More Mania not American Mania. And More Mania is an inside job..What is enough (fiscally, physically, etc.) is a better question - than accusatory indictment of a culture no matter how euphemized and sanitized with \\"conspicuous compassion\\" from the solitude of Plainfield, New Hampshire. There appears to be a disconnect between Dr. Whybrow's thesis and his own example as he exploits the hand (America) that feeds him in the solitude of Plainfield New Hampshire.Not only is American Mania's premise missing the mark relative to America being the magnifying cause of the social diseases it describes, but American Mania appears to be scapegoating, by a professor of psychiatry (probably with tenure), pandering to and exploiting the current chic anti-Americanism of those who resent and envy America."},{"Title":"Pen drawing ;: An illustrated treatise","review":"Inexpensive reference tool, but not terribly helpful.

Perhaps my excuse relates to my own Irish heritage, and the history of the 'Shanachie' or story teller in the Irish culture.Whatever my reason for expecting a book to always deliver a well told story - Eileen Quann's book does just that.Perhaps Ms. Quann's ability to relate her story so well comes from having lived with a man, her husband John, who certainly sounds as if he might have been an Irish Shanachie in an earlier era.This book brings the reader into the story of the author's life. The circumstances that drove Ms. Quann to write the book will most likely be foreign to the majority of readers (I know I don't have any family members who have experienced stroke). But the people in this story will seem familiar to many readers, who may have a brother, sister, mother, or husband who have said or done things that sound very similar to what Ms. Quann's family say and do.I certainly related to where Ms. Quann was in her professional life at the outset of the story. Perhaps this made me think a bit more about what happened as the story unfolded. Would I have reacted in a similar manner? What is really important in my own life? I think many readers who pick up this book will also wind up asking this question. What I truly enjoyed about this book, was the ability of the author to relate this question, in the format of a well told story.This is not a 'preachy' type of book. It is a story about a family. Like most families, that means they experience love, laughter, tears and fights amidst the more routine daily events. This family also experienced a loved one suffering a stroke. Although we may not have experienced that, we can relate to how this family responds to this experience, and enjoy the story this author weaves as she relates their story."},{"Title":"Manhood Development in Urban African-American Communities","review":"This book covers theories, research and intervention programs which were or are designed to address issues that young African-American men face in urban areas. It explores the role of culture in social development, articulates cluster profiles of racial socialization, identifies oppression and sociopolitical development as an basis for intervention, draws a relationship among gender, spirituality and spiritual well-being, compares manhood and womanhood development, and links these factors with the cognitive, emotional and behavioral characteristics of African boys and men. In its survey, it affirms the known and leaves the practicioner with much of the same overwhelmedness about the challenges and issues of Black boys and men in the U.S."},{"Title":"Manhood Development in Urban African-American Communities","review":"This is a duplicate review of another book. So I have withdrawn it from being a review of this book, which I have not read."},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"This book is comprised of several short essays that are each about ten pages or so in length. It is difficult to explain exactly what the book talks about. But it basically is a series of discussions about what our lives mean in relation to G-d. Why we are here on this planet, how you can think of your life and the lives of others, and lessons from other great Jewish thinkers about these same topics. I read this book, which is tiny and small, maybe 80 or so pages, and it changed my life. It opened for me a new way to explore my Jewish identity that was discrete from the mechanics of the religious observances. I am now very interested in Jewish philosophy and epistemology and want to read further. I would highly, highly recommend this book to anyone, Jewish or not."},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"41 pages of wisdom from the standpoint of Hasidism (from &quot;hasidut&quot;: allegiance, piety)--but Hasidism seen through the heart of Martin Buber.This too-brief book really asks only one question: why are we here?Buber responds with thoughts, anecdotes, and reflections, all of it extraordinarily condensed and yet marvelously lucid.Here are two quotations:&quot;Our treasure is hidden beneath the hearth of our own home.&quot;&quot;Man was created for the purpose of unifying the two worlds. He contributes towards this unity by holy living, in relationship to the world in which he has been set, at the place on which he stands.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"Martin Buber has a way of speaking to my heart. He speaks as a human who has always struggled with the cynicism and skeptical spirituality of our age. Yet he has retained a strong faith in God, and a strong faith in God's real presence in our struggling human everyday life. We may not always feel His presence...but in Buber's words we hear another's testimony that God is with us even when He seems absent. In these short parables, Buber introduces us to other humans...ordinary men...who likewise have struggled to walk with God. Their walk is grounded in the existential. But unlike other ways such as Zen, their walk gradually reveals the real presence of God who has been walking with us since day one. It is as if in our faithful walk God gradually becomes trulu felt as walking beside us...and in our hearts."},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"...Martin Buber encompasses the whole world in the span of 50 pages. He relates new interpretations of a handful of old myths and stories, making each one reflect the individual's personal journey towards enlightenment. Poignant and marvellously efficient and concise in his style and vocabulary, Buber has created a book which is accessible to small children, but which will resonate with anyone even slightly interested in spirituality. It can be read in an hour, and is a book to which I return again and again for guidance and inspiration. Truly, a miracle of a book."},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"Buber is one of the great original thinkers of modern Judaism. He reads here six Hasidic tales and infuses them with his own fundamental perceptions as to the nature of the religious life. He writes with grace and power. And there is in his interpretations and retellings a sense of the holy and the inspired."},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"I teach a graduate counseling course on Martin Buber's anthropology and philosophy of dialogue as it illumines the art and science of pastoral counseling. A rabbi at a workshop I did for military chaplains told me about it. It is a gem - one of the top ten books I have ever read. It is without question my favorite book of Buber's ouvre. All of 41 pages, it sets forth in very simple and poignant way, the essence of the I-Thou encounter rooted in the personal dialogue between God and humanity. If you want to read the Bible in order to realize that God is not an idea or a belief but One wh is wholly \\"Other\\" yet approaching you directly, intimately and accompanying you every minute of life, read this book. If you want to enter the \\"way\\" that leads to becoming fully human and living with others in real community, read this book. In our age of information acquisition and craving for new experiences to break through the numbing of our hearts, and the sleep of ouir conscience, what Buber speaks about in the \\"Way of Man\\" is truly an invitation to the \\"road less travelled.\\""},{"Title":"The Way Of Man: According to the Teaching of Hasidism","review":"Martin Buber is one of the greatest thinkers of all times.

I heartily recommend the 1st over the 2nd. In fact, the 2nd edition is actually missing material from the first - even though the 2nd is ALMOST TWICE THE SIZE of the first.This is the worst part.. the best reason to even own the 1st edition (the only reason basically IMHO) is a section near the back of the book. And get this.. thats the only part they took out for the second edition.Thats right, they added a bunch of useless text, and gutted the only thing that made the first edition of any value.I have both on my bookshelf, the 2nd edition is in perfect condition and collects dust.

The author provides outstanding comparisons among oil exporters, along with amazing parallels to the Spanish empire. There's an important point here about how human nature and government limitations often doom these &quot;blessed&quot; countries to failure. Call it the King Midas effect...On the downside, her point is clearly made in the first 50 pages. In the remainder of the book the author goes into too much detail regarding the political evolution of Venezuela. And she fails to end with a reader-friendly synopsis or a glimpse of the future.With today's troubles in the Mideast, this book could have been a lay-reader best seller. Unfortunately the author's writing is aimed more toward Political Science professors than the general public. Still worth the purchase, however."},{"Title":"The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States (Studies in International Political Economy)","review":"Basically, this book is a very strong and appealing summary of the consequences of over-reliance on oil production for developing countries. Not only results, but also underlying causes are considered: most attention is given to institutional and political aspects of what Lynn calls &quot;petrolization&quot; of the state. He argues that petroleum is the only product, which creates strong long-lasting ties among politicians and institutions involving them into constant seeking of oil revenues (for their own as well as for state benefit). Future decisions in this environment are determined by actions taken in the past, which makes it very hard to break away from this circle. The case of Venezuela is especially well considered; much of the information is taken from Lynn's conversations with Venezuelans top governmental officials and, hence, is of a great value. Carefully chosen data are well presented on a passionate manner which conveys the dramatic nature of changes brought by petroleum in this country.The future of new oil-producers becomes less shinning as we look at the data provided by the author. Only Norway, who managed to overcome most of the negative aftermaths of its oil windfalls, deemed as a winner within the group of oil producers. Lynn ascribes this success to a well-prepared and robust bureaucracy and stable democracy existing in Norway.The only problem I see in this book is its superficial treatment of economic factors related to &quot;petrolization&quot; of the state. In this context, Oil Windfalls: Blessing or Curse? by Alan Gelb and Associates (1988) or Sustainable Development In Mineral Economies by R. Auty and Mikesell (1998) or would be a great supplement."},{"Title":"The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States (Studies in International Political Economy)","review":"This book is a good contribution to the scholarship of one-good exporters, such as oil for many Middle Eastern countries and Venezuela. The author focuses on Venezuela, with occasional reference to other countries.The main thesis is that aside from the traditional Dutch disease of such intense exporters, there is an organizational component in the downfall of such plenty. For example, she argues that a large self-serving infrastructure and bureaucracy is built around the &quot;pot of gold&quot;. She argues this may be one of the main causes that coutnries squander such valuable resources without ever refocusing them on the development of people (health and education) or the country's economy (such as through the extension of value-added activities).Overall, an interesting proposition, though I am not sure this is a phenomenon unique to countries faced with the plenty of oil or other products. It is a strong case that inefficiencies are added through bureaucracies, but I still believe much of the damage is caused by the traditional Dutch disease."},{"Title":"The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States (Studies in International Political Economy)","review":"Basically, this book is a very strong and appealing summary of the consequences of over-reliance on oil production for developing countries.

Terry Lynn Karl does an excellent job at explaining what are the most relevant factors that determine the successes and failures of Petro-States in their ability to \\"sow petroleum\\".The King Midas Effect and the Dutch Disease are used as descriptions and comparisons of the sickness that the majority of the countries blessed with oil suffer. The Paradox of Plenty, in my opinion, does an excellent job at narrowing and analyzing the political, economical and social decisions from the past 100-or-so years which led the Oil-producing Countries either into the developed world or on a straight path to under-development and corruption.I agree with some of the reviews in the sense that the book is written for academic purposes and it can be a little dense at the beginning. Nevertheless, once you get past the first 30+ pages, you become used to the writing and the book becomes interesting and enriching.The book bases most of its analysis and theses using Venezuela as an example. An oil-rich Country with one of the largest reserves in the world that has failed to make the jump into the developed world. This was another plus for me since, as a Venezuelan Citizen, the book taught me a great deal of history.It is definitely a must read.

It was as if it had been written in in 2007. It gives any watcher of Venezuela a contextual fabric to understand today's Venezuela.For Venezuela, the western consumption-led, oil-development model has cursed it to high urbanization, hyperinflation, inefficient heavy industries, an elitist and clientelistic labour movement, executive centralization, fiscal black holes and dependency on foreign capital and technology. These trends continue today under the Chavez government.To break the cycle, Venezuela must invest the oil money outside the country, spur the development of agriculture, and broaden the tax base with increased income tax. These three factors would have a cascading effect to diversify the economy, increase accountability, broaden the labour movement, reduce urbanization, decrease inflation and ultimately make Venezuela more than an oil jockey filling up its rich neighbour's Hummer.With all the oil left in the country, maybe they will get it right the next time, but based on Karl's analysis probably not."},{"Title":"The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States (Studies in International Political Economy)","review":"\\"[A]fter benefiting from the largest transfer of wealth ever to occur without war, why have most oil-exporting developing countries suffered from economic deterioration and political decay?\\" In her long-awaited study, Karl offers a sophisticated cross-cultural reply to this question, focusing on the capital-deficit countries of Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Nigeria, and Venezuela. Finding inadequate the existing explanations that focus almost exclusively on economic disruption (the \\"Dutch Disease\\"), she notes the deep social and political roots of the problems and adds these much-needed dimensions to the discussion.Her complex argument boils down to this: oil booms (like all commodity booms) put enormous power in the hands of the state that suddenly has vast sums at its disposal. \\"How these states collect and distribute taxes, in turn, creates incentives that pervasively influence the organization of political and economic life and shapes government preferences to respect to public policies.\\" In other words, \\"the origin of a state's revenues influences the full range of its political institutions.\\" What appears to be a chance to do almost anything, it turns out, is in fact a very circumscribed choice.Though a Latin American specialist, Karl understands the Algerian and Iranian encounters with oil and has insights to offer all those who study Middle Eastern oil states-as well as those who lead them.Middle East Quarterly, December 1997"},{"Title":"Have Mercy!

Influenced by the great DJ's of a long lost era, and music few of us have ever heard (I was born in 1949), Wolfman was a juve (short for juvenile deliquent, a term for a lost soul, or worse, someone headed into the hands of the justice system). But through an amazing string of circumstances he found himself first in a prestigious broadcasting school, then happened into a string of low power, low budget AM stations where he was allowed to create the persona of the Wolfman.

There are parts of the book that are a little surprising, such as his heavy drug usage in the 1970's, but that's not unexpected.

Confessions of the Original Rock 'n' Roll Animal","review":"What a story. I saw this guy a bunch when he hosted the Midnight Special back in the 1970s. He really put a spark in the show and introduced great acts and early videos. It is hard to believe that he has been gone for 17 years as of this writing. However, it seems as if it was only yesterday that he permeated the airwaves with his banter and wolf calls.The story in this book starts with his birth in 1938 in Brooklyn, N.Y. to working class parents. His early years were full of turmoil with his parents divorcing and being subjected to sexual abuse from both sexes during his early years. He credits his older sister Joan for getting him through those tough times. He chronicles his spectacular life with stories including meeting Alan Freed at a show at Brooklyn's Paramount Theater and his love of rhythm and blues through listening to stations out of the south like WLAC out of Nashville, TN where the legendary John R. (John Richbourg) played tunes from James Brown, \\"Baby\\" Washington, Otis Rush and Howlin Wolf. His travels began early by Dj-ing at stations in Washington, DC and Shereveport, Louisiana. His fame began when he accepted a position to play records at a \\"border blaster\\" station in Ciudad Acuna, Mexico which was across the border from Del Rio, Texas. That station, XERF, sent its 250,000 watt to as far away as Europe and Japan. Tales of gunfights with corrupt Mexicans spice up the book and tells of the wild world of radio along the border. Eventually he went to another Mexican station in Tijuana where he gained a huge audience along the West Coast, playing R and B records. The movie American Graffiti gives a fictional account of his stay there.Wolfman Jack also talked about his strained marriage, drug use and infidelities during his life which tarnish his reputation to a degree. He is to be commended for telling his story warts and all, but some of the stories in this book make it unfit for some reading audiences. Nevertheless, it is a full-bodied memoir that should be recommended reading for scholars of early rock and roll music. This book was published in 1995 and Wolfman Jack was promoting the book when he passed away in the summer of that year. There is no index or end notes. A great read; four stars. AAAAHOOO!!"},{"Title":"Have Mercy! Confessions of the Original Rock 'n' Roll Animal","review":"HAVE MERCY! takes a wild ride through an important era of broadcast history. HAVE MERCY! captures the renegade spirit that led a few pirates and pioneers to take risks for entertainment sake. HAVE MERCY! does a superb job of describing the times and painting a picture of what those who ventured into early rock were up against. HAVE MERCY! helps us to better understand what made one white boy howl in the night - and others sing the blues. HAVE MERCY! makes clear the impact of radio in the early days of rock-n-roll. Its a classic expose' on pop culture. HAVE MERCY! shows the drive and determination and focus and endurance and high energy it took to succeed in a highly competetive industry. HAVE MERCY! catches the gimmicks and the glamour. HAVE MERCY! drops all the right names in all the right places. HAVE MERCY! doesn't shy away from revealing the hazards, the hardships, the dirty deals and the difficult decisions either. HAVE MERCY! is a roller coaster without seatbelts - a wooden one with plenty of bumps and sharp turns and deep drops along the way. HAVE MERCY! chronicles the life of a street tough kid with a dream - someone least likely to succeed - who beat the odds and made it. HAVE MERCY! relives the roots of rock as told through THE VOICE that spoke for a whole generation. HAVE MERCY! grabs onto the craziness of THE VOICE but doesn't see the flip side. Nothing is revealed about the inner stuff the Wolfman was made of. HAVE MERCY! tells the what, when and where of Wolfman's story but fails to communicate the why well enough for reader's know who the Wolfman really was. Its as if the author is writing from a distance - on the outside looking in when a more compelling biography would be told from the inside looking out. HAVE MERCY! recants the making of the personality . . . but fails to see beyond the legend the Wolfman had become. If I hadn't already known the huge impact Wolfman had on my generation, I'm not sure I would've comprehended it from the book. The author tries, but fails to show the true connection between THE VOICE and his listeners. HAVE MERCY! gets the facts but not the feelings. Its like when a record company measures the quality of a song by its sales instead of its message or craftmanship. HAVE MERCY! records details but never gets the big picture. The author never catches the vision. He rides with the Wolfman but never contemplates the reason. He notes the Wolf's charisma but never understands it. Its clearly too overwhelming to describe and so its treated almost like an after-thought. Not a lot of effort goes into getting to know Wolf's fans or measuring his impact on the world around him either. HAVE MERCY! never sees the Wolfman as a wholistic being - the author never gets into his soul the way I, the reader, wanted him to. And so, the Wolfman came across as a wild, but somewhat packaged, entertainer with a well inflated ego - rather than a dedicated spokesman whose main mission may have been just to spread some joy. What if the radio was nothing more than a vehicle to enable the Wolfman to accomplish that goal? HAVE MERCY! only suggests such honorable motives - instead the author dwells on stereotypical indicators that suggest the Wolf was mostly after fortune and fame. The Wolfman is depicted as a relentless industry climber willing to do just about anything to claw his way to the top. HAVE MERCY! had me asking whatever happened to Robert Smith? Did he completely disappear whenever the Wolf came out to play? If HAVE MERCY! were an instruction manual on how-to develop a strong stage personality the author would succeed in covering the steps and listing the most sensational ingredients needed - but he'd fail to give a clue as to what makes the recipe work. The author wasn't able to make me feel the fire and the author didn't manage to make the Wolfman bleed. His pen barely scraped the surface. Had it dug deeper it may have gotten to the heart of the story. A good book gets the info, keeps the pace and tells an interesting story - but a great book goes beyond the expected by sharing keen insights and by giving the reader something valuable to hang onto long after the last page is read. HAVE MERCY! is a good book, not a great one. I walked away exhausted from a really wild journey - but still not certain as to who I'd shared it with. That's a shame because I'm certain there was more to the Wolfman than the world ever got a chance to know, or this author ever managed to uncover."},{"Title":"Have Mercy!

BUT, if your interest is in radio history, read the chapter on XERF -which was quite entertaining - and forget the rest.If you are a fan of Wolfman, may I suggest you re-watch American Graffiti, listen to old radio shows and clips, and let the legend live on in your mind.

Haldane, and Roger Penrose. It is clear from this work and other books of Schrodinger that he was one of the few physicists who deeply thought of the inner most secrets of life. This book is divided into two parts: What's Life (7 chapters) and Mind and Matter (6 chapters).The physicist's most dreaded weapon, the mathematical deduction can not be used for life because it is too complex to be accessible to equations. The orderliness required for the preservation of life does not come by the random heat motions of atoms and molecules, but statistical averages that provide order. Schrodinger asks a simple question; why is life made of so many atoms and not just a few. He offers three examples; higher magnetic fields, increase in molecular population and the error introduced into a reaction rate constant or any other physical parameter would be far too great if only few molecules are involved to form life. Hence orderliness, and of course evolution and diversity of life, requires very large population of molecules.The world is a construct of our sensations, perceptions, memories; all existing objectively and all scientific knowledge is based on sense of perception and nonetheless the scientific views of material processes formed in this way lack all sensual qualities and can not account for the latter. Theories that are developed from scientific observations of experiments never account for sensual qualities. The sentient, percipient and thinking ego does not figure anywhere in our world picture, because it is itself the world picture. It is identified with the whole and not part of it. The physical world lacks all the sensual qualities that go to make the subject of cognizance. It is colorless, soundless, and impalpable. The world is deprived of everything that makes sense in its in relation to the consciously contemplating, perceiving, and feeling the subject; no personal god can form part of world model that has only became accessible at the cost of removing everything personal from it. God is missing from spacetime picture like sense of perception or ones own personality. Upanisads (Hindu Scripture) states that Atman = Brahman, the personal self equal the all comprehending eternal self. Consciousness never experienced in plural only in the singular, and plurality is merely a series of different aspect of one soul and one conscious produced by a deception (Maya). There is no multiplicity of minds; in reality and truth there is only one mind.Before and after is not a quality of the world we perceive but pertains to the perceiving mind and don't imply the notion of space and time. After relativity, the notion of before and after reside on the cause and effect relationship. The general directedness of all happenings is explained by the mechanical or statistical theory of heat. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that order changes to disorder but not disorder to order, and time travels in one direction from past to future, but not future to past. The statistical theory of time has a stronger bearing on the philosophy of time than theory of relativity. The latter presupposes unidirectional flow of time while statistical theory constructs from order of events.My body functions according to laws of nature, but I direct body motions. The word \\"I\\" means to state that I who control the motion of the atoms and molecules according to the Laws of Nature. The uncertainty principle and the lack of causal connection in nature introduce certain features into physical reality. For example, we can not make any factual statement about a physical system without interacting with it which would change the physical state of the system. This explains why no complete description of any physical object is ever possible. These laws have pushed the boundary between the subject and object. In fact subject and object are only one, and no barrier exists. It is the same element that goes to compose my mind and the world. The situation is the same for every mind and its world, in spite of the unfathomable abundance of cross references between them. The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived.The last chapter gives brief autobiographical sketches of Schrodinger translated by his granddaughter. Schr&ouml;dinger was deeply philosophical with strong family: He loved and respected his parents. His strong interest in physics and Vedanta philosophy (one of the six schools of Hindu Philosophy) is apparent, but he shy's away from writing about his complex personal life that involved many women and numerous extramarital affairs.1.Schr&ouml;dinger: Life and Thought2.Space-Time Structure (Cambridge Science Classics)3.A Life of Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (Canto original series)4.Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger's World View : The Dynamics of Knowledge and Reality (Theory and Decision Library A:)5.'Nature and the Greeks' and 'Science and Humanism' (Canto original series)6.Schr&ouml;dinger's Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics (Boston Studies in the Philosophy of Science)7.Schrodinger's Science and the Human Temerament8.Schrodinger's Kittens and the Search for Reality: Solving the Quantum Mysteries Tag: Author of In Search of Schrod.

Schrodinger felt that life must be explainable by physics and chemistry, yet seemed to violate the normal behavior of entropy-- and he understood further that this was a remarkable wedge point to explore. He figured out the explanation: life is the result of evolution of genetic information, which selects for complex processes that by ordinary considerations would be very unlikely. He predicted that there must be a molecule capable of carrying the genetic information (incorrectly thinking it would be a protein.) His beautifully-written book was influential and timely. Within 4 years, Von Neumann elucidated the mechanisms involved in self-reproducing automata (illustrating his abstract discussion with a picture looking remarkably like DNA to the eyes of readers today); and within a decade, Watson and Crick grasped the structure of DNA. You should not read Schrodinger's book today as one of your first sources to understand life-- there has been remarkable progress in the 50 years since Watson and Crick-- but you should read it to gain appreciation for how science can be advanced when the time is ready and a wedge point, an apparent conflict between fundamental ideas, is analyzed.The volume also includes another lecture by Schrodinger, Mind and Matter, which is historically interesting in another way. In Schrodinger's day, the state of understanding had not advanced to the point where it was possible to make as useful conjectures about the structure of mind as of life, and he accordingly felt &quot;[mind] may well be beyond human understanding.&quot;Readers interested in Schrodinger's book will also enjoy What is Thought?, published 2004. What is Thought? argues that mind must be explainable by computer science, that the fundamental issues are computational, and that there is again a wedge point: the question of how the workings of a computer, which are always purely syntactical, can correspond to meaning and understanding. The situation is parallel to the one that faced Schrodinger with respect to life in two respects: first, mind is the outcome of evolution, which has built thought processes that seem inconsistent with our standard science, and second, scientific research has advanced to the point where, if we focus on the wedge point, significant understanding is obtainable. What is Thought? brings to bear on the problem of mind core ideas from computational learning theory, complexity theory, and evolutionary computing, as well as molecular and evolutionary biology, cognitive science, and other areas. The result is a principled and concrete explanation, consistent with the vast array of available data, of how meaning, understanding, language, consciousness, and all the various aspects of mind arise from execution of an evolved computer program."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"I must say I expected more from this book, based on the rave reviews.Having studied graduate physics, I was intrigued to see this physics giant's view on the big questions, but I was a bit disappointed. I found his purely reductionist physicist's approach to biology and philosophy naive, but then we do stand on the shoulders of generations of advances in science and technology since most of this book was written: IT, systems theory, molecular biology, gene sequencing, fMRI, emergence & complexity.... These all make Schrodinger's broad musings seem no more than quaint on the scientific front, unless you are a science historian, although my take on philosophy is that we have advanced little since his hero, Kant. I am reminded that an expert in one field does not necessarily have anything of value to say in vastly different fields - our heroes are relevant only in their areas of strength.My favourite section of the book is his autobiographical sketches, which give valuable insights into this likeable man, European life and physics during he world war years and the heyday of early quantum mechanics.I would recommend that unless you are interested in Schrodinger per se, then rather get up to speed by trying anything by Hofstadter, Kaufmann, Prigogine or Dawkins."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"This book is fairly easy to read and provides the best explanation of complex carbon molecules in particular DNA.

This places Schr&ouml;dinger very well in the center of the encounter between modern physics and biology.HOW IS LIFE POSSIBLE AGAINST ENTROPY?The many reviewers until now have pointed out many important aspects related to this book. Thus I have not to repeat this here. My personal interest in this booklet was caused by my own questions while trying to understand the phenomenon of life against the background of physics. Being myself a computer scientist and philosopher as well I was puzzled by the fact that even at the beginning of the 21.century 'everyday knowledge' regarding the question why life is possible in a physical world is not easily available (and you will not find any answer to this question in the modern books about genetics with 900 and more pages!). While I have learned from Boltzmann something about entropy and the general tendency of a physical system to increase the entropy, this introduced the riddle why living organisms seem to work 'against' entropy by increasing order.FROM DISORDER TO ORDERIn his lectures Schr&ouml;dinger follows the nice strategy to show why and how genetic information is rooted in the chromosome molecules and illustrates then step by step why such a molecule from the point of physics seems to be highly exceptional. While the general laws of thermodynamic would lend a structure to dissolve it's bindings to increase the atomistic disorder (and thereby to increase entropy) the biological systems demonstrate a strong 'resistance' instead; they keep the order of the molecules and even more they are able to increase these orders steadily. Not only generates disorder here order, but order even generates more order (p.80). From the point of physics does this mean that biological systems are 'consuming' order (which can be called 'negative entropy' or 'free entropy' or the like) from their environment (a concept which leads back to Josiah Willard Gibbs). Thus to 'keep order' in the physical universe presupposes the availability of already existing order (some form of energy).NON-PHYSICAL LAWSSchr&ouml;dinger recognizes that the 'explanation' with the consumption of available order (energy, neg-entropy...) gives a minimal account of the phenomenon of biological systems, but this does not 'really explain', why there is this tendency of a continuous increase of order against disorder. The availability of order (energy) is necessary, but not sufficient to explain these phenomena. While Schr&ouml;dinger allowed himself the question whether physics has to accept 'new kinds of laws' --'non-physical' or 'super-physical' (p.80)-- he did not answer this question. I do not know any text who gives a sufficient answer to this question. I remember some texts from Eigen and Prigogine years ago which dealt with the special principle of biological systems, but I have to read these again whether they really offered some useful arguments.This story is not finished at all......I recommend everybody to read this wonderful booklet of Schr&ouml;dinger."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"This brief little book manages to pack more of an intellectual wallop in its slim pages than many other longer books do.The first essay, written in 1944, is called What is life? and attempts to connect what was then known about physics which was then known about biology to answer its title question. Though the material predated the discoverty of DNA it can still presents a challenger read for the layman. Significantly however, it does raise an interesting a suprisingly complex question about the nature of life and where we should draw the dividing line.The second essay, written in 1956, is called Mind and Matter and attempts to shed light on the nature of the nexus between its two title topics. For me, this essay is particularly interesting because it really introduces you to the overflowing genius that gave us the conundrum of Schrodinger's cat who sits both alive and dead in famous box to illustrate the paradox that is presented to us under the Copenhagen view of quantum physics. Mind and matter were certainly close to Schrodinger's heart as he was at that forefront of physics which first learned the critical importance of observation in bringing about the existence of quantum phenomenon where trees falling in the forrest litterally couldn't make a sound until they were observed.The rest of the book consists of odds and ends but it all hangs together in dealing with an intellect who every bit as interesting as the questions he raised."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Schroedinger, one of the great physicists of the 20th Century, applied the knowledge he gained in his own discipline to analyze human life.

Needless to say a great deal of progress has been made in molecular biology since the 1940s, beginning with discovering the structure of DNA. If you want to know about molecular biology, you want to read something rather more up to date, like, from a time when people knew that a stretch of DNA uses nucleotides to code for amino acids that then fold together to create proteins. In other words, you should not read \\"What is Life\\" unless you're specifically interested in what people were thinking about genes around 1943. I am interested in the history of science, but not enough to make reading this worthwhile, especially since it could've been summarized in a few pages (or even a sentence: \\"by 1943 scientists had realized that, given the nature of atoms and molecules, the gene must be a solid molecule because it is very stable over time\\")."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"While it's easy to tell that Schrodinger is not a native writer of English, his ideas are so engaging that it is easy to read through.

Certainly interesting.The book itself is a classic of biological writing, which makes Schrodinger's remarks at the beginning of the book all the more entertaining. I picked it up after learning that Watson, Crick, and many of the others involved in the hunt for DNA were initially inspired by this book. It is certainly dated, but the sense of scientific excitement is timeless. I was personally more engaged by some of the philosophical musings contained in the &#34;Autobiographical Sketches,&#34; but thoroughly enjoyed the main book as well.Highly recommended to anyone looking for a historical perspective on one of the great questions of 20th century biology, though a biology student who is aware of the context of the book might get more from it."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Although it is and old book, it is very deep on the thinking about life.

Physics view according to Schr&ouml;dinger point to a well ordered working of living beings. Less than 20 % of mutations result on an improvement. BUT the greatest mistery is how life sustains order, while nature sustains dissorder (negative and positive entropy); of course death returns life to the physical trend of increasing entropy; from this point of view life goes against the popular laws of physics. Worst of all, physics can not explain free will and consciousness (sensations,perceptions and memories)Schr&ouml;dinger does not intend to support any intelligent design, but of course, neither Darwin's evolution.

In what is probably the single greatest unsung leap of intuition in the 20th century, Schrodinger develops--from reasoning and first principles--a very basic idea of DNA. Ultimately, this idea inspirited Watson and Crick in their groundbreaking discoveries. He then goes on to argue how entropy can still allow life to evolve (there are many erroneous arguments about how it supposedly cannot, most by Creationists), and in fact enhances the ability of a life form in an open environment to undergo evolution.The second of the pieces featured in this edition, Mind and Matter is an attempt by Schrodinger to put the study of consciousness on a scientific ground by approaching it from quantum mechanics (canonical uncertainty, measurement theory) and thermodynamics (entropy) to come to the conclusion that consciousness itself is indestructible by time. You may agree with this, you may not, but no one can deny it is well argued and compelling. The ideas he uses to come to this conclusion, such as objectification, are interesting topics unto themselves. I cannot help but think that if certain modern day \\"scientific atheists\\" (Dawkins, Hitchens, etc) would be a little more believable if they actually bothered to read books like this one and understood the limitations the human mind puts on the scientific method.This book is an absolute classic, and a necessary part of any complete education in science.

These events were Einstein's Relativity and perhaps even more importantly the advent of Quantum Physics. Our worldview would never be the same anymore. These two events had (and increasingly are having) a profound influence in other Sciences but also in Philosophy and perhaps even Religion. Not surprisingly, two of the giants of Quantum Physics, Erwin Schrodinger and Werner Heisenberg, wrote a lot about the Philosophical and Existential consequences of what they had set in motion. Einstein, Schrodinger and Heisenberg all acknowledged that their theories still don't describe \\"reality\\" perfectly. Equations are not the \\"presence\\" they are only \\"re-presentations\\". Equations are the result of the human mind and conscience observing, processing, translating in symbols and establishing abstract relationships. This inward focused process still cannot fully grasp the truth; perhaps the ultimate truth is un-knowable.This book contains Erwin Schrodinger's thoughts on Life, Mind and Matter. Erwin Schrodinger of course is the man behind the famous Schrodinger wave equation in Quantum Physics. Schrodinger's equation describes the \\"outcome\\" of physical process but does not explain the \\"why\\". As a result it was concluded that what the equation describes is a \\"probability\\" distribution of what is happening. In this book Schrodinger tries to link Quantum Physics to evolution by explaining that the development of life needed \\"discontinuities\\" and \\"quantum\\" jumps. Like Energy Levels in Particle Physics also Evolution is not a smooth continuum. He describes that evolution needs more than mutations in genes. He further addresses the development of \\"societal learning\\" and the development of a \\"collective\\" memory. This collective memory exists outside ourselves if we only look at ourselves as an \\"organism\\" which operates as a \\"machine\\". In this he touches on the \\"missing link\\" in the development of science. Until the advent of Quantum Physics we could leave ourselves (the \\"observers\\") out of the equation. We were not part of it. Quantum Physics however tells us that we are an intrinsic part of reality. Reality only exists when we observe it (Schrodinger's Probability Wave Distribution \\"Collapses\\").

Physicist Erwin Schrodinger was an affable genius whose comments about life, molecular biology, mind, qualia, and a number of topics are interesting and relevant even today.This edition of 'What is Life?' by Cambridge University Press also contains Schrodinger's essay entitled 'Mind and Matter,' along with some autobiographical notes. What is Life? is a well paced 1944 version of molecular genetics that is still valid today. Crick and Watson didn't discover the structure of DNA til 1953, so Schrodinger didn't know of replisomes and error correcting polymerase III, but this essay shows how well developed molecular biology was by this time. Crick and Watson were certainly in the right place at the right time by clearing up a minor bottleneck in the broader science of molecular genetics. Mainly what Schrodinger, the formulator of the quantum mechanical wave equation of atoms, wants to accomplish is to reconcile quantum effects with biology. What is Life? makes an excellent synthesis of quantum physics and biology. Where modern scientists like physicist Roger Penrose and chemist Graham Cairns-Smith fail at this correlation Schrodinger is eminently successful. Although this essay is somewhat dated it is stimulating and rewarding to read.The second essay entitled 'Mind and Matter' written in 1956 is very similar to modern efforts in describing abstract neuro and cognitive science. It tackles many of the same topics as moderns Daniel Dennett, Gerald Edelman, and Antonio Damasio do. Schrodinger artfully blends the idealism of Schopenhauer with his own personal physicist's point of view and crafts a perfectly enjoyable, reflective discussion on the concept of mind. I actually enjoyed Mind and Matter more than What is Life? as it showed the intellectual range of Schrodinger better. His discussion of what he calls objectivation, or how the subjective and objective dynamics of the scientific observer influence one another was great.Lastly, a brief selection of Schrodinger's writing about his own life rounds out this brief, thoughtful collection of essays by a world class scientist.

Undoubtedly if this book (series of essays/thoughts/lectures) had been written twenty years later, it would be quite different, but as is, it makes some startlingly accurate predictions about the nature of heredity in biological systems. This book is NOT 'quantum mechanics explains life', it is however, the masterwork of one of quantum theories brightest stars, relating the abstract world of subatomic particles to, well, DNA, before anyone knew what it did. Alas, for poor Schrodinger, probabalistic interpretation is much less useful at such a macroscopic level, and the mathematics behind even 'good approximations' of VERY SMALL macromolecules are nearly infinitely more complex than those for, say helium, which cannot be solved exactly (too many variables) itself. But he knew that already, and shows it here. But regardless of any 'after-the-fact' criticism, Schrodinger built something palpable and incredible out of scaling and deduction from the quantum level up. The fact that he struck so close to the mark speaks volumes for the man and for quantum theory in general. Biology is rather more difficult to quantify with wave equations than an alpha particle...not that Schrodinger attempts such an undertaking here, but the point should be understood as pertaining to his background, at least. At any rate, this book is probably not the most pedestrian work one could find on the subject, nor the easiest read. It is however, some awfully foresighted ideas about nature, and is heartily recomended reading for anyone with an in-depth knowledge of biology and chemistry (quantum chemistry/physics would be a good *background* course here), and should be required reading for any molecular biology/biochemistry regimen. This book deserves five stars, and if it wasn't for that article in the late fifties that used quantum tunneling theory to dispute the fact that DNA could be the genetic material of the cell, (not authored by Schrodinger, but using an extension of his ideas, as in most quantum computation) it would have gotten them.

These lectures were originally give in the 1940's and 50's prior to the discovery of DNA, RNA, gene mapping, and other techniques taken for granted by today's biologists.The basic tenant of quantum physics is that all atomic structure can be described only by the mathematics of probability. The exact orbit of an electron or its velocity cannot be determined. One can only state the probability of the location or velocity. Protons and neutrons are thought to change back and forth into one another in a random fashion. The very process of physical measurement introduces errors which preclude accurate measurements. This is modern physics - random events governed by probabilities.Compare this to the biology of living cells. Genetics reproduce specific inherited characteristic for generations. Why does the random atomic behavior not interrupt or change genetic traits? How does humanity think logically using randomly behaving atoms and hence molecules and compounds?This little book attempts and succeeds in theoretically reconciling these two worlds. The author predicts the structure of DNA. He anticipates current studies in how small numbers of randomly acting atoms are constrained to be deterministic. In the latter lectures, he enters the world of metaphysics to discuss &quot;Mind and Matter, Determinism and Free Will, Ethics, and Science and Religion.&quot;This book is less than 300 pages long, but encylopic in scope.

The first is the essay of the title, the second a more metaphysical description called &quot;Mind and Matter&quot; and the last an excerpt of his own autobiography, notes rather than life in detail.The first of these considers the possibility of science, as it stands at Schrodinger's time, answering the question of the title. Naturally such a question can now be asked since the universe has gradually become a mechanical one with life a great mystery since mechanical descriptions cannot describe life as we experience it. This was not always the case, certainly not before the 15th Century or so when the mystery had to do with the mechanical rather than the living aspects of the world.So Schrodinger is able to ask this, the most fundamental of all the major questions in his and our time. Throughout the first essay he attempts to answer this not directly but rather through what science can tell us about the process that a living creature must undergo as part of its life cycle ie how is the being able to reproduce itself, where does this information reside etc. He discusses inheritance and the Darwinian explanation available in his time, which of course did not yet know of the DNA molecule. It appears at first that this is no more than a standard approach to these questions and lacks any new insights but this is a mistaken assumption and an in depth reading leaves no doubt that Schrodinger thinks science does not and cannot describe life truly using its current approach. I leave the potential reader to discover this for him/herself.The second of these essays is far more metaphysical in character although schrodinger, a hardnosed scientist, does not waffle or procrastinate, he looks at things without sentimentality or any of the fantasies now current in the more &quot;out there&quot; new age mysticism. Schrodinger leaves no doubt that science again is not able to really discover what the mind is or how perception truly arises from any form of mechanism.In the last of his essays he talks about his own life and a wonderful adventure it is. Schrodinger rather than being the epitome of the rational scientist lacking in feeling, as the commonly held assumption tells, writes with great joy and style.Something to really look forward to, enjoy."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Schroedinger, one of the great physicists of the 20th Century, applied the knowledge he gained in his own discipline to analyze human life. Based upon lectures that he gave in the 1940s, this brief book contains Schroedinger's fascinating speculations on the nature of life, several of which have proven prophetic (including the discovery of DNA). The reader comes away with the joy of having shared in the workings of a great mind.Perhaps the most impressive achievement of the book is that it can be readily understood by persons relatively untrained in science or mathematics."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Step by step detailed analysis of the origin of life that covers everything from physics to biology to quantum mechanics. In depth, intricate, full of twists and turns writing so typical to the Eastern European authors of the time. Having an extensive back ground in physics and chemistry I found myself re-reading paragraphs just to comprehend the underlying assumptions. The theoretical concepts were not complicated, but to appreciate Schrodingers writing required an extensive background in philosophy, not in physics or chemistry. Nevertheless, I was thrilled to read his original writing!"},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"The modern study of life begins with a somewhat surprising figure, Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger. He was born in 1887, and educated in Vienna. He is best known for his development of his wave equation, which has become the foundation of quantum mechanics, and for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1933. His importance to biologists and for the definition of life comes from his book What is Life?, which is based on a series of lectures given open to the general public in Dublin.His book was enormously influential in convincing physicists such as Max Delbr&uuml;ck that biology offered questions that physicists could find interesting. In it he tried to answer three main questions:1. How can organisms maintain their organization in the face of a continuous production of entropy as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics?2. What is the nature of the hereditary material?3. Can biology be fully understood (even in principle) in terms of the known laws of physics?He answered the thermodynamic question with the statement that \\"what an organism feeds on is negative entropy\\". This may seem an unnecessarily poetic way of expressing an idea that is well understood by scientists today: that the inevitable production of entropy by an organism is compensated for by the ingestion of low-entropy food and excretion of higher-entropy waste. However, this was not well understood at all at the time he was writing, and his statement undoubtedly cleared away some confusion.It is worth noting that Schr&ouml;dinger's point is not well understood, even today, by adherents of creationism, who often claim that the second law of thermodynamics makes evolution impossible, because (according to them) increasing the information content of a system is impossible. The point, however, is that a continuous production of entropy is characteristic of a closed system, but the earth is an open system, because it continuously receives radiation from the sun, and organisms are also open systems, for the reasons explained by Schr&ouml;dinger. In any case, if the creationist argument had any merit it would apply as much to life as to evolution, but we know that life is possible.Schr&ouml;dinger suggested that the hereditary material must be a sort of \\"aperiodic crystal\\", that is to say a substance that had a high degree of cyclic regularity, as in a crystal, coupled with non-repetitive elements whose structures did not interfere with the general regularity, but whose irregularity allowed them to ask as what he called a \\"codescript\\". After the tremendous increase in knowledge of molecular genetics that has occurred in the half-century that followed his lectures we can recognize this as a description of DNA, which has a structure that appears completely regular when viewed from a distance, but completely irregular when viewed with enough resolution for the individual bases to be identified.As for the third question, modern biologists are not much interested in life or its definition, but if pressed most would probably consider that these first two of Schr&ouml;dinger's three points cover the whole story. Thermodynamic analysis of organisms as open systems explains their energy management and information storage in DNA explains heredity, and that is all there is to it. However, neither of these explains how organisms maintain their organization, virtually indefinitely, without external help, in the face of frequent and sometimes large changes in their environments. This idea was the least well understood when Schr&ouml;dinger was writing, and remains the least well understood (and the most controversial) today. Later critics, such as Linus Pauling and Max Perutz, who considered that Schr&ouml;dinger had contributed nothing of value to the understanding of life, appear to have missed this point, treating matters that were obvious to them as obvious to Schr&ouml;dinger's audience in Dublin and to the readers of his book.Provided one remembers the target audience for the book -- not distinguished scientists like Delbr&uuml;ck, Pauling or Perutz, but intelligent and educated non-scientists -- it remains well worth reading today. It is not an easy read, but it is not impossibly dif&#64257;cult either. It is a very short book, of less than 100 pages, and is reprinted in this edition with Mind and Matter and with Autobiographical Sketches. This last is interesting, but very \\"sanitized\\", making very little reference to his wife and none at all to the many other women who played major roles in his life. To learn about Schr&ouml;dinger's remarkable personal life you need to turn to Walter Moore's masterly biography (A Life of Erwin Schr&ouml;dinger (Canto original series))."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Strange that the only thing biologists see in this book is Schroedinger's vague prediction of DNA. I honestly can't find this anywhere in the book, and believe it's the result of people simply attaching Schroedinger's name to the title without reading it.Even stranger is that biologists are unable to see how powerful and simple Schroedinger's call for a fundamentally new type of statistical mechanics is. Current stat mech predicts the diffusion of order; yet the overwhelming observation of biology is that systems of fantastic order arise of their own, all the time. Therefore, a new branch of physics, mathematics, and biology will need to arise to predict systems of 'negative entropy'. And it is; Prigogne was the first to classify entropy producers, and the subject is growing.*This* is the important, clear prediction of Schroedinger's classic book. He was so far ahead of his times, modern biology has yet to catch up."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"This book shows how a real genius works and thinks, not just Physics but all dimensions of the science. In this book, although Schroedinger claims that he is not an expert in this field of Science he is certainly playing humble. He starts with the question, Why human beings have to be so big relative to Atoms, continues with Statistical concepts of Quantum Theory and than comes to the conclusion that the Genes really does not obey to statistical rules and therefore the life is stable and mutations are rare. In the second half of the book he goes into Philosophy and covers Mind and Matter. In the beginning he states that &quot;The world is a construct of our sensations, perceptions, memories&quot; I found this very interesting. Schroedinger provides very nice interpretation of entropy Concept and Statistical formulas."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Of all the books on my bookshelf, this tiny book which can be read in just a few hours, is one of the most important. Not only to me, but to science. In it, Schrodinger perdicts the structure of DNA years before Watson and Crick built their model: &quot;...the chromosome fibre - may be called an aperiodic crystal.&quot;This book is where physics and biology first met. It really is one of the great classics of the twentieth century. It will never go out of print."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"This beautiful little book was based on a sequence of popular lectures given in Dublin during WWII, and in turn on an earlier paper given in Vienna. In the book Schr&ouml;dinger coins the idea of a genetic code carried by linear molecules with his phrase 'code-script'. He asks how, in the absence of validity of a large n limit required by statistical physics for the validity of any macroscopic biological laws, can the chromsome molecules that carry the code-script yield stable genetic rules. Then, he gives the answer: chemical bonding as predicted by quantum theory ala Heitler-London (Schr&ouml;dinger identifies quantum jumps in the chrosomes as the origin of mutations, which are also discrete). He refers to the chromosome fibers as linear 'aperiodic crystals' (to emphase their stability in the face of thermal fluctuations) and encourages physicists to study them: he boldly asserts that both the instructions and mechanism for generating organisms via molecular replication are contained in the chromosome molecules (and there is where the \\"complexity\\" lies). This book encouraged physicists to study problems of complexity long before the term complexity had become the catchword that it is today. Indeed, our first ideas of 'complexity' were developed parallel in the same era by Turing and von Neumann.Schr&ouml;dinger is buried in Alpbach (Tirol), where he lectured and enjoyed the Alps frequently after WWII in a school organized by one of two brothers who, according to a very well-informed source, formed nearly the only Resistance in Austria during the war. On his grave is a pretty little plaque bearing the Schr&ouml;dinger equation.This review refers to the 1969 edition of 'What is Life'."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"As a Grad Student in the 40s,I learned Schroedinger's formulation of Quantum Mechanics. He was a giant to me. I bouoght his book then. He noted that the Third Law of Thrmodynamics said than Entaropy always increased - things always went from order to disorder. Except for life, where atoms and molecules are put together to make order out of disorder. His conclusion is that if there is a God, it must be God that creates life. Sixty years later, I found the book again - with you!"},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Schrodinger states early in the book that the book does not attempts to explain life, but rather touches a very small part of the explanation - he endorses the hypothesis that Mendel's genes (not attributed to DNA at that time) have the order and stability (in spite of being microscopic enough to be directly affected by uncertainity principle) because each gene is ONE molecule.The book is easily readable in just a few hours, and whole book brings out only a few ideas. Treat the book more like a magazine article in the magazine of Life.As an example of the ideas spoken about in the book, Schrodinger asks, \\"Why are atoms so small?\\". He then reasons that the question is same as \\"Why are humans made of so many atoms\\". And then hints at the answer - Maybe just as making computers requires a certain number of components, humans could not be made out of smaller number of atoms!It is said that the book inspired a lot of research. It inspired mee too."},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"Dear ReadersCheck out Roger Penrose on Youtube: \\"Quantum Mechanics\\". He makes mention of how Quantum mechanics accounts for genetics.If you havn't solved Schrodinger's equation for at least one simple potential with boundary conditions you may not understand this review.Even my physics professors most of them could not solve Schrodinger's equation for the chemical bond unless they copied it from their notes directly onto the blackboard.Before Heitler and London's solution there was no theory for covalent chemical bonding. Once it could be demonstated forthe hydrogen molecule then it became obvious for the Carbon atom. Provided one understands the Pauli principle which of course Heitler and London et. al. understood.Following this then one can build bigger models. Notably the proteins and nucleaic acids. Which of course Von Laue would have certainly begun to look for ( because the biologists/biochemists in Germany would have pushed him to do it ) and almost certainly found the structure for, long before the \\"Crick and Watson business\\".Best RegardssjwWell since I've read Anne Sayre's \\"Rosalind Franklin and DNA\\" and have just finished \\"The Double Helix\\" by Watson..I might as well review Schrodinger's \\"What is Life\\".Schrodinger was not a biologist at least as far as I know and was not exactly a X-ray crystallographer but he had friends who were. So I'm thinking it might be a fair guess to say that he had some good sources for his book. Written in 1944.He was of course one of the pioneers of Quantum Mechanics and that study is crucial for trying to understand why molecules do what they do. And why for example human beings have such difficulty understanding their own very nature of being a living organism. Because we do not really and cannot really understand Quantum Mechanics.....Feynman said that....I didn't. Try \\"Exchange Degeneracy\\" for example.Questions about molecules in Quantum Mechanics have direct connections with the behavior of DNA. Which is after all a Quantum dynamical system. And that is what Schrodinger is alluding to in the book. In fact he comes straight out and says that Quantum Mechanics is the physical theory controlling the genetic code.He also cites the work of Heitler and London in this regard. Then he mentions Delbruck's work.Often people who cite this book of Schfodinger's in regard to DNA don't really state the details of how it is that life is described by Quantum Mechanics.So who told Schrodinger about the structure of DNA?.....Answer: Von Laue......not Delbrucksjw"},{"Title":"What Is Life?: with \\"Mind and Matter\\" and \\"Autobiographical Sketches\\"","review":"I was supposed to read this book for one of my classes, and it was a quick and easy read.

The beginning of the title (\\"What is Life\\") sounds like if Schrodinger can claim anything about the difference between mind and matter as a pure consequence of physics. Too bad, as the rest of the title might make you think that there will be some discussion about why and whether there might be a difference between mind and matter. What remains of mind when you stick to the physics? That would be a very nice question to think about, if only this was the topic of the book...but it's not what is done here."},{"Title":"The Harvard Entrepreneurs Club Guide to Starting Your Own Business","review":"I can't figure out why this book got so many great reviews.

This book may be better for people who have no idea whatsoever how to start their own business and need help identifying the entrepeneurial spirit. But those with a true entrepeneurial spirit have probably already taken the steps to explore and gather information that exceed the contents of this book.My opinion is that this book is generally more for high school kids or those who have no exposure to entrepenuers in their daily life.

Many of the advances have been described in the psychometric literature and the techniques described in this book are used to compare scores on different tests such as SAT tests taken at different times.On an elementary level most university professors have done a form of test equating with their own exams since the appropriate difficulty is sometimes hard to gauge. So-called curving a test is a form of adjusting scores by transforming to the standard normal curve.Unfortunately there are many better techniques that have been ignored and many psychometricians are not properly trained. These authors are among teh leaders in the field and have taught test equating. They found a need for a book of this type and they filled it.Many prominent statisticians have contributed to this research including Paul Holland, Don Rubin and Henry Braun. Much of this work was done by statisticians during their tenure at ETS and research continues at the ETS and at academic institutions.The authors provide a thorough treatment of the methods and the literature. This is good for a graduate level course, for a reference guide for practitioners and researchers in test equating.One important aspect of the problem is estimating the standard error of the test equating estimates. The delta method and parametric and nonparametric bootstrap methods are all described.An entire chapter is devote to item response theory and its application to test equating. The final chapter provides a very practical discussion of issues in the implementation of test equating methods and includes discussion of the choice of statistical procedures, determining the sample size, data collection, test specification and design, quality control and calibration."},{"Title":"Silver for General Washington: A story of Valley Forge","review":"I really liked the book Silver For General Washington because it is really interesting book and it talk about how the American Army had to survive in the winter without food, clothes, money, and something to get warm.I recommend this book to you because it gets you hooked and you would not to let go of the book. This book teaches a lot of history and also teaches you about teamwork and how to survive in tough conditions. If you read this book, you can get good grades in history.It is also an interesting book because talks about war without getting involved in a war at all. Of course it is talking about the American revolutionary war but it is telling everything that is going on at the camp. The book i s about a boy named Gilbert Emmett who was sent to Valley Forge because his dad went to help at the revolutionary war and there was not somebody at home to take good care of his sister and him. At Valley Forge Gilbert helped the Americans who did not have food, he gave some of his food to the Americans and in the end he found that General Washington needed money and he remembered that his dad had really expensive things buried in the house, then he decided to go to Philadelphia, where he used to live. When he had the money he gave the money to the General and that is why the book is called Silver For General Washington.This book should be read by everybody even if you are not an American.There are many values you can find along the author's words such as friendship, patriotism, generosity, equality. And America as a country was created on those values and it is wronderful to realize they are still part of the country and literature."},{"Title":"Silver for General Washington: A story of Valley Forge","review":"Many years ago, as a 5th grader, I found this book on the shelf of my classroom library. I found it thrilling and heartwarming! In this exciting story, two young male cousins find themselves living in Valley Forge during the winter George Washington's army was encamped there. They befriend several soldiers, young and old, and learn of the tremendous sacrifices these soldiers are making to stick it out with their general during that dreadful winter. The cousins conceive a daring plan to make their way on foot to Philadelphia in an attempt to retrieve silver which has been hidden there by their family. Their goal is to give it to the General to help sustain the war effort. But they discover a horrible surprise when they arrive in Philadelphia.As an adult, I've read this book to many classes of my first graders, although it is really above their level, and I always had to do a lot of additional explaining. I've read it to my grandchildren when they were around 3rd grade, and they can really appreciate it. Parts of this story bring tears to my eyes and swell my heart with pride no matter how many times I read it.Sadly, I believe it is out of print, so finding it on Amazon seems to be one of the few ways to get a copy. This book deserves to be brought back into publication. I hope that someday Scholastic will do just that, or perhaps even the Valley Forge Association.I recommend this book for anyone who wants a terrific review of that winter in Valley Forge, seen through the eyes of brave youngsters who just want to help their country."},{"Title":"Silver for General Washington: A story of Valley Forge","review":"This was my favorite book as a child.

Fortunately I decided to keep reading. While I certainly do not agree with everything the author says, Database Nation brings up a broad range of privacy and security issues, and then discusses various problems and points of view associated with these issues. First and foremost, I think the author tries to make the reader step back and really think about the issues and the implications they may have for the reader and his or her loved ones.Privacy today is no longer just about whether someone is peaking in your bedroom window. Privacy advocates are legitimately concerned about public surveillance, detailed yet error prone profiles of your credit history and purchasing habits, use of your medical records, and genetic discrimination. On the other side, there is increasing concern about the government's ability to effectively monitor criminals, evidence that public surveillance leads to dramatic reductions of casual street crime, arguments that it is perfectly legitimate to compile your purchasing habits, and various other valid cases to be made in favor of the reduction of some forms of privacy.I read this book immediately after reading David Brin's The Transparent Society, which argues for an increase in openness and accountability in all directions. I tend to lean towards Brin's side of things, but the two books complement each other and there are issues brought up in Database Nation that are not discussed in Brin's book.Again, this is an well written and thought provoking book. I am sure I will be referring to it for quotes for some time."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I've enjoyed other books co-authored by Garfinkel, but I just don't know what to make of this one.The Infosec world tends to be characterized by Chicken Littles who are able to attract attention by claiming that the sky is falling down. This book is filled with sky falling down examples--some of which undoubtedly will come to pass. But I don't believe that most of them will. Just because something can go wrong, doesn't mean that it will, and this book is filled with wild speculation.This book should really appeal to the paranoid and the conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that it really provides much guidance in what is realistically going to take place.It wasn't a bad read--the words are pleasantly arranged. But most of the scenarios in this book are just not credible to me, and the research is non-existent. Its an opinion piece, and I think most of the opinions are wrong.Does not live up to its jacket cover."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"The contents of this book might make some people overly paranoid. They shouldn't. The purpose of this book is more to inform than to scare, but yet the information that Mr. Garfinkel covers is potentially scary and chilling. Advances in computer technology, satellite surveillance, computer hackers, human error, fraud, security and law enforcement technologies, and even terrorists can have a profound effect on our privacy and our lives when these technologies are abused. And as the book shows, this can easily happen.Rather than be scared of it, it's better to be informed and discover ways to fight this invasion of privacy and Mr. Garfinkel provides solutions to this in the book's final chapter.The book details stories of how marketers can find out your name and address easily, how health insurance agencies can use your medical history against you when consdering whether to accept you for a policy, name theft, and even how terrorists can circumvent even the most stringent security procedures in place.This book impresses upon the reader the effect of widespread information gathering efforts and their abuse potential could directly harm them. If you care at all about your privacy, this a book you should read and glean information on how to stop these potential abuses."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"As we embark on the 21st century, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century, by Simson Garfinkel is the compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today.Garfinkel's book does cover a lot of familiar ground, making the issue of privacy more personal to the average person. For example, he describes how cell phone networks can be used to track preferences and physical movement. He also goes into significant detail about advanced identification technologies, including retina scans and DNA analysis, that can be used to identify and track individuals, but those technologies only serve as a lead-in to the issue Garfinkel seems to regard as the most serious: medical privacy.Chapter 6 provides strong details of the Medical Information Bureau. The MIB collects medical information entered on insurance forms and into personal records and sells that information to companies that need to set insurance premiums for applicants. What gives the MIB the right to collect that information? Garfinkel reveals that patients give them that permission when they consent to receive treatment.At the end of Database Nation, Garfinkel calls on our nation's leaders and government to establish an executive agency charged with enforcing existing privacy laws and acting as an ombudsman for individual privacy. The new medical privacy standards the White House offered in early 2000 go part of the way to solving some of the problems Garfinkel describes, but in all I believe his solution is far to weak to result in meaningful privacy reform, nor will it be able to keep up with the ever changing technology.Database Nation continues the growing tradition of books that cast technology in its social context. And as a doctoral student in leadership and technology, I find it heartening to read a book that so thoroughly examines technology's role in society."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Simson Garfinkel's Database Nation is a frightening account of how our privacy is being infringed upon by government, industry and certain individuals. It illustrates how ordinary citizens' private information is obtained by individuals or organizations that want to exploit the data to their advantage. The information can be obtained from driver's licenses, credit card purchases, and medical records, just to name a few. The book is insightful and fast-reading. It will prompt you to take control of your life and wonder, \\"Who is watching me now?\\"Garfinkel's intent is not to scare his readers, but to inform unsuspecting citizens that an increasing percentage of our daily activities are being captured by databases across the world. Our personal privacy is threatened with the use of fingerprinting and human marking to document and identify individuals. Whereas this means of identification was created to prevent identity theft, solve crimes, and eliminate computer error, some states are now able to sell this information to private businesses because they are part of the public record. Garfinkel's research on this topic is extensive.Not unlike George Orwell's book 1984, we are also under constant surveillance. The stores we shop at, offices we work in, roads we drive on, and establishments we frequent are capturing our video images and placing them in databanks across the nation. Even surveillance satellites are able to capture minute details of a person. Our personal information is a commodity--it's what marketers use to solicit people.Chapter 11: Privacy Now! provides us with examples and ways in which we can fight back as a nation to protect our right to privacy. However, it does not provide individuals with strategies for protection. Humans have come to rely on computers and data processing at the expense of the individual. The problem is that the smallest clerical error can destroy a person's life.Garfinkel compares his book to Silent Spring, by Rachel Carson, which planted the seeds for the environmental movement. Likewise, Database Nation sets the stage for the legislation and regulation of privacy in the twenty-first century.Everyone should read this book!"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Overall, a well done expose on the troubling problem of invasive personal data collection, a problem of the infant information age. Garfinkel asserts that \\"technology is not privacy neutral,\\" a true and alarming revelation in the computer age where data collection ability accelerates at a rate defined by Moore's law.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the increasingly important subject of privacy. As other reviewers have pointed out, while Garfinkel does an excellent job exposing the problem, the book comes up short in terms a practical self-defense strategy. His primary prescription for the problem is tough privacy legislation. While I certainly would not oppose this, I think this is unlikely anytime in the near future, especially in our new post 9.11 world, a subject of which he wrote in the chapter entitled \\"Kooks and Terrorists\\" prior to this event. Individuals should read this book to increase their awareness of the problem, and devise their own practical privacy self defense measures."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I am certain that wasn't Garfinkel's intent, however. I would suggest this book to anyone searching for a missing person! As a former private investigator, I can tell you that he describes many of the techniques I have used to locate people! You can run, but you cannot hide anymore.Scarey? Oh, I don't know, what are we scared of?....While he comes across as being an ACLU 'right to privacy' advocate, he has actually, and probably unknowingly, written a 'how to' guide to find people! And in more detail than I could have done!"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Mr. Garfinkel shares a bad dream with us of how unpleasant our lives could be made by unlimited assaults on our privacy.-- Instead of just getting telemarketing calls at dinner time, marketers send thousands of e-mails to follow up on every transaction you make (15,000 restaurants send you an e-mail coupon when they learn you are coming to New York on your honeymoon).-- Someone steals your identity by lifting a credit card application from your junk mail, spends $150,000 in your name, and ruins your credit record for 7 years so you cannot get a mortgage or another credit card (after yours are cancelled)-- because the credit bureaus cannot clean this information out of their systems.-- You get locked in a &quot;smart&quot; elevator that has stopped functioning because it has recognized your fellow passenger as a criminal. You suffer from a psychotic assault by the criminal, as a result, who holds you hostage in the disabled elevator.-- Telemarketers get through your caller ID screen by using software to pretend to call from your relatives' telephone numbers.-- Your computer at work monitors your output, and sends you messages about needing to do more work.George Orwell feared the government as &quot;Big Brother&quot; in &quot;1984.&quot; Mr. Garfinkel says that we have Big Brother under control, but profit-making enterprises are going to get us instead. We are at risk from the universal use of the Social Security Number, &quot;body identifying equipment&quot; like fingerprint and voice print detectors, and massive data bases that are unwieldy.When focused on describing the parts of the threat that have not yet manifested themselves, Mr. Garfinkel is brilliant and effective. When focusing on the solutions, he is less so. Basically, he wants to create federal laws and a federal agency (albeit a small one) that will monitor technology threats and inform Congress on the choices to protect people. I think Mr. Garfinkel is pretty naive in thinking this will be enough. How much has Congress helped us stop intrusions from other forms of free enterprise? Basically, Congress listens to special interests far more than citizens. I marked the book down one star for these weak solution proposals.I do agree with Mr. Garfinkel when he says that technology is invasive. I think instead that we have to rely on our own efforts to protect our own privacy and that of people who we are responsible for. I also think we must business with companies that use our data in responsible ways, and demand full disclosure on privacy policies. For example, encryption technology can help a lot of companies allow us to work with these businesses in ways we prefer to. I can see the rise of intermediaries which provide confidentiality and data security. I certainly would like to do business with companies like that. Are there any entrepreneurs out there listening?After you have finished reading this book, think about how you can protect yourself from the worst invasions of your privacy. A good start is to get your name taken off of bulk lists. Change your address (using P.O. boxes and private services) and e-mail address often, if necessary, to help. Inquire about what other uses are made of the information you generate. Ask to see your medical records. Find out how they are being sold, and make changes to put a stop to that abuse. Armed with this book, you can make a lot of progress in protecting yourself. Mr. Garfinkel deserves our thanks and support for providing this valuable information...."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"This is an older book, but one that I specifically requested after reading books like Myth of Homeland Security by Marcus Ranum and Beyond Fear by Bruce Schneier. While those books related directly to homeland or national security in the wake of the 9/11 attack this book predates the attack but describes an Orwellian society where Big Brother monitors everything and privacy is a facade.When I was in high school I read George Orwell's 1984. It is a work of fiction, but in many ways present society and technology have surpassed Orwell's vision. Simson Garfinkel paints a chilling picture of the complete lack of privacy today because we have the technology to store and retrieve almost every transaction and occurrence that goes on in our lives.When you make a cell phone call records are kept of the area you called from and the number you called. When you make a purchase with a credit card or ATM/Debit card you create a record of where you were at a specific time and date as well as what you purchased. Medical records tell a lot about a person and are not as protected as people believe. A recent Supreme Court decision essentially states that an ISP can legally intercept and view your email without violating wiretap laws. Common, everyday activities capture and store minute details about your life.This book offers few solutions, but does an excellent job of describing the problem in a compelling way. Everyone should read this book to learn what a facade your privacy really is.(...)"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"This book has more to do with American politics than negative implication of advanced technology like it is trying to shoot for.Database is merely a tool, and tools can bring hazardous results when held in wrong hands. SSN is another tool to get a grip on personal information for the government and large businesses, and the author is right in pointing out the abuse of SSN. However, one needs to note that use of such numbering system is considered unconstitutional in many countries, because they rob the rights to remain anonymous away from people.Traditionally, the interest of the nation and large businesses took precedence over the rights and freedom of commoners in the United States, and installment and abuse of SSN is just one of the tools they use in order to tap into what they should not.This book blames the tools and development thereof for such negative consequences, without ever blaming those who hold the tool. It's like blaming chain saw itself for the lost forest, without ever considering who used the chain saw.The book never talks about the global trend of the issue. If it did, it would have been clear that most of the worries expressed in the book does not apply in many countries where the government and businesses aren't as nosy as ours. Freedom, individual rights and technology can co-exist, and there are lots of good examples to learn from on our planet, but the author refuses to do so. Most of the worries expressed in this book have to do with the ways of U.S. policymakers than the technology itself.As for the chapter on terrorism - The author might be a knowledgeable person within the boundary of the United States, but he severely lacks international common sense. It fails to address the cause of terrorism, noting, \\"The terrorist of tomorrow is the irrational terrorist. (pp.211)\\" - A typical uninformed American take on terrorism. The author needs to learn a few languages, travel every continent and see how the world works for himself before publishing a book on it. The ignorance alone doesn't bother me, but I'm not happy with the fact that it is published in a book that is supposedly informative, ending up with spreading unnecessary fear without presenting any valid solution. Besides, this chapter on terrorism strays from the purpose of this book (technology and privacy). This is another indication that this book is compiled without sense of direction.All positive reviews quoted on the back cover are of domestic sources: I suppose they couldn't get anyone overseas to recognize the value of the book on this supposedly global issue. I think this book should be discontinued, but in case that's impossible, they could at least change the title to \\"Nightmare in the 21st century America\\" from \\"The Death of privacy in the 21st century\\" and re-compile the book under some sense of direction, instead of simply listing whatever people would be afraid of.To sum up, this book scores well among those who are uninformed: it is highly engaging because it tickles the fear factor of readers and grabs attention, in a way fictions do. However, the raison d'etre of this book is quite questionable. Like cheap horror movies, it flows without sense of direction, moving from one scare to another. I'm afraid I cannot recommend this book to anyone as an informative source."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Overall this is a good book, provided that you take it for what it is - an opinion piece. There are plenty of facts included in this book (many of which are out-of-date). However, the volume of facts does not support the volume of conclusions drawn by the author. For example:Early on the author states that a failure to create a national database, instead of several independent ones as we have now, had lead to security issues and that the single national database would be better. He does not provide supporting material on WHY it would be better. There are other examples in the book that you can find for yourself.Should you buy it? Maybe consider borrowing it, checking it out from the library, or getting a used one on eBay (mine will be there soon ;-)"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I have been reading books about privacy, notably from Australia where they first got worried about this, and am an admirer of the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) based in Washington, D.C. so I can say with confidence that this book is not completely original, but I can also say that it is quite useful. The single best and most original book in this area that I am aware of with my own limitations, is Jeffrey Rothfeder's 1992 classic,Privacy for Sale: How Computerization Has Made Everyone's Private Life an Open Secret.The author captured my immediate interest when he posited early on that it is capitalism, not totalitarianism, that is the really grave threat to privacy, and then goes on throughout the book to demonstrate how capitalist innovation--and capitalist retribution--can find so many more profitable uses for stolen or insufficiently protected personal information including information about one's precise movements, Internet access, payments, and so on.I credit the author with providing us with a really SUPERB discussion of an expanded definition of privacy and why it matters for the future, to include how a lack of privacy stifles free speech and individual voting or engagement.The book is of course timely with the recent revelation of widespread NSA access to telephone records and widespread domestic telephone interceptions without warrants. I am quite certain NSA has full access to all travel and credit card records, and relatively certain that NSA is also obtaining full access to all banking transactions both within and passing through the USA. Eventually, as the dollar collapses and foreigners realize their financial transactions are not private, I suspect that the NSA intrusions will lead directly to a substantial reduction in what people are willing to transfer via US channels, and in this way deprive the US of interest and assets.The author merits credit for anticipating in 1999 that terrorism would one day be used to justify extensive intrusions against privacy.Most interestingly, the author reveals, for the first time to my knowledge, that NSA is in the phone card business. All those phone cards that terrorists and criminals have been using evidently have tracking information, and the testimony in the McVeigh case that the author illuminates makes it certain that this source and method will dry up for NSA with those who really matter: literate terrorists and criminals who, like Bin Laden, understand the value of open sources of information and make it their business to follow the literature.Although the author's information with respect to credit card errors is somewhat dated, it merits comment that in 1991 there were errors in fully 43% of the files of the three main credit bureaus and--this I did NOT know--even if one corrects errors with those three credit bureaus, the corrections do NOT pass down to the 187 independent industry or localized credit bureaus that have purchased the incorrrect data prior to correction. More recently the industry claims a 1% material error factor, but in my own experience, the credit bureaus are quick to post liens or claims, and not at all interested in posting lien cancellations or settlements.The author spends quite a bit of time, very usefully, in focusing on the fact that identity theft occurs due to lax banking and postal procedures (I for one am very upset over the countless offers of credit I receive in the undefended mail, offers that can be \\"hijacked\\" by anyone cruising for such mail before I collect it), and then denouncing the fact that victims of identify theft do not have \\"standing\\" in the courts--it is treated as a banking issue.The book concludes with several scares and big ideas. Car have computers that can communicate--the day is coming when cars will report their owners for speeding, and a husband driving a wife bleeding to death from a farm accident will not be able to override the computerized speed limit. The author concludes that technology is eliminating the expectation of privacy, but I am more concerned by his documentation that we are becoming slaves to computers programmed by morons in bureaucracies.The author suggests that a major challenge is how to create self-healing systems and I am curious as to why he did not know of Eric Hughes anonymous banking encryption protocols, in which only the bank and the client can see their banking data, which is otherwise constantly encrypted.The federal government is clearly avoiding accountability, not only with respect to data privacy, but with respect to being accountable for who knew what when. The White House and the Senate clearly knew in 1974-1979 that Peak Oil was upon us (see my review ofTwilight in the Desert: The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economyand also ofCrossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of Oil), and deliberate decisions were made to conceal the facts from the public in order to keep the bribes coming and the easy elections going. We wasted 30 years because of decisions that can now be judged to be treasonous and retrospectively impeachable.The book has acceptable coverage of biometics, RFID, public video, and commercial space imagery. In the latter, the book has a mistake SPOT Image likes to take credit for many things, and they evidently claim credit for creating a C-130 portable ground receiving station. This is not true. Colonel \\"Snake\\" Clark in the office of the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, conceptualized and oversaw the development of that capability which made a major difference to air operations in Bosnia among other places, as it made possible near real time seasonally accurate wide area imagery feeds directly into the Air Force mission rehearsal systems.To end on a positive note, I point to page 108 of the book, where the author discusses inexpensive discreet video surveillance systems that can be used to keep an eye on kids, cats, baby sitters, realtors showing one's home, and so on. Technology does have its uses for the individual, and I will end by saying that I found this book to be a very professional and useful overview of the implications of both digital technology, and the personal information that technology can capture, store, manipulate, share, and exploit."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"As a veteran of the technology industry, Simson Garfinkel brings an insider's understanding of how personal data is collected and managed to his book \\"Database Nation\\". He seems to be genuinely concerned about where the unregulated use of information technology may be leading us as a society, and has chosen to write his book in an easily accessible style in order to present his views to as wide an audience as possible.\\"Database Nation\\" succeeds overall. The author provides historical context and anecdotes for each topic within the book, helping bring the subject of privacy to life. Indeed, the book contains many interesting, useful and compelling passages. Among these are discussions of identity theft, credit reporting, and direct marketing.Thematically, I tend to agree with the author that a core problem has been the failure of our government to properly regulate the collection and use of consumer data in the private sector. Citing many real-world examples, Garfinkel succeeds in proving that today we have far more to fear from private industry than from government (although there is no doubt that significant problems remain with the way our government handles information).The chapter on \\"Kooks and Terrorists\\", written prior to September 11, was remarkably and tragically prescient. Garfinkel suggests that we might best be served by tightly controlling and monitoring the instruments of destruction rather than attempting to track the entire civilian population. The author reasons that even if such tracking mechanisms were possible, no such predictive system of monitoring the intentions of millions of individuals could ever be infallible. It would be interesting to learn more about his thoughts on this subject today.However, I was disappointed with the book on several counts. First, despite the repeated use of the word 'privacy', Garfinkel never really develops a theory of privacy: what it is, why we should care about it, and how citizens might be able to simultaneously enjoy the benefits of an information-rich world while living in a society that values and protects its citizens' privacy. Second, I was a bit surprised that the book scarcely addressed the issue of workplace privacy, which has been and remains a highly contentious and important issue for many working class Americans. Third, while Garfinkel often proposes relatively simple but brilliantly conceived laws to secure our privacy rights, at other times he suggests the implementation of additional layers of technology in order to solve problems related to the use of technology; this inconstancy left me a bit puzzled. Fourth, as others have pointed out, there is little information provided about how individuals can take action to protect themselves.Despite these minor flaws, I recommend \\"Database Nation\\" as a fairly good starting point for learning about the important subject of privacy."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I've enjoyed other books co-authored by Garfinkel, but I just don't know what to make of this one.The Infosec world tends to be characterized by Chicken Littles who are able to attract attention by claiming that the sky is falling down. This book is filled with sky falling down examples--some of which undoubtedly will come to pass. But I don't believe that most of them will. Just because something can go wrong, doesn't mean that it will, and this book is filled with wild speculation.This book should really appeal to the paranoid and the conspiracy theorist, but I don't believe that it really provides much guidance in what is realistically going to take place.It wasn't a bad read--the words are pleasantly arranged. But most of the scenarios in this book are just not credible to me, and the research is non-existent. Its an opinion piece, and I think most of the opinions are wrong.Does not live up to its jacket cover."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"This is a fantastic book; a fascinating read through the history of privacy, with many colorful stories.

Buy this book to find out."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"This book dashed the high hopes I had for it. There are many very good reasons to be concerned about the ways technology can be used to curtail our civil liberties and constrict our freedoms. I had hoped for a serious discussion laying out the problems, their current state of application and misuse, and some thoughts about how to push back.We do get some of that and to the extent this book is in this scope I like it a great deal (for example, the discussions around eternal copyrights and huge commercial databases gathering everything known about each of us or the sale of drivers license photos to commercial interests). When it is in the middle area of discussing thought crime and brain wiretapping he begins to lose me. It isn't that the issues aren't worthy of discussion, it is simply they way he discusses them has too much of a paranoid science fiction future feel.When he paints the future of conscious machines and whether they will demand civil rights or not, well, I think he spoils this book. That speculative stuff should be in a different book. For me, the inclusion of this material makes it impossible to take seriously the good stuff he does have. The weird apple spoils the barrel kind of thing.It isn't that the book isn't worth reading. It's that the serious stuff is so important that we need to focus on that and not be distracted by paranoid delusions about things that don't even exist. There is plenty to be concerned about in the databases already collected and being sold in commercial markets."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I almost stopped reading this book after the first 15 pages as the author resorts to scare tactics to paint scenarios that I felt were almost wholly unrealistic. Fortunately I decided to keep reading. While I certainly do not agree with everything the author says, Database Nation brings up a broad range of privacy and security issues, and then discusses various problems and points of view associated with these issues. First and foremost, I think the author tries to make the reader step back and really think about the issues and the implications they may have for the reader and his or her loved ones.Privacy today is no longer just about whether someone is peaking in your bedroom window. Privacy advocates are legitimately concerned about public surveillance, detailed yet error prone profiles of your credit history and purchasing habits, use of your medical records, and genetic discrimination. On the other side, there is increasing concern about the government's ability to effectively monitor criminals, evidence that public surveillance leads to dramatic reductions of casual street crime, arguments that it is perfectly legitimate to compile your purchasing habits, and various other valid cases to be made in favor of the reduction of some forms of privacy.I read this book immediately after reading David Brin's The Transparent Society, which argues for an increase in openness and accountability in all directions. I tend to lean towards Brin's side of things, but the two books complement each other and there are issues brought up in Database Nation that are not discussed in Brin's book.Again, this is an well written and thought provoking book. I am sure I will be referring to it for quotes for some time."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"The imminent future is one that will be suprising to those of us still entranced in the status quo. Our system is milliseconds away from the complete onslaught of policies aimed at protecting our privacy. Garfinkel, describes credit cards, medical records, social security, consumer information, employment, surveillance, identification systems, the internet, and telecommunications. The basic picture is one where there will be an increase in protection, or a lack of privacy in the future. I recommend this book to those who felt paranoid during the y2k scare, yet I feel this book is definitely a requirement for anyone who wishes to be a knowledgeable denizen of the civilized world.

From European point of view, such privacy violations are something unbelievable. Garfinkel's book simply shows us the hazards of modern technology, and convinces us that our European privacy protecting laws are a good thing, despite sometimes being used to cover bribery or theft.Sometimes \`Database Nation' seemed so nave, but to understand it, we must notice it was written few months before attack on WTC. Now we can see how governments are trying to know everything about everybody and the only reason for that is protecting us from terrorism. Nice idea, but Garfinkel has already predicted it - he wrote that a big terrorist attack would happen, even if we maximize security and privacy violations cannot stop really bad people.As I wrote before - I have never been in the States, so sometimes I was reading this book as some kind of \`weird guide to the USA'. Some of described pitfalls can be seen in Europe as well, but usually we do not expect our medical records to be seen by anybody... maybe because in most European countries medical insurance is run mainly by the government. And here is the point, where this book lacks some kind of perspective. What do you think is better: having your medical record sold, or die because funds of some emergency stations are so low, that only one ambulance in fifty-thousand-people-city is on duty? Is it better to protect privacy, or to highlight crooks? The highly illegal under Polish law so-called \`Jachnicki list' was a list of people who cheated and deceived a lot of honest citizens. Giving detailed information including name, adress, birthdate and PESEL (unique number every Pole is assigned at birth) about those people, the creators have broken Personal Data Protection Act, and were forced by government officials to stop publishing that list. This is the other side of fighting for permanent privacy - and Garfinkel doesn't write anything about it..."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Garfinkel cover a wide variety of territory here, and you may not feel that all areas are an issue for you. The territory includes significant breaches, credit reports, health records &amp; insurance forms, as well as direct marketing lists and practices. Garfinkel stresses that the issues are not just privacy-related, but also data integrity - - bad enough that others have access to the truth about your history, but mistakes in the data quickly get replicated throughout the business world.You may not have a problem, for instance, with insurance companies asking you to allow them to share information, if you feel it increases the efficiency of the market. You may not have a problem with targeted marketing, which is built on customer profiles. However, after reading this book you'll have a better sense of the issues.One anecdote was very effective, I thought, in challenging complacency on these issues. I have heard a number of people say their privacy won't be violated because their lives are too boring. Garfinkel tells a story that demonstrates how people who have too little to do will glom on information just because the information is there, whether or not it has practical value. He has a story about an office web camera focusing on the coffee pot; the camera is there so those coming downstairs to get coffee can manage their expectations and will know in advance whether or not they will have to make a fresh pot. Yet this picture of this innocent coffee pot gets heavy web traffic every day, from people who have nothing better to do than look at a coffee pot. So, being boring is not sufficient protection against the idly curious; less so against those with malicious intent."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"The first edition of Simson Garfinkel's Database Nation was published last year and it was well received. It won the praise of many people in the computer and Internet industries for its candid portrayal of how advances in computer and Internet technologies, satellite surveillance technology, abuse of database information, computer hacking, human error, fraud, lax security, security and law enforcement technologies, Federal agency policies, and legislation can affect our lives. Consequences are far from flattering.Readers will find alarming the actual experiences of real people documented in this book. Read up on how companies can use computers and Websites to track customer shopping and surfing patterns and make future use of this information for a variety of purposes. Readers will be made aware of how easily transit card use can be tracked. Did you think that grocery store discount card was used only to save you money? Ever wonder what all that information on a customer survey or registration card was used for? This book addresses these and many other privacy issues we face today that have far reaching implications on how we live our lives in this society. Don't take things for granted.

Garfinkel portrays our world as a hopeless technical dystopia where insurance companies rip you off, telemarketers bother you at dinnertime, terrorists run free and the average person is powerless to do anything about it.The book's unrelenting pessimism makes it unbalanced and ultimately hurts the author's credibility. For example, instead of giving a nod to the progress being made by pro-privacy agencies such as the Department of Health and Human Services and the state Consumer Protection Boards, Garfinkel dwells on abuses by the FBI and \\"faceless\\" corporations.I'd skip this one unless you need another reason to be mad at insurance companies."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Simson Garfinkel has written Database Nation to present a comprehensive assessment of the direction technological advances are taking that have already threatened the privacy of American citizens. Threats to our privacy hit home - they threaten our liberties to voice opposing views, to mount peaceful protests, to buy and sell, to move about freely without big brother watching us, and to live our lives as we please without undue snooping by others.The book serves as an indictment of the Federal Government, law enforcement agencies, financial institutions, private companies, and others who have gained too much control over the lives of people. Garfinkel provides a historical perspective of technological developments and demonstrates how easily we have gone down the road of information gathering. Readers will learn that their privacy is lost when information about them is being collected and sometimes sold, stolen, and put to use by others for a variety of purposes.The contents of this book is chilling. Are threats of crime and terrorism justification for power grabs and the surrendering of our civil liberties? Garfinkel provides case studies to demonstrate the impact technology has had upon our personal freedoms. He provides revelations about various uses and abuses of barcoding, fingerprinting, audio and video surveillance systems, Webcamming, wiretapping, credit reporting, medical record management, confidentiality, and more.Readers will learn how the lives of average American citizens can be turned upside down when errors creep into IRS tax records and credit bureau reports. People are human and humans make errors unintentionally, they steal information, and they deliberately tamper with information for a variety of criminal reasons. Readers would be shocked to learn that they themselves may have been the victims of undue scrutiny!This book should serve as a wake-up call for American citizens to become more knowledgeable about widespread information gathering efforts and the potential for harm that could result from its illegal and unethical use.

Database Nation is a very good set of arguments for privacy laws and regulations.Most of what Mr. Garfinkle talks about is not new, although he does a great job of going into detail about why any individual type of invasion of privacy should worry you. The biggest single worry in my mind was the chapter on medical records and the things that are happening behind your back that you will never be told about with respect to insurance companies, your hospital records, and the access to them.It's not that any one thing is probably that big of an issue. It's that it's all tied together -- and your entire life is on display. It's chilling when looked at as a whole. This isn't a handbook on how to hide. But Garfinkle sets a mood and frame of mind that will certainly make you aware of how information about you gets out there, and does give some suggestions on how to limit that flow. He raises many questions about the balance of security and privacy -- concerns that need to be addressed sooner rather than later.[If you like this kind of thing, Rise of the Computer State is an excellent book, but it looks like it's out of print now (and probably dated). But it's well written.]"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that I would learn not only where &quot;my&quot; data are warehoused around the country, but also what to do to check it, and elect or &quot;opt&quot; out of various databases. Unfortunately, this book fails in that regard. There are ways to opt-out of Direct Mail, and contrary to the authors' claims, the vast majority of direct mail firms DO make use of the &quot;DMA&quot; list. The reason is simple ecomonics: legitimate businesses want to hold down mailing costs to their minima. Regarding medical information, the author lists 23 states the citizens of which may investigate their files. How does one initiate such an investigation? How do I check my FBI file; what about any other government files? My list goes on; it extends to every area Mr. Garfinkel covers. Not a single address or phone number for obtaining one's own data files is listed in this book. The tone appears to be doom-and-gloom rather than here's what you can do to protect yourself. For that reason I rate it 2 stars. (Name withheld to protect my privacy.)"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"First, of all, I should disclose what is probably a conflict of interest. Simson and I have been friends for years, and we have collaborated on a number of projects, including 3 books. As such, some people (who don't know me well) might suspect that I wouldn't provide an objective review. So, if you think that might be the case, then discount my recommendation by half -- and still buy and read this book. Simson has done an outstanding job documenting and describing a set of issues that a great many people -- myself included -- believe will influence computing, e-commerce, law and public policy in the next decade. They also impact every person in modern society.This book describes -- well, and with numerous citations -- how our privacy as individuals and members of groups has been eroding. Unfortunately, that erosion is accelerating, and those of us involved with information technology are a significant factor in that trend. Credit bureaus accumulate information on our spending, governments record the minutiae of their citizens' lives, health insurance organizations record everything about us that might prove useful to deny our claims, and merchants suck up every bit of information they can find so as to target us for more marketing. In each case, there is a seemingly valid reason, but the accumulated weight of all this record-keeping -- especially when coupled with the sale and interchange of the data -- is frightening. Simson provides numerous examples and case studies showing how our privacy is incrementally disappearing as more data is captured in databases large and small.The book includes chapters on a wide range of privacy-related issues, including medical information privacy, purchasing patterns and affinity programs, on-line monitoring, credit bureaus, genetic testing, government record-keeping and regulation, terrorism and law enforcement monitoring, biometrics and identification, ownership of personal information, and AI-based information modeling and collection. The 270 pages of text present a sweeping view of the various assaults on our privacy in day-to-day life. Each instance is documented as a case where someone has a reasonable cause to collect and use the information, whether for law enforcement, medical research, or government cost-saving. Unfortunately, the reality is that most of those scenarios are then extended to where the information is misused, misapplied, or combined with other information to create unexpected and unwanted intrusions.Despite my overall enthusiasm, I was a little disappointed in a few minor respects with the book. Although Simson concludes the book with an interesting agenda of issues that should be pursued in the interests of privacy protection, he misses a number of opportunities to provide the reader with information on how to better his or her own control over personal information. For instance, he describes the opt-out program for direct marketing, but doesn't provide the details of how the reader can do this; Simson recounts that people are able to get their credit records or medical records from MIB, but then doesn't provide any information on how to get them or who to contact; and although he sets forth a legislative agenda for government, he fails to note realistic steps that the reader can take to help move that agenda forward. I suspect that many people will finish reading this book with a strong sense of wanting to *do* something, but they will not have any guidance as to where to go or who to talk with.The book has over 20 pages of comprehensive endnotes and WWW references for the reader interested in further details. These URLs do include pointers to many important sources of information on privacy and law, but with a few puzzling omissions: I didn't see references to resources such as EPIC or Lauren Weinstein's Privacy digest outside of the fine print in the endnotes. I also didn't note references to ACM's Computers, Freedom and Privacy conferences, the USACM, or a number of other useful venues and supporters of privacy and advocacy. Robert Ellis Smith's &quot;Privacy Journal&quot; is mentioned in the text, but there is no information given as to how to subscribe it it. And so on.I also noted that the book doesn't really discuss much of the international privacy scene, including issues of law and culture that complicate our domestic solutions. However, the book is intended for a U.S. audience, so this is somewhat understandable. A few other topics -- such as workplace monitoring -- are similarly given more abbreviated coverage than every reader might wish. Overall, I recognized few of those.On the plus side, the book is very readable, with great examples and anecdotes, and a clear sense of urgency. Although it is obvious that Simson is not an impartial party on these topics, he does present many of the conflicting viewpoints to illustrate the complexity of the issues. For instance, he presents data on the need for wiretaps and criminal investigation, along with accounts and descriptions of bioterrorism, including interviews with FBI officials, to illustrate why there are people of good faith who want to be able to monitor telephone conversations and email. If anything, this increases the impact of the book -- it is not an account of bad people with evil intent, but a description of what happens when ideas reasonable to a small group have consequences beyond their imagining -- or immediate concern. The death of privacy is one of a thousand cuts, each one small and seemingly made for a good reason.Simson has committed to adding important information to the WWW site for the book (&lt;http://www.databasenation.com&gt;). Many (or most) of the items I have noted above will likely be addressed at the WWW site before long. Simson also has informed me that the publisher will be making corrections and some additions to future editions of the book if he deems them important. This is great news for those of us who will use the book as an classroom text, or if we recommend the book to policy makers on an on-going basis. Those of us with older copies will need to keep the URL on our bookmark list.Overall, I was very pleased with the book. I read it all in one sitting, on a flight cross-country, and found it an easy read. I have long been interested in (and involved in) activities in protection of privacy, so I have seen and read most of the sources Simson references. Still, I learned a number of things from reading the book that I didn't already know -- Simson has done a fine job of presenting historical and ancillary context to his narrative without appearing overly pedantic.This is a book I intend to recommend to all of my graduate students and colleagues. I only wish there was some way to get all of our elected officials to read it, too. I believe that everyone who values some sense of private life should be aware of these issues, and this book is a great way to learn about them. I suggest you go out and buy a copy -- but pay in cash instead of with a credit card, take mass transit to the store instead of your personal auto, and don't look directly into the video cameras behind the checkout counter. Once you read the book, you'll be glad you did."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"What cyberspace requires is authors who are willing to interrogate &quot;what we all know is true&quot; to see, in fact, whether what we all know *is* true. This book has an extraordinary integrity to it, as it reopens a set of questions that most of us thought closed. You won't agree with everything, there are many questions left unresolved, but there is no doubt that in places this book will change you mind. It is the best book on privacy and the internet that I have seen."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Privacy has become an apple pie issue. These days everyone is for it, and most people assume that there is a &quot;right to privacy&quot; articulated somewhere in the US Constitution, but there is actually little consensus in our society about what &quot;privacy&quot; really means, let alone &quot;right to privacy.&quot; Alas, Garfinkel never quite puts forward a satisfying definition of privacy in Database Nation. He predicts (correctly) that the &quot;right to privacy&quot; will be one of the most important civil rights in the 21st Century, and (incorrectly) that &quot;the federal government may be our best hope for privacy protection as we move into the new millennium.&quot; When examined more closely, most of the invasions of privacy he cites are actually violations of due process, negligence, inaccurate data, abuses of the nanny state, or outright fraud.The book suffers from so many errors that space does not allow me to identify them all.Garfinkel misstates the federal law regarding social security numbers and driver licenses. He also seems unclear on the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). According to Garfinkel, the FCRA &quot;forbids the release of the information for noncredit or insurance purposes, such as direct marketing or 'people-finding' services.&quot; The truth is more complicated, but you wont find it in Database Nation.Garfinkel's discussion of identity fraud is misinformed, and he passes along uncritically too much received wisdom about the issue. He seems to think that consumer credit reports contain the mother's maiden name of the consumer and that &quot;lookup services make this information available, at minimal cost, over the Internet.&quot; Wrong on both counts. Forgive me, but at this point in the book I started wondering whether Garfinkel had ever even seen a credit report. As a licensed private investigator and professional debt collector, I deal with credit reports, look-up services, data protection laws and privacy issues every day, and am able to compare Garfinkel's claims with my own first-hand knowledge. Garfinkel has too much of a graduate-seminar approach to these issues. He needs to get out more.I admit I have philosophical differences with Garfinkel's framework of reference. The greatest threats to privacy come from government, not business, as government has unique powers to coerce information from its citizens which no private entity has. Garfinkel sees government regulation of the private sector as the solution to privacy concerns. I see it as the problem."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"The basic premise of this book is that today's database-centric technology threatens our privacy. A good topic and the book is written in a &quot;joe public&quot; style so you don't need to be a computer geek to follow the stories. However, many of his &quot;solutions&quot; to database induced problems call for more databases; usually government owned and operated - George Orwell would be proud.For example, one case presented has to do with a couple who sold their home and moved elsewhere. The IRS's database &quot;goofed&quot; and started sending notices to the couple at their old address. Because the IRS mailings are stamped &quot;Do not forward&quot; the couple never received them and the IRS eventually put a lien on their house. The couple only found out about this after being rejected for a credit card renewal. The author writes, &quot;A national database [containing data on every individual in the country] could have headed off the excesses of the credit reporting industry.&quot;Isn't this what the author is arguing against?"},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Why every American? Because, as Garfinkel points, out Europeans are better protected than we are. In every way, on virtually every page of the book, Garfinkel shows not only how our private information is being used without our knowledge, consent, or ability to correct it, but how it is being associated. In fact, I would argue that his collection of details of how the smallest pieces of your personal, financial, medical, and employment history can be connected easily by businesses to deny you credit, a job, or insurance makes the strongest case for regulation.The kind of regulation Garfinkel argues is necessary - and which mirrors existing laws in the EU that American companies flaunt over the Web in their dealings with EU citizens - would provide the right kinds of control and redress for citizens without requiring government involvement and ownership of data.(One of the odd recurring points in the book is that Garfinkel views it as a missed opportunity that a monolithic data center wasn't built in the 60s to collate all individual information. I see his point, but imagine if Nixon had that resource at his disposal? Even without it, he had people's tax returns pulled. I may, perhaps, misunderstand Garfinkel's message there, as he felt a central storage point would have provided a nationwide opt-out control for individuals and the use of their data by any company.)It's fascinating reading and a relatively quick read for a nonfiction title. As I read it, I had prickles at the back of my neck as I discovered how my own information is being used without my knowledge. (Ever heard of the MIB? Not Men In Black - read the book...it's almost as insidious.)Database Nation paints a picture of the dangers of leaving our lives in data in the hands of business instead of our own hands. Hopefully, technology and policy will meet politics for a solution described in his book providing the kind of ownership and rights we need."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"I applaud the extensive research and documentation in this work.However, such a broad subject is perhaps only sensationalized in a brief 312 pages. Describing all information gathering from fingerprinting to satellite imagery as an invasion of privacy is either the outcome of wanting to sell books by pandering to the fears of the public or the by product of covering too many individual topics without balanced depth.As a practitioner in using these database sources of information on a daily basis as a Private Investigator, I found most topics lacking in an explanation as to how valuable and important information is, and not to discount it as only an invasion of privacy to be feared.This book is an interesting overview of an important subject, but it's value to the reader will be dependant entirely on what the reader is expecting from it in the first place."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"\\"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century\\" does not live up to either its promise or potential. I was gravely disappointed.There is no need to revisit at length the issues raised in an earlier review, which point out that there are no methods presented for individuals to check or correct erroneous information in their various errant files. It's as though the author is yelling \\"fire\\" and then not telling us how to get out of the building, forcing readers to find their way out through the smoke. And there is a lot of smoke indeed.Though making many good and instructive points the author often contradicts himself. For example, the government goes through a mutually exclusive, full-cycle, role metamorphosis. In the beginning legislators could have protected us, but fell short through dropped or ignored legislation. For much of the remainder of the text the government is identified as the greatest threat to personal privacy. By the end, the author is back to a benign government that can protect and look out for what is best for us after all. Which is it?The author, to lay some blame, claims that technology is not neutral, anthropomorphizing it with the apparent ability initiate evil, privacy threatening deeds. This is patent nonsense. Technology's use is certainly not neutral, but by itself it is beached, waiting for the next tide to either wash it further up on the sand or out to sea. His example of an inadequately designed high-tech phone system (pg. 258-260) appears to blame the phone system itself because it has the potential to be misused. Who buys that? Raise your hand.The use of statistics throughout is both unscientific and unprofessional. The author strategically reports only the component of the statistic that supports his point, without ever allowing readers the opportunity to arrive at similar conclusions with all the facts at hand. A fair example is on page 134, \\"15% of those who had their medical confidentiality violated...said that it had been violated by insurance companies.\\" Okay, but that's not enough. Where are the others whose medical confidentiality was violated? Is 15% the largest single component of the whole? Or is the 15% all he needed and we are left to wonder where the other 85% falls (not an insignificant portion of the population I might add). The book is redolent with this verbal slight of hand.When he cannot make a point using facts or actual examples the author simply makes up a story. However, once the story is told, and he has admitted to its source, he often doubles back on himself to the belief that this is a real issue. It usually goes something like this: if you put your foot on the floor monsters under the bed will eat you, not really there are no monsters, but putting your foot on the floor is still bad because the monsters will get you when someone finally gets around to building them and figures a way to squeeze them under your bed, so be afraid. See: Simulated Humans Can't Be Trusted (pg. 241-242).A section titled Brain Wiretapping (pg. 234-235) operates in a similar vein. In the opening paragraph he states, \\"Catching these [terrorists] will require an even more invasive monitoring technique: brain wiretapping.\\" Invasive is the word. Without missing a beat he goes from mind reading, which he dismisses as not all that reliable, to the possibility of running these suspected terrorists through functional MRIs (which may include sawing the skull open to get at their works). All of this in an effort to find out what nefarious deeds these terrorists may be up to. Imagine the court order requesting this procedure.As illustrated both above and below, unintentional humor abound. In another example described on page 225, an FBI initiated Internet wiretap led to a student in Argentina, \\"the investigation ended there, because Argentina would not extradite...his actions were not a crime in [Argentina].\\" In an aside immediately following, the author reveals the student \\"waived extradition and plead guilty; he was fined...and received three years probation.\\" What? His footnote indicates if you want to know more, you can look it up yourself. Thanks, but no thanks.Finally, his chapter on medical privacy, which has more to do with medical ethics than personal privacy, contains his most egregious and unforgivable error. He divulges, not once but several times, the names of individuals whose very personal medical conditions were released in flagrant and inexcusable violations of their privacy, often to unfortunate results. By giving up the names of the individuals involved isn't the author a virtual accessory after the fact to the initial privacy violation? Maybe these events and names are a matter of public record, but so what, why compound the wrong?There are many factual anecdotal stories throughout the text; some include names some do not. Why, in a book whose intent is to highlight the increasing threats to personal privacy, did any real names get used at all? I could find no statement to the effect that identities were changed to protect individuals' privacy. One would think this would be the minimum ethical standard of a book on privacy, point that ironically seems to have escaped the author, editor, and publisher."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"Read this and then click over to &quot;Transfer-the end of the beginning&quot; by Jerry Furland.

I've looked."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"This book is important, and it deserves to be big. Simson Garfinkel has nailed the history, the present circumstances, and the nightmare future scenarios as the remaining shreds of privacy in American life circle the drain at the new century's dawn.Garfinkel shows the future we're heading toward in pictures no-one can mistake. The book is aimed at a general reader -- the author doesn't dwell on the technical details, and Database Nation should be a non-threatening read for anyone who is literate.Like good dystopian science fiction, Database Nation bids not to predict a future but to prevent one. Garfinkel is longer on description than on prescription for the problem of privacy under attack. Many of the remedies he sketches suggest government intervention to wrest back some control of private information for the individual. This emphasis on government action will be the most controversial aspect of Database Nation, spurring automatic resistence in overlapping circles of Net culture from the libertarian to the privacy-aware. But the fact is that in the privacy arena, Big Brother may not be the biggest threat -- it's thousands of Little Brothers, private actors in a capitalist free-for-all.Database Nation's dust jacket sports a killer array of blurbs from a who's-who of privacy advocates: Ralph Nader, Marc Rotenberg, Peter Neumann, Sen. Edward Markey. I hope they convince the people who need to read this book to buy it -- that majority of the population in this consumer society who see nothing wrong with selling their most private data for a $5 coupon.If you're a regular reader of Tasty Bits from the Technology Front, RISKS, the PRIVACY Forum, or the newsletters of EPIC or the EFF, you probably don't need to read Database Nation. But I hope you will; you'll learn more than you might imagine, I guarantee it. When you're done, loan the book to a friend who needs to get a clue about privacy. When it comes back, loan it again."},{"Title":"Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century","review":"One thing I seriously do not understand at all:You're writing a book about privacy. You criticize people exposing their private lives, criticize everything under the sun for intrusion of personal privacy. And you give very intimate moments of your life as examples. \\"Once I wrote my wife a letter and I said in that letter....\\" the author continues. Who cares about how you two met or decided to marry??I believe it's a little bit too personal and completely irrelevant. The examples of his personal life don't even support any point he is trying to make. If you're bragging about privacy rights and can not conceal \\"yourself\\" behind the curtain no one will take what you're saying seriously. Write a memoir instead.I think the author is confused about many many more points like this one. His examples are weak, inconsistent, or irrelevant. Here's another one: He is talking about his United Airlines mileage credit card and how he's used it many times to win 50000 extra miles by which he got domestic flight tickets for himself and his always-within-the-context wife. So he goes to a coffee shop and uses this card and thinks to himself \\"Hey someone somewhere is making money keeping track of my purchasing habits.\\" And far, a few more pages later he criticizes Americans for \\"giving up their privacy willingly for the sake of small benefits\\". Excuse me??!? Your latte bringing extra miles probably tastes better than your privacy?His technical knowledge is too shallow. His points are inaccurate perhaps because this book is outdated but he claims things that do not exist; such as how \\"impossible\\" it is to correct false information on your credit report. Or how banks make customers pay for fraud transactions.Another really confusing point is that he is giving examples from the bible!! I find it very offensive to people who do not share his religious views. And beyond that, call me crazy but isn't he supposed to be talking with facts?What bothers me most is the author's way of twisting the truth! He is either blind or ignorant. He spoke vaguely about all(!!!) the points that would have possibly brought about any criticism to the government. It's almost like he is playing dumb. I wonder who sponsored his book?!? It seems to me that he is worshiping some particular political parties?!?He is talking about Philip Zimmerman's case, one of the most important cases in the history of privacy, in one sentence without giving any names or details.I bought this book because it was listed as a textbook and I had to. Other than that it's just crap.

The transformation that took place was the emergence of \\"a system of slavery that was basic to the political economy of many parts of the continent,\\" a system that expanded through the end of the 19th Century, structured on the \\"interaction between enslavement, the slave trade, and the domestic use of slaves within Africa.\\" The transformation occurs in three stages: from 1450 to 1600, the Islamic trade; from 1600 to 1800, the Trans-Atlantic trade, and the 19th Century, the internalization as a result of the breakdown of exterior slave trade."},{"Title":"Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa (African Studies)","review":"Anyone interested in Slavery in Africa must pick this book up.

This IS a necessary volume, in that there are many terms specific to narratology that cannot be found elsewhere in the format of a literary dicitionary.

Owning this book can in many instances save hours of study within other tomes.HOWEVER, the quality of the definitions themselves vary greatly. Many definitions are fantastic, and very complete. They take into account the views of more than one theorist, and that's great. In fact some definitions take up to 3 pages, but other terms are so minimally defined that one is essentially referred to another term in the book, and that's it. And although the bibliography is very complete, it is not annotated.So the bad news is that if you're a student, you're still going to need to do a lot of reading (especially of those books mentioned in the bibliography) and cull through that info to get to a good working definition of some terms. You may want to consider the Penguin Dictionary of Literary Criticism in addition to this book; that one will certainly save time, but it is not geared toward narratology specifically, so you will need both books.All in all, if you're a professor or student of graduate level English, you do need this book.

Hardy can be depended upon to paint a vivid picture of the characters' environment, and their relationships to it, but this time with a twist: One of the two characters being an astronomer, most of the environmental descriptions are of the heavens, and are wonderfully appropriate for the characters' actions and 'aspects'.Hardy had a gift of creating characters who are fascinating in their personalities and actions, and together with the environmental descriptions, reading his novels is just one step away from watching a really good movie of the story.Of all Hardy's varied characters, I felt the most sympathy for the two on the tower. Viviette has a great need for love and is selfless in giving it. Swithin, a somewhat naive and literate scientist, is at the same time a tender and faithful lover. Of all Hardy's stories, I hoped that this one would somehow have that &quot;happy ending&quot;, and I suffered uncounted times for both characters.I highly recommend this book for emotional involvement, though it may tear you apart to read it!I would also recommend another of Hardy's lesser known novels The Woodlanders, which I understand was his own favorite story, and remains mine also."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"Beautifully written, Thomas Hardy goes all out to make the reader see, hear, and smell every scene in this book. From begining to end, you never know what's going to happen next, and just when you think the story is calming down, Hardy throws a swerve your way. Great surprises, not predictable at all.Hardy perhaps one of the better describers of setting of his time, shows once again, why books were so highly read back in his age.Thomas once again delivered another great book of sadness, happiness, pregnancy and marriage. Although the story is mostly sad, it is still a great book, especially for those who have read previous Hardy books. A great read."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"The story of a lonely woman caught between love and propriety, self-sacrifice and self-interest, &quot;Two on a Tower&quot; is one of the saddest novels I've read. I kept hoping for a description of a blissful-but-brief interlude for Viviette, but it never materialized. Instead, unhappiness dogged her to the novel's cruel end. Yes, cruel. The final event in the book was an unnecessary stroke. Also, while I usually accept a character's actions, I cannot believe that Viviette NEVER anticipated becoming pregnant. The possibility certainly haunted ME from the moment her secret marriage took place. For all of it's sadness, however, the story is engaging and provides a criticism of the unforgiving social conventions of Hardy's time."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"Two on a Tower is among Thomas Hardy's least known novels, and though not in his top tier, is excellent and would be nearly anyone else's best. It certainly deserves a far wider readership, as it has both many usual strengths and is in several ways unique, making it worthwhile for both fans and others.The main unique factor is the astronomy focus. Hardy had significant interest in and knowledge of astronomy, which pops up in his work here and there, but only Two deals with it extensively. The main male character is an astronomer, and the field gets considerable attention; readers can learn a fair amount about it from Two, as there are many technical terms, historical references, and other descriptions. The focus is indeed so strong that Two might almost be called proto-science fiction; astronomy is not integral to the plot, but its background importance is very high. Hardy was no scientist but researched extensively, taking great pains to be accurate, and it shows. The science has of course changed much in the century plus since, but the basics here focused on are essentially unaltered, and we also get an interesting historical perspective. Hardy in any case adapts astronomy to his purposes, not least by using terminology metaphorically - a risky move that could have been disastrously corny but is very well-done. More importantly, he shows it through the lens of his infamously pessimistic, naturalist philosophy. Many astronomers think of their field as one of wonder and beauty, but Hardy sees it very differently. Two is well worth reading for these factors alone, especially for anyone interested in astronomy.The astronomy angle also has other important effects, not least in portraying the scientific mindset and culture of science just as it was beginning to arise. Much later novels like Sinclair Lewis' Arrowsmith (1925) are almost universally credited with first showing this, but Hardy was far ahead of his time here as in so many ways, essentially displaying it all in 1882. Two even anticipates stereotypes - such as scientists taking things too literally and being socially inept - not common until after World War II. It dramatizes many important related issues: scientists' single-minded devotion to study, the pure vs. practical research problem, the annoying but impossible to ignore finance issue, etc. It also incorporates related themes closer to Hardy's heart-centered, empathy-driven worldview: the problem of study vs. society, love vs. work, etc. Such dynamics are very complex, and he handles them deftly, making them not only interesting and thought-provoking but affecting.All this may sound as if Two is inaccessible, but it is thankfully very far from so. Early chapters seem to move the book toward true early science fiction, well away from previous Hardy territory, but this soon proves untrue. It changes to his central concern: a story of - in this case quite literally - star-crossed lovers with consequent issues of class, law, morality, and religion. Fans will probably be glad, while some others may be disappointed, but the drama is so well-done that is surely impossible not to be at least moved. This plot aspect is very similar to several other Hardy works, and some elements are virtually verbatim, but many usual strengths are at near full force. Chief among them is Hardy's near-unparalleled portrayal of emotion; whatever else we think of the characters, it would take a hard heart indeed not to feel for them. Hardy always deals in universal human emotions, making his highly dramatic works accessible to all. The characters themselves are also very engaging; Hardy is famous for heroines, and Viviette is another in his long list of great ones and deserves to be much better known. Swithin is in many ways engrossing, if less sympathetic, while Louis and the bishop are two of his more memorable villains. The latter two may be somewhat one-dimensional, but the main characters are richly complex and full of verisimilitude. Finally, Hardy always pushed the boundaries of what was acceptable, and Two, like several of his other novels, was viciously attacked, even condemned, for undermining religion, law, and morality. Hardy's 1895 Preface notes that things had changed so much even by then that readers would be hard-pressed to find anything offensive, and Two is so superficially tame by our standards that the very idea of it causing controversy is laughable. However, time has allowed us to get past such trappings and appreciate Hardy's still unfortunately valid points about laws that are unjust and/or nonsensical, a church that is corrupt, and a society that is hypocritically prudish and optimistically self-important.Strong as Two's core is, occasionally questionable execution keeps it well below Hardy's best. Different as it is in some ways from his other novels, it in other ways exaggerates tendencies that many always dislike in him. The plot is very dense, probably too much for many, with multiple twists in such quick procession that it is easy to dismiss the book as unbelievable. Hardy's heavy coincidence use is often noted; it is common in Victorian fiction but even more so in him, which often annoys those favoring more straightforward recent novels. However, unlike weak writers who rely on it for plot and hope we will not notice, he uses it deliberately and even draws attention to it because of his deterministic beliefs. Fans inevitably come to terms with this, but he arguably simply goes too far here, especially as he does not take as much trouble to justify it as usual. In addition, while there are no plot holes in the usual sense, some points, especially about Louis, are never explained. To be fair, it must be noted that Two has an incredible amount of suspense, far more than we expect from Victorian works. He also has a nearly scientific ability to know what we expect and do something different, which is highly admirable in any writer. On the other hand, the dialogue is also almost certainly Hardy's most artificial - so much so that it is at times nearly risible. Finally, Two is arguably a bit overly melodramatic, especially the rushed ending. Hardy later classed it as one of his \\"Romances and Fantasies\\" where realism was not consciously maintained, and his Preface admits the book was not well put together. This is partly because, in contrast to his usual practice, he did not proof the serial or revise for book publication; in addition, several differing manuscripts floated around at once, and not all changes were implemented. Hardy was usually an inveterate reviser but gave Two unusually little attention, and it shows. A thorough revision would likely have fixed at least several weaknesses, but Two is still quite strong.All told, though Two should be no one's first Hardy novel, anyone who likes his others should certainly pick it up eventually, and those who have disliked one or two may also find it appealing."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"***possible spoilers***Granted, this novel does not quite reach the literary heights of \\"Tess\\", \\"The Return of the Native\\" and a few others by Hardy. However, it's a very compelling story told with the apt pen of this writer, whose (let's face it) lesser novels are so much better than other writers' best efforts. The story tells of Viviette's and Swithin's secret marriage and how destiny does not allow this to come to full recognition. Their destinies are literally controlled by the stars. Like Hardy does so well, he portrays country living in the 19th century with authentic dialogue and real social regulations that bound English society at that time. I loved this novel, despite the rapid conclusion that left me a bit frustrated, but at the same time with my mouth open in beautiful disbelief, a reaction that only Hardy and very few others can elicit from me. Unlike another reviewer stated, I think the title fits the novel perfectly, especially when one considers the final scene of the book, in which there are only two left on the tower after the final events. It's a stunning and symbolic conlusion that is reflected in the title. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"Good book. Hardy's descriptions of astronomy are beautiful. The characters of Lady Constantine and Swithin are well developed, and Swithin's conflict between love and science moves the book.If I have one complaint, the characters apart from Constantine and Swithin aren't as well developed as a book like Far from the Madding crowd. Jan Coggan, the Maltster, and Laban Tall are one of the best parts of Far from the Madding Crowd, and that is missing from this book. The parson is developed, but he's not funny or lively."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"If you like Thomas Hardy and unhappy endings, then you will like this book.

He feels their anguish when faced with serious decisions and guides the reader through all the various options, the good and bad, the exciting and dangerous, the frivilous and deep, with human emotions being examined in ways the reader does not anticipate or expect.The only minor concern with this book is its title.

She knows it can't work, but hopes it might and their struggle with the world..A good read for free download.."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"Thomas Hardy entitled his first attempt at a novel \\"The Poor Man and the Lady\\". The work was never published, and the manuscript is now lost, but its theme of love between people of different social classes is one he returned to time and time again. Its title could serve as an alternative title for several of his published novels, and several others, notably \\"Tess of the d'Urbervilles\\", could equally well be titled \\"The Poor Woman and the Gentleman\\".\\"Two on a Tower\\" falls into the \\"poor man and the lady\\" category. The lady in this case is Viviette, Lady Constantine, the unhappily married wife of a country squire, and the poor man is Swithin St. Cleeve, a penniless young astronomer. The two meet and fall in love when Viviette gives Swithin to use a tower on her country estate for his observations. The death of Viviette's husband Sir Blount while on a hunting expedition in Africa leaves the lovers theoretically free to marry, but as so often happens in Hardy circumstances conspire to force them apart. They are quite literally \\"star-crossed lovers\\"; Hardy himself said that his intention was to \\"set the emotional history of two infinitesimal lives against the stupendous background of the stellar universe\\", and the book shows evidence of his own interest in astronomy.The most important factor preventing their union is the force of social convention. Swithin and Viviette are divided both by class and age, she being some eight years older than he. The class structure of Victorian England was far more complex than a simple rich/poor or upper/lower divide, and the complexities of that structure are exemplified by the positions in which both main characters find themselves. Swithin's father was a clergyman and therefore, almost by definition, a \\"gentleman\\", but one who compromised his social status by marrying the daughter of a local peasant-farmer, which means that Swithin himself cannot lay claim to any social rank, especially as he was orphaned at a young age and raised by his maternal grandmother.Although Viviette is a titled lady, she is not particularly wealthy, her late husband having left her, apart from the manor-house she lives in, little but debts. She is, however, still regarded as a member of the upper classes with a social position to maintain, and after she is widowed her family, especially her domineering brother Louis, expect her to restore her fortunes and position by making an advantageous second marriage. An ideal (from their viewpoint) candidate presents himself in the shape of the wealthy Bishop of the local diocese.The second factor dividing the lovers is sheer bad luck. Hardy here makes use of plot two devices beloved of Victorian novelists- the bungled attempt to marry, something which also occurs in \\"Far from the Madding Crowd\\" and \\"A Pair of Blue Eyes\\", and the eccentric legacy. Swithin is left a considerable amount of money by his uncle, a prosperous doctor and a confirmed bachelor, to further his scientific studies, but this comes with a condition that he will forfeit the legacy should he marry before the age of 25.When it first came out in1882 the novel was the subject of much hostile criticism, with some reviewers condemning it either as immoral, or as anti-religious satire, or both. Like many contemporary attacks on works now regarded as classics, this one seems absurd today. Hardy was far from being the \\"village atheist brooding and blaspheming over the village idiot\\", as Chesterton called him, and his attitude to religion, although sometimes doubting, was certainly not hostile. Although Bishop Helmsdale may come across as pompous and self-satisfied, there is nothing in the novel which might be construed as an attack on Christianity.Swithin has certain similarities with Angel Clare in \\"Tess\\". Both men are the sons of clergymen, both leave the women they love to travel in the Southern Hemisphere and both eventually return from their travels with unhappy consequences for those women. There is, however, a difference between them. The rationalist Angel has consciously rejected his father's faith in a way that Swithin has not. Certainly, he may experience doubts about divine providence when contemplating the vastness of the heavens, but he later takes the step of presenting himself to the Bishop for confirmation- a symbolic reconciliation of scientific endeavours with Christian belief.As for the supposed \\"immorality\\" of \\"Two on a Tower\\", what is likely to strike the modern reader is the caution with which Hardy approaches his theme and the circumlocutions he adopts in an attempt to avoid saying, in so many words, that Viviette is pregnant by a man who is not her husband. This was, in any case, not an unprecedented theme in the 1880s; earlier novelists such as Dickens, Mrs Gaskell and Trollope had all tackled the subjects of illegitimacy and unmarried motherhood.Hardy divided his novels into three categories, which he entitled \\"Novels of Character and Environment\\", \\"Romances and Fantasies\\" and \\"Novels of Ingenuity\\", and it is noteworthy that all those major novels upon which his reputation now chiefly rests, except perhaps \\"A Pair of Blue Eyes\\", fall into the first category. \\"Two on a Tower\\", which he classed as a \\"Romance and Fantasy\\", is today widely regarded as one of his minor works. Although even minor Hardy is at least as good as a whole lot of other writers working at the height of their powers, I think that there is a reason why this novel has not caught the public imagination in the same way as the likes of \\"Tess\\",\\"The Return of the Native\\" or \\"The Mayor of Casterbridge\\".The story seems rather rushed, something possibly due to the fact that it was being written for serialisation. It is considerably shorter than most of Hardy's other novels, yet seems to pack in at least as much incident as any of them, which means that matters such as character development are rather neglected. This is perhaps why Hardy did not classify it as a \\"novel of character and environment\\". Viviette makes an attractively spirited heroine (her name appropriately derives from the Latin for \\"lively\\") but she is not as powerfully drawn as, say, Tess or Bathsheba Everdene. Hardy's greatest novels all end tragically for at least some of the characters, but the tragedy derives logically from some flaw inherent in their characters or in their social environment. The final tragedy of \\"Two on a Tower\\" is down to nothing more than pure bad luck. In the final chapter, in fact, Hardy seems to be working his way towards a rare happy ending, only to reverse this with a sudden and shocking denouement in the last couple of sentences, doubtless realising that he was in danger of losing his reputation as the Great Pessimist of English literature. For this reason we are not moved in the way that we are moved by the climaxes of some of his other novels."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"... with one foot mired in Victorian propriety and the other in the modern world! On one hand to be so eager to challenge conventions, and on the other to be unable to bluntly declare his heroine pregnant! No novel I've ever read has been so plainly riven between two paradigms. Curiously, Two on a Tower begins in the democratic age of modern skepticism and then regresses inexorably to the class-conscious, superstition-bound era of Gothic romance.The first three chapters of the book are as engaging an opening as any Hardy ever wrote, establishing a glorious setting in an abandoned tower in rural 'Wessex', introducing two prepossessing characters who will unquestionably become the love-interest of the tale, and brilliantly contrasting the folkways of a vanishing rural culture with the intellectual turmoil implicit in the discoveries of science in the modern world. The scene in which the new vicar attempts to persuade his local yokel choir to sing at A440 rather than the time-hallowed A415 is preciously funny, reminiscent of the earlier Hardy novels \\"Under the Greenwood Tree\\" and \\"Far from the Madding Crowd.\\" But in close juxtaposition, the young 'leading man' - Swithin St. Cleeve - eloquently describes the fearsome anxiety he feels at realizing the infinitesimal insignificance of humankind in the scope of the cosmos. What he portrays is exactly what I (and you too, dear reader?) feel upon looking into deep time and empty space -- the feeling I call astrophobia. Swithin, admirably, is not daunted by his own insight; rather he aspires to contribute to that very knowledge which has made his traditional worldview unsustainable.Enter the woman, of course. Lady Constantine is an abandoned, abused wife, living the hollowest chivalric mockery of traditional male-female relationships. She's beautiful, she has resources, she's impressionable and impulsive... and she's eight years older than Swithin. She will, obviously from first appearance in the text, seek to find her 'realization' in Swithin's potential as a scientist and in her own role in furthering that potential. Obstacles, need we say, will arise. From chapter four onward, this promising 'novel of ideas' quickly transforms itself into the most rhapsodic Avon Romance, superior to Danielle Steele only in the quality of descriptions. I should say, however, that as an Avon Romance, Two on a Tower is a darn good one.Significant coincidences and momentous chance encounters are the heart's pulse of the Victorian novel, the organizing principle, the primary means of compression of action, the successors to the \\"deus ex machina\\" of earlier epics. Every Victorian novel has a few of them, and it's silly to object since they are intrinsic to the genre. This almost-Post Victorian novel has more than its share, and they seem awkward here precisely because they fail to serve the modernist themes and dispassionate observations of the author. Perhaps in the age of pre-modern credulity -- that is, of religious certainty -- such fortuitous interventions of 'fate' were taken for granted. One could build a critical career, I think, by maintaining that the 'modern' novel was born when the last coincidence was excluded from the plot.I'm surprised that most of the previous reviewers have been charmed by this strangely tragic tale. I would have guessed that no one had ever been satisfied with its outcome. Certainly it was not a success at the time of its publication, and it hasn't received much respectful attention from literary scholars since. Me? I enjoyed it a lot, at the same time as feeling disappointed in it. Poor Thomas Hardy had the most divided 'soul' of any novelist who ever wrote, aching for the old certainties and the quaint tranquillity of pre-modern England yet somberly aware of their futility. He couldn't keep his footing on both sides of the chasm, so he chose to cultivate nostalgia for the very objects of his mockery. When a living man defines himself as 'conservative,' he effectively consigns his mind to hibernation. Hardy's 'conservatism' was a surrender to pessimism, a confession of defeat before the battle."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"It pains me to give one of my favorite authors less than four...-ish stars, but I really feel as if Two on a Tower is not that great. As someone coming from a scientific/engineering background, I did of course get giddy with excitement upon seeing Mr. Hardy discuss the beauties of the sciences and people's relations to them, and as far quotable quotes, Two on a Tower ranks among the best of Hardy's oeuvre. You also have the whole questioning attitude towards marriage/relationships similar to Jude the Obscure coming out of this like you do. But this book is no Jude the Obscure. It felt more draggy and dull...sort of like an episode of Happy Days after the series lost its stride. (And yes Happy Days did have a pretty nice stride there for a while). I don't know, keep Two on a Tower on the bench until you've exhausted most of the rest of Team Hardy, which for me has a starting lineup of Tess, Jude, Madding Crowd, the Native (slight Return), and the Mayor of Casterbridge.Yay"},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"When you look at faded photographs of the aged Thomas Hardy (1840-1928) the elderly gentleman looks like anything but an insightful author whose speciality is the human heart. Bald! Stooped over and clad in black. An old man who loved old dogs, his old home in Dorset and old memories of the days of yore in his childhood home in the West of England.Yet Hardy produced some of the greatest novels in the English language. In this minor work of 1882 he presents us with a tragic/comic love tale ofstarcrossed lovers.Swithin St. Cleeve is a twenty year old amateur astronomer. Each night the young man ascends an old tower built on the site of a Roman campsight. The Tower is on the property of the Constantine farm. Swithin becomes acquainted with Mrs. Constantine whose name is Viviette. She is forlorn and lonely. Her wastrel and wealthy husband has left for a safari junket in distant Africa. Viviette is a romantic woman who dreams of poetry and love. She quickly becomes enamored of the Apollo of the Tower joining him for long evening sessions of watching the stars in panoply over the dark skies of Wessex. Her interest leads her to purchase expensive astronomical equipment for Swithin. With the improvements in the tower telescope the boy hopes to become famous as an astronomer. Perhaps, the couple dream, Swithin will become a member of the famed Royal Academy having his research work published to wide acclaim. Swithin does submit a paper for publication only to learn, to his deep chagrin, that an earlier scientist had already been published on the subject.Viviette and Swithin fall in love-she harder than he!. They secretly wed but are spotted in the town where they get the wedding license. Viviette's brother has seen them. He and the society in the village frown on marriage between two partners coming from different classes.Later, to her utter horror, Viviette learns that the odious husband she had thought had died in Africa was still alive at the time of her clandestine wedding to Swithin. Constantine did die in Africa but still breathed when the marriage with Swithin was consummated. Viviette also learns that Swithin will receive an annual bequest of 400 pounds per annum if he follows the instructions of his late benefactor a relative.The relative was a doctor who was a hater of marriage. Swithin will lose the bequest if he marries before he is 25! Therefore, the couple decide to keep the marriage a secret. Complications and accidents abound!Viviette decides that Swithin should have his career opporunities spiked by his leaving on a long scientific trip to South Africa. While he is gone she learns she is pregnant with his child. The couple had planned to publicly wed in a ceremony when he reached 25 but now this idea is scotched. Viviette has lost her fortune due to her husband's death. She hastily is wed to a dull, pompous, fat and old bishop. He dies soon after the wedding. She is left to raise the boy who is really the son of Swithin and not the deceased cleric.After a few years Swithin returns home to discover Viviette a widow. His son is now a toddler. Viviette has aged badly though she is till in her 30s. Swithin has fallen out of love with her. Instead, he is smitted by the fetching beauty and talent of Tabitha Lark the organist of the local church.Hardy shows nature as apathetic with the human predicaments of his characters. The Hardyian universe is bleakly godless. People are the mere playthings of the chances of nature. In Hardy's view we are open to the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune on a dangerous rock called earth. There is no consolation to be found in the church.This novel evinces the author's interest with older and younger lover. Also on display is his examination of love between a poor man and a richer woman.Class is important since Swithin comes from a lower social order than Lady Viviette. Such marriages were condemned by the prim Victorian society abhorred by Hardy.Viviette is a woman of complexity, romance and compassion. Her heart and not her head rule her lugubrious existence. She is the one character in the book to be remembered; Swithin is a cardboard lover who is lacking in maturity and wisdom.Thomas Hardy is a poet whose prose is evocative of the English rural countryside.His evocative picture of the peasants is well drawn from childhood remembrances. The transient glories of an English year in the country is well drawn. This is a short but satisfying way for Hardy fans to read another fine novel. It is also a good first novel for Hardy newcomers."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"I am a huge Thomas Hardy fan, and I was not disappointed with this book. At first all the technical astronomical information was slow, but the love story started and that was forgotten. My only complaint about Two on a Tower is the ending. It seems very rushed - everything comes crashing together in about 10 pages. It wasn't realistic for Viviette to age so much and no longer be beautiful 4 years later, considering she was only 33 at the end of the story. Sir Constantine was possessive, jealous and terrifying but she still kept her health and beauty after suffering with him. The bishop was full of himself - how is that worse? A few years with him and all of a sudden she's an old woman with a heart condition? Swithin comes back and says he'll marry her, she's overcome with joy and BOOM! She dies in his arms. I also find it strange that neither Swithin or Viviette acknowledged that the boy was his. Didn't people in the village realize who he looked like, since people were already suspicious of the lovers? What will happen next, Swithin takes his son in and marries Tabitha Lark? A very good, sad, complicated romance."},{"Title":"Two On A Tower","review":"The language of Hardy is exceptional.

If I paid $30 for this book I wouldn't be overly upset, but for four times that amount I expected a lot more."},{"Title":"You're All Washed Up, Beetle Bailey","review":"This is an excellent selection of older Beetle Bailey strips that should appeal to the ardent fan."},{"Title":"Birds of the Northern Forest","review":"According to Roger Tory Peterson (who has a blurb on the inside cover of this book), \\"the birds of the north country have never been more beautifully portrayed\\" than in this book.I'd have to agree, as the profiles of each of these birds are complemeted by incredible full-page paintings that are so life-like and detailed that they seem almost three dimensional. You can see every bit of feather texture on the Boreal Owl, for example, and the coloration is perfect. I particularly like the way each bird is highlighted against a white background, with only a bit of branch or foliage on which it perches, just enough to give a hint of the foliage in its natural habitat. This puts the emphasis exactly where it should be- on the birds themselves and the effect is quite striking. They \\"pop\\" from the pages.But this is more than a beautifully done collection of bird portraits. The text is compact but provides full information on the habits, nests, habitat, breeding and migratory patterns of these birds. When writing about the Gray-cheeked Thrush, for example, it is noted that \\"both sexes sing during courtship\\". Such tidbits of interesting trivia are fascinating to read.Bird lovers are sure to learn more about each one featured in this book and the drawings deserve to be showcased, perhaps with the book open on a table or a book stand. It is simply that extraordinary!A complete Bibliography and list of references complete this book, along with some suggestions for materials useful in identifying birds. Quite a find for the birdwatcher!"},{"Title":"Birds of the Northern Forest","review":"James Fenwick Lansdowne of Victoria, British Columbia, is one of the leading bird artists of his generation. Still under thirty, he has produced some of the finest portraits ever made of North American birds. Scientifically accurate, they are also works of art: original in concept, imaginative in treatment, full of action and life. Now for the first time Lansdowne's bird paintings are made available in superb full-color reproductions with accompanying text by the well-known ornithologist and former Executive Director of the Audubon Society of Canada, John A. Livingston. Birds of the Northern Forest contains fifty-six plates printed in six colors. The half-title pages, one for each plate, carry Lansdowne's pencil sketches. Each color plate covers a full page given to a single bird, occasionally a pair, along with appropriate background detail. In each instance the page opposite carries the descriptive text. The subjects run from waterfowl, game birds and birds of prey to the more familiar thrushes, finches, sparrows and warblers.The book has been manufactured in Italy with scrupulous attention to all its aspects, from paper and binding to the reproduction of the illustrations them selves. The artist's original conception and execution have been captured with extraordinary fidelity.Fortunately birds recognize no political boundaries. Though both artist and writer are Canadian, the species they portray are well known in the United States. This magnificent book is created in continental, not national terms. Later volumes are planned to focus on other regions of North America.J. F. IANSDOWNEBorn in Hong Kong of British missionary parents, J. Fenwick Lansdowne came to Canada in 1940 and was educated in Victoria, British Columbia. He became interested in birds at a very young age and studied birds and their anatomy for a year at the Provincial Museum in Victoria.Lansdowne is now recognized as one of the fore most bird painters in the world. His paintings have been exhibited at major galleries and museums including the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto; Audubon House, New York; the Brooke Bond Centres in Toronto and Montreal; the Kennedy Galleries in New York; the Tryon Galleries, Lon don, England; and the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts. The city of Victoria presented one of his paintings to the Princess Royal in 1962, and other paintings have been acquired by such collections as Audubon House, the Beaverbrook Foundation, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, the Ulster Museum, Belfast, Ireland, the Art Gallery of Victoria and numerous private collections including that of Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.JOHN A. LIVINGSTONA lifelong naturalist, conservationist, and wildlife photographer, John A. Livingston was born in Hamilton, Ontario and graduated with his B.A. from the University of Toronto. After serving in the RCNVR in the Second World War, he be came Executive Director and later President of the Audubon Society of Canada. He has been editor of Canadian Audubon magazine, and for seven years wrote and narrated \\"Audubon Outdoors\\", a weekly radio program on conservation and natural science. An executive producer for the CBC, Livingston has also written many scripts for television including two award-winning series, \\"Explorations\\" and \\"The Nature of Things.\\"Livingston's love of birds has led him to study them in twenty-seven countries on five continents. He is at present a trustee and Treasurer of The Nature Conservancy of Canada, a Director of the Federation of Ontario Naturalists, a member of the Commission on Education of the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and is also co-editor of a new ecology series entitled The Naturalist's America."},{"Title":"The purposes of God","review":"This is the best book as a series of teachings by Edwin B. Stube while ministering at an inner city parish St Paul the Apostle. It has many nifty references if you are familiar with the area and just the city of man. The better part of this book compared to the New York Best Seller book is that it contains life beyond salvation into the life in the Spirit of God. It is a book based on a life long experience of a family that started parish life in Montana, on to Indonesia during a trying era, and back to America. Very easy read, one could read it in one Saturday, hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Holy Eucharist: Rites I and II","review":"For the truly visually impaired Episcopalian this is a very useful book. The print is very readable. The true problem lies in the fact that it is not paginated like the Book of Common Prayer that is used in the Episcopal Church. If you are a newcomer to the Episcopal Church and not familiar with where things are in the Prayer Book, even with a &quot;Sunday program&quot; or &quot;bulletin&quot; it is difficult to find the appropriate pages in this large print book. The Episcopal service tends to jump around in the Prayer Book. Without reference to the corresponding pages in this large print book, a novice would be lost. Morehouse Barlow used to publish two large print paperbacks, one with the Eucharists Rites I and II and the other with the Psalter...they were paginated the same as the Book of Common Prayer. Why they stopped publishing in this form is beyond me."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"Cover: For Exam 70-222 No Longer AppliesThe front cover, spine, and back cover of this Training Kit imply that the Training Kit is geared toward the MCP Exam 70-222, however this no longer applies due to the changes in the objectives for this exam.Exam 70-222 is still in development and will be released in its beta version by July 2000. Because the objectives for the exam were not yet finalized when this Training Kit was first published, the Training Kit does not map exactly to this exam, nor to the direction this exam is taking in its development.Since the exam objectives have changed, please disregard the references on the cover."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"This book is very good at allowing you to learn some of the &quot;hands-on&quot; of upgrading an NT network to a Win2k network. However, I found the book lacks in the amount of detail I was expecting for a study resource for the 70-222 exam. If the exam only covers the material contained in this book, it will be one of the easiest exams Microsoft has ever offered; but I doubt this will be the case.In sum, a GREAT book for someone that already has a good understanding of Win2k and needs a lot of hands on exercises to familiarize himself with the practical application of a well considered upgrade strategy."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"This was my first MS Press purchase for Win2K. Overall a light read. I am an MCSE/MCT and have already taken 1594 and 1567 - the information was the same. The nice thing about the training kits is that they ARE like the MOC's - complete with module timing and labs. I would not recommend this book to experienced MCSE's, but would recommend it to anyone that is just getting their feet wet or to those folks that have more \`book learning' than experience. TTFN!"},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"This was a very good book at giving me a quick and easy intro to Win2K. Yes, this book is short on details and missing some areas, but I'm already an experienced MCSE + Internet in NT 4.0 and the last things I wanted to see (again) were 100 page explanations of how WINS, DNS, NTFS permissions,etc,etc work. I read enough books on that subject matter already in getting the NT4 certification. If you are just getting started into NT with Win2000 and need more info then you should probably by one of those 1600+ page books on Win2K by Minasi, but I would not subject myself to that trauma again. I don't care how good anyone say's he writes.For me this book was just what I needed. Now I know what the main differences are between NT4 and Win2K and how and where to set up the most important things needed to incorporate it into my existing NT4 networks. From here, I will learn it hands on and also by later reading more specialized books. Personally, I learn better that way. All in all, this was a good book that you will learn from and you can finish it in a week."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"Microsoft Press is off to a good start supporting Windows 2000 exams with this very smart training kit for exam (70-222). If you're an MCSE like me who wants to upgrade NT 4.0 servers and your certification, this text will help you do both. Its lesson-oriented structure supports effective learning in short steps. Clear explainations of key concepts preceed hands-on exercises. You'll need a test network of at least two PCs and Release Candidate 2 copies of Windows 2000 Professional and Server to take full advantage of the kit. While they did a great job with the key issues, I finished the book hoping to get into unattended installs and ISS 5.0. But then these topics need their own books."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"I found this Microsoft book less useful than the two others I bought: Cockcroft/Eckel/Kauffman (ISBN 157610690X) and Chacon/Chellis/Donald/Desai/Robichaux (ISBN 0782127606). Neither was perfect, but each had its strengths. By reading both I was able to pass the 240 monster-exam with 2-3 weeks' preparation. Transcender was critical in such a rushed exam prep.Next time I might not bother to buy any books, but just use Transcender with its Resource Kit references, sourcing the articles from TechNet's #1 CD, &quot;Technical Information&quot;, the only CD I (sometimes) take with me on holiday!The books do have their advantages: 1. you can travel without a laptop; and 2. they are a chance to escape the evil clutches of your monitor.By the way, I also bought Chellis/Desai/Donald/Robichaux's &quot;Exam Notes&quot; (ISBN 0782127703) but didn't use it - the exam syllabus is available on the Microsoft web site and the remaining content is too superficial to really help.Good luck with the exam."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"As with all Microsoft books, you get what you need to know fast.

This book will teach you everything you need to know about Windows 2000 administration and support, and did a great job of explaining troubling Active Directory concepts.

I have read about 30 MCSE books in the last couple of years and I believe that this is the worst I have read. I would not buy it again."},{"Title":"McSe Upgrade to Microsoft Windows 2000: Training Kit (It-Training Kit)","review":"Surprisingly, this was a good book on the introduce people to Windows 2000.

And he could write! He told of Langston Hughes taking over a play rehearsal and recreating his life: those \\"sad old weary blues.\\" From Kansas where he lived with his grandmother, to Illinois, Mexico, to New York & Harlem, to Africa, to Paris and Harlem again; then Pennsylvania, where he graduated from college in 1929. When other men were jumping from buildings, Langston Hughes continued writing. \\"My soul has grown deep like the rivers.\\"Many named in the play as influences in Langston Hughes' life, were revered by & quoted by my father: Frederick Douglass, Paul Laurence Dunbar, Countee Cullen, Thurgood Marshall, Mary McLeod Bethune; also white poets Vachel Lindsay & Edna St. Vincent Millay. Ossie Davis opened to us a view of a previous generation, somewhat like the view from that railroad car - - passing swiftly as in a dream.By coincidence I had again been reading the play before learning of Ossie Davis' death last week. I am grateful to him for sharing the stories of many dreams with play-goers and readers.

Jon may have moved on and fallen in love again with Ann, but Fleur has never loved everyone but Jon.Swan Song has many of the usual Forsyte book tropes-- commentary on modern life offered through the observations of old men; June introducing us to the latest artistic schools; Forsyte paralysis when faced with the unblinking desire to do the wrong thing. As with the five books preceding this, it is all wonderfully well written. Michael and Fleur encountering people doing the Charleston is a particularly charming moment.Swan Song is so powerful partly because of the mixed emotions it has about Fleur. While Galsworthy gamely soldiers on to complete the cycle of doom begun by Soames and Irene, it is evident that he has a great deal of sympathy for Fleur. This installment shows her at her best as well as showing her at her worst. She is the swan of the book, singing her loveliest song.

Cooper and her friends Alex and Claire are back, along with Josh, Cooper's boyfriend hopeful. While Josh seems, at times, genuinely interested in Cooper, why does he appear to continually be hiding something from Cooper and mysteriously running off somewhere else? And then there's the pretty little redhead Reagan Josh keeps showing up with, even though he's just asked Cooper to the spring dance. At the same time, Cooper's modelling career is flourishing, with getting a job with a hot new photographer. But though his work is very professional, Cooper's just not comfortable around him. Meanwhile, between Cooper's modelling and her struggle to define her relationship with Josh, her friendships with Alex and Claire seem to quickly be drifting away. In this funny episode with Cooper, you'll experience a lot of laughs and a few times of seriousness and contemplation. It's easy to get into this book and hard to put down!

There are so many study-at-home language products that are boring and ineffective. This is more like the Suzuki method of studying music. Listen, imitate, learn!The method definitely deserves 5 stars, but there are problems with the \\"Instant Conversation\\" product. (The negatives can be noted by reading the Amazon reviews of the corresponding product for Spanish.) To advance to the whole first set of the comprehensive Pimsleur method, you have to pay for these first 8 CD's again, in effect, and at a higher price. (When you buy the comprehensive Mandarin I, it is my understanding that half the CD's you buy are identical to these. Therefore your investment in this beginner set is unwise.) Too bad that they didn't make a special (stand-alone) set for this product instead of just removing the first 8 of the 16 CD's in the Comprehensive Mandarin I.Those considerations aside, this method is unbelievably effective. I have taken private and group Berlitz, bought untold numbers of study at home sets, and have taken languages in the university. This is fast and really effective. I'll be buying more of the Pimsleur method in other languages, too.Bottom line: This was an relatively inexpensive way for me to test the Pimsleur method in some depth."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"Two years ago my employer required me to begin to learn Mandarin. They had purchased the Original Pimsleur Mandarin Cassettes several years prior to my joining the company. I made it through eight lessons before I took a position with another firm. However, my desire to learn Mandarin had been ignited.I didn't feel comfortable spending the $350.00 to buy the full Pimsleur course myself, so I went to the local library and checked out the resources there. I tried three different courses by other authors and was amazed how sub-standard they were. Nothing compared to the quality and retention the Pimsleur method gave. When I saw that the Instant Conversation series was available I bought it immediately. I reasoned that for less than $50.00 I could find if I really wanted to learn Chinese. After my experiences with the other learning systems I was not sure I wanted to continue. I'm now starting the third CD and I am confident I will spend the money for the next level of instruction. Every day I learn more and retain probably 80% of what was covered in each lesson. Due to the confidence the Pimsleur method gives I know that mastery of Mandarin Chinese is attainable. I have a friend at work who is a native speaker and she tells me my accent is negligible. I could not think of a more promising recommendation then that."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I am a foreign language teacher and this was my first Pimsleur course and I was pleased with it. I started the course about 3 months before going to China. I found, in China, that people understood what I was saying. I had a Chinese phrase book in \\"pinyin\\" (Chinese method of Romanization)which really messed up my pronounciation. I stopped using it and dealt strictly with the tapes.The only drawback is that this was a beginning course for learning the complete language. It omitted a lot of necessary phrases, i.e., \\"Where is the restroom?\\" These I picked up in China.Be patient with youself. Work with the tape or CD for 15-20 minutes and stop. Work the same material again later until you have learned it...then move on. Otherwise, you will be overwhelmed."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"This is the first Pimsleur course I've used, and I wish I had discovered them sooner! I usually don't learn languages completely by ear, but it's proving to be a great way to learn Mandarin. I even find that I remember things my Chinese friends teach me so much easier since I am getting used to picking up new words without seeing them or writing a notecard on them! I've I am on Disc 3 so far and have had no problems remembering any of my lessons. Additionally, I think my pronunciation is coming very easily because I am not trying to translate Romanized characters into Chinese sounds."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I have completed the instant conversation series and purchased Pimsleur Mandarin I. The method works, although I had to run through the eight CDs three times before I felt comfortable with the language. Lessons 1 and 2 introduce about 30 vocabulary words. The subsequent lessons introduce about 10 new words each. Lessons 1 through 8 cover the to be infinitive as well as what, when, and where questions. Action verbs are also covered: to speak, to eat, to drink, to go, and to buy. In addition, intention expressions of going to, would like to, and wanting to are covered. Lessons 9 through 16 thoroughly cover telling time and counting in situations where money is exchanged. If you are serious about learning Mandarin, listening is okay, but having a teacher to explain the mechanics of producing the sound would be better. I found that the many \\"ch_w\\" and \\"sh_w\\" sounds in Mandarin were difficult to distinguish on the CDs. Consider, for example, the English words \\"shower\\" and \\"chowder\\". On the CDs, the words are spoken with varying emphasis by both a man and a woman, and that helps. However, consider getting help with pronunciation from a native speaker. Mandarin sentences and phases are requested in a random fashion, making it impossible to memorize a CD, unlike an eye chart. So playing a CD while driving is a good review. However, be sure to set aside one half hour per day per lesson in complete quiet to learn new material. After these 16 lessons you will be able to win friends and influence people, on the job or on vacation, with a few select phrases."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I will be leaving for Taiwan in a week and am thankful for this wonderful introduction to Mandarin. After purchasing the Instant Conversation, I used the large rebate to continue my study of Mandarin with Pimsleur's Mandarin I.I have been living with a Taiwanese family (in the US) for the last few months and they tell me that my understanding and pronounciation of the Mandarin I have learned thus far is beautiful. There are, of course, slight differences in pronunciation between the Beijing accent of the CD's and the Taiwanese accent, but it hasn't been problematic.Thanks Pimsleur!"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I like Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese) by Pimsleur. I was already using and enjoying Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel Chinese-Mandarin and getting great results. Pimsleur's method also works but is somewhat rigid and doesn't allow for as much creativity as Behind the Wheel Chinese. Unlike Behind the Wheel Chinese, I also note that with Pimsleur you must remain with the CD track until it ends so that the graduated interval recall system is not interrupted. This is not always possible for me.Still, I recommend you buy this course since it is very good, as long as you use it along with a more versatile alternativesuch as Behind the Wheel Chinese."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I found this at a book outlet for [cheap], and I bought them immediately because Pimsleur tapes have been recommended to me.Well, these are fantastic: You retain everything you hear, and it's actually very exciting. Before using these, I couldn't understand pronounciation at all but with them I am beginning to grasp it.I have tried Berlitz's living languages series and these tapes are a million times better. They're very effective and fun. I highly recommend them."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I give 5 stars to Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese) by Pimsleur.Pimsleur's method really works. If you really want results then buy and use this course.If you want even better results, then combine this wonderful course with another approach and method. I have found Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel Mandarinto be the ideal companion course to Instant Conversational Mandarin. The learning technique is also very good and you learn a lot of sentences and vocabulary with the course. I have gotten excellent results using both."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"My stars are for the program delivering what it claims to deliver -- instant conversational skills. In this aspect alone the program is superb. I followed the instructions (at most 1 lesson -- 30 minutes -- per day, no books) and found myself being understood by my Chinese colleagues by the end of the program. What did I learn to speak? Well there lied this collection's shortcomings. While it teaches you well, it doesn't teach you much. This perhaps can be expected since the package in its entirety includes 16 lessons or 8 hours. In the end I think I've learned some 50 Chinese words, whose combination allowed me to compose simple (as opposed to compound) sentences such as: \\"I am &lt;nationality>,\\" \\"I {want to/can/am going to} do &lt;something> [{or/and} something else] [at what time],\\" \\"I have &lt;something>,\\" \\"Where is &lt;location>?,\\" \\"How much is &lt;something>?,\\" \\"Who is &lt;someone>?,\\" \\"What did you mean?,\\" (In other words, variations of simple sentences making use of verbs shi4 (be), hui4 (can), xiang3 (want to), yao4 (need/must), you3 (have), zai4 (located), ke3 (may) in pinyin.)The program will doubtlessly get you started well, but you will have to fill in other rudimentary vocabulary from elsewhere. Though no direct comparison should be made, I once purchased a Spanish learning program of comparable length. The Spanish set included at least 10 times the words this set contains. As the Spanish program was not as effective (nor as leisurely-paced) as Pimsleur's program it was difficult to digest. However I could always play back the parts I missed."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I already have the Quick and Simple Mandarin Chinese by Pimsleur and really loved it but, even though the description says-'goes beyond the Quick and Simple...'The first 8 lessons (first half) is merely a repackaging of the 8 lessons in the Q + S.So, I cannot comment on the second half because I was so upset about being duped that I returned it!-ck"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I have been absolutely delighted with this cd set. I keep it in my car and just travellng to and from work each day get through at least one lesson. I had Chinese visitors recently and was able to communicate simple phrases that they understood. They told me that my pronunciation was very clear and understood everything I had learnt! Can't wait for the next Primsleur cd lessons!"},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"A lot of people gave this very high reviews so I was quite disappointed when I bought it. I am a translator/interpreter by profession (for some Western languages) and I teach languages so I know a lot about langauge learning. The advantage of the material is that they really drill in the information. They review everything again and again.The bad part is that really, you are covering a very small number of vocabular items and topics. You learn the basic greetings, asking some directions, counting and ordering in a restaurant. Chapter after chapter, you have the same dialogue that is built on. So really, all of the units are there to help you understand 3-4 sentences which are 5-6 sentences in length. They have this bizarre obsession with things like \\"Long Peace Street\\" etc. I would have preferred a wider range of topics and vocabulary.Also, the program seems pretty much devoid of cultural information. We have scenes of a man asking a woman to \\"go to her place\\" to eat lunch etc. All harmless but these things can be misconstrued in a Chinese cultural context. We also have a woman going to a restaurant alone with a man to drink beer. Or when the Chinese speaker tells the foreigner his Chinese is good, he says, \\"Thank you\\" - In some contexts, this can be considered boasting and people should know about the more humble \\"Nali Nali\\"-- I don't deserve your praise.I'm not saying the course is bad, I'm saying that I personally did not get a lot out of it. For the vocab items and topics you get, I think there are better options out there, like Colloquial Chinese by Kan Qian and others."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I found Pimsleur's Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversation) to be too rigid and presented far too little vocabulary for my taste.I have no complaints about the fact that there is no written material since I do all of my language learning in the car.I do not like the fact that there are no tracks. Switching tracks is essential to in-car language learning unless you like listeneing to the same segment three thousand times over every day.I like the Language Dynamics Behind the Wheel method more. The Chinese course doesn't have a book either but they have more vocabulary and multiple tracks and two native Mandarin speakers."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I learned Chinese Mandarin while in the Army about 5 years ago. Without practicing since that time, my language abilities suffered tremendously. I purchased the Pimsler set of CDs as a refresher course for myself. I was so impressed with the style of teaching. (I wish I had had these CDs when I was in school!) The CDs were exactly what I needed to get back in the groove of things. It gave me the oppertunity to get used to the pronunciation and tones again and actually even learned a few new words! I strongly recommend this set of CDs to anyone."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"I have tried the pimsluer courses (highest is Spanish II), but I've found that just using these quick & simple course are just about as good. Why? well, by then if you can see some of the words written down, you pick up how to say written words really fast (of course, for Chinese this would mean the phonetic pinyin, not the Chinese characters)By the end you will know the sounds, the intonations, and basic grammar, but you are still translating in your head, and have a very limited vocabulary. For me, translating everything after reaching this level (like the rest of the course does) just gets in my way of understanding. I suggest that after this short course, if you really want to continue, go find the FSI courses for you language to get you into fluency. The main weakness of these FSI courses is they don't teach pronunciation very well, but you already have this!A cheaper, but not as good or complete route, is to go over to unforgettablelanguages.com and get the courses for you language. These will seriously boost your vocabulary in a relitively short period of time. Sadly, for mandarin, there is only a survival course with no audio. However, there are no verbs, so I don't think you will know any of the words on it."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"As a foreign language instructor who knows the ropes (je connais les ficelles de mon metier) I too was quite disappointed with my experience with Pimsleur Instant Communication Chinese.Behind the Wheel Chinese taught more vocabulary and then taught me how to combine and compound it so that even a limited number of words gave me the ability to communicate greatly in Mandarin Chinese.I attribute the lion's share of what I now speak in Mandarin to Behind the Wheel Mandarin.I would highly recommend you try this course first and not later as I did. It could well be the only Mandarin CD course you will ever need.It is that good."},{"Title":"Chinese (Mandarin) (Instant Conversational Language (Mandarin Chinese))","review":"Product was as promised and the Pimsleur method works all right.

Much of this was requisitioned from the civilian population and certificates were issued payable in either continental or state funds, depending on the units supplied, upon presentation to court authorities. Thousands of these certificates issued to Virginians were duly entered by the courts, and they provide a fascinating insight into the period of the Revolution. These \\"Publick\\" Claims booklets contain interesting and useful information about the contributions of ordinary people to the Revolutionary War. They provide some details of people's service in the militia or as guards for prisoners of war; they indicate where some bodies of troops were at particular times; and they identify providers of horses, wagons, cattle, grain, or other supplies. Much of the information in these booklets cannot be found anywhere else, which makes the surviving records particularly valuable. Also remarkable is the fact that records survived from virtually every county in the state at that time with the exception of the newly formed Kentucky counties. This makes the collection even more valuable in covering areas which heretofore in this time period have suffered from a lack of personal data. The \\"Virginia Publick Claims\\" are published by counties. In addition to a faithful transcription by Janice Luck Abercrombie and the late Richard Slatten, a complete index is provided for each county booklet. This series is an extremely important genealogical tool for searchers in Revolutionary-era materials."},{"Title":"MCSD Visual C++ Distributed Applications Study Guide","review":"Glad I bought this book- I just finished using it for the exam, and expect I'll be referring back to it often.

Stacy Julian reminds us that scrapbooking is supposed to be fun, not stressful. She also tries to show us that the little moments are just as important to scrapbook as the annual birthday or holiday celebration. Stacy Julian fills the book with lots of inspiring layouts, ideas about everyday scrapbooking, and fun ways to help you tap into your creative self. There are also some good creative projects, great resources, and some unique tips for how to organize your pages and albums. The tag book is a nice little added bonus to help you explore your creative inspirations.If you have discovered the \\"Simple\\" way of scrapbooking you will like this book.

My friends have all read it, and we even signed up to take a class from Stacy Julian. Scrapbooking is my hobby, and this book provides a whole new approach that takes the stress out of getting behind. Stacy is truly innovative in her approach. I always knew it was about the memories, but chronological doesn't always work. Stacy gives great tips and ideas that make it seem so easy! I highly recommend this book. It is easy to read with the what, why, where format. You will want to read it several times. I looked at every page and skimmed the articles first, then I read it page by page. Awesome!!!"},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"Stacey Julian has created a wonderful, inspiring book for anyone who wants to preserve and remember special thoughts, events, people, foods, trends and more....

The book is colorful and informative with tons of great ideas to try. The best thing that I took away from this book was to RELAX and have fun with scrapbooking. Not to always feel like you are 'behind' with your stacks of photos. This book also has wonderful, practical organization techniques.I would call this book the 'bible' of scrapbooking!"},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"The book is nice, and reading it helped me realize what my scrapbooking style is.

It did neither for me. For me, scrapbooking has always been about preserving my memories. It also gives me a creative outlet. I thought her organizational system was interesting, but it would never work for me. I may not scrap in chronological order, but I'd like my layouts to at least flow in some sort of chronological order. I also thought her layouts in the book were horrible and completely uninspiring. For a few great scrapbook idea books, I would go with Jeanette Lynton's books, Cherish, Imagine, and Reflections."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"If I could give this book more than five stars, I would. Stacy Julian takes the \\"big picture\\" view and moves away from worrying about what color embossing ink to use on the page, and reminds readers that scrapbooking is, first and foremost, about capturing your family's memories. In her wonderfully warm style, she leads you through design, inspiration, organization, and more.

It was a wonderfully freeing feeling to have different books be about a subject not-just each year in order. I am inspired again - and I am starting with an \\"All about me\\" theme. Stacy's layout style is strong and I also enjoyed those, but much more important is the message."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"if you are just beginning scrapbooking, haven't done it in a while and want to pick it back up, or love scrapbooking and do it all the time! I haven't done it in a while and wanted to pick it back up--but I needed a new way of going about it. Stacy shares her non-chronological method that takes away all the guilt and makes it fun again. This book has so many fun projects and ideas that I can see me completing. Normally I love the books and think the ideas are great but they don't fit what I want to accomplish or can't see myself completing. This one is so different. And because of this book I signed up for an online class at Stacy's online company, Big Picture Scrapbooking.

Since I got this book, I have not been able to put it down. It is absolutely one of THE BEST reference books I've ever owned. It is not so much the great layouts that it has but, more importantly, it gives reason to why we scrap, the meaning behind the passion for our art, and the creative energy that it inspires in me is refreshing. I no longer feel pressured for being so \\"behind\\" in my books and now I have completely reorganized my pictures and albums because of this new approach to my projects. It is so much easier and guilt-free now to scrap and I am lovin' it! Regardless if you are a beginner or avid scrapper, if you LOVE to scrapbook, you MUST buy this book. And, if it is the only book on the subject you will ever own, it should be this one."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"This is not a scrapbook idea book. It is all about revisiting why we scrapbook and how to be more efficient at recording our memories and doing it in a more meaningful way. It basically encourages you to pretend you are someone from your family decades in the future (or even your own children as adults) and to put yourself in their shoes. What will they hope that you put in your scrapbooks? Do they want you to have the latest paper and embellishments? Do they want you to use the latest challenging technique? Do they want you to fill your page with embellishments and crafty details? Likely, they would like to see photos of you and your loved ones, and hear about your personal take on your memories. That is where it takes the guilt away. It encourages scrapping photos & memories that are important to you NOT scrapping every photo you take and in chronological order. The suggestions for additional albums are meant as options that are quick, easy & attractive ways to display additional photos/memories. More ideas to add to your brain can always be overwhelming but it is presented as an alternative to the standard in the scrapbook industry which is beautifully embellished pages using the latest papers and embellishments with complicated techniques and supplies all done in chronological order never missing a photo. This is the book for the lay person, the non-obsessed, non-technique driven, non-fadish scrapper. It just gives an option to those people who feel overwhelmed by everything that I mentioned above. Just another way, not the only way, to scrapbook and preserve memories. It is right up my alley and I appreciated it very much. It is fresh, updated and easy to read."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"I have been scrapping my college pictures chronologically.

But, it wasn't next in the pile so I've been putting it off. Needless to say, after reading Stacy's book, I scrapped that picture bringing out bittersweet memories of the times I spent there. While I'll eventually finish scrapping the pictures I \\"skipped\\", I won't feel guilty for missing a few."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"This book makes you rethink your whole scrapbooking process. If you want to scrap those pics you just got from Costco instead of doing the ones that have been sitting on your craft table for a month-DO IT! Break the rules that you thought were important, or that they ever were rules."},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"Oh my goodness! This book is fantastic! It's time we move away from the Creative Memories philosophy and move towards a creative approach to scrapbooking. Not only does Stacy Julian introduce a new reason to scrapbook but I love her samples in the book. I loved that not all the pictures of herself make her look perfectly made up - how long have I been afraid to scrapbook less than perfect pictures of me? Seriously! I'm rarely photo-ready so why not scrapbook life as it really is. And life is certainly more than the each big holiday to Disneyland, or Christmas pageants. I have felt a lot more freedom to scrapbook whatever I feel and find pictures to match my story. Buy this book! You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Big Picture...scrapbooking Your Life And More","review":"I would give this more stars if I could! This book is teriffic! I have had and/or read COUNTLESS books on scrapbooking, and this is one of my two favorites! Stacy's method of scrapbooking is NOT about products or the latest trends or styles; it's about getting your photos and memories in albums. Her pages are simple and to the point -- YOU can embellish as much as you like. I don't care how many albums she has, as one reviewer criticized! She is just trying to help people NOT to feel overwhelmed with photos and scrapbooking. I wish that people would just NOT write reviews if a book is \\"not what [they] expected\\". If they feel 'deceived' by a book review or title, then I can understand it. I am so NOT like Stacy Julian, but I would like to be 1/2 that happy with life! She is so inspiring! Scrapbooking helps me appreciate my children -- see them in a different light -- in the midst of the chaos of raising them!! I love to browse through this book -- getting page ideas or just inspiration. It also has influenced how I take pictures, or should I say WHAT I take pictures OF! I highly recommend this book as well as Rebecca Sower's book \\"Scrapbooking Life's Little Treasures\\". If I only had these two books, I'd be happy. Their messages about scrapbooking and family are very powerful!"},{"Title":"Christmas Is Together-Time","review":"Re-published from the 1964 edition, CHRISTMAS IS TOGETHER-TIME is the Christmas book of the \\"Peanuts: Happiness Is...\\" series.

The whole thing (some 300 pages in my edition) reads like a set-up for something substantial, a story in which the characters here engaged- an actress named Julia; her actor-manager husband Michael; their accountant Tom; their son Roger; and a small cast of lesser (and entirely one-dimensional) figures, down to and including a caricature Cockney maid- have something of import or significance to do, say to one another, or perhaps think. The closest we get, alas, is a brief period of introspection on Julia's part, prompted by an out-of-left-field observation from son Roger, in which she considers that it is possible that her life does not merely center around her acting, but has in fact itself *become* acting. And there we are.If there were any particular consequences to or results from the heroine's several romantic intrigues (which substitute for a plot); if there were more about acting as such, or about the theater world of London between the wars; if the dialogue were wittily engaging, or if the narration were somehow less pedestrian (one's finger never once itches for the highlighter)--if any of this were the case, one could see why &quot;Theatre&quot; deserved a place, if perhaps a marginal one, in Maugham's much-praised oeuvre. But they aren't, so the question hangs fire: if that sizable body of work (including 20 novels) inspires blurbs like the one on the back of my Russian-reprint (with typos aplenty) edition-\\"Maugham's keen and observant eye, subtle irony and brilliant style made his books extremely popular all over the world.\\"-how did &quot;Theatre&quot; find its way into the mix? Cheez Whiz, talk about irony! It's hard to imagine a better summary-- keen observations, subtlety, irony and brilliance-of the elements *missing* from &quot;Theatre.&quot;Granted, there are some diverting moments here and there, and just enough competent storytelling to keep the reader from tossing &quot;Theatre&quot; aside after a hundred pages. But at its best the novel still leaves one suspecting, as developments so adamantly refuse to take place and significance successfully escapes at every turn, that one has somehow picked up an Agatha Christie novel which never gets to the murder.Put otherwise, there is probably a good short story in here dying to get out. And that, in effect, may already have happened-only the short story has emerged as a screenplay. A movie based on &quot;Theatre&quot;, called &quot;Being Julia&quot; and starring Annette Benning, is apparently scheduled for release in 2004. While I'm not racing to reserve tickets for opening night, I can see how Hollywood might feel that a nicely filmable star vehicle/character study might come out of this novel- and indeed, might have a much better chance for success in its genre than the original did on the printed page."},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"\\"Theater\\" is my favorite W. Somerset Maugham's book. I have read it many times and remember it very vividly.\\"Theater\\" is the story of Julia Lambert, the best and deservingly famous stage actress in England. On stage she is a true master of her craft, she is great in playing every possible human feeling and emotion. Off stage, however, she is not very happy with her handsome but not too bright husband; she does not have close relationship with her teenager son. At first, amused and touched by the adoration of a young fan, she eventually falls madly in love and lives through the real feelings and emotions that she was so great in playing on stage. How she deals with love, jealousy, anger, loneliness, aging - that's what \\"Theater\\" is about. She was able to take her revenge and punish her unfaithful lover, not only as a woman but what is more important, as an artist, and that was absolutely brilliant. Masterfully told story with delightful main character - talented, witty, charming, and very clever, \\"Theater\\" is an enjoyable, insightful, and honest portrait of a woman and an artist.4.5/5"},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"Middle-aged woman, a star of the London theatre, beautiful, fulfilled.

What makes it so different from other million love stories? THe talant of it's writer and the truly wonderful finale. Maugham was able to turn the whole thing upside down.

Here they are in case anyone else finds them useful; feel free to use:1. Why do you think Julia has an affair with Tom - he's a \\"snob\\" and \\"dull\\" and half her age. Do you think her reasons for continuing the affair are the same as the ones she had for starting it? Do you think it's accurate to describe Tom as an addiction of Julia's? Why or why not?2. Tom and Julia are clearly using each other, but who is using the other more? Do you think Julia is even aware she is using Tom?3. What do you think is the purpose or role of Charles Tamerley's character? Is there anyone Julia can truly be herself around?4. Julia is self-centered, a perpetual liar, and manipulative. Yet I don't think the author intends for us to hate her. Do you agree? Why or why not?5. What scenes in the book struck you as the most important? most memorable?6. How would you describe Maugham's writing style in Theatre? What did you like most/least about it?7. \\"Roger says we don't exist. Why, it's only we who do exist. They are the shadows and we give them substance. We are the symbols of all this confused, aimless struggling that they call life, and it's only the symbol which is real.

To what extent do you think Julia has grown or changed by the end of the story? What do you think was Maugham's purpose in writing this book?8. Are there any lingering questions you have about Theatre? Like plot holes or anything that didn't seem to add up or make sense?"},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"This is the best novel ever written about those beguiling creatures called actresses. The central character is Julia Lambert, England's greatest actress, and at times a lying, manipulative bitch. Men who have been made miserable by such women will be disgusted by the novel unless they are able to maintain objective distance and laugh at this woman's scheming as she attempts to carry on a hopeless affair with a boy half her age.Maugham has a remarkable ability to write compelling scenes that avoid melodrama and predictability. His years as a comic playwright served him well as a story teller. I find him one of the easiest to read of great (or near great) fiction writers. He keeps you turning the pages and avoids longeurs.Maugham's view of human nature is tawdry -- some might say filthy. He believed a a perfectly respectable woman was capable of an episode of cheap sex in a sleeping car on a train. He certainly shows no Victorian sentimentality about the fairer sex.I won't give away the ending, but it is the oddest scene in the novel. The ending is original to the point of peculiarity. Maugham believes the artist is the only truly free person because he can use his pain to create art. I don't think being an artist helped Maugham find happiness at the end of his own long life."},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"I read this novel years ago and had almost forgotten about it. I had certainly forgotten how vivid and distinct the characters are. Maugham is one of my favorite writers; as one of his short story characters said, I have a weakness for a story with a beginning, a middle and an end. This story has all three and a very satifying end at that."},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"Julia Lambert is an ageing star of the London stage. She stands at the summit of her art and reputation, but there is no substitute for youth and the elation that the attentions of a younger man can provide, especially since her husband Michael's principal preoccupation is with safeguarding her career. In Theatre, Maugham follows a similar plot line as in Of Human Bondage and The Painted Veil: the heroine (hero) falls in love with someone who only exploits and doesn't deserve her (him), with disastrous results until... (all right, I won't say until what).Yet just because the topic isn't entirely new does not mean it isn't the occasion for the same trepidation and anguished, page-turning scenes. And Maugham knows his subject. He was a playwright. His novel is a realistic picture of the early 20th-century thespian milieu. In fact, it dispels many of the commonplaces about stage artists. Rather than irresponsible, capricious creatures, they are shown as hard-working and devoted, and production as a business where cost and income calculations often override considerations of art. At the same time, Maugham shows how expectations that they should lead a Bohemian life can affect even the most responsible and faithful actors.Theatre is realistically written, fun, and interesting. If this is the first Maugham you are reading, I would choose Of Human Bondage; but if you have already done that, this is well worth adding to your library."},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"I was inspired to read it again by the movie Being Julia.

Somerset Maugham, was complex, thought provoking, unpredictable and totally entertaining. It's my favorite Maugham book."},{"Title":"Theatre","review":"Julia Lambert is a gifted stage actress, the most renowned in London. Her immense talent has made her the toast of the theater world and a major celebrity. Her personal relations are another thing altogether. In Julia ,Maugham has created the ultimate narcissistic personality. She is so taken with own effect on people via her acting abilities that she cannot help but to use those skills off the stage as well to manipulate just about everyone she comes into contact with. The writing is pure Maugham and for fans of his work, this lesser known novel delivers. Julia and her theater manager husband are realistically portrayed as they progress in their careers and age together. Maugham was intimately involved in the London theater world and he is on obviously familiar territory so the writing and characterizations ring true throughout.A very fine novel by one of my favorite writers and highly recommended."},{"Title":"First blood;: The story of Fort Sumter","review":"Swanberg takes us back to the days surrounding the firing on Fort Sumter and the initiation of the American Civil War. Swanberg details how this event unfolded, the politics behind it, the personalities involved, and the strategy underlying the attack. The book is very readable, but is not the most scholarly treatment on Sumter out there. The author does a great job of illustrating the mindset of those involved at the fort and in the nation's capital. We see the fact that the attack did little from a strategic standpoint because the forces would have been starved out if they had not been fired upon. We also see that Col. Anderson was torn between his southern background and sense of honor to the Union. We see how Lincoln was placed in a bad spot by Buchanan. What we do not see is minutia surrounding the attack or how it was reported across the states, but I am not sure this was needed. All in all, a good treatment. The only knock might be finding it as it is very old."},{"Title":"First blood;: The story of Fort Sumter","review":"A very good book.

Well written and well-read by the narrator. If you like reading history, this won't disappoint. If you're not a history reader, on the other hand, you should probably pass this by."},{"Title":"First blood;: The story of Fort Sumter","review":"This book deserves much more attention than it has received.By focusing on the shaky Union presence at Fort Sumter along the South Carolina coast, the gifted author W.A. Swanberg offers readers an enjoyable and at times even somewhat humorous exploration of the much larger events and issues confronting America during the secession winter of 1860-61.His take on President James Buchanan is certainly fair, while his protrayal of Robert Anderson, the very unfortunate commander of the Union forces at Sumter is sympathetic. In fact, he really only obviously hammers one person, and that is the Secretary of War John Floyd, a disastrous presence in Buchanan's cabinet who openly advocated secession.For anyone wanting to understand the military origins of the Civil War in a nicely concise book, I would recommend \\"First Blood.\\""},{"Title":"First blood;: The story of Fort Sumter","review":"Very enjoyable traditional history of"},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself e-Travel Today","review":"This book is the most useful, well-written, easy-to-read book of its type I have ever read.

A few years ago we were reading books the size of telephone directories which contained URLs (the addresses of web pages) for the entire Web. Lately a new breed of books has sprouted, which cover one and only one subject in great depth. The difficult part about writing (and reading) many of these books is that the author needs to be a specialist in two fields: not only his own area of expertise, but also his subject in relation to the variegated resources on the Net. Fortunately, Mark Orwoll is a skilled guide in both these realms, and his new book, e-TRAVEL, is as useful and convenient as a credit card. Sams Teach Yourself Today e-Travel: Planning Vacations, Finding Bargains, And Booking Reservations Online is divided into five parts. The first, &quot;Getting Started in e-Travel&quot; is a guided tour of various resources about the Internet, including a savvy section on the essential theme: &quot;Evaluating a Web Site's Accuracy and Validity.&quot; Part II, &quot;Planning a Vacation on the Internet&quot;, includes a nifty quiz: &quot;What's Your e-Travel type?&quot; Part III explains how to be your own travel agent, and how to use the Internet to find the lowest rates and fares. Part IV discusses your laptop computer, passports, visas, customs, digital photography, organizing your money, and keeping yourself safe. Lastly, you'll find a collection of practical travel-minded websites. Keep in mind, regarding everything related to the Web, that things change quickly. Recently a number of major airlines announced that they would create a super-website for travelers. I couldn't find this site mentioned in the book, but readers who are interested in news like this can keep updated at Orwoll's daily travel advice column. There's an enormous amount of essential information throughout this entertaining guide. Orwoll, the managing editor for &quot;Travel and Leisure Magazine&quot;, has been there, done that, and shared the best of his inside tips. And it's all served up in a witty style: Orwoll is as pleasant a traveling companion as you'll encounter anywhere.

Its extent, power, and impact increase year by year. In several parts of the world the distinction between organised criminals and the state means almost nothing. There is also an intimate connection between organised criminality on the one hand and both state intelligence services and terrorist organisations on the other. What is seldom realised is how new this is. The criminal gang is probably as old as civilisation but before the twentieth century that was as far as criminal organisation went. Now it has moved up several levels and crime is now organised as a business, on a transnational scale. It has, to adapt Peter Drucker, been &quot;institutionalised&quot;. This book explains why this has happened. It is because of a change in the incentives facing criminals. To simplify the argument, historically the transactions costs of ensuring and enforcing cooperation among criminals have been too high to make it worthwhile. Criminals have also faced the problem that the short term incentive to betray their fellows has trumped the longer term incentive to cooperate with other criminals. This has been changed by a number of factors - communications and transport technology being significant - but as the book shows by far the most significant is government policy. Specifically, the policy of prohibiting the sale and manufacture of a number of &quot;products&quot; for which there is high demand such as arms, pornography, prostitution, gambling, and, above all, drugs. This changes the incentives and makes the pay off for cooperating so great that organised crime is the inevitable outcome. The essays make other points as well, notably the close similarities between organised criminal groups and governments/ruling classes (as St Augustine said, &quot;All governments are in origin bands of robbers&quot;). Some of the essays are quite technical and would be most useful to someone with an economics background but there is enough to make this book very informative for the layman as well. Truly an eye-opener. Now why do I think no one in Congress has read this book?"},{"Title":"The Economics of Organised Crime","review":"I first encountered this book in a class called -- wait for it ---the Economics of Organized crime. I was fascinated. The book explains the workings of the Sicilian and New York Mafia as well as Asian Tongs and the drug trade. The chapter by Gambetta is especially interesting. The book does get a bit technical in places with formulas and such, but one can skip over that for the more general view of how organized crime and government are similar in their operations. This work gave me a lot of insight into the role that crime plays in our social and economic structures. This is also a nice introduction to Transaction Cost Economics, which is rather new in the field of Econ. I would only add that some background in Macroeconomics is useful for a fuller understanding of the book."},{"Title":"The Economics of Organised Crime","review":"As an undegraduate student, it was useful to use approach presented by Florentini and Peltzman, since they use economical techniques to explain this phaenomenon.

This is a piece of pure entertainment, full of memories and anecdotes that can brighten up a hundred dinner tables over the years. Hoveyda was a founder of France's snootiest film review, the Cahiers du Cinema, but writes with the ease and wit of a free spirit. While recalling his friendship with many of the innovative film-makers of the last century, Hoveyda also debunks some of the myths about the New Wave and independent cinema. A READER IN LONDON"},{"Title":"The Hidden Meaning of Mass Communications: Cinema, Books, and Television in the Age of Computers","review":"With the &quot;Hidden Meaning of Mass Communications,&quot; Exiled Iranian diplomat-writer Fereydoun Hoveyda has come out with a refreshing and most enticing undertaking on the Cinema and other stirring subjects affecting contemporary society. Hoveyda is a former contributor and renowned critic of the Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma, a French magazine that has highly influenced contemporary cinematic theory and technique. According to Hoveyda who has always refused to be a censor, &quot;criticism can achieve responsible objectives by shifting in time, by taking place not at the beginning but towards the end of a film's run. It is not a matter of predetermining the viewer's choice, but of engaging in a dialogue with him about the work he has seen.&quot;In this new book, Hoveyda's many delightful anecdotes, observations and memories are enticing, and remarkably his revealing relationship between film and dreams are new and very stimulating ideas. Do you know that when you sleep, you become a cinematographer, directing and inventing your mental images? Thus, it could be that exiled Hoveyda presently lives in one land but may well dream in another! That's a wonderful idea and there are many more in the book. For example, &quot;light&quot; being a character in a film! The last chapter too is of high interest for it deals on how the computer age has changed film, art, literature and our entire way of life. We are no longer in the age of the Cahiers du Cin&eacute;ma. Much research went into this very personal and useful work, surely with the advent of wonderful new techniques it may well turn into an e-book made available to all, with all the amazing photographs included.Guy Revol Paris - October 17, 2000"},{"Title":"The Hidden Meaning of Mass Communications: Cinema, Books, and Television in the Age of Computers","review":"This is a charming collection of a lifetime of thoughts about cinema, literature and TV by one of the founders of the famous Cahier de Cinema. Hoveyda was a film critic for years, and tells personal anecdotes about Truffaut, Godard, Rosselini, etc.Some of the more whimsical thoughts are: cinema did not follow literature! It actually came before books, in the form of dreams in which we use cinematic techniques.And Sheherezade, in 1001 Nights, provided the \\"late show\\" (minus the TV set) for her insomniac husband, who had no opportunity to dream."},{"Title":"Taller Women: A Cautionary Tale","review":"I read this crazy little book in two days. i just couldn't put it down. Naumoff is a great southern writer to get into. His characters, especially in this book, are so clear you can picture them well in your mind as you read through the story. More than once, my jaw dropped at some of the things these characters said or did. I've never experienced a character like Ronnie in anything I've read and doubt I will again. I won't give away any details but I will say this, if this were ever made into a film, I could see Kevin Spacey playing the character of Monroe. Read this book to see what I mean."},{"Title":"Taller Women: A Cautionary Tale","review":"This is a provocative, disturbing and hilarious book by a master of dialogue. Naumoff is not read as much as he should be."},{"Title":"Taller Women: A Cautionary Tale","review":"Occasionally a novel comes along that swallows you whole, making you sigh with pleasure, think deep thoughts, and blink with a delighted astonishment. Taller Women is just such a novel. Following hot on the heels of Naumoff's previous novel, Rootie Kazootie, it continues the theme of wise women, filled with hope and sadness, and near-silent men afraid of the truth in their hearts and the questions from their lovers.In manic Lydia and whimsical Monroe, Naumoff portrays a tangled relationship that steers off the road into emotional territory for which neither has prepared. Like the shifting plates beneath the earth's surface, they bump and grind, facing mutual confusion and a hope for something better around the corner. With off-beat humour and genuine insight, Naumoff recognises the sad, funny, scary and absurd battles that occur between the sexes.Marvellous."},{"Title":"Who Was Who in British India","review":"While this highly detailed volume is valuable for its scope--some 5,000 entries--I found that the arrogance of the author crept into so many entries that the book is more misleading than informative.

Pity Riddick coiuld not have just given us the information on these personalities without the tawdry editorializing."},{"Title":"Who Was Who in British India","review":"This was the most comprehensive collection on British India that I have encountered.

Not only is this balderdash, his offering is the weakest Goebbels biography in recent memory. The writing style is extremely pedantic, plodding, slow-as-molasses and tedious. Goebbels was an extremely complex, brilliant, devious man, but you'll not encounter much of him here. Reuth inexplicably chooses not to use the copious 1920's Goebbels diaries, which David Irving included in his infinitely superior biography of &quot;the little dwarf.&quot;This book is heavily weighted towards Goebbels role in WWII Berlin, which is curiously among the least-interesting periods of his life. Utterly glossed over are the most engrossing years of the &quot;Kampfzeit&quot; in the 20's, where Goebbels was a discipline of Gregor Strasser and then only came under Hitler's spell once he met him. Then it was no turning back. There is shockingly little interest displayed here in Goebbels' fascinating private life. Magda, his wife, is scarcely mentioned, nor is Lida Baarova, the Czech actress that Goebbels fell in love with in 1938.A chilly, disappointing read. Not recommended."},{"Title":"Goebbels","review":"It is quite clear that the author has devoted years ofresearch to his subject, and that he has reconstructed the life ofthis enigmatic little man who churned the propaganda machine of Nazi Germany for nearly two decades largely through the examination of contemporary newspaper accounts. Mr. Reuth manages to convey to his reader the sense that Joseph Goebbels was a man driven to his demons by an unrelenting inferiority complex stemming from his physical ailments, his economic station in life, and his heartless rejection by classmates and childhood peers early in life. However, we do not hear much more about his family and youthful associates after the opening chapters. Goebbels private life (which is what the reader expects from a well-crafted biography) is subordinated by a minute by minute account of the rise and fall of National Socialism. Mr. Reuth's history of the Third Reich is interesting and highly readable, and he avoids the natural inclination to editorialize about his subject matter."},{"Title":"Goebbels","review":"This is not a light and fluffy biography. Reuth has put an amazing amount of scholastic work into reconstructing the life of Goebbels.

I believe this bio shows his gradual arrival,(though at times considerable leaps),at the circus freak he became.The book traces his career from Catholic altar boy to high religious priest fanatic of the Hitler regime.At times he seems to out-Nazi his own Nazis in an attempt to maybe convince himself through his fanaticism? A favorite phrase I borrowed from one of Goebbels critics quoted in the book,\\"small town rabble rouser\\".A guy on a stump box shouting much like a religious fanatic.No one would dare shout back at him because by 1923 Goebbels had the backing of the SA thugs.So early on he's a \\"kid in a candy shop\\". Free limousine,mansion,love affairs,the works.Anyone who disagrees or even questions him gets paid a late night visit by a Nazi goon squad.A lack of opposition not exactly conducive to intellectual growth.So early on Joe's body and mind are both stunted.(He does stay thin however,very thin).We've heard it all before.His squabbles for power involving other Nazi hirarchy are covered well in the book.Goebbels particularly goes after the Nazi party intellectual Alfred Rosenberg,calling Rosenberg's book,an \\"intellectual hiccup\\".Squabbles with Goering,Bormann,and everybody else lead to the conclusion he was not prejudiced but\\"hated everyone including himself equally\\"!If you want to read a good book on the\\"spiteful dwarf\\" this is definitely one of the better.By the way Goebbels in the book tries to project the image of himself as the correct and master\\"patron of the arts\\".In fact according to the author with Dr. Joe's book burnings and destruction of paintings,he outdoes the worst of the medieval religious fanatics.Yikes!!"},{"Title":"Goebbels","review":"This book was originally written in German and I think the English version is a very good one.

It is fantastic text and highly informative. That said, a few cautionary notes:This book has diminishing returns. I read the whole thing, but the book is rather formulaic. Spend more time on the Introduction than anything else. Without it you'll be lost.Also I have little familiarity with the authors White discusses. With the ones I did know, Nietszche, Hegel, and Tocqueville, I found his commentary very interesting. But some familiarity with each author addressed would be worthwhile to enjoy it fully.Hope it was useful. Whether or not you buy his argument, the work is definitely a modern classic."},{"Title":"Metahistory: The historical imagination in nineteenth-century Europe","review":"Hayden White's Metahistory takes the reader deeply into the winding roads of history writing. From Hegel to Croce, he reviews and analizes the many different ways history was written in the nineteenth century and it's impact and influence in today's historiography. A must for any historian, but a little too deep - and perhaps boring- for those not familiar with history's theory and philosophy."},{"Title":"Metahistory: The historical imagination in nineteenth-century Europe","review":"Hayden White (born 1928) is professor emeritus at the University of California, Santa Cruz, having recently retired from the position of Professor of comparative literature at Stanford University. He has also writtenThe Content of the Form: Narrative Discourse and Historical Representation,Figural Realism: Studies in the Mimesis Effect, etc.He wrote in the Preface to this 1973 book, \\"I treat the historical work as what it most manifestly is: a verbal structure in the form of a narrative prose discourse... as an icon of sets of events presumed to have occurred in times past. In addition... they contain a deep structural content which is generally poetic, and specifically linguistic... which serves as the precritically accepted paradigm of what a distinctively 'historical' explanation should be... One of my principal aims... has been to establish the uniquely POETIC elements in historiography and philosophy of history... Thus I have postulated four principal modes of historical consciousness... Metaphor, Synecdoche, Metonymy, and Irony... I contend that the recognized masters of nineteenth-century historical thinking can be understood... by the explanation of the different tropological modes which underlie and inform their work.\\" (Pg. ix-xi)He explains, \\"My method, in short, is formalist. I will not try to decide whether a given historian's work is a better, or more correct, account of a specific set of events or segment of the historical process than some other historian's account of them. Rather, I will seek to identify the structural components of those accounts.\\" (Pg. 3-4)The philosphers/historians he examines are Hegel, Michelet, Ranke, Tocqueville, Burckhardt, Marx, Nietzsche, and Croce.He observes, \\"Thus, inThe Birth of Tragedy (Dover Thrift Editions), Nietzsche opposed two kinds of false Tragic sensibility: that which interprets the Tragic vision in the Ironic mode, and that which interprets it in the Romantic mode. His demolition of these two false conceptions of Tragic consciousness provided him with the means of reinterpreting Tragedy as a COMBINATION of Dionysiac and Apollonian insights, as Tragic apprehensions of the world being discharged in Comic comprehensions of it---AND the reverse.\\" (Pg. 334) He adds, \\"Nietzsche's purpose as a philosopher of history was to destroy the notion that the historical process has to be explained or emplotted in any particular way.\\" (Pg. 371)He says, \\"Croce's critics failed to register adequately the qualification he had placed on philosophy's capacity to know reality and history's power to represent it truthfully. At the conclusion of hisTheory & History Of Historiography, Croce denied that men could judge with any certitude the nature of their own age.\\" (Pg. 398)White's book will be of interest to students of the philosophy of history in the modern age."},{"Title":"Metahistory: The historical imagination in nineteenth-century Europe","review":"Hayden White's METAHISTORY is a sophisticated analysis of historical methodology in the nineteenth century.Without a doubt, the book is brilliant. White analyzes the poetic and linguistic structure behind the writings of historians and philosophers of history. He focuses on the works of Michelet, Ranke, Toqueville, Burckhardt, Hegel, Marx, Nietzsche, and Croce. The result is a compelling look at how the methodological structure of historical writing changed through the course of the nineteenth century.However, there is a major drawback to the work. White frequently uses a number of poetic and linguistic terms that are not standard fare for the average reader. For example, unfamiliar terms such as Metonymy, Synecdoche, Metaphor, Organicist, and Contextualist are used to describe the methodology behind various historical works. I frequently found myself lost and flipping back pages to find the definition of a particular term. This was an un-needed difficulty; the terms only served to obscure White's otherwise clear and logical arguments.In conclusion, this highly sophisticated work is a brilliant piece of historical analysis. However, it would have been much more readable without the difficult language."},{"Title":"Metahistory: The historical imagination in nineteenth-century Europe","review":"This book is great in its own way: highly readable for readers of all ages, immensely rich in details, and gives some new perspectives into history.But the main idea of the book struck me as an attack on Empiricism raised by Leopold Ranke and popularized by Lord Acton(as the title suggests \\"in nineteenth-century Europe\\", both Ranke and Acton were of that period), rather than a totally new approach to the study of history. I could be wrong on this point, since I read this book immediately after finishing reading Lord Acton's lectures and Ranke's works.In a nutshell, this is a book that sets you think-maybe not easy for beginners on the first try, but it would be a very rewarding experience to read a book from such a thinker."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"I read this book the first time in 1979 when it was published. I had never read anything like it. The young characters were all from my generation, did the things I did, and took the risks I took. I was very moved by this book. The prose evoked the rather disoriented late 1970s perfectly.I went back and read &quot;Black Tickets&quot; again last summer and was pleasantly surprised to discover how evocative the book still is and how moving the language is. This book is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"These are staggeringly assured pieces and, as wonderful as her subsequent work has been, in some ways I don't think she's been able to top them. Marred only by an occasional tendency to use shocking subject matter for its own sake, these stories are punch-drunk on the precision and lush beauty of their own language. I don't think there is anyone currently writing in English whose prose is this gorgeous, or this gorgeously controlled. For me, she's like a female equivalent of Michael Ondaatje. Language to get lost in, but that never loses sight of the very human characters who use it, or whom it concerns."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"I first read Black Tickets nearly 20 years ago and for me, as a young writer, stories such as \\"Gemcrack\\" bordered on revelatory. I don't think I'd ever before encountered a style quite like the one I saw there--heightened prose but with considerably more polish than other practitioners of heightened prose--say Jack Kerouac or Henry Miller--had managed to pull off. I was not surprised to discover that Jayne Anne began as a poet since it was the language of Black Tickets that attracted me first and foremostIn addition to the exquisitely crafted sentences, Phillips performs a rare feat: She not only writes in several distinct styles, she has mastered them all. Most stylists--authors known for their lyrical power--have a single signature way of writing. Phillips, however, displays an impressive command of vernacular, heightened prose, naturalism, and maybe one or two varieties of writing that fall somewhere in between.While I have new admiration for stories such as \\"Gemcrack,\\" I was nearly flattened by \\"El Paso.\\" The imagery, the lyricism tempered by vernacular, the rhythm--as palpable as handholds in a rock face--the dialogue, and the vortical ending (forgive the neologism, but I can't think of anything else that fits) fuse seamlessly. Here's an exemplary sentence: \\"The light rolling now, leaked into the dark, ripples the skin of the dark and flies fly up in loose knots; low slow buzz in corners yellowed and pulled out by the light that rolls across the surfaces of things in yellow blocks.\\" The reader sees the light as almost solid, the dark filling corners, sees the knotty flight patterns of flies, hears their lethargic buzz, and consequently feels the dusty melancholy and intimated squalor of this room.Perhaps the most stunning verbal performance in \\"El Paso\\" belongs to Rita, who says \\"Them stars are just holes in the sky after all. And while I'm sleeping in that hot bed, everything I ever thought of having falls into em.\\" In two sentences we experience most of the despair that so often accompanies existence, a despair that Hemingway, with the sharpness of an unexpected blow, staggered us with in \\"A Clean, Well-Lighted Place.\\" Another admirable aspect of this sentence is the way it inverts the trite use of stars as symbols of beauty, so that we have a visceral experience of the futility that is like a bed of ash Rita has slept on her whole life. A brief confessional from Rita's boyfriend, Dude, is also illuminating: \\"By noon those days I was a walking fever ... and since I first saw her I come into the heat the place the heat like a bitch dog and lived with it.\\" As in Rita's quote, the off grammar makes the writing more specific (to both to character and place), more intimate, less bookish, more real. The deliberate omission of commas makes Dude's words more urgent and brings the reader closer to Dude's inner turmoil--we're just about in his guts. The repetition of \\"heat\\" works toward the same effect but also marks the metamorphosis from weatherly heat to body heat--all buildup for Dude's declaration of resignation: \\"and [I] lived with it.\\" The lines in this story, in their compactness, in the way their small openings admit the reader to much larger interiors, in their vividness, tend to have more in common with poetry, which heightens the dramatic intensity of the story.Like Tillie Olsen's Tell Me a Riddle, Black Tickets was a classic the same year it was published, a book that in and of itself is certain to guarantee Phillips's place as one America's most distinguished writers."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"I bought this for a Creative Writing seminar on story cycles. I didn't understand how this piece was a story cycle, nor did I connect on any level to anything in the book - which made it a boring read."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"i was excited to read this book. the enthusiatic reviews by so many upstanding authors made me feel i was about to embark on a journey into something forceful &amp; important. instead, i found myself barely submerged in a lot of jibberish and unfocused monologues.there were 1 or 2 compelling stories in the book, but for the most part- i could have cared less. there wasn't anything about most of the characters that made me want to enter their worlds- i kept reading, hoping to find whatever it was the critics were raving about.needless to say, i never found it."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"This book hasn't aged well. There is very little plot, very little dialogue, and very few verbs. (Seriously, there are stretches of five or six \\"sentences\\" in a row with nary a verb to be seen.) There are some beautiful gems compacted into the dense prose, but for the most part Phillips crafted chewy, chunky, unwieldy sentences that don't give much pay-off for all the work you've done to decipher them. I have a Masters in literature, I have read and understood Ulysses, but I had to give up on many of the incomprehensible lines here. \\"I suck you up like erasers\\"? What?The subject matter has aged poorly, too. In 2006, I'm neither shocked nor intrigued by Phillips's thinly veiled alter-ego's confrontation with her mother over birth control.I can see why reviewers at the time were struck by the promise and poetry of her work; the story \\"1934\\" has the most plot in the collection, and is quite lovely. But is she, as Nadine Gordimer wrote, \\"the best short-story writer since Eudora Welty\\"?Umm, no."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"I love and hate these stories, but mostly..I hate them. Maybe \\"hate\\" is putting too fine a point on it. I know Raymond Carver's wife gushed that \\"Black Tickets\\" was the \\"unmistakable work of early genius\\" but she and I must have read different books. These stories are, for the most point, pretentious and awkward. Come on--\\"the snowy Bible hums?\\" \\"Her breasts balloon, the sky opens inside them?\\" What the hell does that mean? I can't even visualize it. Kudos to Phillips for experimentation, but it doesn't work. I have to say that I do like \\"Lechery\\" and evidently so do many others, because it is heavily anthologized. \\"Black Tickets\\" is also compelling: bleak, black worlds these. Yet in the end these stories feel thin and undeveloped: abstractions rather than gritty experience."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"These stories encompass a range that is undeniable. Voices shift from young girls to young women mostly and occasionally to young men as in \\"El Paso.\\" The narrative scope is tight and very intimately entwined. The landscape, family, and dynamics of character change constantly from story to story. These are gritty situations and people: displaced young women, strippers, a homeless madwoman, an orphaned child turned prostitute.These are bottom-feeder stories-- youth without the rosy glow of hope, lackluster in faith. But despite the harrowing void in Phillips' writing, truth can be found here. These stories are full of the monsters that tear us down and that we give ourselves to as well.The flash fiction in this collection is perhaps the most spectacular part of the book. They are quick portraits of girls and sometimes their families as in \\"Wedding Picture.\\" Others take a more perilous turn as in \\"Under the Boardwalk,\\" \\"Accidents,\\" and \\"Slave.\\" An overwhelming number of the stories are pocked with sexual deviation and marked with terror. There is something forceful about this exhumation of human depravity as if the author were excising skin and tissue and veins and clots just to show the reader the glimmer of a wet organ.Phillips' details are mostly spot-on and daring. In one passage she compares the texture of a woman's skin to a \\"seeded strawberry.\\" Phillips also has tight control of her pacing. She often writes as if cutting into the last sentence, as if the slideshow quickens and the pictures begin to move like a small home movie. However, this is not an easy collection. At times, reading her feels as if a pleasurable spot on the body is being stroked too hard, rubbed too long perhaps by even the wrong person.This collection is original and the stories are frighteningly raw, sexually devious, and potent. She has a knack for honesty that is always bound to brutality. There are demons in these stories that perhaps will make us hope we had not woken."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"The stories are of two types here -- short, one page sketches that verge on being prose poems, and longer, fuller stories which still contain an elusive quality. Although critics, to a man, preferred the longer stories, I find the shorter ones equally compelling. The writing is first-rate; it is nuanced, poetic, and contains a wealth of psychological insight. I think this is Phillps's greatest accomplishment: her merging of the psychological and the political in stories that are always accessible. Those looking for pretension will find it only with reviewers who trash sophisticated story-tellers while including the (see more about me) tag at the beginning of their own reviews."},{"Title":"Black Tickets","review":"This is potent, unblinking, and very courageous stuff.

And other chapters are hard-hitting investigative journalism--into the lives of girls cut off from education by budget cuts in their counties or their families, or women left to run the farms as the agricultural workforce turns mainly female, or migrant women working in the maquiladora factories of Guangdong. There's fascinating little glimpses into history, like a piece on female roles in the old Peking Opera, or on an exclusively women's writing system developed long ago in a region of Hunan.All told, the book gives a feel for the rapidly shifting challenges and tactics of China's women's movement.--author of A Galaxy of Immortal Women: The Yin Side of Chinese Civilization"},{"Title":"Start to Finish Ironman Training 24 Weeks to an Endurance Triathlon","review":"I bought this book several years ago with the intention to do an Ironman sometime in the future.

I find it very easy to use the daily training book as a coach pushing down workouts every single day. This leaves no excuse for not getting a solid workout it.Additionally, the program is properly set up (as would be by 3 very experienced, Olympic-level Ironman athletes/coaches) with Build, IM, Hard, Recovery, Taper and Race Week sections so as to not overtrain and to vary the intensity of the workouts.

The main characteristic of this chapter is that it also give some introduction to the theory needed to understand the models. In this chapter, the authors take care to provide not only equations, but also examples of how these equations work in small sets of documents, making it easier for student to grasp their workings. It is a long and detailed chapter, maybe the best you can find among the field.Chapters 3 to 8, make a broad review of IR techniques, however they do not go deep in any technique.

This book is not going to provide you with a set of recipes for building an indexing or search engine, nor would I expect it do so. However, it does give you an idea of how such engines might be built. Further, I found this book to be a necessary prerequisite for other practitioner-oriented texts, such asLucene in Action (In Action series).

Author Richard C. Eyer (Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Concordia University, Wisconsin) deftly explains that the answers to guilt, anxiety, loneliness, depression, grief, and more come from turning to God and opening one's hearts. Very highly recommended as an emotional vehicle of faithful expression, They Will See His Face closely peruses the Scripture with discussion questions for the reader to ponder."},{"Title":"They Will See His Face: Worship and Healing","review":"Richard Eyer is professor emeritus of Philosophy at Concordia University (Mequon, WI) who has spent most of his career as a chaplain at health care facilities. He has written widely on spiritual health and its role in holistic health. \\"They Will See His Face\\" is a book on the role of Divine Service in holistic health.The Divine Service is the weekly liturgical Sunday worship service in which Holy Communion is celebrated; with the exception of the Scripture readings and a few prayers, the Divine Service is characterized by an unchanging, weekly ritual. Eyer argues that this ritualistic participation in the Divine Service is an effective health-giving agent for many of our modern maladies. This is so for three main reasons. One reason is that the frequent practice of an objective ritual becomes a window through which you view the rest of the world--that is to say ritual shapes your worldview--thus the ritualistic practice of grounding yourself in God's truth allows you to interact with the world in a more healthful way. Second, the nature of the Divine Service is such that the participant is forced to look outside himself for health and healing and look instead to God. This is very much unlike modern (postmodern?) America which advises one to look within himself for healing; the Divine Service directs you toward Jesus. Finally and most importantly, the Divine Service contributes to spiritual/holistic health because it is composed entirely of the Means of Grace--Word and Sacraments--the means by which God comes to his people to bless them, increase their faith, and heal them.\\"They Will See His Face\\" is divided into six chapters. Each deals with an affliction/source of un-health, describes it, and then goes no to show how the Divine Service can contribute to the healing of that malady. The six maladies covered are: guilt, anxiety, loneliness, depression, grief, and physical sickness. In each chapter, Eyer draws upon his theological training, his decades of experience ministering to the sick and dying, and even his own personal, introspective thoughts to paint a graphic, yet supremely caring picture of the sickness. With the disease authoritatively and lovingly defined, Eyer explains how the Divine Service serves as God's instrument of healing. Each chapter ends with a summery paragraph and several questions for discussion--in case the book is part of a book club or Bible study series.In all, \\"They Will See His Face\\" is a well-written and insightful book that gives practical and timely advice for our time. The author's pastoral care and decades of experience come through in a way that warms the heart. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"They Will See His Face: Worship and Healing","review":"This book is excellent on explaining how the Lutheran Liturgy helps heals loneliness, grief, depression, anxiety and many of the emotions that appear when we are suffering. It is wonderfully written by a pastor who was first a church pastor, then a hospital chaplain and then a seminary professor. His life experience has wonderful examples of how the liturgy connects us to God Through Christ in the Word and Sacraments and unites us with the saints who have gone before us and the ones we now share in our common faith and those of generations to come who have not yet been born.Fantastic book to use as a bible study as well.

Happy reading, hope you enjoy!"},{"Title":"hildilid's night","review":"Hildilid is a solitary old woman who lives in a hut on a mountain, and she hates the night. One night, she decides to attempt to get rid of it, musing, \\"I do not know why no one has thought of chasing away the night before.\\" So she commences a multitude of strategies: she sweeps, scrubs, scours, whisks at the night, with no result. She sews a sack to capture the night, but cannot get it all in. She singes it with a candle, but it skips outside her hut. And so her antics continue through the night, until the sun comes up, finding her too tired to enjoy the day.This old-fashioned tale is full of humor, and children will enjoy Hildilid's absurdly futile antics, which gently illustrate the foolishness of pride. This woman believes she is powerful enough to change the movements of the sun, which has determined the day and night since God created it for that purpose (Genesis 1:16-18; Job 38:12, 19-21).The book is illustrated in pen-and-ink, with a creative use of color at the end when the sun rises, lighting Hildilid's world with yellow light. Some children may not immediately be drawn to it because it is mostly in black and white, but the artwork holds lots of visual interest and earned a Caldecott Honor in 1972, before the more modern printing equipment was available. It may be best suited to a younger elementary-school audience, although some preschoolers will enjoy it as well."},{"Title":"hildilid's night","review":"A friend gave me this book when I was in college, and I instantly fell in love with it.

There's one phrase, \\"like dust behind rafters\\" that comes to me whenever I contemplate things in life that we would rather pretend didn't exist, but which are always with us.The illustrations are delightful, and the black and white fits the subject perfectly.

KEEP THEM COMING."},{"Title":"History of Indian philosophy,","review":"Last year (for reasons I will not go into) I was crazy enough to agree to teach a course on Indian Philosophy. This was crazy because I am not a specialist on Indian Philosophy (my dissertation was on the thought of Francis Suarez, a late medieval Roman Catholic thinker), I never even took a course in Indian Philosophy, and Indian philosophy is extremely complex and sophisticated. But I knew that there was one work out there which would give me a solid grounding in the entire history of Indian Philosophy, Dasgupta's classic five volume A History of Indian Philosophy. While teaching the Indian Philosophy course last spring, I read parts of this magistrial work every day, and at least one volume of it was always by my bedstand every night.This work cannot, of course, by itself give one a complete understanding of all the complexities of Indian Philosophy. But what is amazing about it is that it is more than just an introduction; Dasgupta often goes into great detail about the incredibly intricate debates which raged between various schools of Indian thought over the centuries. In volume 4 of his work, for example, he devotes a hundred and fifteen pages to describing the arguments and conter-arguments of the monists (Advaita Vedantins) and the dualists (Dvaita Vedantins). Much of this part of his work deals with very complicated and abstruse arguments, and I was never able to completely digest it. But I have found that, by reading other works on Indian philosophy, I am able to understand more and more of Dasgupta's great work, and so, after being away from it for a while, I periodically return to it, as if to discourse again with a great master about the most profound topics raised by the gurus of old.This treatise is, in short, a gem. Not only is there no other comparable work on Indian philosophy as a whole (Radakrishnan's Indian Philosophy being a pale second to Dasgupta's work), there is nothing comparable to it on Western Philosophy. Scholars of Indian thought, as well as any one who wishes to risk attempting to begin to seriously study this great and ancient tradition, must be eternally grateful to Motilal Banarsidass Publishers for reprinting this magisterial work at such a bargin price."},{"Title":"History of Indian philosophy,","review":"Surendranath Dasgupta was one of the most profound scholars of modernity. He was among the first of his generation to realize that the onus of the contemporary thinker is not as much in the initiation of new ideas, as in the gathering and, more importantly, sorting of the mass of information by which we are engulfed. This magisterial history is the fruit of a lifetime of study, a magnum among magni, a revelatory reading of the development of every major school of Indian thought, simply, one of the greatest books. In the words of the Oxford Journal, \\"the collection of data, editing and the interpretation of every school of thought is a feat unparalleled in the field of history of philosophy\\". I would stress \`interpretation'. Dasgupta is a true vivekan, a master of discrimination in these matters, judicious, with a seemingly infallible sense of the main and the germinal, and a cultivated ability to correctly assay the merit and weight of arguments with the myriad of ancient traditions discussed within these pages.The organization of the compilation in five volumes is as follows:Vol I: Vedic, Buddhist, Jaina philosophies, i.e., the foundational thought of Indian (perhaps all) philosophy in this aeon; the six systems of Hindu thought, viz., Samkhya, Yoga, Nyaya, Vaisesika, Mimamsa, Vedanta.Vol II: Studies in the Sankara school of Vedanta, philosophy of the Yogavasistha, the Bhagavadgita, and speculations in the medical schools.Vol III: An elaborate account of dualistic and pluralistic systems such as the philosophy of the Pancarata, Bhaskara, Yamuna, Ramanuja, Nimbarka, Vijnanabhiksu, and philosophic speculations of some of the Puranas.Vol IV: Philosophies of the Bhagavata Purana, Madva and his school, Vallabha, Caitanya, Jiva Goswami, Baladeva Vidyabhusana.Vol V: Philosophy of Saivism: the southern schools of Saivism, viz., Saiva Siddhanta, Vira Saivism, philosophy of Srikantha, Saiva philosophy in the Puranas and other texts.The book takes a lifetime to read as well - but do not despair, Volume I alone offers an in depth view of the essence of fundametal Indian thought - and is superior to any other introduction to the subject. Also Dasgupta's literary talents are on par with his notable scholarship, which makes for fun reading as well as a great education."},{"Title":"History of Indian philosophy,","review":"Dasgupta's book continues to be a superb resource on Indian philosophy even though it was first published a long time ago."},{"Title":"History of Indian philosophy,","review":"Perhaps the best book for any one who wants to learn about the greatest civilization ever existed on the face of this earth i.e. India.

In order of presentation (as well as the historical order of the founding of these religions, according to the editor), we encounter a \\"Hindu,\\" a Jew, a Zen Buddhist, a Christian, and a Muslim-Americans all-each explaining the basic tenets of their respective faiths.The five essays vary in their quality and depth of insight into the respective religions. Given the fact that each author was allotted only twenty pages to introduce a major world religion, one must expect the essays to be selective and limited with regard to their subject matter. The brevity, combined with each author's pluralistic outlook-a sort of rush to non-judgment as it were-lends itself to a misleading presentation of the views.Professor Anantanand Rambachan's essay on \\"Hinduism\\" blurs important distinctions among religious traditions that are often given this designation. Indeed, the reader comes away with the impression that Hindus are committed to a sort of panentheism, as he cites a hymn in the Rg Veda that \\"states that while God pervades the universe by a fourth of God's being, three-fourths remain beyond it\\" (p. 3). He fails to tell his readers that he himself is an adherent of Advaita Vedanta, Shankara's 9th century philosophy of absolute non-dualism. On Advaita, Brahman is the only existing being, so that the observable world of samsara around us is actually an illusion due to avidya or ignorance. Further, Brahman is literally \\"propertyless\\" according to Advaita Vedanta, so that no properties-from personhood to power to goodness-apply to \\"him.\\" The Advaitan concept of Brahman is a far cry from any theistic conception of God, and readers may be misled by the theistic overtones of Professor Rambachan's use of \\"God\\" to refer to Brahman. Though the Hindu doctrine of ishtadeva and the corresponding doctrine of diverse margas or \\"approved ways\\" \\"has enabled Hindus to think of the world's religions in complementary and not exclusive ways\\" (p. 7), the Absolute Monism of Rambachan's own view entails that, while theistic belief may be instrumental as a stepping stone to the truth of Brahman, it is little more than a useful fiction.Yaakov Ariel's essay on Judaism emphasizes Jewish culture and practice and decidedly de-emphasizes doctrine. We learn something of Hannukah and Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur and Purim, and of the cultural shift from the priestly class to a lay priesthood, from temple to synagogue, but precious little about what Jews believe about the Creator-or the Messiah.Patricia Phelan tells us something of the Buddha's early life and original teachings, including the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path. The latter, with its practical emphasis, gets the most attention, and she steers clear of themetaphysical implications of, say, the Buddhist doctrines of \\"dependent origination\\" and its corollaries of anitya (impermanence) and anatman (no-self). After nodding in the direction of the other Buddhist traditions of Theravada and Mahayana, she settles into a discussion of her own Zen practice.Editor Amanda Millay Hughes, an Episcopalian, emphasizes the confessional nature of Christianity, and opens her essay with a statement and brief exposition of the Nicene Creed. She nicely articulates an orthodox account of such doctrines as the Trinity and Incarnation, and, importantly given this interfaith context, the ontological transcendence of God (\\"God is fundamentally other than any created thing or being,\\" p. 75). She affirms the universality of sin and the need for forgiveness, but says little to nothing about the Atonement itself. She does, however, offer the exclusivist claim that \\"Christians believe that all human life needs the redemptive action of God in Christ Jesus\\" (p. 79). This does not sit well with the pluralist motivation behind this project, as one of her collaborators points out in the Q&A; section. Rambachan asks, \\"How do you relate [this claim] with the reality of different religions?\\" (p. 88). Her reply is evasive. She notes that exclusivist thinking engenders \\"dark judgments about other religions\\" and confesses,\\"it is hard to give a definitive answer to your question\\" (p. 88). The non-definitive answer that follows urges the need for love and the universal \\"desire to live in harmony,\\" and concludes with an appeal to \\"mystery.\\" I'll return to her dilemma momentarily.Amy Nelson, a self-described \\"white, educated, American-born\\" convert to Islam, explains the basic tenets of her faith. Allah has no cohorts, and \\"there is no god but Allah\\" is the cornerstone of Muslim faith. She explains the exalted view that Muslims take of Mohammed and of the Q'uran. And we learn something of the five pillars of Islam: monotheistic belief itself, prayer, fasting, alms, pilgrimage. Many post-911 readers may hope to learn whether Islam is, after all, a peaceful religion. But for a couple of oblique references to \\"popular western conceptions\\" (p. 111) of Islam, little to nothing is said in either the essay or the Q&A; section to dispel the alleged misconceptions.Five Voices, Five Faiths is motivated by the desire to \\"live amicably\\" with those whose beliefs are different from one's own, to \\"live with and value fundamental differences\\" (p. xiv), and to find \\"common ground\\" for interfaith dialogue (p. xiii). These are noble aspirations, all, I suppose. But the concerns go beyond a desire for harmonious co-existence. We are told that mere \\"tolerant forbearance\\" implies (arrogantly, I take it) that one is in a \\"position of privilege\\" that is not enjoyed by the other. Indeed, we are to avoid \\"unproductive dogmatic debate\\" (p. xv) and are urged to \\"do more than tolerate difference-we can honor it as part of the richness of human experience\\" (p. xiv). \\"Celebrate diversity,\\" as they say. Ms. Millay Hughes quotes approvingly from an essay on religious pluralism by a Christian pastor who bubbles that \\"the Christian calling allows him to sing his song to Jesus \`with abandon ...without speaking negatively about others'\\" (p. xvi). Though she once subscribed to the mandate to make disciples of all people (p. xvii), now, \\"as a middle-aged woman,\\" she \\"reflects more deeply\\" on Jesus' \\"new commandment\\" to love one another. Her advice to the adherents of the different traditions these days is \\"hold onto the truths you have received\\" (p. xviii). One might draw the conclusion that somehow the Great Commission and this \\"new commandment\\" are mutually at odds. One might also be a child of the times.Ms. Millay Hughes' dilemma in attempting to answer Professor Rambachan's question is symptomatic of the pluralistic perspective that motivates projects such as Five Voices, Five Faiths. She wishes to affirm her own Christian faith while commending other competing traditions, as \\"sacred truths.\\" She wishes to \\"sing her song to Jesus without speaking negatively of others.\\" Her trouble arises from a simple point of logic. To believe something just is to believe that it is true. And to believe that it is true entails believing that its denial is false. The Islamic version of monotheism requires that the Christian doctrine of the Incarnation is not only false but blasphemous. The Advaita Vedantan doctrine of Nirguna Brahman entails the falseness of all varieties of monotheism. There just is no sense in which all of these competing doctrines may be said to be \\"true\\"-not in a way that does full justice to the sense in which actual believers (as opposed to Religious Studies scholars) take their doctrines to be true. To believe anything is to believe that lots of other things-even doctrines that are cherished by fine people-are false. If tolerance means never thinking that those cherished beliefs of others are false, then, necessarily, no one is ever tolerant.I do not recommend Five Voices, Five Faiths as a text for the college classroom-especially at the Christian college. Win Corduan's Neighboring Faiths (InterVarsity, 1998) is much more thorough in its exploration of the various traditions, is even-handed despite being written by a Christian philosopher, and lacks the confused pluralistic outlook of the present book. Harold Netland's Encountering Religious Pluralism (InterVarsity, 2001) written by a former student of Professor John Hick, is a healthy antidote to the perspective of Five Voices, and is a fine text for the classroom. Scholars who wish to understand the perspective of Religious Pluralism itself should bypass Five Voices and go directly to Professor Hick's An Interpretation of Religion (Yale, 2005)."},{"Title":"Five Voices Five Faiths: An Interfaith Primer","review":"Five Voices Five Faiths: An Interfaith Primer is an introduction to five major religious traditions of the world for lay readers, as presented by five practitioners of each religion.

I've since bought it five or six times again, one for myself in case I lose my original, and the others as gifts. I'm usually a fiction reader but I keep this book on my bedside table for times when I'm not sure what I'm in the mood to read next. I flip to any essay and dive right in again. I can't say enough how much I adore this book - her writing is superior and the overall tone is relaxing, humorous, and insightful in the way that only comes from living a real life and not criticizing everyone else's choices. In fact the only thing this book really criticizes, and brilliantly subtly at that, is the act of being overly critical and judgmental. The whole collection is so memorable, and certain essays really stick with you. For example, the one about smoking is surprising and lovely. Whether you smoke or not (and she doesn't champion smoking, though she doesn't rail on it either), the imagery of two cigarettes lit after sex saying without words, \\"I am here,\\" and \\"I am here too,\\" has been in my mind since the first time I read it. Likewise, her assessment of cats and dogs is insightful and funny. It's clear she prefers cats, and I'm the opposite, but I appreciate her description of dogs as simpler and cats as more complex, like \\"artichokes.\\" These are small images that leave a lasting impression. Honestly I can't count how many times I've picked up this book, read a few essays, then fallen asleep relaxed and thinking about nothing stressful. Any book that can do that for me is damn near perfect. If it were twice as long, I'd be twice as happy."},{"Title":"Endangered Pleasures In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences","review":"The subtitle reads, \\"In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences.\\" The Washington Post said it's, \\"so pleasingly subversive that the reader falls into a reverie of his own remembered pleasures.\\" The chapters have titles like, \\"Naps,\\" \\"Speed,\\" \\"Bad Words,\\" \\"Whistling,\\" \\"Bare Feet,\\" and \\"Gardening.\\" They are every bit as wonderful as they sound.The crux of this read is that rest and relaxation with friends and family are infintely more rewarding (and important) than a job performance review.

Her curmudgonous &quot;Wasn't The Grass Greener&quot; finds her post-expulsion, wistfully remembering telegrams, clotheslines, radiators and tangible, fading societal remnants. Here she praises seasonal, small, slightly sinful luxuries readily available if occassionally politically incorrect.Sensuality rules &quot;Endangered Pleasures&quot; in taste (coffee, martinis, even cigarettes), touch (bare feet, naked bodies in shower, bath and bed, wearing fur in an apologetic essay) sound (songs of youth, whistling, profanity), and above all, sight ( July 4, Christmas, books and morining paper, emotional blankets covering the four seasons, travel modes and motivations). Holland also indulges in slight sins of lust (morning sex), gluttony (justifications of the day's three meals), schadenfreude (her section on disasters and crowd behavior after the Phillies' 1980 World Series win) and supposed sloth (her defense of working and not working, and of gardening as a form of work, are alone worth the book price).Holland also understands small, measurable triumphs of early childhood (&quot;the first 10 or 12 years are just one triumph after another&quot;) early adulthood (&quot;We studied for the career of being adults...we thought we had to have opinions on everything.&quot;)and parenthood (&quot;Having a child around is more fun than being one, since we're free to leave the small world for the large one whenever we get bored.&quot;)Some Holland-praised pleasures became unpopular for understandable, if not completely agreeable, reasons. But she correctly states many benign indulgences fell to what author Robert Ringer called &quot;absolute morality,&quot; a governmental/societal/Puritanical mindset distrusting and discouraging pleasure as immoral and unfair while praising pain and self-denial as noble and necessary. Authors like Barbara Holland and books like &quot;Endangered Pleasures&quot; remind us life is too short to take too seriously or studiously, or to deny self without greater purpose. Like chocolate fudge cake, &quot;Endangered Pleasures&quot; should be enjoyed rarely in small slices, but enjoyed to its fullest nonetheless."},{"Title":"Endangered Pleasures In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences","review":"This book will make you laugh...at yourself and others who try to make life a series of grim responsibilities. Barbara Holland is such an unabashed pleasure-seeker, I had to keep checking the cover to see that it was really written by a woman! The things she embraces are truly guilty pleasures no self-respecting, typically suffering woman of the '90's would admit to. Thank God for her! As a fellow sybarite, I appluad this book's celebration of all that is deliciously decadent. What's great is reading about guilty pleasures you may not have even thought of. The overriding theme of the book is not how great martinis, bacon or naps are in and of themselves, but how anything that you enjoy that way can really lift your spirits...and if it's forbidden, all the better! In this overwrought era of taking everything too seriously, wondering what food will kill us next and what disease we'll catch, this book is like a ray of sunshine. Read this book with a martini, in the tub or just before taking that leisurely mid-day nap!P.S. I would add to the list: gossip, flirting, buying splurges at bookstores, massages (perferably voluntary and spontaneous) dancing when home alone to music everyone else makes fun of, watching &quot;Lifetime&quot;, any Judith Krantz novel, candles, body lotion and decolletage."},{"Title":"Endangered Pleasures In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences","review":"Ms. Holland is one of my favorite authors and this is my favorite of her books.

Bacon (yum), naps, calling out sick, cursing, all the things we're not supposed to do or enjoy because they're bad for our health, the economy, the nation.

In this delightful collection of essays, each devoted to a particular pleasure at risk of being forgotten in our busy lives, Barbara Holland eloquently and wittily persuades us to succumb to guilty indulgences such as bare feet, happy hour, chicken gravy, and calling in sick. She also celebrates the unabashed pleasures such as weekends, dawdling over the morning paper, gardening, and idle summer vacations. Ms Holland covers 67 pleasures in all, some of which you will instantly recognize, some of which it is never too late to start indulging in, and others that are just downright dangerous! Extremely engaging and often laugh-out-loud funny, this is a book to dip into every now and then, as a delicious antidote to the strains and stresses of modern life. It makes an excellent gift for any of the overworked, abstemious persons you know, including yourself."},{"Title":"Endangered Pleasures In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences","review":"ENDANGERED PLEASURES is perhaps mistitled as it's not credible to think any of the 67 things and activities listed, from the morning paper to cigarettes to bare feet to weekends to gambling to winter to babies, are actually in peril of extinction. \\"Unappreciated\\" might be more a apropos term instead of \\"endangered\\". The book's subtitle says it all more succinctly: IN DEFENSE OF NAPS, BACON, MARTINIS, PROFANITY AND OTHER INDULGENCES.Author/essayist Barbara Holland has a remarkable talent for perceiving the small details of life and living. Or rather, a talent for remembering what she perceives and subsequently bringing it to the attention of the lumpish rest of us. For instance, on the \\"being there\\" phase of travel:\\"The hee-haw of the ambulance in the foreign streets sings with a pure and alien glamour, quite unrelated to the irritating scream of emergency vehicles back home.\\" Now, I've noticed that on my own overseas walk-abouts, but would never think it worth mentioning to the folks back home.And, on a more sobering note, regarding the psychology of crowds:\\"Face to face with, say, Adolph Hitler at a table for two, we would have jeered at his passions, protested, flounced out in a snit. In a crowd of thousands, all cheering and brandishing fists, we might have stood in the path of the electric current, felt the blood of common cause rise joyfully in our throats, and cheered too ... Deep inside each of us lurks a chained lemming, struggling to break free, and we need to keep an eye on it.\\"I admire Holland's talent for social commentary.

She shows the bones of a good screenplay in a manner that doesn't seem so much formulaic as archetypal: a movie starts with its status quo, hits an inciting incident; its protagonist forms a plan of action at plot point one, hits the high or low of his story at the midpoint, renews his efforts at plot point two, and earns his reward, or tragedy, in the conclusion. Schellhardt clued me in to the pattern, and now, when I sense a movie petering out or losing its focus, I have a notion why it happened.Schellhardt also covers outline writing in detail and takes a couple of pages to discuss the purpose and interleaving of subplot, as well as the usual stuff about formatting and marketing.

I was going to give this book 4 stars, but ultimately decided on 3 stars due to the author's unfortunate habit of using music metaphors to explain film industry techniques. There are two problems with this... 1) For a reader who has no experience as a composer or a performing orchestral musician, the author's use of one artform (music) to explain another (filmmaking) is completely useless as the analogy will not make any sense and only serve to further confuse the reader 2) In addition to being confusing for non-musicians, these analogies are infuriating to those of us who actually do understand music, because of the author's ignorance of the subject matter. This is most evident in one example (there are many others that I won't take the time to detail) where the author claims that a pause in dialogue is analogous to a grace note in music. She obviously has confused grace notes for rests. A grace note is a short note that precedes a written note, typically used to create an accent. A rest indicates one or more beats of silence. She is way off the mark here, and it makes her look more than a little foolish to those in the know. In summary, I would recommend this book as a starter for beginners, with a warning to ignore her attempts at analogy and focus in on those parts of the book where she explains things in a straight-forward and less colorful manner."},{"Title":"Screenwriting For Dummies","review":"For those who have little idea of where to start in writting a screen play, this book will get you on the right track.

I threw the book away and wanted to write this review.The biggest problem for me, as a reader who was relying on this book to inform me, was that the book never recommended a length (one of its many problems). I ended up writing a drama that was 220 pages long. If you know anything about a draft screenplay, they are to be 90 to 110 pages long (and then once accepted, the director adds insights bringing to length to 200 pages +). The screenwriters length pre-publication is at most 120 pages. I read this book (back in 2003) and the book never discussed length at all. It would have been helpful, because my screenplay was never taken seriously due primarily to length. If I even want this screenplay considered in the future, I need to cut it in half, which is impossible at this point. I have decided, if anything, I will adapt it into a novel.The moral of the story is this. Do not believe this book will prepare you for Hollywood or the business in general. It will not. Had the author of this book had any direct insights into Hollywood (or the business at large) then she would have inserted a section on common sense material (length, what producers are looking for... and the like). I cannot tell you how many producers turned me down and then rebuked me for even trying to produce such a \\"monster\\" script. The fact the author didn't know this about the industry, is telling enough to leave this book well enough alone.I bought this book in 2003, perhaps the author has listened to criticism and has included a \\"common sense section.\\" If she has, good for her.

REVKINJanuary 8, 2003(c) The New York TimesA branch of the Danish Research Agency has concluded that Prof. Bjorn Lomborg, an author whose upbeat analysis of environmental trends has been embraced by conservatives, displayed \\"scientific dishonesty\\" in his popular book, \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist.\\"Professor Lomborg, who has a doctorate in political science and teaches statistics at the University of Aarhus, has portrayed the book as an unbiased scientific refutation of dire pronouncements by environmental groups. But it has been attacked as deeply flawed by many environmental scientists since its publication in English in 2001 by Cambridge University Press.Many experts have said that environmental conditions, in most cases, are not nearly as good as Professor Lomborg portrays them, but also not nearly as bad as some environmental groups and scientists have said.The Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty, after a six-month review following several complaints filed by scientists, issued a 17-page report yesterday concluding that the book displayed \\"systematic one-sidedness.\\"\\"Objectively speaking,\\" the committees found, \\"the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty,\\" as defined by Danish rules for scientific integrity.But because Dr. Lomborg was not found grossly negligent, he could not be found formally to have been scientifically dishonest, the report said.The committee said it found no evidence that Professor Lomborg deliberately tried to mislead readers, which would have been a graver issue, and settled on a relatively mild rebuke, concluding, \\"The publication is deemed clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice.\\"The committees, divisions of the Danish Research Agency, are composed of a variety of scientists and headed by a judge from the Danish High Court.In a telephone interview, Professor Lomborg, 38, defended the book and challenged the committees to come up with specific examples of errors or bias.\\"You can't say I'm scientifically dishonest or in breach of good scientific conduct unless you point the finger and say this is the smoking gun,\\" he said. \\"It's like saying you committed murder but we won't tell you who you killed. It's impossible for me to defend myself.\\"He said the committees' conclusion could get him fired from his new position as director of the Danish Institute for Environmental Assessment, in which he reviews the effectiveness of government spending on environmental programs. Government officials, however, told Danish news organizations that the criticism of the book did not jeopardize Professor Lomborg's job.Cambridge University Press has also been criticized by scientists for publishing the book. Officials at the publishing house declined to comment on the findings, saying they had not had a chance to read them.The report did not cite specific examples, but asserted that the book &#65533; although presented in the style of a scientific treatise, with copious footnotes and diagrams &#65533; was actually \\"a provocative debate-generating paper.\\"It extensively cited a long critique of Professor Lomborg's book that was published in Scientific American last year. Professor Lomborg and his supporters said that critique was itself biased and written by scientists who have long portrayed the environment as dangerously degraded.The book &#65533; a dense review of data on forests, climate change, food supplies, population growth and other issues &#65533; has not been a runaway best seller but has been widely cited by conservative groups, commentators and elected officials who oppose strict environmental regulations.At the same time, the book posed a sharp challenge to environmental groups and many scientists who have long spoken of looming ecological and climatic catastrophes that have yet to materialize.\\"The environment is a field where, when people do some light calculations like Lomborg did, it's easy to argue for a happy-times kind of conclusion,\\" said Dr. Peter H. Raven, the director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.But such findings should not be portrayed as science, he said, adding, \\"This is a just outcome that ought to bring his credibility to a halt except for those who desperately want to believe what he says.\\""},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"check out this books editorial review.

That's up to us."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It's surprising that people are still being hoodwinked by this book. The arguments made in \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" have been thoroughly debunked, most prominently in a series of articles in Scientific American. The deceptions used by Lomborg in arriving at his conclusions include selecting only the data that support his preferred interpretation and evaluation against meaningless benchmarks. Lomborg is a statistician by profession, not a scientist, so he might be excused for lacking the background necessary to understand the meaning of the fragmentary data that he reviews in this book. However, some of the deceptions that he practices appear very much to be conscious.An example of the misleading approach taken in the book is his treatment of the topic of pesticides. Pesticide application causes acute poisoning of field workers in the U.S. and globally due to poor adherence to safety standards. Pesticides also cause unintended damage to natural systems (including the economically signficant products of ecosystems such as fish stocks). And the chronic toxicology of pesticides in human populations is very poorly understood. However, Lomborg evaluates the regulation of pesticide use and the momentum towards adopting farming methods less reliant on pesticides against only one threat: the increased risk of cancer among people exposed to pesticide residues in their food. Because clinical studies of such risks are very difficult, Lomborg concludes that threat is exagerated and that the public concerns over pesticide use are more hysterical than rational. He willfully ignores the numerous problems with pesticide use outside of cancer risks. And the fact that research is incomplete on the topic of cancer risk does not mean that the subject can be dismissed. For example, only in the last couple of years has a long-term study been completed to establish that the birth weight of babies born in the 1960s was lower as the mothers' exposure to DDT increased.Of the more than 10,000 man-made chemicals in use, only a few dozen have been extensively studied for their toxicological effect on adults, and even fewer have been studied for their effects on children or for their effects in combination with each other. Lomborg does not illuminate the limits of our knowledge and the directions for further inquiry. Rather he tries to close the discussion and make the reader feel foolish for having concern for the environment. This is not the mark of good science.I encourage anyone who reads this book (or is assigned to read it) to seek out the comprehensive critiques of it. In that sense the book may be instructive: by presenting the popular canards used by the uninformed to dismiss environmental concerns and to condemn environmental science. It can be educational to confront a muddled and deceptive argument and see it for what it is."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Being a Dane, I have followed the career of Bjrn Lomborg since his first newspaper articles in January 1998. When &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; was published in 2001, I helped the Danish Ecological Council scrutinizing the contents of the book. We found that it is full of errors, many of which are deliberate. Because of this, I lodged a complaint to the Danish Committees on Scientific Dishonesty, which ruled Lomborg &quot;objectively dishonest&quot;. In January 2004, I established the web site www.lomborg-errors.dk, where I review the events behind the book, and where I list errors and flaws, ordered by chapters and pages. Right now (6th March 2004) I have listed 226 flaws and errors, of which about 70 are clearly deliberate. Lomborg's text is written in a very seductive way, so that you will not detect the flaws unless they are pointed out to you. So, one should not read the book without also consulting critiques. The most extensive list of error corrections up to now is the web site referred to above."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Although i found this book to be exceedingly well written, reading smoothly and drawing you in, it soon became clear how little of a scientist Lomborg was. on the surface his points seem convincing and valid, but, as somebody with a background in environmental science, it only took a moments thoughts to fill his propositions with holes. his overriding theme seems to be that increased wealth will be the answer to all of the questionable (in his mind) current environmental concerns. i'm still a little confused about how having more money will be able to raise up the Pacific islands when the sea level rises two inches in the next few decades (as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted it will)and other like claims. my primary responce to this book was fear, fear that, as one of the few readible and straightforward books out there on environmental concerns, people who have only a passing interest in such issues will be sucked in by his smooth words despite the questionable, and at times unequivicably false ('global warming will make the world greener and thus aid in abatting world huner' was a favorite of mine...)nature of his claims. i sincerely hope that some of the numerous scientists out there in the field of the environment will be able to conteract these dangerous lies soon with a similar book told from a more factual background."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"[...]Does this book merit such positive attention? Does Lomborg provide new insights? Are his claims supported by the data? A healthy skepticism towards the claims of others is, after all, one of the hallmarks of good science. And, at first glance, Lomborg's book appears to be an objective and rigorous scientific analysis. It is published by a leading academic press, and contains an extensive bibliography and nearly 3,000 footnotes.To answer these questions, UCS invited several of the world's leading experts on water resources, biodiversity, and climate change to carefully review the sections in Lomborg's book that address their areas of expertise. We asked them to evaluate whether Lomborg's skepticism is coupled with the other hallmarks of good science - namely, objectivity, understanding of the underlying concepts, appropriate statistical methods and careful peer review. Reviewing Lomborg's claims are Dr. Peter Gleick, an internationally recognized expert on the state of freshwater resources; Dr. Jerry Mahlman, one of the most highly regarded atmospheric scientists and climate modelers; and top biologists and biodiversity experts Dr.'s Edward O. Wilson, Thomas Lovejoy, Norman Myers, Jeffrey Harvey and Stuart Pimm.These separately written expert reviews unequivocally demonstrate that on closer inspection, Lomborg's book is seriously flawed and fails to meet basic standards of credible scientific analysis. The authors note how Lomborg consistently misuses, misrepresents or misinterprets data to greatly underestimate rates of species extinction, ignore evidence that billions of people lack access to clean water and sanitation, and minimize the extent and impacts of global warming due to the burning of fossil fuels and other human-caused emissions of heat-trapping gases. Time and again, these experts find that Lomborg's assertions and analyses are marred by flawed logic, inappropriate use of statistics and hidden value judgments. He uncritically and selectively cites literature -- often not peer-reviewed -- that supports his assertions, while ignoring or misinterpreting scientific evidence that does not. His consistently flawed use of scientific data is, in Peter Gleick's words \\"unexpected and disturbing in a statistician\\".These reviews show that The Skeptical Environmentalist fits squarely in a tradition of contrarian works on the environment that may gain temporary prominence but ultimately fail to stand up to scientific scrutiny. Others, such as Julian Simon and Gregg Easterbrook, have come before him, and others no doubt will follow. Correcting the misperceptions these works foster is an essential task, for, as noted above, groups with anti-environmental agendas use these works to promote their objectives. It is also an unfortunate, time-consuming distraction, for it pulls talented scientists away from the pressing research needed to help us understand the environmental challenges we face and their prospective solutions.Winston Churchill once said, \\"A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on\\", reminding usof the parable of the Tortoise and the Hare. Like the Hare, Lomborg's lie has raced out in front of the truth.With the help of these careful scientific peer reviews, UCS hopes that the truth, like the Tortoise, will catch up and emerge the ultimate victor.Editor's note: In addition to these UCS-solicited reviews, critiques of Lomborg's book have also been published in Scientific American, Nature, Science, and other scientific journals, as well as on several web sites [...] in global environment[...]"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lots of 5 star reviews here... he deserves credits for his extensive use of sources.He deserves 0 out of 5 stars for taking these issues completely out of context and citing only the statistics that support what he wants to say.

There is increasing interest in environmental studies these days. Many of the environmentalists tell us that we are destroying hour planet. Nothing could be further from the truth. Lomborg takes all the major fields of concern and shows there is nothing to worry about. Let me give you an example. It is often said, even educated people tend to believe it, that the oil is not going to last. There is going to be scarcity of oil in the future. Lomborg points out that the best indicator of scarcity is the price. When supply goes down the price goes up. For the last decades the price of oil has been going heavily down. That means that there is more and more oil available to us in this world. In fact, all these government projects about hydrogen or solar power are a waste of taxpayers hard earned money. In fact, if oil would be scarce, the price of oil would get higher and private firms would have an incentive to spend money on new ways of energy.Lomborg also talks about the Kyoto-protocol and shows how stupid it really is. What the environmentalists talk about is the cost of global warming. But they never mention the cost of stopping global warming which is enormous. In fact, Lomborg shows that the cost of stopping global warming is probably much more than the cost of global warming itself. This means that the Kyoto-protocol is in fact nothing but the biggest government waste in history."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"We live in a period in history where there is a disturbing tendency in the western world towards wanting to strangulate free debate and oppress points of views that does not comply with the established views of what it is politically correct to say.As an example we in Europe recently saw the tragic assasination af the dutch politician Pim Fortuyn,a right wing populist who made a political platform out of being against immigration - a point of view that indeed is politically incorrect.In stead of using arguments against the man,first a pie was thrown in his face and when that did'nt stop the man and his \\"dangerous\\" opinions,he was killed by a crazed animal rights fanatic.Lomborg has also had the doubtful pleasure of having a pie thrown in his face,this childish behavior is apparently quite common amongst people without any debate culture.So far,thanks god,no one has tried to hurt Lomborg physically,something wich I could fear because when I read the hateful \\"anti-lomborgian\\" propaganda here and elsewhere,it is clear to me that a lot of people feel so provoked by his claims that they wan't to destroy the man rather than attempt to refute him,perhaps because they are unable to do so.Even if you disagree with him,his courage in standing up against all the people that reject him and his claims is something that demands respect.I originally read the danish version of the book that was published back in 1998 and it made a good impression on me.His style of writing is easy to understand,making often complex issues as simplified as it is possible without leaving anything essential out.If you don't believe his claims,he provides lots of refences to his sources so that you can go and check the information for yourself,this adds to his credibility in my opinion.His overall claims about the (improving) state of the world haven't been effectively refuted by anyone since the book was first published 4 years ago and inspite of his ferocious critics he has also had a lot af positive feedback from scientists that agrees with him.The most positive thing about the book is that it allows common people to understand and discuss environmental issues,this is extremely important since a small elite of arrogant experts have had a monopoly on the debate for much too long.He popularizes the debate,doing the democratic debate a great favour.Recommended 100%!"},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Professor Lomborg's book has received the sort of excessive criticism that makes one wonder if the criticism is not motivated by something other than a love for the truth.Real science is always sceptical. Some environmental activists apparently have decided that since they know the truth they can dispense with rigorous examination of the facts. Such an attitude produces a form of activism that has more in common with political and religious extremism than with science.Lomborg may be correct, or maybe not, but the only way to know for sure will be through rigorous science, not through smear tactics. The critics should dig into the data and his arguments with rigor, not with dismissive ad-hominem statements."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The subtitle is &quot;Measuring the Real State of the World&quot; and this is what this statistician/author did. The author states that there are only a few sources accepted for worldwide statistics, mainly UN, USGS or Nasa studies. Using these studies the author shows how some studies are misused, and misquoted to portend impending environmental doom.I read this book because as one who lived through the sixties, I have not seen the environmental disasters that were predicted, come true. The world population did not outrun the food supply of the green revolution by the mid- seventies; basic foodstuffs are not even on a rising price trend. I have not seen it with our basic metals or oil for that matter. The costs of these have not kept pace with inflation. The author attempts to show where the error lies in these environmental dire predictions. One is inclined to believe this book, the original source is cited, numerous graphs are used and the historical results seem to jive with reality. Many of the past-predicted environmental scares did not pan out.One example would be the scarcity of oil in the seventies and the beginning of a continuous oil scarcity. In reality, oil prices have not kept pace with inflation.One main point of the book is that as a country becomes richer it puts less pressure on the environment and its population levels off. The author puts much faith in this because statistics show that the percentage of the world's population considered poor is steadily diminishing. The author's research seems to be immense, and his reasoning very well thought out. He leads you through the main points of environmental crisis's, scarcity of resources, energy, food, the rainforest, global warming, etc. This book puts many things in perspective. One wants to believe this book, because it offers a future that is not going to be one of stark choices, but reasonable choices and trade-offs. The conclusions are based on the data given and seem very logical. I recommend this book as an eye-opener. The author's explanation of what is happening environmentally, certainly bears more resemblance to reality than can be shown throughout the history of the environmentalist scares of the recent past. One can only hope the future is also as consistent."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"The Skeptical Environmentalist by Bjorn Lomborg is a superb extension of the work pioneered by Julian Simon. The writing is solid and the book is comprehensive. Lomborg systematically covers a vast array of issues on human welfare, pollution, population growth, economic growth, energy, chemical fears, biodiversity, etc. He effectively refutes many of the popular environmental myths of today. What is particularly effective and devastating is that Lomborg does not fall in the data confrontation trap.Much of the data used by the environmental industry does not measure that what it is claimed to measure. For example Global Warming Theory is based on the hypothesis that an increase use of carbon-based fuels will increase the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot; - the amount of the sun's energy that is absorbed by the atmosphere once it is reflect off the earth. This increase in absorbed energy will cause the atmosphere to warm, which in turn will cause the globe to warm further.The only way to directly prove Global Warming Theory is to measure changes in atmospheric temperatures over time with an increase use of carbon based fuels. Since 1979 this has been done using satellites. These provide the only systematic, comprehensive global temperature measurements in existence. However, the environmental industry dismisses atmospheric temperature measurements. Instead to &quot;prove&quot; Global Warming Theory the environmental industry uses surface temperature measurements that are not systematic, a far from comprehensive, and are bias. The environmental industry ignores satellite data because, since measurements began, temperatures have not significantly changed, thus they refute Global Warming Theory.If Lomborg had refuted the data used by the environmental industry, the industry would drown him out by the sheer volume of the cacophony it creates. Instead, he brilliantly accepts their data and shows how the environmental industry selects, twists, and distorts the data to reach its conclusions. Lomborg analyses the entire data sets and shows that contrary conclusions follow.No doubt Lomborg will be attacked as being supported by greedy corporations and capitalists. This time honored attack has a certain perverse logic. Why else would Lomborg be willing to incur the wrath of his colleagues were he not an instrument of greedy corporations and capitalists?Four centuries ago a brilliant scientist was bitterly and repeatedly attacked by almost the entire scientific community of the day because he skewered its pet theories with careful, systematic measurement and experimentation. The best argument his attackers could muster was: Why else would Galileo incur the wrath of his colleagues by advocating the heliocentric solar system were he not an instrument of the devil?The Skeptical Environmentalist is an important book and a &quot;must read&quot; for those who are tired of being deceived - provided, of course, they are not afraid to read the devil."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"For anybody with an open mind who would like to hear a point of view about the environment, that is stunningly absent from most media outlets, this book will be well worth your time.Bjorn Lomborg, a self-proclaimed leftist and former Greenpeace member, set out to debunk what he believed were the overly optimistic views of Julian Simon, who claimed that the world was improving in every quantifiable measure from air and water quality, to availability of natural resources, to longevity, to global warming. After years of painstakingly analyzing current scientific data, Lomborg was shocked to discover that Simon was right after all and that the sky wasn't falling as most environmentalists would have us believe.Some reviewers, apparently unhappy about having their dogma challenged, have tried to discredit Lomborg through ad hominem attacks, saying that his work is worthless because he's not an environmental scientist, but they are unable to offer even a single example of innaccuracy in his research.Lomborg cuts through all the fear and hysteria with his blindingly clear and rational analysis. He does not conclude that \\"everything is perfectly fine\\" and that we don't need to worry. Instead, he argues that even though the world continues to improve, we still need to be vigilant, to continue striving to make the world a better place for all of us to live."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is not a review as such, but it will help buyers trying to determine the validity of the charges against this book's rigour:Press Release from the Danish Committees on Scientific DishonestyMarch 12, 2004Scientific Dishonesty Committee Withdraws Lomborg CaseThe Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty (DCSD) today announced it would not reopen the case concerning Bjrn Lomborg's book, &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot;.In December 2003 The Danish Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation completely rejected the DCSD finding that &quot;The Skeptical Environmentalist&quot; was &quot;objectively dishonest&quot; or &quot;clearly contrary to the standards of good scientific practice&quot;.The Ministry, which is responsible for the DCSD, found that the committee's judgment was not backed up by documentation and was &quot;completely void of argumentation&quot; for the claims of dishonesty and lack of good scientific practice.The Ministry invalidated the original finding and sent the case back to DCSD, where it was up to the committee to decide whether to reopen the case for a new trial.&quot;The committee decision is as one would expect,&quot; Environmental Assessment Institute director Bjrn Lomborg said today. &quot;More than two years have passed since the case against my book was started.

This is a book that is important to read to get some perspective on the exaggerations and distortions fed to us and repeated uncritically by the mostly mindless press.As Lomborg points out more than once in the book, there is real environmental work to do and there are real environmental decisions to be made, but there is so much noise and so much distortion by advocacy groups competing for money and others competing for publicity that it can be hard to get government to do what will really work instead of wasting needed money on foolish enterprises.The &quot;review&quot; by the appropriately-named Mr. Fog is nothing more than a hatchet job by someone who helped launch the now-discredited Danish Committee on Scientific Dishonesty and who helped contribute to a lengthy book in Danish attacking Lomborg's. Lomborg's response to the book shows some of its inaccuracies and distortions and can be found on his web site &lt;http://www.lomborg.com/critique.htm&gt;.The policy stakes here are high. Even higher is the cost of the intellectual pollution offered by dishonest &quot;activists&quot; to the information level of some important pubilc debates.

It would have been very useful to see acoherent review of data, without adherence to political ideology --which is what this book bills itself as, but fails to be. Lomborg hascarefully cherrypicked the sources of his information, generallyignoring actual peer-reviewed research data in favor of repackagedmedia clips, in order to give a uniformly rosy view of the world. Hepresents things as clear-cut and simplistic that are uniformly morecomplex (for instance, confusing issues between coal and oil reservesthat *exist*, and those that are *recoverable*; and in his chapter onpopulation, calculating population per total landmass rather thanpopulation per *usable* landmass -- his calculations look much better,but are not realistic when viewed against the fact that the SaharaDesert, the Antarctic, and similar regions are in the main notconducive to supporting a human population). And throughout the bookhe conveniently ignores data that contradicts what he has chosen toquote, something that peer-reviewed scientists are not allowed to getaway with.And that brings us to the further level of deceptioninvolved in this book -- it is, indeed, \\"peer-reviewed\\", but thosepeers were chosen from the fields of the social sciences, primarilypsychology. This was not reviewed by a single environmental,biological, climate or even agricultural scientist before publication-- quite possibly because they would have made him go back and rewritethe thing."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg's book and following events have managed to paint, in the eyes of the most nave, the image of an environmentalist community that lobbies their biased theories for a mixture of fanatism, research funding, and plain stupidity. The events in which the Danish Council for Scientific Dishonesty first found Lomborg guilty and then had to acquit him after political pressures from the government (that later supported Lomborg, might be mentioned) helped to paint the image of a modern-day Galileo.However, facts point in another direction. First, Lomborg's qualifications are irrelevant to his book's subject: he is no climatologist, no statistician (he only taught a course in statistics), but a political scientist. He published to date only one publication in a peer-reviewed journal, on game theory. Presenting one's new theories to the press or in book form is one of the most certain signs of scientific nonsense, just like what happened for cold fusion.But let's admit we do have a modern day Galileo, who after all had no degree in Optics himself. Reading his book proves convincing to many, and indeed much of the reasoning seems correct-until one checks the sources. Most readers never check the references, possibly because it is tedious, and/or they have no access to a university library. Even for those who could and would do it, Lomborg has been quite subtle at misquoting some authors, and one wonders how such subtlety could be achieved by mere navet&eacute; and ignorance.For the example of the air quality of London, Lomborg took data from a theoretical study of pollution in London in the past 500 years (published in peer-review literature), and multiplied the data plot almost tenfold, writing in a note that \\"the scale had been adjusted\\". However, the plots do look similar, and an unattentive controller could overlook the gross difference in scale. This way, the reader is led to believe that air quality in London in 1600 was as bad, if not worse, than during the industrial revolution.Lomborg manages to claim that forest area is growing worldwide. To demonstrate this, he points to data from UN agency FAO. Since the end of WW2, FAO kept records of forest area in various countries, but reliability of such estimates in a time when satellites did not exist and when the definition of \\"forest\\" might change from country to country was scarce. In Lomborg's sources, therefore, it appears that all forests in Papua-New Guinea sprung out of nowhere in 1961, and Mongolia's mountain forests in 1959. It is interesting to note that FAO had published a revised edition of their estimates before the English edition of the Skeptical Environmentalist, in which a clear trend to reduction is visible; and of course these data did not make it into Lomborg's book.[...]In brief, I think this book is full of false allegations that are \\"proven\\" through systematic and subtle deception. Lomborg has proven himself skilled in twisting references to lead to the conclusions of his own agenda. Whereas he accuses climatologists of producing alarmistic research in search of funding, he has made quite a career with his book, that probably proved to be an excellent investment for him.I give two stars to this book for one reason: it taught me how it is important to check the sources, and thoroughly so. It has also taught me how easy it can be to deceive people on matters they are not competent enough to judge for themselves.As I final note, I would ask the reader NOT to believe me. Please, check for yourself. Look at some of Fog's site allegations, print one of errors reported, go to a well-furnished library and do verify them for yourself."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Well, that's a lie, I've read the first 130 pages and the conclusion, but I get the gist. :)This is actually a refreshing book. Despite the harsh criticism here from rabid environmentalists, Bjorn Lomborg originally is an environmentalist and remains so, and is also not apparently right wing (although he seems to have a very good understanding of economics despite this).As such his conclusion is that more work on the environment STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE, but it's not as bad as the doomsayers make out. That's why I'm skeptical as to whether some of the reviewers here have actually opened a page of the book. That's hardly a right wing attitude, although it is realistic.The book is very interesting, particularly the graphs as one reviewer noted. The graphs alone are worth the price of purchase. Such information as the graph of known oil reserves over time is fascinating, as is the table of leisure time used over the years.Reading this book has actually made me a little more environmentalist, as now I have something a bit more logical to go on and practical.Disclosure: I started out life holding left wing, environmental views up until age 12-14, when the hypocrisy and lies of the movements made me fed up with them. You can only cry wolf so many times (Erlich, Marx, etc.) about catastrophy and coming revolution before you get a little skeptical.Then I swung the other way, becoming big L libertarian for a few years, up until age 23 or so. Since then I have swung back towards the centre somewhat - looking at things on a case by case basis as to whether a government or private solution is better, without a religion (government is the answer/government is the problem) to guide me."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Most of us just \\"know\\" that the planet is in bad shape.

Coming to conclusions about our situation that are based on evidence makes for a refreshing change from the constant indoctrination of the passionate cries of environmental alarmists.I appreciate Mr. Lomborg's use of responsible statistical analysis in the examination of the available evidence on environmental subjects. This kind of approach will allow us to make good judgments about our allocation of resources for solving the world's problems, and reflects the right kind of level-headed attitude so often missing in the environmental movement.I recommend this read as a healthy antidote to an increasingly alarmist attitude towards ecology.

The Cornucopian and celebratory view presented here and the equally self-righteous criticism by some environemntalists is disturbing. There needs to be a more reasoned way to approach this topic and alas both sides are too polarized to do justice to the issues at hand.The biggest problem with Lomborg is his equivocation under the pretense of objectivity. While environmentalists may be accused of the same, they tend to predicate their perspectives on morally premised relativism and are thus more humble about the human perception of nature.

Lomborg's narrative implies that things are fine, the world is better not worse, what's all the fuss about? Environmentalists are enraged: the only reason they are getting better is because we've been working so hard, and we need to work harder!In my opinion, Lomborg isn't suggesting that the world become complacent, despite his unfortunate tone. Instead he is suggesting that the world's efforts be directed to where they are most needed, as determined by a scientific rather than an emotional judgement. To that end, he provides a great deal of scientific data. The data itself is mostly undisputed, with some exceptions (population density for example). But for the most part, the graphs he present are accurate and representative.These graphs are the true value of this book. Within a couple of minutes, I can find a graphs of population growth, cancer rates, poverty, global average temperatures, rice yields per acre, etc; valuable information which was previously impractical for me to obtain. With this information, I can make my own judgement about facts or opinions that appear in the media.You can't accept every opinion Lomborg offers, but that's his point: everybody has an agenda.

This book lets you do that."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"As a professor with a good knowledge of statistics and public policy issues (though not an expert on environmental issues), the anger on both sides of this issue is part of the problem.The Scientific American asked 4 generally respected scientists who had written strongly pro-environmentalist pieces to evaluate the book for their journal (most were people whom Lomborg had caught using false scare tactics in the past). The editor added his criticisms as well. In a later issue Lomborg was given only 1 page to respond to all 5 critical pieces. Lomborg then wrote a very long response to every single paragraph of criticism, a response that can be found on the website of Scientific American for downloading.I just finished reading all the Scientific American's criticisms and Lomborg's response to each supposed error and Lomborg gets much the better of the argument. Frankly, it is shocking that his critics could have made so many obvious and unscientific errors. The Scientific American critics did catch a very few small errors which Lomborg promptly corrected on his website, but the many errors that Lomborg caught in the Scientific American reviews stand uncorrected to this day. Sadly, I don't think enough reasonable people are working in these fields to sort out these matters one way or the other for us lay people--which is a shame.Before you make up your mind, please read both the criticisms and Lomborg's response (which repeats every word of the criticisms). Those who are quick to suggest that Lomborg's work is riddled with errors should see how specious most of the criticisms are. What comes through quite clearly is that Lomborg's standards for accuracy, fairness and balance in argumentation are higher than those of his critics.But is Lomborg right in the overall argument? I can't tell, but his critics show themselves to be less reliable than Lomborg, so he might well be.Consider these exchanges as fairly typical examples. Note that Lomborg's critics have a very unscientific approach to environmental policy (which is the point of the book):[SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (John Bongaarts):] \\"Agricultural expansion, however, will be costly, especially if global food production has to rise twofold or even threefold to accommodate the demand for better diets from several billion more people. The land now used for agriculture is generally of better quality than unused, potentially cultivable land. Similarly, existing irrigation systems have been built on the most favorable sites. And water is increasingly in short supply in many countries as the competition for that resource among households, industry and agriculture intensifies. Consequently, each new increase in food production is becoming more expensive to obtain. This is especially true if one considers environmental costs not reflected in the price of agricultural products.\\"[LOMBORG'S RESPONSE:] \\"This is one of the stunningly simplistic analyses from the environmental Litany: Since we have already used the best land sites with the easiest irrigation etc., an expansion of the agricultural production will lead to higher prices. However, this clearly neglects the historical trend towards ever more efficient production and better crops which has given us steadily declining prices. However, Bongaarts simply does not supply any evidence that his scenario of increasing prices should become true--yet, both IFPRI, USDA and the World Bank predicts ever lower prices (IFPRI 1997, 1999; ERS 1997:4; USDA 2000b; Mitchell et al. 1997), which is a continuation of the almost constant decrease in food prices since 1800 (data on wheat prices from 1316-2000 in SE:62).\\"[SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (Bongaarts):] \\"Lomborg's view that the production of more food is a non-issue rests heavily on the fact that world food prices are low and have declined over time. But this evidence is flawed. Massive governmental subsidies to farmers, particularly in the developed countries, keep food prices artificially low. Although technological developments have reduced prices, without these massive subsidies, world food prices would certainly be higher.\\"[LOMBORG'S RESPONSE:] \\"The last hypothetical sentence is true--without subsidies, prices would be higher, but the argument lies with the trend of the price, which is downwards, and has been so since early 1800s. It is still curious that Scientific American lets their critic \`defend science' by referring to such fickle speculation instead of giving real references. Again, this could possibly be due to the fact that all major food analysis institutions still predict decreasing food prices (as above, IFPRI 1997, 1999; ERS 1997:4; USDA 2000b; Mitchell et al. 1997).\\"[SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN (Bongaarts):] \\"The environmental cost of what Paul R. and Anne H. Ehrlich describe as \\"turning the earth into a giant human feedlot\\" could be severe. A large expansion of agriculture to provide growing populations with improved diets is likely to lead to further deforestation, loss of species, soil erosion, and pollution from pesticides and fertilizer runoff as farming intensifies and new land is brought into production . . . .\\"[LOMBORG'S RESPONSE:] \\"Surprisingly and without any statistical backing, Bongaarts invoke[s] the doomsday metaphor of \\"turning the earth into a giant human feedlot.\\" However, as we saw above, we are currently using about 11% of the global land surface area for agriculture, and in 2030, where we will be feeding more than 8 billion much better (3100 calories per person) we will be using 12%--hardly \\"turning the earth into a giant human feedlot.\\" Moreover, had Bongaarts accessed the available statistics, he could have seen that the increase in agricultural land use was actually bigger over the last 25 years than the coming 30 years (increasing land use by 0.173Gha, compared to the expected increase of 0.12Gha, FAO 2000d:105).\\" ...In Lomborg's response, there is much more like these exchanges--which reflects very badly on the ethical and scientific standards at Scientific American."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"...In my opinion (and I do possess a doctorate in biology and have experience in environmental areas) much of Dr. Lombard's analysis is pointed in the right directions. In my experience many environmentalists are very emotional and idealistic but not highly informed and don't possess much, if any, balance in their understanding of their favorite issues. In truth a few activist organizations provide much of the information that drives the activist masses. Beyond doubt Lomborg has caught these organizations in the act of producing a great deal of very sloppy research, no matter what mistakes of his own he has made in this gigantic analysis. Thus the impetus behind the hysterical trashings of his book.However sloppy their research may often be, it must be said that environmental activists are responsible for pushing much absolutely needed change and that much remains to be done which will only likely be done by their efforts. We benefit from environmental activism in tremendous ways, the Great Lakes have sizable fish populations again and the Ohio River no longer catches fire, to name just two obvious examples of the benefits of environmental activism over the years. However in order to make a reasonable future allocation of society's resources in the area of environmental protection it is very necessary to make a large-scale statistical analysis of the environment such as Dr. Lomborg's. Anybody who trusts environmentalists to provide such an analysis is very naive. The academic system of &quot;studies&quot; programs turns out a great deal of absolutely unbalanced pseudo analysis, any thoughtful person who has read an environmental studies textbook knows this. Unfortunately, truly junk science is very often being presented as higher education. Dr. Lombard has successfully debunked a great deal of this. Obviously some segments of the environmental community are less than grateful and fiercely resent having their beliefs examined.The book is so comprehensive that it does raise doubt as to how any person could be capable of interpreting and discussing so many different scientific areas. The book has been criticized on this point already, a criticism not easily dismissed. Dr Lombard has in truth published no papers in any of the fields he discusses. However, his expertise is in statistics, not biology or physics or such. As a statistician his analysis is generally a valid one. There is no doubt that for many complex issues the statistics do need to be interpreted by persons with specialized knowledge, knowledge not likely possessed by Lomborg. This point does not detract from the usefulness of his statistical work however. Not all the issues Dr. Lomborg treats in the book are so complex that they defy analysis by a statistical expert, which Dr Lomborg unarguably is. On the more complex issues, let the experts turn their attentions to his analysis, it will be a fruitful exercise ( If done honestly!) and our knowledge of our environment will be the better for it. However let us also scrutinize the specialists very carefully, as Lomborg has. Whether they like it or not, environmentalists will have to work with a much greater degree of honesty and accuracy in the post Skeptical Environmentalist era because many of the points in the book are dead on.Although it is a solid professional work, the book certainly is not correct in all of its aspects. There are obvious problems with applying the statistics to some environmental issues. Looking at data from a very broad view may disguise smaller-scale issues which are still tremendously important. For example even if we are losing species at much slower rate than activists claim, we are still losing species at an unacceptable rate. Moreover, losing panda bears is equivalent statistically to losing a minor species of slugs. Yet most of us would care WHICH species we are losing, Tigers and Cheetahs and Panda Bears matter more to us and say more about the changing environmental conditions than do miniscule species at the bottom of the food chain (though these species too have their passionate defenders). Lomborg seems to be on the shakiest ground when he discusses global warming due to his lack of credentials as an atmospheric scientist. How can he make a more meaningful interpretation of the possible scenarios than the experts? On the issue of global warming it is real scientists who drive the analysis, not activists...."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has compiled an amazing amount of data and presents it thoughtfully and thoroughly. He brings a scientific mindset to the environmentalist movement. If you find that fear mongering and factually challenged arguments aren't cutting it anymore, this is the book for you. The scope of his work is stunning. The Skeptical Environmentalist is a must have for anyone who is frustrated when anecdotal evidence is presented as science in the media."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This book certainly made waves within the environmental protection community, and for good reason. Lomborg takes a systematic, statistics-based approach to shooting down pretty much every doomsday theory on the environment. From pollution to global warming, from food shortages to disease, his well-reasoned and exhaustively-researched arguments make it pretty clear that environmental groups have exaggerated the precarious state of the world.Having said that, I should note that I am neither an expert in statistics or environmental science, so perhaps Lomborg has simply fooled me the same way that he claims environmentalists have been fooling the masses for decades. But it's indicative of something, I think, that nobody has come along yet to refute his arguments. From what I've heard, the statistical evidence that he presents is air-tight.This is an excellent book for anyone who is interested in environmental science but perhaps does not have the in-depth knowledge or interest required to read some of the more technical studies. Lomborg presents his arguments in simple language, and while the statistics that he cites can get tiresome, it is not in any way a difficult read. What's more, he presents an overview of all the major environmental concerns in just 350 pages, as opposed to focusing on one specific problem (or worse, spending thousands of pages to cover everything).And you'll learn some fascinating facts that will stick with you for a long time. Like for example, did you know that cats kill more birds each day than the Exxon Valdez oil spill killed? Or that the U.S. could satisfy it's entire need for garbage landfills for the next century with a plot of land less than 30 square miles? At the very least, it's good material for cocktail parties."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Jan 9th 2003From The Economist:THE Bjorn Lomborg saga took a decidedly Orwellian turn this week. Readers will recall that Mr Lomborg, a statistician and director of Denmark's Environmental Assessment Institute, is the author of \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\", which attacks the environmental lobby for systematically exaggerated pessimism. Environmentalists have risen as one in furious condemnation of Mr Lomborg's presumption in challenging their claims, partly no doubt because he did it so tellingly. This week, to the delight of greens everywhere, Denmark's Committees on Scientific Dishonesty ruled on the book as follows: \\"Objectively speaking, the publication of the work under consideration is deemed to fall within the concept of scientific dishonesty.\\"How odd. Why, in the first place, is a panel with a name such as this investigating complaints against a book which makes no claim to be a scientific treatise? \\"The Skeptical Environmentalist\\" is explicitly not concerned with conducting scientific research. Rather, it measures the \\"litany\\" of environmental alarm that is constantly fed to the public against a range of largely uncontested data about the state of the planet. The litany comes off very badly from the comparison. The environmental movement was right to find the book a severe embarrassment. But since the book was not conducting scientific research, what business is it of a panel concerned with scientific dishonesty?One might expect to find the answer to this question in the arguments and data supporting the ruling-but there aren't any. The material assembled by the panel consists almost entirely of a synopsis of four articles published by Scientific American last year. (We criticised those articles and the editorial that ran with them in our issue of February 2nd 2002.) The panel seems to regard these pieces as disinterested science, rather than counter-advocacy from committed environmentalists. Incredibly, the complaints of these self-interested parties are blandly accepted at face value. Mr Lomborg's line-by-line replies to the criticisms ... are not reported. On its own behalf, the panel offers not one instance of inaccuracy or distortion in Mr Lomborg's book: not its job, it says. On this basis it finds Mr Lomborg guilty of dishonesty.The panel's ruling-objectively speaking-is incompetent and shameful."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Bjorn Lomborg, Associate Professor of Statistics at Denmark's Aarhus University, aims to allow us to see the real state of the world more clearly by confronting myths with data. He seeks to use only the best available statistical information from internationally recognised research institutes: 2930 references and a 70-page bibliography attest to the depth of his research into health, life expectancy, food, forests, resources, pollution and global warming.For example, we are constantly told that our forests are vanishing, but according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the world's forests covered 40.24 million square kilometres in 1950, and 43.04 million in 1994. 80% of the world's original rainforest is still intact.The evidence that Lomborg presents undermines the misanthropic scare mongering of leading environmentalists like Paul Ehrlich, who said in 1967 that India was doomed. Lomborg explodes the Greens' litany of disaster and their liberal contempt for productive forces; he shows how wonderfully creative workers are, and how technological progress brings great benefits. Listening to some Greens, you would think that our factories produced only pollution! In the historic debate between the anti-industry parson Malthus and the pro-industry Marx, Lomborg is clearly with Marx.Unfortunately, Lomborg mistakenly credits \`market economies', not workers' creativity, for this progress, although, as he notes, the most important welfare improvement of the last 50 years was achieved in post-revolutionary China, and the most significant worsening of welfare has happened in post-counter-revolutionary Russia and Eastern Europe.Some environmentalists mistakenly damn GM foods, pesticides, the chlorination of water and vaccination, technological achievements that all help to save us from killer diseases. As Lomborg points out, nobody has died from eating GM foods, or from cancer caused by pesticides, or from chlorination or vaccination. Banning GM foods and pesticides would reduce yields of fruit and veg, making them dearer and diets worse, and would therefore increase deaths from cancer. Peru didn't chlorinate its water, which resulted in the cholera epidemic of 1991. Falling rates of vaccination are increasing the risks of lethal epidemics.He does not ignore the huge problems facing the world: every year, ten million children under the age of five die of preventable diseases; 1.1 billion people still have no clean drinking water, and 2.5 billion have no access to sanitation. But to solve these problems, we need a clear-headed prioritisation of resources, not counsels of despair."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Science claims its legitimacy on different grounds from other modes of thought. Science requires prediction.This is an active argument in academia today. Social Science must predict whereas failure to predict relegates your work to the field of social opinion. In a liberal democracy we let anyone hold any opinion they want but to qualify as a scientific theory your opinion must be capable of being tested and eventually of passing the test.How then are we to judge environmentalism? Is it science? Or is it merely just feeling good about feeling bad?Professor Lomborg examines the predictions of environmentalists. The short answer is that every prediction that is specific enough to be tested has been shown to have been wrong. The most egregious examples are the many millenial doomsday predictions of Paul Erlich but there are many other examples.This book is NOT a book against the environment. It is a book about the opinions of some who claim to speak for the environment. Do they in fact hold scientific opinions?This book has met with strong opposition from some members of the environmentalist lobby. There is an unprecedented series of essays in the latest issue of Scientific American. All these essays have a strident tone of outrage. They are written in something like an inchoherent rage. Yet they only attack minor issues of error or emphasis in a very large book. They never come to grips with the clear fact that virtually all environment predictions of the past have been outrageously wrong.The issues raised in this book should no longer be controversial. All the evidence is in. Population and environment doomsday predictions have always been wrong and continue to be wrong in a very big way. The Scientific American critics of this book carp on minor issues (some say he has too many foot notes, other say it doesn't have enough). None of them are willing to recognize that Erlich, Borgstrom, the Club of Rome, and the Sierra Club have virtually never made a valid prediction and have made a long series of fantastic predictions that have failed.A few years ago there was a book and a theory called Cognitive Dissonance. It was a theory created to account for the observable fact that cults that predicted the end of the earth tended to experience new growth and energy after their predictions failed. The true believers redoubled their faith when on the apponted day the sky refused to fall.Another explanation for the bizarly tenacious faith of environmentalism is the &quot;Watermelon&quot; effect - green on the outside, red on the inside. Much present day environmentalism has inherited the hard leftists who have been left disenfranchised by the fall of international communism. For many of them the struggle is against property and ownership. They put on the mantle of protectors of environment so they can get in their licks against landlords and factory owners. They like to think that nature agrees with them that western capitalism is evil.Professor Lomborg doesn't spend much time with these kind of speculations as too motives. He just goes about nailing down the evidence with largely impartial scholarship. Thoughout his tone is very fair and neutral. He is not at all an anti-environmental extremist. Most of that group will find Lomborg's views on renewables to be too optimistic. Similarly Lomborg accepts anti-nuclear arguments without much protest. Danes have long been concerned with the environment. In all Lomborg is a Dane and is very much in that Scandinavian mold of moderation, fair mindedness and a friend of nature. He just wants some science too."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"It's hard to believe that at some level everyone is not an environmentalist to a degree. The problem is that the hype surrounding the various environmental issues turns people like me off. Some of the claims are clearly fiction and it's hard to sort it all out.This book does a great job of cutting through the hype and getting to the facts to that we can make good choices about the environment. Choices based on facts not hype.One of the first things that Lomborg shows is that everyone has a horse in this race - there are no unbiased observers. Scientists and environmental organizations make $millions by scaring people oil companies make $millions selling products that produce pollution. They both are biased.If you really care about the environment you should read this book."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg has done something quite rare. He has honestly analyzed his own opinions and found that they are unsupported by the facts. Then he has modified his views so that they agree with the evidence. That is the way it is should work in science and society but generally does not.This is an excellent text for students since it covers every major environmental issue and with great attention to accuracy and detail. It is also well worth a read by the intelligent person interested in the best current evidence about &quot;the state of the world.&quot;I have only two objections to the book. Lomborg seems to look favorably on the Chinese government's coercive and immoral population control methods, though he amply demonstrates that overpopulation is not a great concern. He also seems to retain the naive view that hard core environmentalists will be persuaded by evidence when he demonstrates again and again that deceipt is their weapon of choice. These people no more respond to reason than do the Taliban. Both are driven by mystical fanaticism. It is odd that Lomborg still considers himself a leftist since this book is a lesson in the advantages of market-based approaches to environmental management.Those interested in this book should also read the works of Julian Simon, the economist whose opinions caused Lomborg to write this book. Simon was the master at debunking ecomyths and Amazon has a nice selection of his books."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Firstly, this book is very controversial. *Mr Lomborg's basic assertion, is that the state of the world, as a whole, and human life in general, is getting better, not worse, and that the alarmist claims of some environmentalists are exaggerated*.Mr Lomborg is an expert in statistics, with a background in political science. A very readable and up to date overview of the human and environmental state of the world is presented, and includes:a) Human welfare-life expectancy, infant mortality, infectious disease rates, food availability, dietary habits.b) future human prosperity based on measurable trends-forest cover, energy resources, non-energy resources, water availability and quality.c) pollution issues-air, acid rain, indoor pollution, allergies and asthma, water pollution (eg Exxon Valdez and other oil spills), waste issues.d) Future issues-chemical, pesticides, cancer rates and causes, GM foods, biodiversity, extinction, global warming-causes and consequences.The first 2 chapters concern discussion of the more common doomsday reports, the underlying assumptions upon which some of these are based, and the problems of a sensationalist-driven media. It is obvious from these initial discussions, and what is just common sense, that selective reporting and human politics pervades environmentalism as much as any other human activity. What Mr Lomborg tries to show, is that we need to channel peoples concerns and energies, as much as possible, into real priorities concerning the environment, and not rely on the doomsday theorists to frighten us by selective use of statistics, and thus clouding issues of prioritisation.He presents longer term trends to show how human welfare is in some ways getting much better (infant mortality, illness decline, technological advance, increased wealth, life expectancy), however some or much of this is undoubtedly due to 'environmental' achievements (such as lower pollution, regulation of food and drugs). Many environmentalists of course contend that human prosperity is occurring at the great expense of the environment in general, however Mr Lomborg's general assertion is that this effect itself is declining, not increasing, even as humans increase-(eg due to better technology, more efficient use of resources, recycling, research, alternative materials, environmental priorities, etc).One major concern in the book is that there seems to be little express acknowledgement that the committment, energy, and scientific concern that people genuinely concerned about the environment, misguided in some instances or not, have had on the very statistics which he presents. It is implied, but not expressly discussed.His assertion that biodiversity decline is real but grossly exaggerted is one of his more questionable assertions. He challenges the specialist biologists on this matter directly, and I think here, as in a few other cases, he is mistaken, claiming that extinction rates over the next 50 years are likely to be 'only' about 0.7%. It even seems that he uses weaknesses in his detractors arguments to support some of his assertions, eg that because we can't measure species decline in many small species for example, this means it is exaggerated. What also is not discussed, is whether some of the effects of this decline are overstated. Ecosystems are interconnected and fragile, but if a more benign species increases at the expense of a less benign species, is this desirable? Are selective pressures partially manageable?Whilst he has made some very good points, especially with regards to human welfare (the past was never a 'golden age'), he does appear to have overstated his case with regards to more direct environmental issues (eg extinction, biodiversity, forest cover). It is important to stress that Mr Lomborg does some very good work in exposing some blatant and serious mistakes about environmental data (eg the claim that 40% of deaths are caused by pollution, that we woud run out of oil by 1992). In covering a range of difficult scientific specialities, no doubt he has made some factual errors. (I can see one with regard to my field of geology-there is no mention of the problem of rate of extraction of oil shale/tar sands). But the point is not trivial mistakes, but broad themes, are things getting worse or better?-well it really depends on what you are referring to.Some people have pointed out that the material in this book will be used by those in power to further their own exploitative ends and/or maintain the status quo. Of course, unfortunately, this is true. But what this book is trying to explain, is that *these sorts of things also go on amongst those who have an active concern for the world*. It simply isn't always as obvious.Mr Lomborg, I hope, is not about undermining the passion of those who are actively concerned about this beautiful planet. What he is about, is targetting and setting this good energy where it needs to be, in informed decision making. People like to see things in relative terms-the glass is \\"half full\\" or \\"half empty\\", but really without proper use of statistics and a good understanding of that great leveller-time-we often can't see what is 'relatively' going on. That is what this book is about-what we need to chose to do, what to prioritise, what to use and what to save-natures cup, not constraining human delusions."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"This is a \\"wake up and smell the roses\\" book. It is NOT politically correct.Whether you agree or disagree it is worth reading to understand the arguements being waged in the science media.NOTE: The author is being targeted by many, in what amounts to a \\"witch hunt\\", citing bias and selective data.Also... one of the strongest critics of the book (Schneider, interview in Discover magazine) once stated:\\"... we have to offer up scary scenarios, make simplified, dramatic statements, and make little mention of any doubts we might have. ... Each of us has to decide what the right balance is between being effective and being honest.\\"END NOTEAbout the book:The book points out some serious flaws in the hyperbole of predictions of human induced planetary disasters.The book does not white-wash away problems. There is strong acknowledgement that the world does have problems. They are just not as bad as popularized.Lomborg also points out the solution most likely to be sucessful in avoiding many of these same problems (overpopulation, famine, global warming etc), which is to reduce world poverty, that enables the use of less destructive lifestyle practices.I bought a second copy, because I keep lending the first copy out."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Despite all the latest attacks on Lomborg and his recent publication I have found the opposite to be true after reading this book. It is very enlightening to actually see global comparisons and trends that were formerly just assumptions and manytimes made-up by organizations. I commend Lomborg for setting out to make such a bold statement. Though, I do not exactly agree with every detail, I feel that his state of the world is the closest to the truth. After being in academia studying environmental issues about 6 years ago, his book answers and clarifies many questions and misconceptions that I had. Regardless of what critics say I highly suggest reading this book because, it will help cut through many of the assumptions, lies, and bad information we have seen in the past. This book helps us get down to the root of the issue. Because the environment is such an emotional and almost moral issue with people let yourself be the critic and remember look at facts, not emotional opinions."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Lomborg's critique is so effective because he stays away from speculation and innuendo. The author lays out the facts based on the major research and it is devastating to 'the Litany' (the author's term for the 'sky is always falling' themes that seem to dominate most self-described environmentalist groups) because the facts seldom support the dramatic conclusions of most environmental groups. Lomborg also provides an interesting social-economic perspective by placing environmental considerations into the broader context of human and global well-being. The book is organized in sections which deal with a specific topic, so it is very user-friendly (you can pick it up and read about a single issue, rather than being forced to read it cover to cover). With extensive notes and a high degree of intellectual honesty, Lomborg has done a real service to those of us primarily interested in the truth and what science can tell us about our planet."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"An articulate and well written expose on the 'real state if the world'. Lomborg provides a compelling and accessable study into the environment and the many statements that are made about it on a day-to-day basis. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in a scientific and realistic interpretation of what is actually happening out there."},{"Title":"The Skeptical Environmentalist: Measuring the Real State of the World","review":"Solving our environmental problems requires action from us as voters, consumers, governments and business. But where can we get the most leverage, the most effective outcomes? And how can we avoid prescribing cures with side effects that are worse than the disease?These simple and straightforward questions form the core of Lomborg's work. To improve environmental conditions in the most useful and beneficial way requires hard data, detailed analysis, and a frank recognition of the limits of our knowledge. Lomborg eschews the polemic of extremists on all sides of the environmental debate in favor of rolled-up sleeves and dirt under his fingernails, digging in to the data to understand what's really happening - including areas where our understanding is limited.From time to time Lomborg oversteps his mark with incomplete social analysis, mostly along the lines of &quot;improvements in the environment have come not from government policy but from technological innovation.&quot; He may have a point, but these passages are among the few in the book which are only sparsely backed up with supporting material.Lomborg also sets out to debunk a number of left-wing environmentalist myths. Much of this is spot on; it's high time somebody called these bluffs. Some of his debunking, however, rakes over the cold ashes of arguments set aside ages ago, such as the series of bets in the 1970s between Paul Ehrlich and Julian Simon over future prices of strategic natural resources. As every informed reader would know, Simon won every bet; but the environmental movement has since shifted to higher ground.One can understand why these passages would miff the high priesthood of the environmental movement and produce blind adhominem attacks, such as the rabid articles in the January Scientific American. The brahmins never approve when someone starts slaughtering the sacred cows.One can, however, set these passages aside without affecting Lomborg's main argument, which is that we've got to figure out what to do next based on rigorous data and hard thinking about costs, benefits and priorities, not fuzzy feel-good pronouncements. And it's got to involve informed judgements from ordinary citizens. In the words of the old saw, the environment is too important to leave to the scientists.Lomborg's work is not anti-environmentalist. I imagine that in Lomborg's ideal future, the environmental movement is strong and thriving, punching all the political, commercial and technological buttons it can find to get real environmental problems on the agenda and solved - but with more transparency, and with more constructive input and criticism from ordinary, concerned, informed citizens.What a good idea!"}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],L={key:0},B={key:1};function R(s,o,n,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",E,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",B,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",L,"See more"))],8,M)):p("",!0)])}const q=d(x,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-20dffa10"]]),W=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/29.md","filePath":"library/29.md"}'),H={name:"library/29.md"},D=Object.assign(H,{setup(s){return(o,n)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(q)]))}});export{W as __pageData,D as default};
