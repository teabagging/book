Martin Marty commented that if he had to introduce one man from the Protestant world to tell the church what its agenda should be, that man would be Ellul.The eminent Frenchman now brings us his most profound, most moving theological statement. For years, Jacques Ellul tells us in his preface, he had wanted to write a book on \\"The Age of Abandonment,\\" for it seemed to him that both society and the church had reached that point described in Scripture when God turns his back and is silent. But when he came to elaborate this theme, Ellul found himself inexplicably writing on the theme of hope, despite the fact that his analysis of society remained unchanged. Hope was now no longer a matter of intellect, but a word asked by God of the heart for its salvation.More than ever before, in this book Jacques Ellul shares with readers not only the darkest forebodings of contemporary man's soul, but also his own struggle to emerge from despair to a stronger level of Christian faith--and hope. He writes of hope, not in the vein of Moltmann and Metz, but in a highly original and penetrating manner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k01MAwAAQBAJ&dq=Hope+in+Time+of+Abandonment.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rules for a Pretty Woman","description":"Dr. Lenny Faulkner, a single, African American doctor is living a charmed life in Atlanta; compared to the poor childhood she experienced growing up in Madoosa County, a small southeast section of Georgia that reeks of the local box manufacturing plant.

The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche's first book. Its youthful faults were exposed by Nietzsche in the brilliant \\"Attempt at a Self-Criticism\\" which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down through the Victorian era, and it sounded themes developed in the twentieth century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts, and others. The Case of Wagner (1888) was one Nietzsche's last books, and his wittiest. In attitude and style it is diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects and deal with art and culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche's thought. The distinguished translations by Walter Kaufmann superbly reflect in English Nietzsche's idiom and the vitality of his style. Professor Kaufmann has also furnished running footnote commentaries, relevant passages from Nietzsche's correspondence, a bibliography, and, for the first time in any edition, an extensive index to each book.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2Hn8fkeCXu4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vanity Fair July 2007 Africa Issue, Chris Rock/ Maya Angelou Cover","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aFsTAQAAMAAJ&dq=Vanity+Fair+July+2007+Africa+Issue,+Chris+Rock/+Maya+Angelou+Cover&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlin Apartments (Designpocket)","description":"This book looks at a number of extraordinary living spaces designed by leading architects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RSmJqwb0CNcC&dq=Berlin+Apartments+(Designpocket)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Programmed Review for Electrical Engineering Professional Engineer's Exam","description":"The field of electrical engineering is very innovative-new products and new ideas are continu ally being developed.

Both in its broad sweep and in countless supporting reflections, it is a journey through spiritual scenery of the most majestic and exhilarating kind.

The revelations of prisoner abuse and torture at Abu Ghraib and more recently at Guant namo were shocking to most Americans. And those who condemned the treatment of prisoners abroad have focused on U.S. military procedures and abuses of executive powers in the war on terror, or, more specifically, on the now-famous White House legal counsel memos on the acceptable limits of torture. But in The Story of Cruel and Unusual, Colin Dayan argues that anyone who has followed U.S. Supreme Court decisions regarding the Eighth Amendment prohibition of \\"cruel and unusual\\" punishment would recognize the prisoners' treatment at Abu Ghraib and Guant namo as a natural extension of the language of our courts and practices in U.S. prisons. In fact, it was no coincidence that White House legal counsel referred to a series of Supreme Court decisions in the 1980s and 1990s in making its case for torture.Dayan traces the roots of \\"acceptable\\" torture to slave codes of the nineteenth century that deeply embedded the dehumanization of the incarcerated in our legal system. Although the Eighth Amendment was interpreted generously during the prisoners' rights movement of the late 1960s and 1970s, this period of judicial concern was an anomaly. Over the last thirty years, Supreme Court decisions have once again dismantled Eighth Amendment protections and rendered such words as \\"cruel\\" and \\"inhuman\\" meaningless when applied to conditions of confinement and treatment during detention. Prisoners' actual pain and suffering have been explained away in a rhetorical haze with rationalizations, for example, that measure cruelty not by the pain or suffering inflicted, but by the intent of the person who inflicted it. The Story of Cruel and Unusual is a stunningly original work of legal scholarship, and a searing indictment of the U.S. penal system.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7RHWcQfeqQUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cousin Betty","description":"Cousin Bette (1846), long considered Balzac's last great novel, is a key work in his Comedie humaine.

C. Boyle Stories","description":"A second volume of collected short fiction from the bestselling author and winner of the 2015 Rea Award for the Short Story Few authors write with such sheer love of story and language as T.C. Boyle, and that is nowhere more evident than in his inventive, wickedly funny, and always entertaining short stories. In 1998, T.C. Boyle Stories brought together the author s first four collections to critical acclaim. Now, T.C. Boyle Stories II gathers the work from his three most recent collections along with fourteen new tales previously unpublished in book form as well as a preface in which Boyle looks back on his career as a writer of stories and the art of making them. By turns mythic and realistic, farcical and tragic, ironic and moving, Boyle s stories have mapped a wide range of human emotions. The fifty-eight stories in this new volume, written over the last eighteen years, reflect his maturing themes. Along with the satires and tall tales that established his reputation, readers will find stories speaking to contemporary social issues, from air rage to abortion doctors, and character-driven tales of quiet power and passion. Others capture timeless themes, from first love and its consequences to confrontations with mortality, or explore the conflict between civilization and wildness. The new stories find Boyle engagingly testing his characters  emotional and physical endurance, whether it s a group of giants being bred as weapons of war in a fictional Latin American country, a Russian woman who ignores dire warnings in returning to her radiation-contaminated home, a hermetic writer who gets more than a break in his routine when he travels to receive a minor award, or a man in a California mountain town who goes a little too far in his concern for a widow. Mordant wit, emotional power, exquisite prose: it is all here in abundance. T.C. Boyle Stories II is a grand career statement from a writer whose imagination knows no bounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hLkBDAAAQBAJ&dq=T.+C.+Boyle+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Self-Nurture: Learning to Care for Yourself As Effectively As You Care for Everyone Else","description":"Collects humorous and inspiring stories, easy-to-follow exercises, and meditations that enable readers to shift from personally destructive behaviors to self-nurturing ones.

In this landmark essay collection, Joan Didion brilliantly interweaves her own  bad dreams  with those of a nation confronting the dark underside of 1960s counterculture. From a jailhouse visit to Black Panther Party cofounder Huey Newton to witnessing First Lady of California Nancy Reagan pretend to pick flowers for the benefit of news cameras, Didion captures the paranoia and absurdity of the era with her signature blend of irony and insight. She takes readers to the  giddily splendid  Getty Museum in Los Angeles, the cool mountains of Bogot , and the Jordanian Desert, where Bishop James Pike went to walk in Jesus s footsteps and died not far from his rented Ford Cortina. She anatomizes the culture of shopping malls  toy garden cities in which no one lives but everyone consumes  and exposes the contradictions and compromises of the women s movement. In the iconic title essay, she documents her uneasy state of mind during the years leading up to and following the Manson murders a terrifying crime that, in her memory, surprised no one. Written in  a voice like no other in contemporary journalism,  The White Album is a masterpiece of literary reportage and a fearless work of autobiography by the National Book Awardwinning author of The Year of Magical Thinking (The New York Times Book Review).

Offering information on fertility, pregnancy, birth, and infant care, and written in a chatty, colloquial style, it influenced most other literary works of the period bearing on sex, reproduction, and childcare. Until now, this important text has been unavailable except for a microfilm of the 1654 edition. For this new annotated edition of the 1560 version, Elaine Hobby has modernized the spelling and included informative notes. In her critical introduction, she not only traces the development of the book from its German origins, but also shows how early-modern ideas about the reproductive process combined ancient, medieval, and contemporary conceptions. Combining editorial rigour with a concern for the needs of the informed non-specialist, Hobby has made available a text that will be useful to scholars and students in a range of academic disciplines, including literature, history, and women's studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L0hBDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Perfect Men","description":"In this romantic adventure, the lives of three Houston women become entangled with those of three men they encounter while vacationing at a remote East Texas lake.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FbJvAAAACAAJ&dq=Three+Perfect+Men&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fiddler's Ferry","description":"You can t choose your family...

Using a unique combination of biblical scholarship and folklore methodology, Susan Niditch tracks stories of biblical characters who become heroes against the odds, either through trickery or through native wisdom, physical prowess, and the help of human or divine agents. In this volume, originally published as Underdogs and Tricksters, Niditch examines three cross-sections of the Old Testament in detail: stories in Genesis in which patriarchs pretend that their wives are really their sisters; the contrasting stories of two younger sons, the trickster Jacob and the earnest underdog Joseph; and the story of Esther as a paradigm of feminine wisdom pitted against unjust authority. Linking these Old Testament heroes to the legendary tricksters and underdogs of other cultures, Niditch shows how the Israelites' worldview and self-image are reflected in the way biblical authors tell their stories. Through a thoughtful analysis of style, content, narrative choices, and attitudes to issues of gender and political authority in biblical narrative, A Prelude to Biblical Folklore draws persuasive conclusions about the identity, location, and provenance of the stories' authors and their audiences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=y7bqrQq4htkC&dq=A+Prelude+to+Biblical+Folklore:+UNDERDOGS+AND+TRICKSTERS&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Popular Politics and the English Reformation (Cambridge Studies in Early Modern British History)","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MiiTzO6NsdMC&dq=Popular+Politics+and+the+English+Reformation+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Early+Modern+British+History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Companion to Baugh and Cable's A History of the English Language","description":"In the spirit of the main text, the Companion pays attention to the linguistic effects of social, political, and literary events. The maps are designed to set the geographical contexts for these cultural influences during the Indo-European period, the Middle Ages, and the eras of the British Empire and of American ascendancy. The pre-chapter on The Sounds of English contains phonetic information and exercises that should be helpful in most of the chapters that follow. The Questions for Review that begin each chapter give an overview of the most important topics in each period and serve as a checklist of items that should be familiar in any discussion of the history of English. Now that we are into the second decade of the twenty-first century, a twelfth chapter has been added to the main text. Because English as a global language is a central issue in its history at this point, the questions for review in Chapter 12 raise topics for discussion concerning the major languages of the world, prospects for the future, and less obvious issues such as the relative complexity of languages. The headings for most sections are followed by a corresponding section number in the History.On many topics the amount of exposition preceding the exercises varies more or less inversely with the amount in the History, the idea being to have a full discussion of important topics without a duplication between the two books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dxaMZwEACAAJ&dq=A+Companion+to+Baugh+and+Cable%27s+A+History+of+the+English+Language&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Desperate Remedy: Henry Gresham and the Gunpowder Plot; A Novel","description":"Thief. Informer. Double-dealer. Pimp. Will Shadwell may not be the most moral of men, but to gentleman spy Henry Gresham he is invaluable. During the reign of King James I a man must know his enemies to survive and Shadwell is one of Gresham's best sources. Then Shadwell is discovered brutally murdered. And before Gresham is able to establish why, he is summoned by the man he fears most: Robert Cecil, the King's Machiavellian Chief Secretary. Cecil wants Gresham to investigate Sir Francis Bacon's private life. When Gresham begins his inquiries, he uncovers a plot so audacious it is scarcely believable: a conspiring clutch of Catholic lords and a trail of gunpowder underneath the Houses of Parliament. From the court of King James to the deadly underworld of Jacobean London, Martin Stephen's superb debut novel is as rich in atmosphere as it is in tension. Historical fiction of the highest order, The Desperate Remedy is a thrilling tale of courtly machinations.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3ZB-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antepasados: Surveyors in history","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wpz0tgAACAAJ&dq=Antepasados:+Surveyors+in+history&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bella Luna","description":"A girl wishes on the moon that daytime will never end, but when her wish comes true she discovers that the world needs a time of darkness and rest.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BoH_PAAACAAJ&dq=Bella+Luna&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bongwater","description":"This novel of young slackers in 1990s Portland and New York City is  a swift, exhilarating read [and] a surprisingly sweet-natured love story  (Madison Smartt Bell).

Covering subjects as diverse as tactics, the uses of autobiography, and the power of myth-making in the southern tradition, they illustrate the rewards of imaginative scholarship--even for the most intensely studied battle in America's history. The Third Day at Gettysburg and Beyond brings current research and interpretation to bear on a range of pivotal issues surrounding the final day of the battle, July 3, 1863. This revisionist approach begins by expanding our knowledge of the engagement itself: individual essays address Confederate general James Longstreet's role in Pickett's Charge and Union general George Meade's failure to pursue Lee after the fighting. Other essays widen the scope of investigation to look at contemporary reactions to the Confederate defeat across the South, the construction of narratives by the participants themselves--from Confederate survivors of Pickett's assault to Union sergeant Ben Hirst--and the reverberations of Pickett's final momentous charge. Combining fresh evidence with the reinterpretation of standard sources, these essays refocus our view of the third day at Gettysburg to take in its diverse stories of combat and memory. The contributors are Gary W. Gallagher, William Garrett Piston, Carol Reardon, Robert K. Krick, Robert L. Bee, and A. Wilson Greene.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sEQTfRZ-FwEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hats, Gloves, Scarves","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yu32zQEACAAJ&dq=Hats,+Gloves,+Scarves&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft SQL Server 2005: Changing the Paradigm (SQL Server 2005 Public Beta Edition)","description":"&Quot;This powerhouse reference covers the entire breadth of SQL Server 2005 features including XML, SOA, .NET, business intelligence, administration, scalability, reliability, security, performance, and high-availability.

This personal account by a biocultural anthropologist illuminates not-soon-forgotten messages involving the sobering aspects of fieldwork among malnourished children in West Africa. With nutritional anthropology at its core, Dancing Skeletons presents informal, engaging, and oftentimes dramatic stories that relate the author s experiences conducting research on infant feeding and health in Mali. Through fascinating vignettes and honest, vivid descriptions, Dettwyler explores such diverse topics as ethnocentrism, culture shock, population control, breastfeeding, child care, the meaning of disability and child death in different cultures, female circumcision, women s roles in patrilineal societies, the dangers of fieldwork, and facing emotionally draining realities. Readers will laugh and cry as they meet the author s friends and informants, follow her through a series of encounters with both peri-urban and rural Bambara culture, and struggle with her as she attempts to reconcile her very different roles as objective ethnographer, subjective friend, and mother in the field. The 20th Anniversary Edition includes a 13-page  Q&A with the Author  in which Dettwyler responds to typical questions she has received individually from students who have been assigned Dancing Skeletons as well as audience questions at lectures on various campuses. The new 23-page  Update on Mali, 2013  chapter is a factual update about economic and health conditions in Mali as well as a brief summary of the recent political unrest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQVhAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vacant Spaces","description":"Vacant Spaces NY begins gathering the incomplete data available and documenting vacant spaces in New York City. Organized from large to small, general to specific, vacancy in the United States to case studies of specific vacancies in Manhattan, Michael Meredith, Hilary Sample, and their architecture studio MOS imagine possibilities for repurposing current vacant spaces in New York City. This project began by walking around our neighborhood noticing empty storefronts. Once we saw them, they were everywhere. They followed us, appearing quietly throughout New York City. Many with no signage, no \\"for rent,\\" no \\"coming soon.\\" Usually empty, sometimes dusty, sometimes with brown paper covering the glass. Now, vacancy has only increased. In the densest city in the United States. During a housing crisis. Throughout a pandemic. The quantity of vacant spaces is anyone's best guess. It's only partially documented. They hide in plain sight. Vacant Spaces NY is organized from large to small, general to specific. It begins by looking at vacancy within the United States and continues down to each Manhattan neighborhood, where we zoom into specific vacant spaces, where we have provided as case studies that imagine some possibilities for transforming current vacant spaces into housing or social services. There is also a section on Covid 19, which infiltrated New York during our research. As a whole, this document is not meant to provide specific solutions. The data is incomplete. Case studies are limited. We are not policy experts or data analysts or urban planners.

With some of the fastest speeds and lowest prices in the world for high-speed Internet access, the nation was poised to be the global leader in the new knowledge-based economy. Today that global competitive advantage has all but vanished because of a series of government decisions and resulting monopolies that have allowed dozens of countries, including Japan and South Korea, to pass us in both speed and price of broadband. This steady slide backward not only deprives consumers of vital services needed in a competitive employment and business market it also threatens the economic future of the nation. This important book by leading telecommunications policy expert Susan Crawford explores why Americans are now paying much more but getting much less when it comes to high-speed Internet access. Using the 2011 merger between Comcast and NBC Universal as a lens, Crawford examines how we have created the biggest monopoly since the breakup of Standard Oil a century ago. In the clearest terms, this book explores how telecommunications monopolies have affected the daily lives of consumers and America's global economic standing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=G4KCPGnKFEUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Process Algebra (Cambridge Tracts in Theoretical Computer Science)","description":"Process algebra, also known as the Algebra of Communicating Processes (ACP), is a mathematical theory or model of computer processes, particularly concurrent systems.

Given that approximately ninety percent of advertising dollars are spent in media, a sound understanding of media planning is essential for the researcher and professional media planner alike. Although this book provides a novel and advanced approach to media planning, the basics are covered as well, making the book suitable for trainees. The authors argue that current media planning is still too conventional, that while reach and frequency are not incorrect, they are certainly too simplistic for modern media planning. This book introduces the advanced concept of using reach patterns in making the reach decision, and develops the method of factoring in effective frequency when making the frequency decision. Reach patterns are an entirely new concept. Effective frequency, while not new, needs proper definition and an operational formula for its calculation, both of which are provided here. Other new concepts are introduced and shown to be necessary for choosing an appropriate media strategy.

Charting the trail across the Great Plains from New York City to the Mexican Territory of California, a headstrong couple embarks on a new life in this classic work of historical fiction as unforgiving, moving, and unpredictable as the frontier. A recent finishing school graduate, eighteen-year-old Garnet Cameron is desperate for direction. Too driven for the restrictive manners of the upper class, Garnet is naturally drawn to Oliver Hale, a frontier trader from the West. Unlike the men to whom she s accustomed, Oliver treats Garnet as an equal and respects her independence. His tales of adventure on the plains thrill her. And his proposal of marriage is accepted. Garnet eagerly grabs hold of the promise and prospects of an exciting future, only to discover how ill-prepared she is for the punishing landscape of the Jubilee Trail and the even harsher realities of human nature. Made into a feature film, Jubilee Trail is a classic novel of a woman in the old West, beloved not only for the rebelliousness and resilience of its heroine, but for its authenticity, its grand sweep, its unsparing intimacy, and its honest portrayal of the survivors and victims and victors and villains of a defiant American wilderness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4JhxAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Business Ethics: Case Studies and Selected Readings","description":"Gain a better understanding of common threads and patterns of ethical challenges with cases and readings drawn from pop culture, business, and history.

It may seem incredible, but as bestselling novelist and occult expert J.H. Brennan reveals in this eye-opening new history, there is a wealth of evidence to suggest that the disembodied voices of spirits may have subtly directed the course of human events. In Whisperers, Brennan explores how the  spirit world  whether we believe in it or not has influenced our own since the dawn of civilization. With a novelist s flair and a scholar s keen eye, Brennan details the supernatural affinities of world leaders from King Nebuchadnezzar to Adolf Hitler, showing how the decisions and policies of each have been shaped by their supernatural beliefs and encounters. Brennan also examines the impact of visions, from shamanism in native cultures to prophets such as Joan of Arc. Chronicling millennia of contact between the spirit world and our own, Whisperers presents an entirely new and different way to look at history.  Prolific Irish author and lecturer Brennan s lifelong fascination with psychic phenomena fuels this comprehensive analysis of potential supernatural influences on history. . . . Certain hokum for skeptics, but the more open-minded will savor this chillingly convincing testimonial.   Kirkus Reviews  J.H. Brennan is an expert storyteller who paints an often terrifying picture of how human destiny has regularly been changed forever by individuals convinced they were in communication with intelligences from beyond. In Whisperers, Brennan has created a unique and timely history of spirit voices that is both brilliant and utterly chilling.

Yet even the Flame is less dangerous than Her Most Regal and Sacred Majesty Melesandra the Third, an unyielding and terrifying ruler.

Often at odds with Melesandra, Demnor knows he will receive no support from her when faced with the prospect of an unwanted, politically motivated marriage.

Light takes no prisoners. His telling of the story behind The News will upset some and delight others.-The Buffalo NewsIn 1873, a twenty-three-year-old entrepreneur named Edward H. Butler arrived in Buffalo, New York, to found a newspaper eventually called the Buffalo Evening News. Under Butler's aegis the News became one of the most successful newspapers in America, growing along with the thriving city at the end of the Erie Canal, which was expanding rapidly as immigrants poured in and America urbanized. About a century later, in 1977, financial investor Warren E. Buffett, recognizing the value of the paper, bought the Buffalo Evening News, and to this day, despite competition from large media conglomerates, the Buffalo News (as it is now called) remains a successful independent publication.There is no one better to tell the story of the News than Murray B. Light, who held senior editorial positions at the paper for over thirty years. Beginning with the founding of the newspaper by Butler, Light provides a wealth of historical information and many in-depth, behind-the-scenes profiles of key persons who influenced the course of the paper. Chief among these is founder Edward H. Butler, a dynamo of energy, whose enthusiasm, innovation, and high standards are still felt to this day. His son, Edward Butler Jr., also played an important role, extending the reach of the News into radio and television, as did his extraordinary wife, Kate Robinson Butler, who also served as publisher. Almost as influential as the senior Butler was Alfred H. Kirchhofer, whose strong personality and work ethic, staunch Republican Party connections, and active involvement in the Buffalo community became legendary. Readers are offered a rare inside look at the strength of leadership, attention to detail, and accuracy in reporting that are consistently needed to maintain a dedicated subscriber base through such momentous events as the Three-Mile-Island nuclear disaster, the Attica prison riots, and the environmental dangers of Love Canal.Regarding the current owner, Warren Buffett, Light has many interesting insights into his famous low-key, hands-off style of management. He assumed ownership of the News at a critical time, bolstering its financial strength while encouraging complete editorial independence. Light also devotes a chapter to current publisher Stanford Lipsey, a longtime associate of Buffett, highlighting his leadership in the wake of the bitter court dispute with the Courier Express.Along the way Light offers interesting comments on newspaper trends and on many longtime and widely read reporters and columnists, such as Ray Hill, Bob Curran, Lee Coppola, Jeff Simon, Alan Pergament, Donn Esmonde, Janice Okun, Larry Felser, and many others, as well as Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonists Bruce Shanks and Tom Toles.This detailed memoir of the persons and events that had a formative influence on a major independent regional newspaper will capture the attention of anyone interested in the history of one of America's great independent presses.Murray B. Light (Buffalo, NY) has worked for the Buffalo News for 50 years. Starting as a reporter, Light worked his way up to Managing Editor, Editor and Vice President, and Senior Vice President. Though now retired, he continues to write a weekly commentary column and book reviews.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FPraxoFm_RsC&dq=From+Butler+to+Buffett:+The+Story+Behind+the+Buffalo+News&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SURVIVING AUNT RUTH: Vignettes of a Caregiver's Struggles Or How To Keep Laughing When You Want To Cry","description":"The latest and easily the most unique book on the controversial topic of Pope Pius XII's decisions and indecisions during World War II.

S. Lewis","description":"Twenty-five years ago rumors began to circulate that all was not well in the literary world of C. S. Lewis. Lewis's brother vehemently denied false claims made by those who control the C. S. Lewis literary estate but bogus Lewis literature began to appear in print anyway. Since Lewis's books still sell in the millions, powerful forces have been exerted to keep this controversy from surfacing. Author Lindskoog has spent 20 years unearthing old evidence and compiling new data that Martin E. Marty calls \\"compelling,\\" adding that he hopes Lindskoog \\"will be heeded.\\" Instead, within weeks of being released, her book's original publishers yielded to pressure and silently dropped it from their active list. Willard Dickerson, Jr., director of education and professional development for the American Booksellers Association has stated, \\"I am surprised that so many who love the writings of C.S. Lewis have chosen to remain deliberately silent or to suppose the evidence they have that his writings have indeed been tampered with. I can vouch for Kathryn Lindskoog's scholarship, integrity and clear thinking. Her facts ring with truth.\\" An array of famous authors, including Arthur C. Clark and Ursula K. LeGuin have joined the chorus of those who recommend her \\"fascinating,\\" \\"astonishing\\" and \\"exciting\\" book. Therefore we have determined to re-release this extraordinary piece of literary scholarship.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p4Ct2oXIV1cC&dq=Light+in+the+Shadowlands:+Protecting+the+Real+C.+S.+Lewis&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sword and the Flame","description":"Sometimes the greatest evil lies within. The Dragon King who rules the land of Mensandor is none other than Quentin, whose courage and heroism have slowly transformed him from an orphaned servant into a war hero, respected leader, and a fierce man of faith. But even the powerful can fall prey to weakness. The world is turned upside-down when the dark sorcerer Nimrood--long thought dead after a battle with the previous Dragon King--returns with a fearsome plan. Shattered by the death of a dear and trusted friend, the abduction of his beloved son, and the loss of his enchanted sword, Quentin finds his faith tested like never before. In The Sword and the Flame, the final volume of Stephen R. Lawhead's captivating Dragon King Trilogy, the fate of the entire world depends on the outcome of this climactic battle between good and evil.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ex4lm3fxHoYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lord Of The Horizon","description":"Since the Turks first shattered the glory of the French crusaders in 1396, the Ottoman Empire has exerted a long, strong pull on Western minds. For six hundred years, the Empire swelled and declined. Islamic, martial, civilized, and tolerant, in three centuries it advanced from the dusty foothills of Anatolia to rule on the Danube and the Nile; at the Empire's height, Indian rajahs and the kings of France beseeched its aid. For the next three hundred years the Empire seemed ready to collapse, a prodigy of survival and decay. Early in the twentieth century it fell. In this dazzling evocation of its power, Jason Goodwin explores how the Ottomans rose and how, against all odds, they lingered on. In the process he unfolds a sequence of mysteries, triumphs, treasures, and terrors unknown to most American readers. This was a place where pillows spoke and birds were fed in the snow; where time itself unfolded at a different rate and clocks were banned; where sounds were different, and even the hyacinths too strong to sniff. Dramatic and passionate, comic and gruesome, Lords of the Horizons is a history, a travel book, and a vision of a lost world all in one.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f9eZAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Stanguellini","description":"A thorough and complete survey of Stanguellini, the man, and his cars.

Unforgettable characters include a former slave who became a wealthy plantation owner, a clever and corrupt political boss, a deadly black outlaw, and his Irish priest accomplice. And here are stories of a 14,000-acre lake that disappears, a grandiose planned community nipped in the bud by a yellow fever epidemic, devastating freezes, and a vote by ten men to determine the future of two competing towns.

These hopes, however, produced a bitter irony. In order to secure a naturally functioning park, officials had to provide intensive management to preserve ?nature at work.? For the better part of the twentieth century, the forms this management has taken have polarized public opinion. ? James A. Pritchard?s Preserving Yellowstone?s Natural Conditions demonstrates that even the most up-to-date scientific policy could not reckon with public expectations and animal behavior. When Yellowstone stopped its bear feeding program in an attempt to restore naturally regulated bear populations, the public bemoaned the loss of the spectacle. The bears, meanwhile, had learned to associate humans with food, and the loss of reliable meals brought them into campsites. Park officials had to shoot bears that made a menace of themselves, leaving many people frustrated with the park?s attempts to preserve Yellowstone as a natural ecosystem. ? Pritchard believes that restoring natural conditions for bears and other animals is a sound idea. Yellowstone, he argues, represents an ecological anchor, a relatively untrammeled slice of nature. Despite decades of tampering, the park provides scientists and managers with an outdoor laboratory for examining natural processes that existed before extensive settlement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YRKmm03VznYC&dq=Preserving+Yellowstone%27s+Natural+Conditions:+Science+and+the+Perception+of+Nature&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Purgatorio (Bantam Classics)","description":"An informative introduction and commentary accompany this classic translation of Dante's epic poem about a spiritual pilgrim being led by Virgil through the nine circles of hell, available in a dual-language edition.

Indeed, the Sermon and the moral imperatives it contains must be understood: 1) in relation to the example provided by Jesus' words and deeds elsewhere in the Gospel; 2) with reference to the community of believers that constitutes the intended audience of Matthew's Gospel; and 3) in terms of what the Gospel says elsewhere about the end of the age. The Sermon does not present a simple set of rules, perhaps only intended for a small and select group within the Christian community, but seeks to instill a moral vision and to inspire the moral imagination of all who would follow Jesus.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0P0QAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Sermon+on+the+Mount&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thought and Action","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JFC5vgEACAAJ&dq=Thought+and+Action&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Violence, Utopia and the Kingdom of God: Fantasy and Ideology in the Bible","description":"This controversial book explores the presence of the fantastic in Biblical and related texts, and the influence of Biblical traditions on contemporary fantasy writing, cinema, music and art.

A meditation on the death of a mother, MERIDIAN measures the hours and reflects on how experience collapses and elongates time, creating a lens through which we can look at how we're connected and separated. And the poet asks: Is music our best refusal to accede to the irrationality of death? \\"I have long considered Kathleen Jesme a truly remarkable poet. In MERIDIAN, however, she outdoes herself. Jesme fills this lyric chronicle of the death of her mother with precise observations, strange silences, and breathtaking moments of beauty and music. Whether she dwells on the relentless snow whispering around the house or slips into crystalline recollection of her mother's slow failure, I sense in these poems a subtle mind at work on an unsolvable problem. For Jesme knows we can find neither clarity nor conclusion in the emptiness death leaves behind, but must always circle around it, reaching for meaning in the images and memories that surround us as we prepare to grieve, and then grieve. 'I am swimming toward you,' she writes late in the poem, 'through / the past / which clings to me / and holds me / back / and up.' MERIDIAN is not merely a beautifully written, ambitious poem-it is also the most moving I have read in a long time.\\" Kevin Prufer","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=B12GMAEACAAJ&dq=Motherhouse:+Poems+(Lena-Miles+Wever+Todd+Poetry+Series+Award)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quick & Fun Games for Preschoolers","description":"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY SLATE ?

Microarray Image Analysis: An Algorithmic Approach presents an automatic system for microarray image processing to make this decoupling a reality. The proposed system integrates and extends traditional analytical-based methods and custom-designed novel algorithms. The book first explores a new technique that takes advantage of a multiview approach to image analysis and addresses the challenges of applying powerful traditional techniques, such as clustering, to full-scale microarray experiments. It then presents an effective feature identification approach, an innovative technique that renders highly detailed surface models, a new approach to subgrid detection, a novel technique for the background removal process, and a useful technique for removing \\"noise.\\" The authors also develop an expectationmaximization (EM) algorithm for modeling gene regulatory networks from gene expression time series data. The final chapter describes the overall benefits of these techniques in the biological and computer sciences and reviews future research topics. This book systematically brings together the fields of image processing, data analysis, and molecular biology to advance the state of the art in this important area. Although the text focuses on improving the processes involved in the analysis of microarray image data, the methods discussed can be applied to a broad range of medical and computer vision analysis areas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WPzshV-NeeAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faces: The Changing Look of Humankind","description":"Scientists have emphasized the innate, genetically based nature of our fascination with the human face and its almost limitless expressive capacity, all of which is represented in the art of the last six centuries.

It is the only book that tells you precisely what supplement to take, for which ailment, how much to take, and how often to take it. It is the only book that tells you exactly what results to expect and gives you a time frame in which to expect them. Perhaps best of all, it assumes that the reader knows nothing about how to use supplements as remedies, so the directions are simple, step-by-step, hold-your-hand instructions that are impossible to misunderstand. Many vitamin books give you more information than you want, but still do not tell you exactly how to use a supplement to treat a specific condition. That is all this book will tell you. If you are looking for more information on supplements, you will have to look elsewhere. This book does not contain information you do not need in order to use a supplement as a remedy. You will find no complex historical data here. No technical information on recommended daily allowances. No confusing details about what foods contain which supplements. And there are no diets or recipes. Instead, this is a simple, hands-on, \\"how to\\" book, with easy access to brief instructions telling you what you need to know to use supplements to treat illness. And everything you need to know to use a supplement as a remedy is found in this book. The alphabetical Cross Reference and Index give you quick access to the remedies for all the conditions addressed, as well as, an overview of supplements used. The Remedy At A Glance charts in each chapter make it easy to reference a remedy without rereading theinstructions each time. Each chapter concludes with a case study written as an entertaining and inspirational short story about someone who uses the remedy to heal and prevent a medical condition. You can relate to these people no matter who you are because they share the same problems as you. They are women and men, old and young, black and white, rich and poor, single and married. The stories take place in various locations like New York, San Diego, Dallas, the Midwest, Seattle, Los Angeles, Aspen, Puerto Rico, France, and Mexico. These personal accounts relate to the human condition and do more than just entertain. They make it easier to remember the directions in the first part of the chapter. You may forget Ginkgo Biloba and L-Glutamine, but you will remember Moshe, the kosher deli owner in Manhattan who uses the combination to recover his super memory. Or Betsy, the ninety-two year old granddaughter of a slave, who uses Vitamin B12 to help her outpace her forty-something nephew during a visit to San Diego's Sea World. To protect their privacy, pseudonyms have been used for most of the subjects of the case studies, and non-relevant biographical details have been changed. Real names are used in the personal testimonials found on the front pages. All of these people used supplements to help them reach their \\"Maximum Best.\\" You can use their experiences to help you reach your own. The \\"Maximum Best\\" Philosophy The intellectual foundation of Vitamin Remedies That Really Work! is the \\"Maximum Best Philosophy,\\" which embodies the principle of living responsibly and includes a duty to the self -- to try to fully realize your own potential. Maximum Best is completely personal. Youcan no more compare your Maximum Best to another person's than you can compare your fingerprints. It involves letting go of the world, the outside competition, and looking inside to compete with yourself. In other words, you can only gauge your attainment of Maximum Best by competing with yourself. One problem with competing with other people as a way of measuring your own abilities is that you are constantly dependent on -- and limited to -- the quality of the competition. If you win a race against people whose abilities are far below yours, it can be an empty victory. And there is no disgrace in placing last when you are outclassed by the competition -- if you reached your Maximum Best in trying. If you could fast forward to the end of your life and look back, your Maximum Best would be the highest points you reached in your lifetime. Maximum Best is better than your best. It is a level you must reach and stretch and tax to attain. Some people reach it a couple of times a week, others only once in a lifetime. Everyone has a Maximum Best even if he or she reaches it rarely. Illness is one variable that will affect your ability to attain Maximum Best; healing and preventing illness with food supplements is the focus of this book. Your body's warning plus your timely response cart equal prevention, making it possible to age without severe illness, but if you do not take care of your health, your body and mind will retaliate against you as you age. Consider the serious debilitations -- preventable cancers, mined livers, broken-down kidneys, worn-out hearts, fused and arthritic joints, deformed spines, clogged arteries and confused minds -- which could be avoided by making responsiblechoices about your health now. Naturally, you cannot account for or control every genetic predisposition to a specific condition, but you can do more to heal yourself than you have been led to believe.

This biography traces Elizabeth's youth in rural Knutsford, her married years in the tension-ridden city of Manchester and her wide network of friends in London, Europe and America. Standing as a figure caught up in the religious and political radicalism of nineteenth century Britain, the book looks at how Elizabeth observed, from her Manchester home, the brutal but transforming impact of industry, enjoying a social and family life, but distracted by her need to write down the truth of what she saw. In this widely acclaimed biography, Elizabeth Gaskell emerges as an artist of unrecognized complexity, shrewdly observing the political, religious and feminist arguments of nineteenth century Britain, with enjoyment, passion and wit. Jenny Uglow is the bestselling author of Nature's Engraver, which won the National Arts Writers Award, and A Gambling Man: Charles II and the Restoration, which was shortlisted for the 2010 Samuel Johnson Prize.

Exorcism was an illicit activity in the Roman world, so why would Jesus risk condemnation, arrest, and even death for the sake of the demon-possessed? Some point to his compassion. Roger Busse, a thirty-nine-year veteran of risk analysis and a graduate of Harvard Divinity School, has another answer from the world in which he lives: risk assessment. People engage in risky ventures only when not doing so would pose even greater risks. What was the greater risk for Jesus? He believed that his land and home, then suffering under foreign occupation, was filled with demons. He believed that if he did not drive them off, all might be lost and the forces of darkness might win out, leaving only the kingdom of Satan. Given this context, Busse reassesses the gospel traditions. Using risk analysis, Busse provides a new approach that recovers the specific charismatic practices, sayings, and parables that the exorcist Jesus' employed in his deliberate and dangerous strategy to drive Satan from the land and reestablish the kingdom of God. To Be Near the Fire offers a new portrait of Jesus and the origins of Christianity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bY0NBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Merlyn: The Unpublished Conclusion to the Once and Future King","description":"The long-lost conclusion to The Once and Future King, in which King Arthur faces his final battle against his son. This magical account of King Arthur s last night on earth, rediscovered in a collection of T. H. White s papers at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin, spent twenty-six weeks on the New York Times bestseller list following its publication in 1977. While preparing for his final, fatal battle with his bastard son, Mordred, Arthur returns to the Animal Council with Merlyn, where the deliberations center on ways to abolish war. More self-revealing than any other of White s books, Merlyn shows his mind at work as he agonized over whether to join the fight against Nazi Germany while penning the epic that would become The Once and Future King. The Book of Merlyn has been cited as a major influence by such illustrious writers as Kazuo Ishiguro, J. K. Rowling, Helen Macdonald, Neil Gaiman, and Lev Grossman.  Arriving from beyond the curve of time and apparently from the grave, The Book of Merlyn stirs its own pages, saying, wait: you didn t get the whole story. . . . It gives us a final glimpse of those two immortal characters, Wart and Merlyn, up close, slo-mo, with a considered and affectionate scrutiny. The book is an elegiac posting from a master storyteller of the twentieth century. Its reissue in our next century is just as welcome as when it first arrived forty years ago. . . . Certainly the moral questions about the military use of force perplex the world still. . . . The efficacy of treaties, the trading of insults among the potentates of the day, the testing of weapons, the weaponizing of trade these strategies are still front and center. Rather terrifyingly so.

Gregory Maguire, bestselling author of Wicked,from the foreword  Such a small thing, The Book of Merlyn, to hold so much. Joyful and despairing, heartbreaking, yet full of hope. As wonderful and fearful to read today as it was when I first found it in 1978. And the world has as much need of it today as it did then more, perhaps. But will the world be ready to listen?

The site was Peenemnde, where Hitler's scientists were developing both the V-1 flying bomb and the V-2 rocket whose destructive powers could have swung the course of the War. The raid was meticulously planned and hopes were high. But the night sky was so cloudless that the British bombers presented an easy target for German night fighters, and over 40 were lost. Martin Middlebrook draws on the memories of over 400 people involved in the dramatic events on that night: RAF and Luftwaffe aircrew, German personnel at the research site and foreign labourers who had been forced to work there.

In a time when most formal religions are on the wane, Wicca is said to be the fastest growing religion in North America. What is it that draws people to Witchcraft, and how does a spiritual path with its roots in ancient beliefs and traditions transform itself into a practice that resonates so deeply with today s modern woman? There are a number of explanations for the phenomenon, such as Witchcraft's connection to the natural world, or acceptance of members regardless of lifestyle choices. For women, however, the greatest appeal may be the worship of a goddess (or goddesses). No stern patriarchal God here. Instead, Wicca and most other forms of modern Witchcraft embrace deity in both the feminine and the masculine. Suddenly, women can look at the divine and see themselves reflected back. In addition, many women are frustrated, frightened, triggered, and down-right furious with the current social and political environment, but feel powerless to create positive change. Witchcraft can give them a sense of personal empowerment. There are many different Witchcraft paths and a multitude of approaches to its practice. This book will guide the reader on the journey to connecting with the feminine divine both without and within, and open the door to this magical religion that will enlighten, uplift, and energize their lives.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PVC9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cinematic Storytelling: The 100 Most Powerful Film Conventions Every Filmmaker Must Know","description":"What the industry's most succcessful writers and directors have in common is that they have mastered the cinematic conventions specific to the medium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VifZMQEACAAJ&dq=Cinematic+Storytelling:+The+100+Most+Powerful+Film+Conventions+Every+Filmmaker+Must+Know&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dangerous Dilemmas","description":"With her life falling apart around her--an unfaithful lawyer husband and a son on trial for a murder he claims he did not commit--Audrey Roberts has reached the breaking point, but her world become further complicated when she finds herself drawn to Houston police officer Kirk Maxwell, who just happens to be the cop who arrested her son.

This book is a wide-ranging and interdisciplinary examination and critique of meat consumption by humans, throughout their evolution and around the world. Setting the scene with a chapter on meat s role in human evolution and its growing influence during the development of agricultural practices, the book goes on to examine modern production systems, their efficiencies, outputs, and impacts. The major global trends of meat consumption are described in order to find out what part its consumption plays in changing modern diets in countries around the world. The heart of the book addresses the consequences of the \\"massive carnivory\\" of western diets, looking at the inefficiencies of production and at the huge impacts on land, water, and the atmosphere. Health impacts are also covered, both positive and negative. In conclusion, the author looks forward at his vision of  rational meat eating , where environmental and health impacts are reduced, animals are treated more humanely, and alternative sources of protein make a higher contribution. Should We Eat Meat? is not an ideological tract for or against carnivorousness but rather a careful evaluation of meat's roles in human diets and the environmental and health consequences of its production and consumption. It will be of interest to a wide readership including professionals and academics in food and agricultural production, human health and nutrition, environmental science, and regulatory and policy making bodies around the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PLaYN1RpemwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Military Collectibles Price Guide","description":"From the Civil War to the Gulf War, this first-of-its-kind price guide to American Military collectibles covers it all.

For others, work is the reward, and it is for those people, professionals who plan to continue working at age 60 and beyond, that Mike Willard has written The Portfolio Bubble: Surviving Professionally at 60. In The Portfolio Bubble, Willard offers practical advice for professionals who find themselves planning for the next phase of their working life. He shows how to add life experiences and professional abilities to a work portfolio that can be used to launch a new career - or to reinvigorate an existing one.

For the first time ever, the line of graduates who received their degrees at the \\"West Point of the South\\" included women who had spent four years at VMI. For 150 years, VMI had operated as a revered, state-funded institution an amalgam of Southern history, military tradition, and male bonding rituals and throughout that long history, no one had ever questioned the fact that only males were admitted. Then in 1989 a female applicant complained of discrimination to the Justice Department, which brought suit the following year to integrate women into VMI. In a book that poses serious questions about equal rights in America, Philippa Strum traces the origins of this landmark case back to VMI's founding, its evolution over fifteen decades, and through competing notions about women's proper place. Unlike most works on women in military institutions, this one also provides a complete legal history from the initial complaint to final resolution in United States v. Virginia and shows how the Supreme Court's ruling against VMI reflected changing societal ideas about gender roles. At the heart of the VMI case was the \\"rat line\\": a ritualized form of hazing geared toward instilling male solidarity. VMI claimed that its system of toughening individuals for leadership was even more stringent than military service and that the system would be destroyed if the Institute were forced to accommodate women. Strum interviewed lawyers from Justice and VMI, heads of concerned women's groups, and VMI administrators, faculty, and cadets to reconstruct the arguments in this important case. She was granted interviews with both Justice Ginsburg, author of the majority opinion, and Justice Scalia, the lone dissenter on the bench, and meticulously analyzes both viewpoints. She shows how Ginsburg's opinion not only articulated a new constitutional standard for institutions accused of gender discrimination but also represented the culmination of gender equality litigation in the twentieth century. Women in the Barracks is a case study that combines both legal and cultural history, reviewing the long history of male elitism in the military as it explores how new ideas about gender equality have developed in the United States. It is an engrossing story of change versus tradition, clear and accessible for general readers yet highly instructive and valuable for students and scholars. Now as questions continue to loom concerning the role of state funding for single-sex education, Strum's book squarely addresses competing notions of women's place and capabilities in American society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5WXYIOHviWYC&dq=Women+in+the+Barracks:+The+VMI+Case+and+Equal+Rights&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wicca Herbal: Recipes, Magick, and Abundance","description":"Features descriptions for 100 magical herbs with gardening tips and recipes for cooking, beauty, healing, and ritual.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KL3owAEACAAJ&dq=The+Wicca+Herbal:+Recipes,+Magick,+and+Abundance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel (Great Discoveries)","description":"A portrait of the eminent twentieth-century mathematician discusses his theorem of incompleteness, relationships with such contemporaries as Albert Einstein, and untimely death as a result of mental instability and self-starvation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tXk2AAAAQBAJ&dq=Incompleteness:+The+Proof+and+Paradox+of+Kurt+Godel+(Great+Discoveries)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Teachers Guide to Free Curriculum Materials: 2000-2001","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Jv1zliE2rb0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Brothers in Blood (Tony Hillerman's Frontier #5)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HzpfMwEACAAJ&dq=Brothers+in+Blood+(Tony+Hillerman%27s+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The homeowner's guide to controlling crafty critters: Pro secrets to stop sneaky squirrels and other nuisance wildlife in their tracks","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9SxKAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+homeowner%27s+guide+to+controlling+crafty+critters:+Pro+secrets+to+stop+sneaky+squirrels+and+other+nuisance+wildlife+in+their+tracks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Street Fighter, Vol. 2","description":"Fighters of every size, shape and color collide in a global battle for supremacy in the Street Fighter Tournament an underground fight club hosted by the leader of Shadaloo criminal organization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VLCnAAAACAAJ&dq=Street+Fighter,+Vol.+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocking America: An Insider's Story","description":"The author describes his experiences as program director of rock radio stations in New York City and describes the stations' efforts to increase their audience ratings","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-Fh2QgAACAAJ&dq=Rocking+America:+An+Insider%27s+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MInd Prey","description":"Lucas Davenport has met his match-a brilliant, wanton killer who knows more about mind games than Lucas himself.

The renowned Egyptologist Erik Hornung here studies the ancient Egyptians' conceptions of god, basing his account on a thorough reappraisal of the primary sources. His book, now available in English for the first time, is the most extensive exploration yet undertaken of the nature of Egyptian religion. Hornung examines the characteristics, spheres of action, and significance of Egyptian gods and goddesses, analyzing the complex and changing iconography used to represent them, and disentangling the many seemingly contradictory aspects of the religion of which they are a part. He seeks to answer two basic questions: How did the Egyptians themselves see their gods? Did they believe there was an impersonal, anonymous force behind the multiplicity of their deities? Throughout, he attempts to evoke the complexity and richness of the religion of the ancient Egyptians and of their worldview, which differs so greatly from our own. A work of extraordinary distinction, Hornung's book will appeal to anyone interested in ancient Egypt, in ancient religion, and in the history of religion, as well as students and scholars of ancient history, anthropology, and archaeology. Sensitively translated by John Baines and with a new preface by the author, this edition has been amplified and updated with an English-language audience in mind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J9QlAQAAMAAJ&dq=Conceptions+of+God+in+Ancient+Egypt:+The+One+and+the+Many&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Robert C.

Graves and Hodge had recently completed a social history of the between-wars period called The Long Week-End. Now they embarked on this new project,  a handbook for writers of English Prose,  to be called The Reader Over Your Shoulder. The world was in total upheaval. Graves had already fled Majorca three years earlier at the start of the Spanish Civil War. As they labored over their new writing project, Graves and Hodge witnessed the fall of France and the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk. In early September 1940 began the bombing of London by the German Luftwaffe, a concentrated effort to destroy the resolve of the English people. Graves s and Hodge s idea was simple enough: at a time when their whole world was falling apart, the survival of English prose sentences, of writing that was clear, concise, intelligible, had become paramount if hope were going to survive the onslaught. They came up with forty-one principles for writing, the majority devoted to clarity, the remainder to grace of expression. They studied the prose of a wide range of noted authors and leaders, finding much room for improvement. Quoting grammarian and bestselling author Patricia T. O Conner from her new introduction,  With a new war to be won, the kingdom couldn t afford careless, sloppy English. Good communication was critical.  The book they would write would turn out to be one of the most erudite, and at the same time one of the most spontaneous and inspired, ever to take on the challenge of writing well. O Conner in her introduction describes The Reader Over Your Shoulder as nothing less than  the best book on writing ever published.  The present edition restores, for the first time in three-quarters of a century, the original, 1943, text, which in subsequent printings and editions had been shortened by over 150 pages, including much of the heart of the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iGFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Reader+Over+Your+Shoulder:+A+Handbook+for+Writers+of+English+Prose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Programming Under Mach (UNIX and open systems series)","description":"The book provides the detailed information necessary to write practical programs under Mach.

Of the dead, approximately 8500 were Catholic Christians, representing over sixty percent of the community. In this collective biography, nine Catholic survivors share personal and compelling stories about the aftermath of the bomb and their lives since that day. Examining the Catholic community s interpretation of the A-bomb, this book not only uses memory to provide a greater understanding of the destruction of the bombing, but also links it to the past experiences of religious persecution, drawing comparisons with the  Secret Christian  groups which survived in the Japanese countryside after the banning of Christianity. Through in-depth interviews, it emerges that the memory of the atomic bomb is viewed through the lens of a community which had experienced suffering and marginalisation for more than 400 years. Furthermore, it argues that their dangerous memory confronts Euro-American-centric narratives of the atomic bombings, whilst also challenging assumptions around a providential bomb. Dangerous Memory in Nagasaki presents the voices of Catholics, many of whom have not spoken of their losses within the framework of their faith before. As such, it will be invaluable to students and scholars of Japanese history, religion and war history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oLSuDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Money: Your Personal Finance Guide","description":"This illustrated beginner s guide to personal finance distills essential information into small, easy-to-follow steps to help you get your finances in order.

In the best tradition of Melanesian scholarship, Jane Goodale writes here of the Kaulong who live in the deep forests of New Britain, an island in the vast territory of Papua New Guinea. Even in the last half of the twentieth century, the Kaulong?s contact with the outside world through government patrols and missionaries has been minimal. Their story enhances our understanding of Melanesia and adds new and significant material to the comparison of Oceanic cultures and societies. In the course of her fieldwork with them, Goodale recognized that everything of importance to the Kaulong--every event, every relationship, every transaction--was rooted in their constant quest for recognition as human beings. She addresses here questions central to Kaulong society: What is it that makes an individual human? How is humanity, or personhood, achieved and maintained? In their consuming concern with their status as human beings, the Kaulong mark progress on a continuum from nonhuman (animal-like) to the most respected level of humanity--the political Big Men and Big Women. Knowledge is the key to movement along the continuum, and acquiring, displaying and defending knowledge are at the heart of social interaction. At all-night ?singsings,? individuals compete through song in their knowledge of people, places, and many other aspects of their forested world. The sacrifice of pigs and distribution of pork to guests completes the ceremonial display and defense of knowledge and personhood. While To Sing with Pigs will be welcomed by anthropologists and area specialists, it will appeal on a broader level to anyone interested in this still remote part of the world. Goodale's analysis of songs and their ritual context adds unusual depth to the ethnography. Fascinating field photographs and readable text prove again that anthropology can be both scholarly and lively.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eaYpDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"For the Defense: True Crime Cases of America's Most Famous Criminal Lawyer","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=NnZszgEACAAJ&dq=For+the+Defense:+True+Crime+Cases+of+America%27s+Most+Famous+Criminal+Lawyer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The cultural side of Islam","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dXgwAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+cultural+side+of+Islam&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cold Justice (THF #6): Tony Hillerman's Frontier #6","description":"Hostage Negotiators can talk themselves out of anything except falling in love.

Since World War II, a group of scientists has been attempting to understand the human nervous system and to build computer systems that emulate the brain's abilities. Many of the early workers in this field of neural networks came from cybernetics; others came from neuroscience, physics, electrical engineering, mathematics, psychology, even economics. In this collection of interviews, those who helped to shape the field share their childhood memories, their influences, how they became interested in neural networks, and what they see as its future. The subjects tell stories that have been told, referred to, whispered about, and imagined throughout the history of the field. Together, the interviews form a Rashomon-like web of reality. Some of the mythic people responsible for the foundations of modern brain theory and cybernetics, such as Norbert Wiener, Warren McCulloch, and Frank Rosenblatt, appear prominently in the recollections. The interviewees agree about some things and disagree about more. Together, they tell the story of how science is actually done, including the false starts, and the Darwinian struggle for jobs, resources, and reputation. Although some of the interviews contain technical material, there is no actual mathematics in the book. Contributors James A.

Amanda and Marian Laton are identical twins but they are as different as night and day. Amanda is beautiful but nasty, and Marian is kind but plain purposely so to avoid provoking her spiteful twin's jealousy. When their wealthy father suddenly dies, the two gently reared New England heiresses are sent to live with their aunt on a sprawling Texas ranch. There the twins meet Chad Kinkaid, the cowboy son of a neighboring rancher. Marian is fascinated by Chad's rugged good looks and his sheer masculinity, but she knows that like every other man she and her twin have met, he will pursue Amanda, not her. Chad is indeed beguiled by Amanda's beauty, but soon he begins to see beyond Marian's carefully constructed dowdy fa?ade. Unlike the tame gentlemen back East, after witnessing Marian's taste for adventure, her sense of humor and bravery in the face of danger, Chad finds himself wanting her.

There is no interesting history of square dancing, there are no entertaining anecdotes, just the nuts and bolts of how to square dance. The author worked painstakingly with the graphic artist to execute a feat never achieved before in a square dance manual. Revolutionary illustrations show the dancer's point of view, not just the spectators' viewpoint. Dancers can, without turning on their heads, glean from the detailed illustrations exactly what they need to be doing with their hands, feet, etc. Each dancer can effortlessly grasp the material and easily retain it. Renown master caller/teacher, Marshall Flippo, assiduously assisted the author in establishing the very first guidelines for standardized  Basic Maneuvers  which would enable square dancers to dance gracefully with any group, anywhere. This was a true innovation in square dancing not yet available in the late 1960's. Marshall also painstakingly edited this first-of-its-kind book, twice! - to be sure it met the highest standards of accuracy and ease of understanding for square dancing neophytes. One of the greatest merits of this book is its logical continuity, which can be a tremendous aid to both the caller/teacher and the student, regardless of how it is used. New dancers, taking lessons, can go home and review what they have learned in class and prepare for the next, significantly shortening the learning curve. Although a few changes in the names of the calls have been made through the years, it is a simple task to merely write in the current name for the square dance call according to your instructor. But no one shows you better how to execute the maneuvers than John W. Jones with his super simplified instructions and state-of-the-art illustrations in Squaredance Fundamentals - the gold standard for over 37 years.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_gbypKCZcG8C&dq=Squaredance+fundamentals,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pattern of Blood (Libertus Mystery Series)","description":"Book two in Rosemary Rowe's Libertus series: 'A cracking tale with a fast-moving plot' CONN IGGULDEN.

Commanded by his patron Marcus Septimus to investigate the attack, Libertus arrives at Quintus's mansion only moments before the decurion is knifed again, this time fatally.

It's a pedestrian's world, where the streets are clean, the employees are friendly, and the trains run on time. All of its elements are themed, presented in a consistent architectural, decorative, horticultural, musical, even olfactory tone, with rides, shows, restaurants, scenery, and costumed characters coordinated to tell a consistent set of stories. It is beguiling and exasperating, a place of ambivalence and ambiguity. In Vinyl Leaves Professor Fjellman analyzes each ride and theater show of Walt Disney World and discusses the history, political economy, technical infrastructure, and urban planning of the area as well as its relationship with Metropolitan Orlando and the state of Florida.Vinyl Leaves argues that Disney, in pursuit of its own economic interests, acts as the muse for the allied transnational corporations that sponsor it as well as for the world of late capitalism, where the commodity form has colonized much of human life. With brilliant technological legerdemain, Disney puts visitors into cinematically structured stories in which pieces of American and world culture become ideological tokens in arguments in favor of commodification and techno-corporate control. Culture is construed as spirit, colonialism and entrepreneurial violence as exotic zaniness, and the Other as child.Exhaustion and cognitive overload lead visitors into the bliss of Commodity Zen the characteristic state of postmodern life. While we were watching for Orwell, Huxley rode into town, bringing soma, cable, and charge cards and wearing mouse ears.

In this powerful and provocative book, Scottish writer and campaigner Alastair McIntosh shows how it is still possible for individuals and communities to take on the might of corporate power and emerge victorious. As a founder of the Isle of Eigg Trust, McIntosh helped the beleaguered residents of Eigg to become the first Scottish community ever to clear their laird from his own estate. And plans to turn a majestic Hebridean mountain into a superquarry were overturned after McIntosh persuaded a Native American warrior chief to visit the Isle of Harris and testify at the government inquiry. This extraordinary book weaves together theology, mythology, economics, ecology, history, poetics and politics as the author journeys towards a radical new philosophy of community, spirit and place. His daring and imaginative responses to the destruction of the natural world make Soil and Soul an uplifting, inspirational and often richly humorous read. /div","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KKz0AgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bluebirds Used to Croon in the Choir: Stories","description":"Novelist, music journalist, and playwright Meno writes squarely in the American tradition of wringing large effects from small change, revealing the subtlety in the broad stroke and conveying complexity with seeming simplicity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nHz0-ARs9tcC&dq=Bluebirds+Used+to+Croon+in+the+Choir:+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tunnel Visions: Journeys of an Underground Philosopher","description":"Christopherr Ross, philosopher and traveller, decided to cease his journeyings and go underground, quite literally.

The roots of this vast flowering of the Arthurian legend are to be found in early Welsh tradition and this volume gives an account of the Arthurian literature produced in Wales, in both Welsh and Latin, during the Middle Ages. The distinguished contributors offer a comprehensive view of recent scholarship relating to Arthurian literature in early Welsh and other Brythonic sources. The volume includes chapters on the \\"historical\\" Arthur, Arthur in early Welsh verse, the legend of Merlin, the tales of Culhwch ac Olwen, Geraint, Owain, Peredur, The Dream of Rhonabwy and Trystan ac Esyllt.

It maps a tension between the infinite and finite, between the concrete and ethereal. In some ways, it is a celebration of the mundane, by which I mean the world of everyday objects, of plants and animals, scents, textures, movements, water, and phases of the moon. But interwoven with this testament to ineffable beauty, this celebratory mode, are reflections on my cancer, for example, my autistic strivings, my gender queer identity, and the plight of the natural world. A recurrent thread that runs through the manuscript is the idea of dreaming, which offers a kind of poetic membrane, a connective tissue that softens some of the weighty concerns and allows them a more muted resonance than they might otherwise have.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oGIlzwEACAAJ&dq=The+Greenwood+Encyclopedia+of+African+American+Folklore:+%5BThree+Volumes%5D&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Books: Body Rags; Mortal Acts, Mortal Words; The Past","description":"This volume brings together BODY RAGS and MORTAL ACTS, MORTAL WORDS and THE PAST, three books that are central to the life s work of one of the masters of contemporary poetry.

In this collection, scholars from a number of disciplines look at various artists and movements and come to some new conclusions about the ways in which female artists have contributed to the past four decades of pop, rock, blues and punk. From new looks at major artists Etta James, Laura Nyro and Patti Smith to later figures Ferron, Bj?rk, and Melissa Etheridge, these chapters suggest new ways to view and hear music that is already part of our culture. Essays on the Indigo Girls, Dixie Chicks and Destiny s Child prove that the girl-groups tradition is alive and well, but with additional new dimensions, and a three-essay section on Joan Jett and the Riot Grrrls phenomenon sheds new light on their implications for feminist artistic expression. The final piece, an annotated bibliography of academic writing on women in rock, helps make this collection a useful addition to the library of students of popular music, while the solid research and accessibility of the text make this a good choice for the general reader as well as the seasoned scholar. \\"If you think that adoration of certain pop music is a guilty pleasure, not worthy of higher intellectual aspirations, then Singing For Themselves offers absolution. It's far from trivial to ponder the Tao of Canadian singer Ferron, the classical allusions of Laura Nyro's lyrics, the postfeminist booty-shaking of Destiny's Child, or the historical milieu that turned Jamesetta Hawkins into blues great Etta James. Reading these essays made me want to go right back to the music - feeling wiser, yes, but also validated in the desire to go as deep as any song or singer can take me.\\" Michele Kort, author of Soul Picnic: The Music and Passion of Laura Nyro, and senior editor at Ms. magazine \\"I've read Singing for Themselves: Essays on Women in Popular Music, and am happy to provide an endorsement. Singing for Themselves is a consistently interesting collection of new essays on women and popular music. The collection is all the more welcome for being so current. It mixes essays on recent phenomena (such as electronic/punk group Le Tigre and the Dixie Chicks' stirring of political controversy) with new perspectives on canonical figures like Patti Smith or Etta James.

The case hinges on a single fingerprint found on a murdered doctor's car, and the fledgling Federal Bureau of Identification and the new boss J. Edgar Hoover play a crucial role in turning the fingerprint into solid evidence used to find, arrest and convict members of the Fleagle Gang. The Fleagle Gang robbed banks and trains in Kansas, Colorado, Oregon and California of over $1 million in the 10 years they operated. Three gang members were hung at the Colorado Penitentiary a little over two years after committing the Colorado bank robbery. The fourth was trapped and shot on a train in Branson, Mo. by postal inspectors and detectives from several states. Cartoonist Al Capp used one of the gang to create his character Evil Eye Fleagle in the Lil Abner cartoon strip and Broadway show. Cartoonist Carl Barks used the Fleagle Gang as the inspiration for The Beagle Boys who have tormented Donald Duck since 1951.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=IkoBocPBJ1kC&dq=The+Fleagle+Gang:+Betrayed+by+a+fingerprint&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Contemporary Women's Health with PowerWeb Bind-in Card","description":"This proven text provides a concise introduction to health topics, bringing students current information about health and wellness topics.

Be an opportunist. Make love whenever possible. 2. Date your spouse. Don't put off dating for two decades until your kids are conveniently in college. 3. Tend to your spouse. Even adults need to be nurtured. 4. Plan for chaos. 5. Become a top-flight negotiator. Marriage is one long, unwieldy negotiation. Keep closing the deal. 6. Keep close to your spirit. Find ways to nurture yourself. The co-authors firmly believe couples are living their most challenging years when they have children under their roof. Parents inhabit a different world than do those without children, one ruled by the needs of small people. The sheer responsibility that comes with parenthood can, over time, complicate even the healthiest marriage. While the divorce rate in America is at an astonishing 62 percent, staying happily married with children is not an insurmountable challenge as long as you realize it requires a kind of vigilance. It requires perspective, insight and, most importantly, the energy to keep a strong connection with your spouse. The authors use wisdom and wit to detail valuable tips drawn from their own experiences both positive and negative. The book is broken into six chapters, with a series of vignettes approximately one to three pages in length. Some of the more visual scenes from the book include playing hooky with your spouse, renewing marriage vows at Notre Dame and absent-mindedly driving to work with a plateful of cookies flying off the roof of the car, littering the road. Mancillas and Melnik's 100-page survival guide will no doubt be a compelling read, the best-selling bible for the married-with-kids crowd.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xP_kRrzC7MYC&dq=Happily+Married+With+Kids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teenage Survival Book","description":"Offers teenagers practical advice about love, school, work, sexuality, parenting, marriage, mental illness, and religion","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TU5qAAAAMAAJ&dq=Teenage+Survival+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Piang, the Moro jungle boy: A book for young and old","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Helping Your Teenager Beat Depression offers parents a strategy that enables them to become active partners in the treatment of their child's depression. Chapters begin with an overview of teenage mood problems followed by an explanation of the authors' unique treatment approach, known by the acronym, LEEAPP (LEAP for short). Based on cognitive behavioural therapy (BT), a recognized and successful problem-solving strategy for changing distorted behaviours and thoughts, LEAP offers parents a plan to change a troublesome situation or negative pattern of interaction with their teen. Parents first identify what behaviour (e.g. refusing to get out of bed) or attitude (e.g. unprovoked anger) they want to change, then create a LEAP plan to: LABEL their own thoughts and emotions related to their teen's behaviour; EMPATHIZE with their teen's perspective; EXPLORE ways to respond to this perspective; APPLY an alternative way to respond; PICK a follow-up time to evaluate the result; and PLAN ahead for the next step.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AI4NAAAACAAJ&dq=Helping+Your+Teenager+Beat+Depression:+A+Problem-Solving+Approach+for+Families+(Special+Needs+Collection)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Late Great Planet Earth","description":"The impact of The Late Great Planet Earth cannot be overstated.

The years since have confirmed Lindsey's insights into what biblical prophecy says about the times we live in. Whether you're a church-going believer or someone who wouldn't darken the door of a Christian institution, the Bible has much to tell you about the imminent future of this planet. In the midst of an out-of-control generation, it reveals a grand design that's unfolding exactly according to plan. The rebirth of Israel. The threat of war in the Middle East. An increase in natural catastrophes. The revival of Satanism and witchcraft.

In this view, although the institution of slaver is seen as important, blacks are not generally treated as actors nor is their \\"divergent culture\\" seen as having had a wide-ranging effect on whites. Historians working in this area generally assume two social systems in America, one black and one white, and cultural divergence between slaves and masters. It is the thesis of this book that blacks, Africans, and Afro-Americans, deeply influenced white's perceptions, values, and identity, and that although two world views existed, there was a deep symbiotic relatedness that must be explored if we are to understand either or both of them. This exploration raises many questions and suggests many possibilities and probabilities, but it also establishes how thoroughly whites and blacks intermixed within the system of slavery and how extensive was the resulting cultural interaction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JU0gEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teaching All the Children: Strategies for Developing Literacy in an Urban Setting (Solving Problems in Teaching of Literacy)","description":"Uses research reviews, instructional models, and portraits of exemplary urban classrooms to present field-tested strategies for promoting reading, writing, and oral language success in low socioeconomic status urban settings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=pmlSngEACAAJ&dq=Teaching+All+the+Children:+Strategies+for+Developing+Literacy+in+an+Urban+Setting+(Solving+Problems+in+Teaching+of+Literacy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And Then...History","description":"Collects twelve previously unpublished essays by one of Britain's most eminent historians, David Cannadine, including his inaugural and valedictory lectures at the Institute of Historical Research.

This volume explores the many struggles by various individuals and groups to put right Marie's identity, and it simultaneously links these struggles to larger destabilizations in social, political and gender systems in France. Looking at how Marie was represented in politics, art, literature and journalism, the contributors to this volume reveal how crucial political and cultural contexts were enacted \\"on the body of the queen\\" and on the complex identity of Marie. Taken together, these essays suggest that it is precisely because she came to represent the contradictions in the social, political and gender systems of her era, that Marie remains such an important historical figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KV-4AQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daily life in Greece at the time of Pericles (Daily life series)","description":"What was it actually like to live in Athens when Greek civilization was at the height of its powers?

Against a history of relative inattention on the part of Western translators to modern Asian critical theory, this first English publication is sure to have a profound effect on current cultural criticism in the West. It is both the boldest critique of modern Japanese literary history to appear in the post-war era and a major theoretical intervention, which calls into question the idea of modernity that informs Western consciousness. In a sweeping reinterpretation of nineteenth-and twentieth-century Japanese literature, Karatani Kojin forces a reconsideration of the very assumptions underlying our concepts of modernity. In his analysis, such familiar terms as origin, modern, literature, and the state reveal themselves to be ideological constructs. Karatani weaves many separate strands into an argument that exposes what has been hidden in both Japanese and Western accounts of the development of modern culture. Among these strands are: the \\"discovery\\" of landscape in painting and literature and its relation to the inwardness of individual consciousness; the similar \\"discovery\\" in Japanese drama of the naked face as another kind of landscape produced by interiority; the challenge to the dominance of Chinese characters in writing; the emergence of confessional literature as an outgrowth of the repression of sexuality and the body; the conversion of the samurai class to Christianity; the mythologizing of tuberculosis, cancer, and illness in general as a producer of meaning; and the \\"discovery\\" of \\"the child\\" as an independent category of human being. A work that will be important beyond the confines of literary studies, Karatani's analysis challenges basic Western presumptions of theoretical centrality and originality and disturbs the binary opposition of the \\"West\\" to its so-called \\"other.\\" Origins of Modern Japanese Literature should be read by all those with an interest in the development of cultural concepts and in the interrelating factors that have determined modernity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hPJO2vEQgjYC&dq=Origins+of+Modern+Japanese+Literature+(Post-Contemporary+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Timon of Athens","description":"The real Timon of Athens lived there in the fifth century BCE, making him a contemporary of Socrates and Pericles. Shakespeare presents Timon as a figure who suffers such profound disillusionment that he becomes a misanthrope, or man-hater. This makes him a more interesting character than the caricature he had become to Shakespeare s contemporaries, for whom  Timonist  was a slang term for an unsociable man. Shakespeare s play includes the wealthy, magnificent, and extravagantly generous figure of Timon before his transformation. Timon expects that, having received as gifts all that he owned, his friends will be equally generous to him. Once his creditors clamor for repayment, Timon finds that his idealization of friendship is an illusion. He repudiates his friends, abandons Athens, and retreats to the woods. Yet his misanthropy arises from the destruction of an admirable illusion, from which his subsequent hatred can never be entirely disentangled. The authoritative edition of Timon of Athens from The Folger Shakespeare Library, the trusted and widely used Shakespeare series for students and general readers, includes: -The exact text of the printed book for easy cross-reference -Hundreds of hypertext links for instant navigation -Freshly edited text based on the best early printed version of the play -Full explanatory notes conveniently placed on pages facing the text of the play -Scene-by-scene plot summaries -A key to the play s famous lines and phrases -An introduction to reading Shakespeare s language -An essay by a leading Shakespeare scholar providing a modern perspective on the play -Fresh images from the Folger Shakespeare Library s vast holdings of rare books -An annotated guide to further reading Essay by Copp lia Kahn The Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, DC, is home to the world s largest collection of Shakespeare s printed works, and a magnet for Shakespeare scholars from around the globe.

Drawing on exclusive access to family members and previously unseen correspondence, Thomson reconstructs the world of Levi's youth--the rhythms of Jewish life in Turin during the Mussolini years--as well as his experience in Auschwitz and difficult reintegration into postwar Italy. Thomson presents Levi in all his facets: his fondness for Louis Armstrong and fast cars, his insomnia and many near-catastrophic work accidents. Finally, he explores the controversy and isolation of Levi's later years, along with the increasing tensions in his life--between his private anguish and gift for friendship; his severe bouts of depression and passion for life and ideas; his pervasive dread and reasoned, pragmatic ethic. Praised in Britain as \\"the best sort of history\\" and \\"a model of its kind,\\" Primo Levi: A Life is certain to take its place as the standard biography and a necessary companion to the works themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTmuAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beowulf and Other Old English Poems","description":"Unique and beautiful, Beowulf brings to life a society of violence and honor, fierce warriors and bloody battles, deadly monsters and famous swords.

Untouched for 3,300 years, the ancient tomb, filled with spectacular treasures, raised many questions about the legendary reign of this boy king. Recently Tut has been in the news again. Not only has a traveling museum exhibit of his tomb's fascinating artifacts drawn the public's attention, but also a CT scan of his body, which provides new evidence concerning the king's fate, has received a good deal of media attention. Based on this new investigation, an Egyptian team of scientists and scholars has now publicly ruled out the possibility that Tut was murdered.In this thorough and intriguing review of all of the evidence, two law enforcement specialists in forensics and the psychology of criminal behavior dispute the conclusions reached by the Egyptian team. Applying sophisticated crime-solving techniques used in the investigation of contemporary murders, Detectives King and Cooper make a compelling case that the cause of King Tut's death was most likely murder.The detectives' investigation concentrates on Tut's inner circle of close confidants. One by one, the suspects are eliminated, due to evidence or probable cause, until in the end the detectives focus on the most likely suspect.For readers who enjoy mysteries, true crime, and history, Who Killed King Tut? is both an educational read and a real page-turner.Michael R. King is a senior investigative analyst for Motorola. He is a former State Attorney General Chief of Staff and intelligence supervisor for the Utah Criminal Intelligence Center and Homeland Security.Gregory M. Cooper is a manager and analyst for Motorola.

An Exercise in Serenity: Easing Stress, Depression and Dependence Through Strength Training","description":"Most addictive behavior is rooted in some type of loss, be it the death of a loved one, coming to terms with limitations set by chronic health problems, or the end of a relationship. By turning to drugs and alcohol, people who have suffered a loss can numb their grief. In the process, they postpone their healing and can drive themselves further into addiction. The Mindfulness Workbook for Addiction offers readers an effective program for working through their addiction and grief with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT). Created by a psychologist who works for the Department of Veterans Affairs and a marriage and family therapist who works for Sharp Mesa Vista Hospital, this mindfulness training workbook is effective for treating the emotion dysregulation, stress, depression, and grief that lie at the heart of addiction. No matter the loss, the mindfulness skills in this workbook help readers process their grief, determine the function their addiction is serving, and replace the addiction with healthy coping behaviors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V7KYsmNBn8EC&dq=Breakthrough!+An+Exercise+in+Serenity:+Easing+Stress,+Depression+and+Dependence+Through+Strength+Training&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Warming the Stone Child","description":"Warming the Stone Children is a true story of mother-daughter sexual abuse.

We say we love people in our lives yet, too often, we don't act very lovingly. Nor do we choose our partners wisely. This lack of understanding about love is reflected in the ever-increasing divorce rate and the huge number of people who ask with a deep yearning in their hearts: Why is love so hard? The Feel The Fear Guide To... Lasting Love shows what real love actually looks like, how to learn the essentials for finding it - and how to make it last a lifetime. It also lays out solutions to common problems and explains the destructive power of fear.

Each chapter is a small window into the mysteries of nature and soul as they infuse daily life. Cowan draws on the teachings of medieval mystics, fairy legends, Celtic songs, present-day poets and seekers, and Native American stories.

Graessley that presents a unified view of flexible-chain polymer liquids and networks. The topics of both volumes range from equilibrium properties to dynamic response, finite deformation behavior and non-Newtonian flow. The second book will be titled Polymeric Liquids and Networks: Dynamics and Rheology. These various aspects of the field were developed over the past 70 years by researchers from many academic disciplines. The infusion of fresh viewpoints continually invigorated and enriched the field, making polymeric liquids and networks a truly interdisciplinary subject. The lack of a common terminology and perspective, however, has led to compartmentalization, making it difficult for a newcomer, even one technically trained, to gain a broad appreciation of the field and to see the relationships among its various parts. The aim of these two books, without diluting the substance, is to achieve a desired unity. Polymeric Liquids and Networks emphasizes fundamental principles and a molecular viewpoint. The conceptual basis of theories underlying each topical area is explained with derivations sometimes outlined briefly and sometimes given in detail. Technical terminology is kept to a minimum necessary for coherent presentation. The goal of the text is to provide an informed understanding rather than detailed technical proficiency. Theory, experiment, and simulation are woven together as appropriate for achieving a balanced view. The books are designed to serve academic and industrial needs, consolidating the understanding of topics with both practical and fundamental significance, and written from a technical but non-specialized perspective. The books deal mainly with non-polar and weakly polar species and largely with results derived from experiments on structurally well-defined systems. The objective is not to ignore the more complex systems, which are pervasive in both nature and industry and important in their own right. Much space is devoted to structural distributions, their characterization and their effect on properties. It is rather to provide a framework for better understanding of all polymeric liquids by identifying, in the simplest possible circumstances, the universal attributes of a chain-like and flexible molecular structure.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wTjangEACAAJ&dq=Polymeric+Liquids+and+Networks&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Make a Swedish Christmas!

Jim Harrison in The New York Times Book Review Chris Dombrowski, a poet and passionate fly-fisher, had a second child on the way and an income hovering perilously close to zero when he received a miraculous email: can t go, it s all paid for, just book a flight to Miami. Thus began a journey that would eventually lead to the Bahamas and to David Pinder, a legendary bonefishing guide. Bonefish are prized for their elusiveness and their tenacity. And no one was better at hunting them than Pinder, a Bahamian whose accuracy and patience were virtuosic. He knows what the fish think, said one fisherman, before they think it. By the time Dombrowski meets him, though, Pinder has been abandoned by the industry he helped build. With cataracts from a lifetime of staring at the water and a tiny severance package after forty years of service, he watches as the world of his beloved bonefish is degraded by tourists he himself did so much to attract. But as Pinder s stories unfold, Dombrowski discovers a profound integrity and wisdom in the bonefishing guide s life.  A poet and Montana-based fly-fishing guide recounts his trip to the Bahamas, where he met an aging guide who taught him about fish and life loosely links reflections on his experiences catching and releasing bonefish, the history and geography of the Bahamas, the construction of fishing rods, stories he has told his children, and the difference between fishing or hunting for sport and for dinner.

When Rye needs a roommate, Julian moves in, and a quiet, compulsive envy takes root, assuring, at least in his own mind, that he will never achieve Rye s certain success. Both men are fascinated with their beautiful and talented classmate, Magda, whose captivating images of her Polish neighborhood set her apart, and each will come to know her intimately  a woman neither can possess and only one can love. Twenty years later, long after their paths diverge, Rye is at the top of his field, famous for his photographs of celebrities and far removed from the downtrodden and disenfranchised subjects who d secured his reputation as the eye of his generation. When Magda reenters his life, asking for help only he can give, Rye finds himself in a broken landscape of street people and addicts, forcing him to reckon with the artist he once was, until his search for a missing boy becomes his own desperate fight to survive. Months later, when Julian discovers Rye s obituary, the paper makes it sound like a suicide. Despite himself, Julian attends the funeral, where there is no casket and no body. This sudden reentry into a world he thought he left behind forces Julian to question not only Rye s death, but the very foundations of his life.

Author Oliver Bradbury presents a compelling argument that the influence of Soane (1753-1837) has persevered through the centuries, rather than waning around the time of his death. Through examinations of internationally-renowned architects from Benjamin Henry Latrobe to Philip Johnson, as well as a number of not so well known Soanean disciples, Bradbury posits that Soane is perhaps second only to Palladio in terms of the longevity of his influence on architecture through the course of more than two centuries, from the early 1790s to today, concluding with the recent return to pure revivalism. Previous investigations have been limited to focusing on Soane?s late-Georgian and then post-modern influence; this is the first in-depth study of his impact over the course of two centuries. Through this survey, Bradbury demonstrates that Soane?s influence has been truly international in the pre-modern era, reaching throughout the British Isles and beyond to North America and even colonial Australia. Through his inclusion of select, detailed case studies, Bradbury contends that Soane?s is a continuing, not negated, legacy in architecture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CD0rDwAAQBAJ&dq=James+Gowan+(Architectural+Monographs+No+3)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Rogue's Proposal (BCED)","description":"Demon Cynster has seen love bring his brethren to their knees, and he s vowed that he will not share their fate ... until he spies Felicity Parteger sneaking about his racing stable.

Given the fervent renewed appreciation for the contributions Albert Einstein has bestowed on humanity, Parker thinks it only right to dedicate a book to explaining in the clearest possible terms the meaning and beauty of Einstein's theories.While tracing the story of Einstein's life, Parker seizes on the crucial groundbreaking theories that Einstein envisioned. Not since Isaac Newton had anyone conceived the universe in such a revolutionary, startling new way. Through Parker's eloquence, eye for detail, and clever use of Einsteinian cartoons and vivid illustrations, he enables the reader to see and appreciate for perhaps the first time the full meaning and scope of Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity and General Theory of Relativity.Parker then guides the reader to the next step in Einstein's revelations: the possibility of time travel. In exploring the fascinating implications of Einstein's thought, Parker treats us to the experience of discovering a black hole, traversing curved spacetime, and greeting our much younger twin who has just returned from a long and arduous spaceflight.Parker's incomparable gift for language captures Einstein's uniqueness, singular brilliance, and stunning theories.

His Anthropology and Modern Life shows how Boas uses science in the service of humanity, hoping to break down racial and cultural barriers.From the book's very opening, Boas shatters the myth that anthropology is simply a collection of curious facts about exotic peoples and their customs and belief systems. He asserts that a clear understanding of the principles of anthropology illuminates the social processes of our own times and may show us the book's what to do and what to avoid. Boas proceeds to discuss issues that have had resounding significance in our own time: the problem of defining race; the subjective view of racial types; heredity versus environment; alleged physiological and mental differences between races; the significance of intelligence tests; the importance of one's cultural experience; open versus closed societies; nationality and nationalism; the mixed descent of European nations; eugenics; social conditions versus heredity in the committing of crimes; intolerance; and the influence of race and sex on a successful education. While he outwardly acknowledges that his book runs contrary to popular prejudices, Boas was an optimist, and hoped that dissenters, in reading Anthropology and Modern Life, would come to reexamine their own viewpoints dispassionately and critically.This new edition of Anthropology and Modern Life is enhanced by an extended introduction by Herbert S. Lewis, who details Franz Boas' life, influence, and ideals. This volume will be a welcome contribution to the libraries of anthropologists, sociologists, and those concerned with human rights.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=STQrDwAAQBAJ&dq=Anthropology+and+Modern+Life+(Classics+in+Anthropology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The outlaw years;: The history of the land pirates of the Natchez trace","description":"The years just before 1880 until about 1885 are considered the \\"outlaw years,\\" when lawlessness developed a law of its own and planned an empire. Operating along the Natchez Trace, an overland trading and postal-rider route that in places was barely a trail, the outlaws preyed upon the traffic along this line. Their plans were laid in the dives under the bluffs of the river towns--Natchez and Vicksburg and as far south as New Orleans. By far the bloodiest were the Harpes, who were capable of spectacular murders solely to amuse their comrades. Another gang of outlaws under John Murrell even threatened national stability for a time in his plot to steal slaves and organize insurrection in order to disorganize the government and establish his own state. This conspiracy was discovered and defeated by a store clerk who joined the outlaws and lived several perilous months among them. He was almost hung by Murrell's secret partisans among the \\"respectable\\" elements. After the overthrow of the \\"outlaw empire\\" in 1885, the scene shifted: the frontier advanced; outlaw violence changed its forms, but it never again reached the terrible and magnificent range of the \\"outlaw years.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tNYRIxzNJCIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Lust","description":"Devoted husband, loving father, respected businessman, Dayton Leroy Rogers was, in reality, the murderer of women","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lNSKNwAACAAJ&dq=Blood+Lust&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Secret Wife (Larger Print Superromance)","description":"The Secret Wife by Carrie Weaver released on May 10, 2005 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=80FoiFkFFA0C&dq=The+Secret+Wife+(Larger+Print+Superromance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ninjitsu For Women: Ninja Secrets of Defensive Fighting","description":"Showing how women are getting their \\"kicks\\" nowadays, this guide instructs on how to defend against any attacker and how to distract, disable, disarm, and then disappear. 150 illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYk3DTHRk_wC&dq=Ninjitsu+For+Women:+Ninja+Secrets+of+Defensive+Fighting&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Inside Look At America's Teams (Meet The Women Of American Soccer)","description":"Profiles and photographs of American women soccer players.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=26YJAAAACAAJ&dq=An+Inside+Look+At+America%27s+Teams+(Meet+The+Women+Of+American+Soccer)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principia Ethica : With the Preface to the Second Edition and Other Papers; Revised Edition","description":"Recognized as the definitive starting point for twentieth-century ethical theory, the text is reprinted with the previously unpublished preface Moore wrote for a planned, but never completed, second edition. \\"Free Will\\" and \\"The Conception of Intrinsic Value\\" are also included from his later ethical writings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLpcgAQvr_gC&dq=Principia+Ethica+:+With+the+Preface+to+the+Second+Edition+and+Other+Papers%3B+Revised+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Icons of Jazz","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z8tszgEACAAJ&dq=Icons+of+Jazz&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood and Banquets: A Berlin Diary 1930-38","description":"The diary, smuggled out of Nazi Germany, of a Jewish woman who wrote the social column for a major Berlin newspaper, and was able to observe the rise of the Nazis","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i6cqAQAAMAAJ&dq=Blood+and+Banquets:+A+Berlin+Diary+1930-38&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best face forward","description":"From the Internet s favorite dermatologist, and the star of TLC's Dr. Pimple Popper, an entertaining, comprehensive, illustrated skin care guide from the social media phenomenon and board-certified Dermatologist, Dr. Sandra Lee.

Israel is a tiny state, and yet it has captured the world s attention, aroused its imagination, and lately, been the object of its opprobrium. Why does such a small country speak to so many global concerns? More pressingly: Why does Israel make the decisions it does? And what lies in its future? We cannot answer these questions until we understand Israel s people and the questions and conflicts, the hopes and desires, that have animated their conversations and actions. Though Israel s history is rife with conflict, these conflicts do not fully communicate the spirit of Israel and its people: they give short shrift to the dream that gave birth to the state, and to the vision for the Jewish people that was at its core. Guiding us through the milestones of Israeli history, Gordis relays the drama of the Jewish people s story and the creation of the state. Clear-eyed and erudite, he illustrates how Israel became a cultural, economic and military powerhouse but also explains where Israel made grave mistakes and traces the long history of Israel s deepening isolation. With Israel, public intellectual Daniel Gordis offers us a brief but thorough account of the cultural, economic, and political history of this complex nation, from its beginnings to the present. Accessible, levelheaded, and rigorous, Israel sheds light on the Israel s past so we can understand its future. The result is a vivid portrait of a people, and a nation, reborn.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cQlyCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corpus of Early Arabic Sources for West African History","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=yrDsuQEACAAJ&dq=Corpus+of+Early+Arabic+Sources+for+West+African+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Optimists","description":"Investors have too often extrapolated from recent experience. In the 1950s, who but the most rampant optimist would have dreamt that over the next fifty years the real return on equities would be 9% per year? Yet this is what happened in the U.S. stock market. The optimists triumphed. However, as Don Marquis observed, an optimist is someone who never had much experience. The authors of this book extend our experience across regions and across time. They present a comprehensive and consistent analysis of investment returns for equities, bonds, bills, currencies and inflation, spanning sixteen countries, from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first. This is achieved in a clear and simple way, with over 130 color diagrams that make comparison easy. Crucially, the authors analyze total returns, including reinvested income. They show that some historical indexes overstate long-term performance because they are contaminated by survivorship bias and that long-term stock returns are in most countries seriously overestimated, due to a focus on periods that with hindsight are known to have been successful. The book also provides the first comprehensive evidence on the long-term equity risk premium--the reward for bearing the risk of common stocks. The authors reveal whether the United States and United Kingdom have had unusually high stock market returns compared to other countries. The book covers the U.S., the U.K., Japan, France, Germany, Canada, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden, Belgium, Ireland, Denmark, and South Africa. Triumph of the Optimists is required reading for investment professionals, financial economists, and investors. It will be the definitive reference in the field and consulted for years to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ntNpQ5VbpmMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Along This Way: The Autobiography of James Weldon Johnson","description":"The autobiography of the celebrated African American writer and civil rights activist Published just four years before his death in 1938, James Weldon Johnson's autobiography is a fascinating portrait of an African American who broke the racial divide at a time when the Harlem Renaissance had not yet begun to usher in the civil rights movement. Not only an educator, lawyer, and diplomat, Johnson was also one of the most revered leaders of his time, going on to serve as the first black president of the NAACP (which had previously been run only by whites), as well as write the groundbreaking novel The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man.

Due to its spectacular long-run economic performance and impressive social development, it has been termed both an economic success story and a developmental state. While there is uniqueness in the Botswana experience, several aspects of the country s opportunities and challenges are of a more general nature. Throughout its history, Botswana has been both blessed and hindered by its natural resource abundance and dependency, which have influenced growth periods, opportunities for economic diversification, strategies for sustainable economic and social development, and the distribution of incomes and opportunities. Through a political economy framework, Hillbom and Bolt provide an updated understanding of an African success story, covering the period from the mid-19th century, when the Tswana groups settled, to the present day. Understanding the interaction over time between geography and factor endowments on the one hand, and the development of economic and political institutions on the other, offers principle lessons from Botswana s experience to other natural resource rich developing countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZmJRDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"All Shall Be Well","description":"Each book in the Thirty Days with a Great Spiritual Teacher series provides a month of daily readings from one of Christianity's most beloved spiritual guides.

The instrument used was the Attitudes Towards Teaching All Students (ATTAS-mm) survey, which incorporated questions on teachers' attitudes toward students with disabilities as well as the number of years of teaching experience, special education experience, and the amount of participation in special education coursework to determine influence on teacher attitude.The data were analyzed using one-way and two-way ANOVAs to determine the differences of attitudes of the teachers toward students with special needs in their classrooms, and whether teaching experience, special education experience, and/or the amount of professional development had a positive impact on the attitude of the teachers.The results of this study revealed differences in general education and special education teacher attitude toward students with disabilities. In the Affective domain and the Behavioral domain, correlations were statistically significant. The analysis also revealed the unexpected finding that relationships in the Cognitive dimension were not significant. Results of this study can be used in teacher preparation programs for early childhood teachers and in professional learning opportunities for schools and school districts. Specifically, teachers must be prepared to teach students with special needs. According to Avalos (2011), professional learning for teachers is strongly recommended. Schools can facilitate the process, which is strengthened through experiences such as courses and educational learning opportunities. This study demonstrated the number of special education courses, and special education experience had a positive relationship to the attitudes of teachers. The negative, but statistically significant relationship between teaching experience and attitude demonstrated the need for hands-on teaching experiences. College teacher education programs should include additional courses that contain strategies to teach students with special needs and also include student teaching in special education settings for all teachers, not just special education teachers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qnRgzgEACAAJ&dq=Teacher+with+an+Attitude&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Jewels of the Duchess of Windsor","description":"\\"...an enduring record of the most remarkable jewellery sale of our time, each piece of the Windsor collection is fully described not only im gemological terms but also in relation to the lives of the celebrated couple\\"--book jacket flap.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q0MTAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Jewels+of+the+Duchess+of+Windsor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Busy Day Book of Action Words","description":"Help the busy vet as she listens to buster's heart, gives Carla her medicine and X-rays Bella's leg.

Its scope is intended to span the full range of interests from classical problems in the philosophy of mind and philosophical psycholo gy through issues in cognitive psychology and sociobiology (concerning the mental capabilities of other species) to ideas related to artificial in telligence and to computer science. While primary emphasis will be placed upon theoretical, conceptual, and epistemological aspects of these prob lems and domains, empirical, experimental, and methodological studies will also appear from time to time. The perspective that prevails in artificial intelligence today suggests that the theory of computability defines the boundaries of the nature of thought, precisely because all thinking is computational. This paradigm draws its inspiration from the symbol-system hypothesis of Newell and Simon and finds its culmination in the computational conception of lan guage and mentality. The \\"standard conception\\" represented by these views is subjected to a thorough and sustained critique in the pages of this book. Employing a distinction between systems for which signs are signif icant for the users of a system and others for which signs are significant for use by a system, I have sought to define the boundaries of what AI, in principle, may be expected to achieve.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=77SLBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gottlieb Schober of Salem: Discipleship and Ecumenical Vision in a Moravian Town","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oXTZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Gottlieb+Schober+of+Salem:+Discipleship+and+Ecumenical+Vision+in+a+Moravian+Town&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Political Correctness: Are There Limits to This Lunacy?","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=a7MJAAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+Political+Correctness:+Are+There+Limits+to+This+Lunacy%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Student Development in College Theory, Research, and Practice","description":"THE ESSENTIAL STUDENT DEVELOPMENT REFERENCE, UPDATED WITH CUTTING-EDGE THEORY AND PRACTICE Student Development in College is the go-to resource for student affairs, and is considered a key reference for those most committed to conscious and intentional student affairs practice.

Part memoir and part self-help guide, this very personal story traces the private struggles that Ellis faced from early childhood to well into his adult life. Whether you are already familiar with Ellis s many best-selling psychology books or are discovering his work for the first time, you will gain many insights into how to deal with your problems by seeing how Ellis learned to cope with his own serious challenges. In his early life, Ellis was faced with a major physical disability, chronic nephritis, which plagued him from age five to nine and led to hospitalization. This experience then caused the emotional reaction of separation anxiety. At this time he also suffered from severe, migraine-like headaches, which persisted into his forties. Later in life, he realized that some of his emotional upset was the result of initially taking parental neglect too seriously. Active and energetic by nature, he gradually learned that the best way to cope with any problem, physical or emotional, was to stop \\"catastrophizing\\" and to do something to correct it. As Ellis points out in all of his work, when faced with adversity, we must realize that we have a real choice, either to think rationally about the problem or to react irrationally. The first choice leads to healthy consequences normal emotions such as sorrow, regret, frustration, or annoyance, which are justifiable reactions to troubling situations. The second choice leads to the unhealthy consequences of anxiety, depression, rage, and low self-esteem. When we recognize irrational beliefs as such, we must then use our reason to dispute their validity. Ellis goes on to describe how these techniques helped him to cope with many other adult emotional problems, including failure in love affairs, shame, anger, distress over his parents  divorce, stress from others  reactions to his atheistic convictions, and upset due to his attitudes about academic and professional setbacks. Honest and unflinching yet always positive and forward-looking, Ellis demonstrates how to gain and grow from trying experiences through rational thinking.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VHNwQgAACAAJ&dq=Rational+Emotive+Behavior+Therapy:+It+Works+for+Me+-+It+Can+Work+for+You&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Three Day Passes","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9u8HAQAAIAAJ&dq=Three+Day+Passes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Loony-Bin Trip","description":"A personal story of Kate Millett's struggle to regain control of her life after falling under an ascription of manic depression.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1DcIdv-7j3AC&dq=The+Loony-Bin+Trip&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cockatiel: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"This is our sixth set of Happy, Healthy Pet titles.

Almost all these books owe a tremendous debt to Colonel Count Yorck von Wartenburg. His book was published at the end of the nineteenth Century and is still as important today; indeed, Dr David Chandler acknowledges that he used the book as one of the primary works when researching his momentous history of Napoleon. After a brief look at Napoleon s youth and early career Wartenburg sets out Napoleon s military exploits chronologically, beginning with the campaign in Italy, and the battles for Mantua. The first volume then describes the campaigns in Egypt and Syria before giving an account of the first of Napoleon s great battles: Marengo. Ulm, Austerlitz, Jena, Eylau and Friedland complete Volume I. The writing is always clear and uncomplicated, suiting a description of twenty years in Europe which threw the political map into confusion, and had as legacy the mistrust between France and the remainder of the continent, and the growth of Prussian military might and British complacency in military matters.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jHy-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creative game for the Timex/Sinclair 2068","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R3uPtAEACAAJ&dq=Creative+game+for+the+Timex/Sinclair+2068&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guide to the Camarilla and the Sabbat (Vampire, the Masquerade)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gUSxAAAACAAJ&dq=Guide+to+the+Camarilla+and+the+Sabbat+(Vampire,+the+Masquerade)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WINGS,WHEELS & SAILS (Tell Me About)","description":"Questions and answers describe several types of vehicles that use wings, wheels, or sails as their means of propulsion.

In its \\"active mode\\" we use it to \\"interrogate\\" the physical world, sending appropriate \\"signals\\" and receiving nature's \\"reply\\". In the \\"passive mode\\" we receive nature's signals directly. Since we never know a prioriwhat particular return signal will be forthcoming, we must necessarily adopt a probabilistic model of communication. This has developed over the approximately seventy years since it's beginning, into a Statistical Communication Theory (or SCT). Here it is the set or ensemble of possible results which is meaningful. From this ensemble we attempt to construct in the appropriate model format, based on our understanding of the observed physical data and on the associated statistical mechanism, analytically represented by suitable probability measures. Since its inception in the late '30's of the last century, and in particular subsequent to World War II, SCT has grown into a major field of study. As we have noted above, SCT is applicable to all branches of science. The latter itself is inherently and ultimately probabilistic at all levels. Moreover, in the natural world there is always a random background \\"noise\\" as well as an inherent a priori uncertainty in the presentation of deterministic observations, i.e. those which are specifically obtained, a posteriori. The purpose of the book is to introduce Non-Gaussian statistical communication theory and demonstrate how the theory improves probabilistic model. The book was originally planed to include 24 chapters as seen in the table of preface. Dr. Middleton completed first 10 chapters prior to his passing in 2008.

By applying critical discourse analysis methodology to the Los Angeles Times, Arizona Republic, Albuquerque Journal, and Houston Chronicle during a peak epoch of border militarization policies (19932006), brownness emerges through a news crime frame that reflexively shows the values and meanings of whiteness and the nation. At the body scale, border crossings threaten the whiteness of the national body through suggestions of rape and disfigurement. Border news discourse feminizes the nation with nurturing resources and services under threat of immigrant  rape  as well as expresses racial anxiety about a  changing face  of the nation. Border news coverage constructs immigrants as home intruders at the house scale, both human and animal. Whiteness at this scale reflexively signifies a law-abiding, rightful owner of property protecting against criminal trespassing. Brown immigrants are also seen as wild animals, which constructs whiteness burdened with the task of animal management. Whiteness at the regional scale suggests a masculinized, militarized battleground or a settled region threatened by a brown, cataclysmic flood. Finally, the nation scale complements the body scale but in a more contemporary and scientific way. Whiteness reflects a body politic fighting the disease of cancer/immigration in two ways: with an imagined militaristic, immune system and with hi-tech, aggressive operations. This  diseased body politic  communicates whiteness and nativism about the border through discursive border symptoms and border operations that represent the intersection of immunology discourse, the racial construction of the body politic, and anxiety about postmodern economic transformation and its impact on national borders.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0K68DwAAQBAJ&dq=NEWS+FROM+THE+BORDER&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Virgin Islands Alive!","description":"Annotation St. Thomas, St. John, St. Croix are the major US Virgin Islands, and they are among the most popular destinations in the Caribbean.

Borodin is #50) * A detailed and anecdotal look at each composer's life and work * The five primary works of each composer and specific recommended CDs for each. * Further great works of each composer--if you really like him * Concise explanations of musical terminology, forms, and periods * A guide to the parts and history of the symphony orchestra \\"This book uses every conceivable gimmick to immerse readers in the richness of classical music: lists, rankings, sidebars devoted to lively anecdotes, and catchy leads.\\" --The Washington Post \\"One terrific music appreciation book...The information is surprisingly detailed but concisely presented. Goulding's writing style is breezy yet mature....[He] has raised music appreciation from a racket to a service.\\" --The Arizona Daily Star","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vGLL4fEE08sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chart No. 1","description":"Chart Number One is essential to correct and accurate use of nautical charts.

Anglicans and other Protestants have also begun to use the rosary to help refresh a life of prayer--it creates a rhythm that helps wean us from our distractions and focus our attention so that we can more readily move into God's presence. As the beads and prayers recede into the background, the mysteries that make up the rosary come into our minds and hearts like religious pictures or icons. First published by Doubleday in 1975, J. Neville Ward's unusual collection of meditations offer an entirely new approach to the rosary for all Christians. He begins with its traditional use and then offers fifteen insights into the life of Jesus and his mother Mary that can speak to us today. Thus a meditation on the sorrowful themes reminds us of the suffering that is so much a part of our own lives, while the joyful and glorious mysteries speak of the desire for faith, hope, and love that will heal them. These reflections serve up a rich spiritual repast for Christians seeking new contemplative practices and learning to pray with the rosary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iPwyEAAAQBAJ&dq=Five+For+Sorrow,+Ten+For+Joy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Family Manager's Everyday Survival Guide","description":"Tells how to reduce clutter, recommends weekly and monthly tasks, and offers advice on effective food shopping, cleaning, and time management","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g6yGpB6JbJsC&dq=The+Family+Manager%27s+Everyday+Survival+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A History of Scandinavia: Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland","description":"Traces the history of Scandinavian countries, emphasizing common features in their heritage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eDh5z2_K_S0C&dq=A+History+of+Scandinavia:+Norway,+Sweden,+Denmark,+Finland+and+Iceland&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The concept of mind (Barnes & Noble everyday handbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q1okzQEACAAJ&dq=The+concept+of+mind+(Barnes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discourse markers (Studies in interactional sociolinguistics)","description":"Discourse markers - the particles oh, well, now, then, you know and I mean, and the connectives so, because, and, but and or - perform important functions in conversation. Dr Schiffrin's approach is firmly interdisciplinary, within linguistics and sociology, and her rigourous analysis clearly demonstrates that neither the markers, nor the discourse within which they function, can be understood from one point of view alone, but only as an integration of structural, semantic, pragmatic, and social factors. The core of the book is a comparative analysis of markers within conversational discourse collected by Dr Schiffrin during sociolinguistic fieldwork. The study concludes that markers provide contextual coordinates which aid in the production and interpretation of coherent conversation at both local and global levels of organization. It raises a wide range of theoretical and methodological issues important to discourse analysis - including the relationship between meaning and use, the role of qualitative and quantitative analyses - and the insights it offers will be of particular value to readers confronting the very substantial problems presented by the search for a model of discourse which is based on what people actually say, mean, and do with words in everyday social interaction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QcPLCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Simplified Diet Manual","description":"Hospitals and long-term care facilities in every state and many foreign countries use the Simplified Diet Manual to assist them in planning nutritious, appealing, and cost-effective meals that are modified to meet the dietary requirements of individuals with special health needs.

It is well known that Hegel exerted a major influence on the development of Marx's thought. This circumstance led Luk cs, one of the chief Marxist theoreticians of this century, to embark on his exploration of Hegelian antecedents in the German intellectual tradition, their concrete expression in the work of Hegel himself, and later syntheses of seemingly contradictory modes of though. Four phases of Hegel's intellectual development are examined: \\"Hegel's early republican phase,\\" \\"the crisis in Hegel's views on society and the earliest beginnings of his dialectical method,\\" \\"rationale and defense of objective idealism,\\" and \\"the breach with Schelling and The Phenomenology of Mind.\\" Luk cs completed this study in 1938, but because of the imminent outbreak of war, it was not published until the late 1940s.

She stresses the importance of identifying each autistic individual's nonverbal language - which can be visual, tactile, kinaesthetic, auditory, olfactory or gustatory - with a view to establish a shared means of verbal communication. She offers an explanation of why certain approaches, for example PECS, might work with some autistic children but not others. Offering real insights, the \`What They Say' sections enable the reader to see through the eyes of autistic individuals and to understand their language differences first hand. \`What We Can Do to Help' sections throughout the book give practical recommendations on what to do in order to help autistic individuals use their natural mechanisms to learn and develop social and communicative skills. The final chapters are devoted to assessment and intervention issues with practical recommendations for selecting appropriate methods and techniques to enhance communication, based on the specific mode of communication a person uses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DmHGaJrduIwC&dq=Communication+Issues+In+Autism+And+Asperger+Syndrome:+Do+We+Speak+The+Same+Language%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Eye Of The Artist, 1e","description":"Where medical science and artistic philosophy meet, you will find The Eye of the Artist.

Having such a person indebted to you is a great insurance policy. There was one nation that did treat the Jews as if they were powerful and rich. The Japanese never had much exposure to Jews, and knew very little about them. In 1919 Japan fought alongside the anti-Semitic White Russians against the Communists. At that time the White Russians introduced the Japanese to the book, \\"The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\\". The Japanese studied the book and, according to all accounts, naively believed its propaganda. Their reaction was immediate and forceful -- they formulated a plan to encourage Jewish settlement and investment into Manchuria. People with such wealth and power as the Jews possess, the Japanese determined, are exactly the type of people with whom we want to do business! The Japanese called their plan for Jewish settlement \\"The Fugu Plan\\". The fugu is a highly poisonous blowfish. After the toxin-containing organs are painstakingly removed, it is used as a food in Japan, and is considered an exquisite delicacy. If it is not prepared carefully, however, its poison can kill a person. The Japanese saw the Jews as a nation with highly valuable potential, but, as with the fugu, in order to take advantage of that potential, they had to be extremely careful. Otherwise, the Japanese thought, the plan would backfire and the Jews would annihilate Japan with their awesome power. The Japanese were allies of the Nazis, yet they allowed thousands of European refugees -- including the entire Mirrer Yeshivah -- to enter Shanghai and Kobe during World War II. They welcomed these Jews into their country, not because they bore any great love for the Jews, but because they believed that Jews had access to enormous resources and amazingly influential power, which could greatly benefit Japan. If anti-Semites truly believe that Jews rule the world, why don't they all relate to Jews like the Japanese did? The fact that Jews are generally treated as outcasts proves that people do not really believe that Jews are anywhere near as wealthy or powerful as they claim. It proves that anti-Semites do not take their own propaganda seriously.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5dCY1mp2R2gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Dark Crusader","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=En5tNAEACAAJ&dq=The+Dark+Crusader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lament for the Molly Maguires","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5LhrAAAAIAAJ&dq=Lament+for+the+Molly+Maguires&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come to the Feast: An Invitation to Eucharistic Transformation","description":"An attempt to revive the Mass through an interpretation of the Eucharistic story, this text offers a central notion by which one can experience the fullness of the Eucharist, as a gift that is God's self.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M9KoAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hullabaloo: A little bit of heaven ... a whole lot of hell! : a true story","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c0yqAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Hullabaloo:+A+little+bit+of+heaven+...+a+whole+lot+of+hell!+:+a+true+story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Appalachian frontier;: America's first surge westward","description":"John A. Caruso s The Appalachian Frontier is a stirring drama of the beginnings of American westward expansion. It traces the advance of the frontier in the area between the Ohio and Tennessee rivers and the development of the American character those attitudes toward personal liberty and dignity that have come to epitomize our national ideal. The Appalachian Frontier is no mere catalog of facts; it is a recreation of life. Not until about 1650, more than a generation after the first English settlements were established on the eastern coast, did organized bands of white explorers, hunters and fur trappers venture very far into the trackless back country claimed by the British Crown. Beginning with those earliest scouting parties The Appalachian Frontier presses with the pioneers past the Fall Line and the pine barrens into the Piedmont of Virginia, on through gaps in the Blue Ridge Mountains to the Great Valley of the Appalachians, through the Great Valley to the jagged peaks of the Allegheny Front and, finally, over those peaks into the rich country of Kentucky and Tennessee. As the frontiersman advances he discovers that the rules prevailing in the European-dominated eastern settlements do not apply in his new situation. Thus we see him formulate the rudiments of a law of his own. As his life grows more complex, he frames compacts and, finally; constitutions peculiarly adapted to the exigencies of frontier living. We are present at the inception of the fluid democracy that later engulfed the more stable coastal colonies and ultimately came to characterize the government of the United States. The story closes, quite properly, with the admission of Tennessee into the Union in 1796. In John A. Caruso s bright, informal, sometimes almost racy telling of the tale, historical personages emerge as real people whose triumphs and heartaches we share, with whose deficiencies and inadequacies we sympathize, and in whose hours of nobility we rejoice.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3RkkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Encyclopedia of Nutritional Supplements: The Essential Guide for Improving Your Health Naturally","description":"Discusses the role of nutritional supplements in promoting good health, and describes specific vitamins, minerals, essential fatty acids, glandular products, and other nutrients","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XBd0FvcmaSsC&dq=Encyclopedia+of+Nutritional+Supplements:+The+Essential+Guide+for+Improving+Your+Health+Naturally&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sleepless nights in the Procrustean bed: Essays (I.O.

The term 'Transeurasian' refers to a large group of geographically adjacent languages that includes five uncontroversial linguistic families: Japonic, Koreanic, Tungusic, Mongolic, and Turkic. The historical connection between these languages, however, constitutes one of the most debated issues in historical comparative linguistics. In the present book, a team of leading international scholars in the field take a balanced approach to this controversy, integrating different theoretical frameworks, combining both functional and formal linguistics, and showing that genealogical and areal approaches are in fact compatible with one another. The volume is divided into five parts. Part I deals with the historical sources and periodization of the Transeurasian languages and their classification and typology. In Part II, chapters provide individual structural overviews of the Transeurasian languages and the linguistic subgroups that they belong to, while Part III explores Transeurasian phonology, morphology, syntax, lexis, and semantics from a comparative perspective. Part IV offers a range of areal and genealogical explanations for the correlations observed in the preceding parts. Finally, Part V combines archaeological, genetic, and anthropological perspectives on the identity of speakers of Transeurasian languages. The Oxford Guide to the Transeurasian Languages will be an indispensable resource for specialists in Japonic, Koreanic, Tungusic, Mongolic, and Turkic languages and for anyone with an interest in Transeurasian and comparative linguistics more broadly.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PyrtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cats of Lamu","description":"This beautiful and intriguing exploration of the cats of the exotic African island of Lamu features more than 100 full-color photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1C0KAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Cats+of+Lamu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Shadow Before","description":"Growing up in a tranquil wilderness, Teal Swan had a childhood that was anything but serene.

Like the novels of James Michener, The Princes of Ireland brilliantly interweaves engrossing fiction and well-researched fact to capture the essence of a place. Edward Rutherfurd has introduced millions of readers to the human dramas that are the lifeblood of history. From his first bestseller, Sarum, to the #1 bestseller London, he has captivated audiences with gripping narratives that follow the fortunes of several fictional families down through the ages. The Princes of Ireland, a sweeping panorama steeped in the tragedy and glory that is Ireland, epitomizes the power and richness of Rutherfurd s storytelling magic. The saga begins in pre-Christian Ireland with a clever refashioning of the legend of Cuchulainn, and culminates in the dramatic founding of the Free Irish State in 1922. Through the interlocking stories of a wonderfully imagined cast of characters -- monks and noblemen, soldiers and rebels, craftswomen and writers -- Rutherfurd vividly conveys the personal passions and shared dreams that shaped the character of the country. He takes readers inside all the major events in Irish history: the reign of the fierce and mighty kings of Tara; the mission of Saint Patrick; the Viking invasion and the founding of Dublin; the trickery of Henry II, which gave England its foothold on the island in 1167; the plantations of the Tudors and the savagery of Cromwell; the flight of the  Wild Geese ; the failed rebellion of 1798; the Great Famine and the Easter Rebellion. With Rutherfurd s well-crafted storytelling, readers witness the rise of the Fenians in the late nineteenth century, the splendours of the Irish cultural renaissance, and the bloody battles for Irish independence, as though experiencing their momentous impact firsthand. Tens of millions of North Americans claim Irish descent. Generations of people have been enchanted by Irish literature, and visitors flock to Dublin and its environs year after year. The Princes of Ireland will appeal to all of them -- and to anyone who relishes epic entertainment spun by a master.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HCzuBtZZL1kC&dq=The+Princes+of+Ireland:+The+Dublin+Saga&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Water Vagabond: Six Years' Adventure at Sea","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1jbkOwAACAAJ&dq=Blue+Water+Vagabond:+Six+Years%27+Adventure+at+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La Chambre rouge (French Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Don't Bet on the Prince: Contemporary Feminist Fairy Tales in North America and","description":"A collection of fairy tales and essays written to break with the classical tradition of fairy tales with dominant males.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FpHEmAEACAAJ&dq=Don%27t+Bet+on+the+Prince:+Contemporary+Feminist+Fairy+Tales+in+North+America+and&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"De Leon, a Tejano Family History","description":"La familia de Le n was one of the foundation stones on which Texas was built. Mart n de Le n and his wife Patricia de la Garza left a comfortable life in Mexico for the hardships and uncertainties of the Texas frontier in 1801. Together, they established family ranches in South Texas and, in 1824, the town of Victoria and the de Le n colony on the Guadalupe River (along with Stephen F. Austin's colony, the only completely successful colonization effort in Texas). They and their descendents survived and prospered under four governments, as the society in which they lived evolved from autocratic to republican and the economy from which they drew their livelihood changed from one of mercantile control to one characterized by capitalistic investments. Combining the storytelling flair of a novelist with a scholar's concern for the facts, Ana Carolina Castillo Crimm here recounts the history of three generations of the de Le n family. She follows Mart n and Patricia from their beginnings in Mexico through the establishment of the family ranches in Texas and the founding of the de Le n colony and the town of Victoria. Then she details how, after Mart n's death in 1834, Patricia and her children endured the Texas Revolution, exile in New Orleans and Mexico, expropriation of their lands, and, after returning to Texas, years of legal battles to regain their property. Representative of the experiences of many Tejanos whose stories have yet to be written, the history of the de Le n family is the story of the Tejano settlers of Texas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hhFiAjjjLyUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Love You Forever","description":"As her son grows up from little boy to adult man, a mother secretly rocks him each night as he sleeps.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7ep09WAFbDwC&dq=Love+You+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Diary of Joseph Plumb Martin (In My Own Words)","description":"The diary of a young Connecticut farmer, who fought against the British in the Revolutionary War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=70k4zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Diary+of+Joseph+Plumb+Martin+(In+My+Own+Words)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Athena: Goddess of War and Wisdom (Little Wisdom Library)","description":"Illustrations and the story of the myths of Athena, Greek goddess of war and wisdom.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TuEz99-b-ZkC&dq=Athena:+Goddess+of+War+and+Wisdom+(Little+Wisdom+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows and Images","description":"An extraordinary memoir by Iris Origo, who chronicled political life in A Chill in the Air and War in Val d'Orcia, and now turns inward to describe her own family, the work of writing, and the transcience of memory. Images and Shadows, Iris Origo s autobiographical account of her early life, is as perceptive and humane and beautifully written as her celebrated memoir War in Val d Orcia. Origo s father came from an old and moneyed American family, her mother was the daughter of an Irish peer, and Iris grew up in the most privileged of circumstances. Her father died of tuberculosis when he was only thirty, and her mother moved to Fiesole, Italy, where she and Iris developed a close friendship with the great connoisseur and art historian Bernard Berenson. Later, Origo and her Italian husband transformed a desolate and deforested Tuscan property into a flourishing estate, and it was there that she discovered her true calling as a writer. In Images and Shadows, Origo paints portraits of her shy, loving father and her headstrong mother, and describes beloved places, the books that formed her sensibility, and how she grew up and made her way in the world. She reflects on the pleasures and challenges of writing and evokes the persistence and fragility of memory.

Through a battery of increasingly predatory forms, shopping has infiltrated, colonized, and even replaced, almost every aspect of urban life. Town centers, suburbs, streets, and now airports, train stations, museums, hospitals, schools, the Internet, and the military are shaped by the mechanisms and spaces of shopping. The voracity by which shopping pursues the public has, in effect, made it one of the principal-if only-modes by which we experience the city. The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping explores the spaces, people, techniques, ideologies, and inventions by which shopping has so dramatically refashioned the city. Perhaps the beginning of the twenty-first century will be remembered as the point where the urban could no longer be understood without shopping. The PROJECT ON THE CITY, formerly known as \\"The Project for What Used to be the City,\\" is an ongoing research effort that examines the effects of modernization on the urban condition. Each year the Project on the City investigates a specific urban region or a general urban condition undergoing virulent change. It tries to capture and decipher ongoing mutations in order to develop a new conceptual framework and vocabulary for phenomena that can no longer be described within the traditional categories of architecture, landscape, and urban planning. The first project, Great Leap Forward, focuses on the new forms and speeds of urbanization in the Pearl River Delta, China. The second project investigates the impact of shopping on the city. The third project explores the urban condition of Lagos, Nigeria. The fourth project treats the invention and expansion of the \\"systematic\\" Roman city as an early version of modernization and a prototype for the current process of globalization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S6zUQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Harvard+Design+School+Guide+to+Shopping+/+Harvard+Design+School+Project+on+the+City+2&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Afflicting the Comfortable: Journalism and Politics in West Virginia (West Virginia and Appalachia) (WEST VIRIGINIA & APPALACHIA)","description":"West Virginia Politics and Government offers the only recent study of politics in the Mountain State.

Sadly, it was also a world of alcoholism, bitter divorce, estrangement, and abuse, on the part of both his mother and father. In this fascinating memoir, the late son and namesake of John Steinbeck writes with great insight and a gift for lyrical expression about his often painful youth. Left unfinished at his untimely death, this testament to his life is here reconstructed by his wife of twelve years. Interweaving her own reminiscences of her life with John Steinbeck IV, Nancy Steinbeck has created an engrossing account from two perspectives: her husband's memories of his chaotic and adventurous upbringing and her own thoughts on their journey together to make a new life apart from the long shadow of a famous father and a troubled past.Though laboring under the burden of being the son of a 20th-century legend, the younger Steinbeck established himself as a respected journalist in his own right, mainly through his writing on wartime Vietnam, which had a profound impact on his life. The Other Side of Eden contains many thoughts on Vietnam, including a memorable scene of his father's visit to the war-torn country while the younger Steinbeck was in the army. There are also vivid recollections of his mother's abusive, alcoholic rages; his lonely years in boarding school; his long battle with drug addiction; his strained relationship with his remote, conflicted father; and the connection of East of Eden to Steinbeck's real-life family.Nancy Steinbeck adds important perspective as an outsider getting to know this complex family through her husband, and in the end helping him to put his life on a sound footing. Both Nancy and John, in their search for spiritual identity, were drawn to Tibetan Buddhism. Along the way they befriended a strange and fascinating collection of characters, from the Dalai Lama to William Burroughs and Abbie Hoffman. Their tale of triumph in the struggle against parental abuse, drug addiction, and the seductive trap of guru worship is a must read for all Steinbeck fans, as well as anyone who survived the sixties.In his original proposal for the book Steinbeck aptly summed up its intent:The reasons for attempting to write this book . . . could be summed up simply by my desire to live free from fear. However, the path leading to that sort of fruition has, along its border, a lot of fearful things that at first glance can cause panic, or resentment, or shame. There is also charity and sanity, which accompany this sort of voyage like good dolphins on a good quest. Frankly, I feel blessed that these guiding elements have never abandoned me and, as I and others continue to recover from the effects of my actions, I am encouraged that these qualities will endure, even shine.John Steinbeck IV (1946-1991) wrote the highly acclaimed Vietnam memoir In Touch and received an Emmy for his work on the CBS documentary The World of Charlie Company.Nancy Steinbeck, a former therapist who worked with hard-core delinquents and addicts, is currently collaborating on a screen adaptation of The Other Side of Eden.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DpyPl-TgpbYC&dq=The+Other+Side+of+Eden:+Life+With+John+Steinbeck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Real World Adobe Photoshop CS","description":"Offers hands-on production techniques and explanations of the concepts needed to build Photoshop CS projects.

Most notably, these eight countries are at the backbone of the spice trade, many of them exporters of things like pepper and vanilla.

For this investigation, Andrew Boyd has stepped beyond the current cases to interview professional carers across Britain. Between them they claim to be counselling more than 600 victims of ritual abuse. Their detailed account plus in-depth statements by survivors are shocking in the extreme.

Three abortion doctors and eight aides are gunned down and six are killed. More than 150 abortion clinics are firebombed. A church is vandalized by gay prostitutes. A pro-choice activist calls for \\"massive militant action\\" against anti-abortionists. In Cease Fire Tom Sine takes up the concerns of millions of Christians -- evangelical and mainline Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox -- who feel uneasy with some of the excesses of the politically correct left but who recoil at the stance taken by Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and Ralph Reed and the Christian Coalition that the extreme religious right, with its quest for political power, is the only place to turn. Sine looks at the tactics and agendas of extremists on both sides and asks what society would look like if their particular visions were to win out. He then argues that the positions of the religious right and of the left are not the only available choices. The Bible offers a third choice, God's \\"better way\\" -- a biblical center represented by neither right nor left in the current debate. Cease Fire is written to enable readers to understand why America's culture wars are so adversarial, polarizing, and increasingly violent; to anticipate which side is likely to gain the upper hand in these contentious conflicts and how it is likely to shape our common future; and to offer a third way -- a radical biblical alternative to the political ideologies of the religious right and the left -- for those searching for a new place to stand in a new millennium.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Fdzcil2SfXYC&dq=Cease+Fire:+Searching+for+Sanity+in+America%27s+Culture+Wars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Eating the Oregon way: A guide to cooking with the good tastes of Oregon","description":"Whether you want to enjoy shrimp, salmon or crab dipped from the sea, sun-ripened strawberries, raspberries, or blueberries fresh from the farm, or cheeses from the coast, in this book you will find recipes that include these & many other tastes of Oregon.

These range from the iconic Casablanca, starring a cynical, world-weary Humphrey Bogart and a never-more-beautiful Ingrid Bergman, to Orson Welles' seminal Citizen Kane, and from the optimistic It's A Wonderful Life to the enigmatic The Third Man, recently voted best British film of all time by the critics. This was the decade when Hollywood introduced cinema audiences to one of the greatest of all genres the film noir, still epitomised by movies like Double Indemnity, Out of the Past, Gilda and The Maltese Falcon - a darkly sinister world of gumshoes, double-crossing dames, bent cops and blind alleys. The world may have been at war for the first half of the decade and Europe in ruins for the second, but this was, in many ways, a golden age of cinema.

In other words, your hidden potential lies within your genes. Since the genetic code is clearly too complex to have been created randomly, it offers evidence that a greater power exists in the universe. Dr. Murakami calls this power \\"Something Great.\\" He believes that all life emanates from the same source-the great origin. All cells have a similar form. Hence, life in any form-human, animal, plant, and even in an individual cell-deserves to be treated with respect and dignity.

Of this work Alban Butler says, in his life of St. Gertrude, that it is perhaps the most useful production, next to the writings of St. Teresa, with which any female saint ever enriched the Church.\\"Care has been taken to preserve, not only the substance, but, as far as might be, the form, of the original prayers; and a few others, well known and much valued, have been added as an Appendix.Let us consider this advice:  When you are distracted in prayer, commend it to the Heart of Jesus, to be perfected by him, as our Lord Himself taught St. Gertrude. One day, when she was nluch distracted in prayer, he appeared to her, and held forth to her his Heart with his own sacred hands, saying: Behold, I set My Heart before the eyes of thy soul, that thou mayest commend to it all thine actions, confidently trusting that all that thou canst not of thyself supply to them will be therein supplied, so that they may appear perfect and spotless in my sight. Remember always to say the Gloria Patri with great devotion. The hermit Honorius relates that a certain monk who had been accustomed to say his office negligently appeared to another after his death and being asked what sufferings he had to undergo in punishment of his carelessness, he said that all had been satisfied for and effaced by the reverent devotion with which he had always said the Gloria Patri.

After a sobering, do-it-yourself divorce, Colette is at a loss for what to do next. Convinced that she is due an out-of-hand, life-affirming revelation, she strays into the realm of psychics and clairvoyants, hungry for a whisper to set her off in the right direction. At a psychic fair in Windsor she meets the charismatic Alison. Alison, the daughter of a prostitute, beleaguered during her childhood by the pressures of her connection to the spiritual world, lives in a different kind of solitude. She cannot escape the dead who speak to her, least of all the constant presence of Morris, her low-life spiritual guide. An expansive presence onstage, Alison at once feels her bond with Colette, inviting her to join her on the road as her personal assistant and companion. Troubles spiral out of control when the pair moves to a suburban wasteland in what was once the English countryside and take up with a spirit guide and his drowned therapist. It is not long before Alison's connection to the place beyond black threatens to uproot their lives forever. This is Hilary Mantel at her finest- insightful, darkly comic, unorthodox, and thrilling to read.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=enTJX3AiZvsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Picture of Dorian Gray and Other Short Stories (Signet Classics)","description":"This timeless tale of gothic horror is accompanied by three short stories-- \\"Lord Arthur Savile's Crime,\\" \\"The Happy Prince,\\" and \\"The Birthday of the Infanta\\"--and a new introduction by Gary Schmidgall, author of The Stranger Wilde.

In its first brief six-year incarnation, Trojan produced nearly 30 hit singles, created the legendary compilation series Tighten Up and launched new acts like Jimmy Cliff, Desmond Dekker, Ken Boothe, The Pioneers, Bob And Marcia, Greyhound and Dave And Ansell Collins, all against a background of cut-throat politics, cultural division and prejudice. Featuring a comprehensive discography, Young, Gifted And Black is the official story of Trojan Records, lifting the lid on the scheming, backbiting and sheer seat-of-the-pants inspiration that made the label such a powerful force for black UK music.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1rNcDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grandma Moses: An American Original (American Art)","description":"Grandma Moses is a name synonymous with American folk art.

In Seeing Earth, Ronald Weber focuses on the literary response to this new frontier, examining an area of contemporary expression that has remained until now virtually untouched. The author surveys what has been written about space exploration and calls attention to its dominant use as a means of deflecting attention back to earth and earthly concerns. As Norman Cousins states, the \\"most significant achievement of that lunar voyage (Apollo 11) was not that man set foot on the Moon, but that he set eyes on Earth.\\" This timely study includes the responses of writers, scientists, historians, theologians, philosophers, and those who have experienced space first hand - the astronauts. Here we find, of course, Tom Wolfe and The Right Stuff, Carl Sagan, James Michener, and Norman Mailer. But Weber also discusses Oriana Fallaci, Ben Bova, Ken Kesey, Saul Bellow, Ray Bradbury, and others as they offer a literary embodiment of this newest and perhaps ultimate phase of American journeying, the newest New World, the darkest frontier. Weber finds that in the first quarter-century of the space age our writers have been more attentive to the familiar attractions of earth than the mysteries of outer space, paradoxically in their accounts of space returning us to earth. Seeing Earth is offered, however, as a preliminary report. The era of the space shuttle, with the promise of routine journeys in space, may well alter the response of writers. We may come to see ourselves at home in space. But so far the deepest sympathies of our writers have been directed to the origin of space rockets more than their exotic destinations. Weber shows us that our literary accounts of space journeys have given us new instruction about earth and earthly life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-BZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Seeing+Earth+from+Space&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crow - From the Life and Songs of the Crow (Poetry)","description":"'Crow' was Ted Hughes's fourth book of poems for adults and a pivotal moment in his writing career.

According to Bickerton, the behavioral sciences have failed to give an adequate account of human nature at least partly because of the conjunction and mutual reinforcement of two widespread beliefs: that language is simply a means of communication and that human intelligence is the result of the rapid growth and unusual size of human brains. Bickerton argues that each of the properties distinguishing human intelligence and consciousness from that of other animals can be shown to derive straightforwardly from properties of language. In essence, language arose as a representational system, not a means of communication or a skill, and not a product of culture but an evolutionary adaptation. The author stresses the necessity of viewing intelligence in evolutionary terms, seeing it not as problem solving but as a way of maintaining homeostasis the preservation of those conditions most favorable to an organism, the optimal achievable conditions for survival and well-being. Nonhumans practice what he calls  on-line thinking  to maintain homeostasis, but only humans can employ off-line thinking:  only humans can assemble fragments of information to form a pattern that they can later act upon without having to wait on that great but unpunctual teacher, experience.  The term protolanguage is used to describe the stringing together of symbols that prehuman hominids employed.  It did not allow them to turn today s imagination into tomorrow s fact. But it is just this power to transform imagination into fact that distinguishes human behavior from that of our ancestral species, and indeed from that of all other species. It is exactly what enables us to change our behavior, or invent vast ranges of new behavior, practically overnight, with no concomitant genetic changes.  Language and Human Behavior should be of interest to anyone in the behavioral and evolutionary sciences and to all those concerned with the role of language in human behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CyPTDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Minstrel in the Tower (Stepping Stone Books)","description":"In the year 1195, eleven-year-old Roger and his eight-year-old sister Alice travel through the French countryside in search of their ailing mother's estranged brother, a wealthy baron.

During the 1970s, he founded an experimental residential facility called Diabasis in Berkeley, California, designed as a supportive home for young adults who were experiencing the initial days of their first \\"acute schizophrenic break.\\" At Diabasis, these full-blown \\"schizophrenics\\" were able to emerge \\"on the far side of madness,\\" as Perry put it, \\"weller than well,\\" without any treatment by medication, electroshock, or locked doors. When \\"The Far Side of Madness\\" was first published in 1974, Perry's deep insight into the nature of so-called \\"schizophrenia\\" opened the way for a radically new, more compassionate approach to this condition. This pioneering work of Jungian psychiatry reframes acute psychotic episodes in the context of visionary experience of schizophrenic patients and describes innovative methods of handling them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=asnizQEACAAJ&dq=Far+Side+of+Madness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hollywood Beauty: Linda Darnell and the American Dream","description":"At fifteen, Linda Darnell left her Texas home and normal adolescence to live the Hollywood dream promoted by fan magazine and studio publicity offices. She appeared in dozens of films and won international acclaim for Blood and Sand (playing opposite Tyrone Power), Forever Amber, A Letter to Three Wives, and the original version of Unfaithfully Yours. Driven by a stage mother to become rich and Famous, but unable to cope with the career she had longed for as a child, Darnell soon was caught in a downward spiral of drinking, failed marriages, and exploitive relationships. By her early twenties she was an alcoholic, hardened by a life in which beautiful women were chattel, and by the time of her death at age forty- one, she was struggling for recognition in the industry that once had called her its \\"glory girl.  Hollywood Beauty begins in the Southwest during the Depression, when Pearl Darnell became obsessed by the glitter of the movie world that would dominate her children s lives. We follow Linda s path from her Texas childhood and first public successduring the state centennial, in 1936through her contract work with Twentieth Century-Fox in the heyday of the big-studio system. Film historian Ronald L. Davis documents Darnell s discovery and marriages, the adoption of her daughter, the marking of many well-known films, and her emotional difficulties, leading up to her tragic death by fire. This is the story of a native teenager from a dysfunctional middle-class family thrust into the golden age of Hollywood.

Yet there is so much in these seven short, simple words that they have transformed many a life and brought many an inefficient worker into a place of great power. I spoke on these seven words some years ago at a Bible conference in central New York. Some months after the conference, I received a letter from the man who had presided at the conference, one of the best-known ministers of the gospel in America. He wrote me,  I have been unable to get away from the seven words on which you spoke at Lake Keuka, they have been with me day and night. They have transformed my ideas, transformed my methods, transformed my ministry.  The man who wrote those words has since been the pastor of what is probably the most widely known of any evangelical church in the world.

According to Bickerton, the behavioral sciences have failed to give an adequate account of human nature at least partly because of the conjunction and mutual reinforcement of two widespread beliefs: that language is simply a means of communication and that human intelligence is the result of the rapid growth and unusual size of human brains. Bickerton argues that each of the properties distinguishing human intelligence and consciousness from that of other animals can be shown to derive straightforwardly from properties of language. In essence, language arose as a representational system, not a means of communication or a skill, and not a product of culture but an evolutionary adaptation. The author stresses the necessity of viewing intelligence in evolutionary terms, seeing it not as problem solving but as a way of maintaining homeostasis the preservation of those conditions most favorable to an organism, the optimal achievable conditions for survival and well-being. Nonhumans practice what he calls  on-line thinking  to maintain homeostasis, but only humans can employ off-line thinking:  only humans can assemble fragments of information to form a pattern that they can later act upon without having to wait on that great but unpunctual teacher, experience.  The term protolanguage is used to describe the stringing together of symbols that prehuman hominids employed.  It did not allow them to turn today s imagination into tomorrow s fact. But it is just this power to transform imagination into fact that distinguishes human behavior from that of our ancestral species, and indeed from that of all other species. It is exactly what enables us to change our behavior, or invent vast ranges of new behavior, practically overnight, with no concomitant genetic changes.  Language and Human Behavior should be of interest to anyone in the behavioral and evolutionary sciences and to all those concerned with the role of language in human behavior.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CyPTDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Employment Discrimination Law: Cases and Materials","description":"Coauthored by two reporters from the recently released Restatement on Employment Law, this casebook provides considerable flexibility for an instructor teaching employment discrimination law, employment law, or a combination of both topics.

The cases, which came to trial before the NWT Supreme Court between 1955 and 1970, and the carvings that represent them illuminate a pivotal period of overwhelming social change when the Inuit camp system was eroding and age-old practices and traditional mores were being called into question. Dorothy Harley Eber tells the stories behind the carvings and provides fascinating insight into the unusual situations and special problems that developed as the Inuit came contact with Canada's justice system. The collection of carvings was started when J.H. Sissons, first resident justice of the NWT Supreme Court, received a carving of himself on the bench from an Inuit defendant. He decided to have Inuit artists document more cases and collected carvings that represented important decisions involving murder, assisted suicide, adoption, custom law marriage, and infractions of game laws. The collection was added to by his successor, William Morrow. Both Sissons and Morrow believed that to serve justice the North the law and the courts must adapt, and they were instrumental in spurring the fight for Native rights and making changes to the law to secure them. Eber provides colourful portraits of the two men based on recollections of those who travelled on circuit with them and observed their battles with Ottawa bureaucrats and the higher courts. Images of Justice resonates with voices of the North and comes alive through interviews with many of those involved in the cases -- Inuit and whites, defendants, judges, and prosecutors. Eber brings herstory up to date with a look at the courts today and presents views of Inuit and non-Inuit with regard to future directions. She also provides valuable information on the remarkable but little-known artists who created the unique works of art the Yellowknife Courthouse Collection of Inuit Sculpture. At a time when alternative legal systems for Native peoples are being debated, Images of Justice provides a lively, accessible account of the northern courts, their evolution, and their future a changing northern society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=g7Qcr7vzQbQC&dq=Images+of+Justice:+A+Legal+History+of+the+Northwest+Territories+As+Traced+Through+the+Yellowknife+Courthouse+Collection+of+Inuit+Sculpture+(Mcgill-Queen%27s+Native+and+Northern+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Groundwater Modeling: Finite Difference and Finite Element Methods","description":"The dramatic advances in the efficiency of digital computers during the past decade have provided hydrologists with a powerful tool for numerical modeling of groundwater systems.

The knowledge and support of northern Native peoples were critical to the newcomer's survival and success. With acquaintance and alliance came intermarriage, and the unions of European traders and Native women generated thousands of descendants. Jennifer Brown's Strangers in Blood is the first work to look systematically at these parents and their children. Brown focuses on Hudson's Bay Company officers and North West Company wintering partners and clerks-those whose relationships are best known from post journals, correspondence, accounts, and wills. The durability of such families varied greatly. Settlers, missionaries, European women, and sometimes the courts challenged fur trade marriages. Some officers' Scottish and Canadian relatives dismissed Native wives and \\"Indian\\" progeny as illegitimate. Traders who took these ties seriously were obliged to defend them, to leave wills recognizing their wives and children, and to secure their legal and social status-to prove that they were kin, not \\"strangers in blood.\\" Brown illustrates that the lives and identities of these children were shaped by factors far more complex than \\"blood.\\" Sons and daughters diverged along paths affected by gender. Some descendants became M tis and espoused M tis nationhood under Louis Riel. Others rejected or were never offered that course-they passed into white or Indian communities or, in some instances, identified themselves (without prejudice) as \\"half breeds.\\" The fur trade did not coalesce into a single society. Rather, like Rupert's Land, it splintered, and the historical consequences have been with us ever since.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gH1u-1tSf9IC&dq=Stranger+in+Blood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Cut Above","description":"Esteemed pattern designer Gerri Robinson shows how to turn ordinary precut fabrics into extraordinary projects for home decor.

Arguments are presented to demonstrate that these kinds of evidence are crucial for establishing theories of language that relate to the psychological mechanisms involved in producing and comprehending speech, in contrast to theories about abstract linguistic structure. A range of topics is covered including morphological parsing, nominalization, stress, syllable structure, diphthongization, gender, morphophonemic alternations, and epenthesis.

Sumerian history and mythology have been shrouded in mystery for thousands of years. These tales of the world's very first civilization is now being exposed to the light of day, fascinating men and women around the world. The stories of Enlil, Enkidu, and Gilgamesh are finding new audiences, people interested in learning about a world where the people felt and experienced very differently from how we do today. Sumerian mythology was so powerful that some of their gods found their way into different cultures, the most famous example of this being Aphrodite who began life as the Sumerian goddess Inanna. Sumerian civilization has become an intrinsic part of how we live today, even if most of us are unaware of it. The way that we measure time, observe the stars, and even plant and grow crops has a lot to do with the advancements made by the Sumerians more than six thousand years ago. And heroes like Gilgamesh have helped define what it means to be a hero today. They were men who became gods, earning their place in immortality in more ways than one. The Sumerians used their stories as a way to instruct others and how they lived and even to help themselves understand their world. This book explores the tales of gods and heroes in a concise, easy-to-read fashion. These tales of heroes and gods were deeply important to the Mesopotamian people and learning about them is the only way to understand the kind of world they lived in and how it was different from our own. It was a world of birds with the faces of lions, gods with the wings of birds, and seductive goddesses who symbolically married the kings of the various city-states. The Sumerians told many tales of gods like Inanna, An, Ashur, and Enlil, tales that helped the civilizations of Mesopotamia endure for nearly 4000 years. Indeed, European travelers to the Orient in the 18th century discovered that there were still districts where the goddess Inanna (more than five thousand years old then) was still worshipped in secret. The world of the Sumerians was unlike our own. The people at the heart of Sumerian civilization - living in modern-day Iraq, Kuwait, Turkey, and other places - these people were part of a culture so far removed from the way that we think and perceive today as to be almost unrecognizable. This book gives you the binoculars to view their world. It was a world of great empires: the Akkadian, Hurrian, Assyrian, and Babylonian. It was a world of legendary wealth and beauty. In Sumerian Myth, you will understand this world by gaining a summary of the major historical events and an in-depth exposure to the gods. You will learn about the Gilgamesh and Enkidu, the Anzu bird, who the major gods and goddesses were, who the important heroes were, and how Sumerian society left a legacy that continues with us today. Poets and historians recorded Mesopotamian tales on cuneiform tablets, but we have made the deciphering work easy for you.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xiv5zgEACAAJ&dq=The+Goddess+of+Sumer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daemon's Angel","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=J6OcxXt2QPkC&dq=Daemon%27s+Angel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hints on household taste in furniture, upholstery, and other details","description":"This book was written by Charles Eastlake, a British architect and designer who established his own style called Eastlake style.

Those battles were influenced more by geography and climate than by generals and admirals. Properly titled they would be known as the Battles of the Sky (Britain), the Sand (El Alemein), the Snow (Stalingrad), the Sea (North Atlantic), and the Shore (Normandy). Slogging their way through this quintet are an eighteen-year-old G.I. from Missouri (as seen through his letters home), an \\"ugly duckling\\" of a Liberty ship (as seen through its Armed Guard reports), and a bottle of rum (as traced by those who, after the war, made money in selling war souvenirs). It is the history of the North Atlantic sea basin and its extensions at war: the story of the lulls between battles, when America's teenage warriors often watched war movies (Humphrey Bogart made and Warner Brothers released seven during the war), sang or listened to popular tunes by songsmiths like Irving Berlin, and drank rum-and-Coke (while listening to Dick Haymes sing the hit \\"Rum & Coca-Cola\\"). While accessible and vastly entertaining, this is a serious work of history. By treating World War II in Europe much as Fernand Braudel treated the origins of Western civilization in his masterpiece The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II, Hatcher brings Braudelian detachment to his narrative.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A0anDKEFI3gC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Why the Bottom Line Isn't!: How to Build Value Through People and Organization","description":"Offers a broad view of leadership and shareholder value based onmultiple business disciplines In Why the Bottom Line Isn't! authors Dave Ulrichand Norm Smallwood argue that sustainable shareholder value comesincreasingly from assets not accounted for on an organization'sbalance sheet.

But how did these once-taboo toys become so socially acceptable? The journey of the devices to the cultural mainstream is a surprisingly stimulating one.In Buzz, Hallie Lieberman traces the tale from lubricant in Ancient Greece to the very first condom in 1560 to advertisements touting devices as medical equipment in 19th-century magazines. She looks in particular from the period of major change from the 1950s through the present, when sex toys evolved from symbols of female emancipation to tools in the fight against HIV/AIDS to consumerist marital aids to today's mainstays of pop culture. The story is populated with a cast of vivid and fascinating characters including Dell Williams, founder of the first feminist sex toy store; Betty Dodson, whose workshops helped 1960s women discover vibrators; and Gosnell Duncan, a paraplegic engineer who invented the silicone dildo. And these personal dramas are all set against a backdrop of changing American attitudes toward sexuality, feminism, LGBTQ issues, and more.Both educational and titillating, Buzz will make readers think quite differently about those secret items hiding in bedside drawers across the nation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BZPnuAEACAAJ&dq=Sex+toy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ANGELIQUE COOKBOOK","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uXB9AAAACAAJ&dq=THE+ANGELIQUE+COOKBOOK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Legend of the Seventh Virgin","description":"According to the legend, six novices living in a Cornish convent strayed from their vows and were turned to stone.

It was a delusion, moreover, to which men of learning and piety lent themselves, and thus became the means of increasing it. The scene of this affair was the puritanical colony of New England, since better known as Massachusetts, the colonists of which appear to have carried with them, in an exaggerated form, the superstitious feelings with regard to witchcraft which then prevailed in the mother country. In the spring of 1692 an alarm of witchcraft was raised in the family of the minister of Salem, and some black servants were charged with the supposed crime. Once started, the alarm spread rapidly, and in a very short time a great number of people fell under suspicion, and many were thrown into prison on very frivolous grounds, supported, as such charges usually were, by very unworthy witnesses. The new governor of the colony, Sir William Phipps, arrived from England in the middle of May, and he seems to have been carried away by the excitement, and authorized judicial prosecutions. The trials began at the commencement of June; and the first victim, a woman named Bridget Bishop, was hanged. Governor Phipps, embarrassed by this extraordinary state of things, called in the assistance of the clergy of Boston. There was at this time in Boston a distinguished family of puritanical ministers of the name of Mather. Richard Mather, an English non-conformist divine, had emigrated to America in 1636, and settled at Dorchester, where, in 1639, he had a son born, who was named, in accordance with the peculiar nomenclature of the puritans, Increase Mather...","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XtcDswEACAAJ&dq=The+Wonders+of+the+Invisible+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Switchbacks: True Stories from the Canadian Rockies","description":"In \\"Switchbacks, Sid Marty draws on his own memories and those of friends and former colleagues in relating a series of true mountain tales.

This book is not just about gay American Indians, it is by gay Indians. Over twenty different American Indian writers, men and women, represent tribes from every part of North America. Living the Spirit tells our story---the story of our history and traditions, as well as the realities and challenges of the present. As Paula Gunn Allen writes,  Some like Indians endure.  The themes of change and continuity are a part of every contribution in this book---in the contemporary coyote tales by Daniel-Harry Steward and Beth Brant---in the reservation experiences of Jerry, a Hupa Indian---in the painful memories of cruelty and injustice that Beth Brant, Chrystos, and others evoke. Our pain, but also our joy, our love, and our sexuality, are all here, in these pages. M. Owlfeather writes,  If traditions have been lost, then new ones should be borrowed from other tribes,  and he uses the example of the Indian pow-wow---Indian, yet contemporary and pantribal. One of our traditional roles was that of the  go-between ---individuals who could help different groups communicate with each other. This is the role GAI hopes to play today. We are advocates for not only gay but American Indian concerns, as well. We are turning double oppression into double continuity---the chance to build bridges between communities, to create a place for gay Indians in both of the worlds we live in, to honor our past and secure our future. Published by Stonewall Inn Editions in partnership with St. Martin s Press, 1988.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BKkVgvw4lZ0C&dq=Living+the+Spirit,+A+Gay+American+Indian+Anthology+(Stonewall+Inn+Editions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Programming Introductory Concepts and Techniques","description":"Part of the highly successful Shelly Cashman Series, this text takes the project-oriented approach to learning introductory Java programming skills.

It also explores claims that a distinctly  westward-looking orientation  in their design produced housing estates that were superior in design to those produced elsewhere in the Soviet Union (between 1944 and 1991, Estonia was a member republic of the USSR). The first two parts of the book provide contextual material to help readers understand the vision behind housing estates in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. These sections present the background of housing estates in the Baltic Republics as well as challenges and debates concerning their formation, evolution, and present condition and importance. Subsequent parts of the book consist of: demographic analyses of the socioeconomic characteristics and ethnicity of housing estate residents (past and present) in the three Baltic capital cities, case studies of people and places related to housing estates in the Baltic countries, and chapters exploring relevant special topics and themes. This book will be of interest to students, scholars, and advocates interested in understanding the past, present, and future importance of housing estates in the Baltic countries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BbKrDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Holding the Line: Women in the Great Arizona Mine Strike of 1983 (Ilr Press Books)","description":"Barbara Kingsolver's first non-fiction book is the story of women's lives transformed by an a signal event.

Sam Sifton, The New York Times Book Review Acclaimed author of American Catch and The Omega Princple and life-long fisherman, Paul Greenberg takes us on a journey, examining the four fish that dominate our menus: salmon, sea bass, cod, and tuna. Investigating the forces that get fish to our dinner tables, Greenberg reveals our damaged relationship with the ocean and its inhabitants. Just three decades ago, nearly everything we ate from the sea was wild. Today, rampant overfishing and an unprecedented biotech revolution have brought us to a point where wild and farmed fish occupy equal parts of a complex marketplace. Four Fish offers a way for us to move toward a future in which healthy and sustainable seafood is the rule rather than the exception.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZVvK7yp1FzkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Faith, God, & Rock 'n' Roll","description":"For decades, Michael Savage has been preaching his political faith of borders, language and culture to millions on his nationally-syndicated radio show, The Savage Nation. Now, Savage gives his audience a look into his religious faith and his ideas about the Judeo-Christian foundation of the American culture he has fought all his life to preserve. But rather than a dry, theological treatise, Savage provides something more akin to an ancient mystery text. Drawing on Christian, Jewish, Buddhist and other spiritual sources, as well as autobiographical material and highlights from his radio show, Savage shares a series of glimpses of God he has experienced over the whole of his life, before and after his groundbreaking radio career. Moving childhood stories, his dinner with an atheist and a Buddhist, an interview with a Jewish gangster and Savage's reflections on selected passages from ancient scriptures are just a few of the eclectic group of experiences and insights Savage shares in what is easily the most unique book on spirituality in decades. From his days as a boy growing up in New York City to many years searching for healing plants in the South Seas to his current incarnation as one of the most popular talk radio hosts in the world, Savage has been haunted by glimpses of the divine and struggled to find their meaning. Rather than trite, orthodox answers, GOD, FAITH, AND REASON presents the reader with one man's perceptions and consideration of the daily presence of God in the world around us and how the search to find God is the finding itself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbYkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"La cite des eaux mouvantes (Valerian, agent spatio-temporel) (French Edition)","description":"When agents Valerian and Laureline arrive in 1986 New York to intercept Galaxity's worst megalomaniac, they find the world in ruins and the city about to sink into the ocean.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EfEARAAACAAJ&dq=La+cite+des+eaux+mouvantes+(Valerian,+agent+spatio-temporel)+(French+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Consumer Handbook On Dizziness And Vertigo","description":"\\"The Consumer Handbook on Dizziness and Vertigo\\" answers an essential need to better understand this dreaded condition.

More than 40 methods for measuring surface tension both at the liquid-fluid and solid-fluid boundaries are described including methods using computational techniques, tele- and video-apparatus, and laser techniques. A central place in the book has been given to methods based on the investigation of properties of liquid and gaseous menisci both in the presence or absence of a gravitational field and a rotational one. Their description is preceded by a chapter on the theory of menisci including the derivation of various forms of the Laplace formula. The application of the methods for studying the equilibrium and dynamic surface tension has been considered. Dynamic methods used for very small surface life-times are described and a separate chapter is devoted to the theory of surface tension which will ensure a better understanding of the material. A systematic analysis of the material embracing all kinds of interfaces including solid surfaces, the history of each method, its theoretical foundation, characterization of measuring procedures and setups, a large number of numeric tables and plots and representative illustrations make the book encyclopedic in character.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q5y88C5AYFoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swimming in the Sun: Discovering the Lord's Prayer with Francis of Assisi and Thomas Merton","description":"Winner of a Catholic Book Award from the Catholic Press Association of the United States, \\"Swimming in the Sun\\" turns to two great spiritual masters to illustrate the central themes of the Lord's Prayer.

As W. H. Auden told friends, it is \\"really about the Christian conception of art\\" and it is \\"my Ars Poetica, in the same way I believe The Tempest to be Shakespeare's.\\" This is the first critical edition. Arthur Kirsch's introduction and notes make the poem newly accessible to readers of Auden, readers of Shakespeare, and all those interested in the relation of life and literature--those two classic themes alluded to in its title. The poem begins in a theater after a performance of The Tempest has ended. It includes a moving speech in verse by Prospero bidding farewell to Ariel, a section in which the supporting characters speak in a dazzling variety of verse forms about their experiences on the island, and an extravagantly inventive section in prose that sees the uncivilized Caliban address the audience on art--an unalloyed example of what Auden's friend Oliver Sachs has called his \\"wild, extraordinary and demonic imagination.\\" Besides annotating Auden's allusions and sources (in notes after the text), Kirsch provides extensive quotations from his manuscript drafts, permitting the reader to follow the poem's genesis in Auden's imagination. This book, which incorporates for the first time previously ignored corrections that Auden made on the galleys of the first edition, also provides an unusual opportunity to see the effect of one literary genius upon another.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7Mc8EAAAQBAJ&dq=The+mirror+of+the+sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curious myths of the middle ages","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_RgHAAAAQAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The terminal experiment","description":"Dr. Peter Hobson has created three electronic simulations of his own personality.

In the first volume, Einstein's Brainchild, Parker focused on relativity, the most famous and important of the great genius's ideas. In the second volume, Einstein's Passions, his human side and diverse interests beyond science were Parker's main topic.Now the author turns once again to Einstein as creative scientist, concentrating on his prolific output of far-reaching contributions that complement and broaden his discovery of relativity. Moreover, Parker provides an indelible portrait of the man behind the theories. Parker, in clear and eloquent language, helps us appreciate the breadth and richness of Einstein's vision: from Einstein's theories supporting time travel, to his research on curved space, the cosmological constant, black holes, worm holes, gravity waves, cosmic lenses, to quantum theory, and beyond. Parker also discusses Einstein's reluctant connection with atomic weapons, his pacifist philosophy, his quest for the elusive unified field theory, and the relationship of his work to the recent hot area of superstrings.Even readers already familiar with Einstein's work will discover a wealth of new material in this singular contribution to the Einstein corpus. Parker's gift for turning complex physics into lucid prose has produced the most complete and accessible volume to elucidate for everyone the magnificent contributions of this most brilliant of scientists.Barry Parker (Pocatello, ID) is an award-winning science writer and the author of thirteen highly acclaimed popular science books, including Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Einstein's Brainchild: Relativity Made Relatively Easy! and Quantum Legacy: The Discovery That Changed Our Universe. He served as a professor of physics at Idaho State University from 1967 to 1997.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Y-rB0qL_YokC&dq=Albert+Einstein%27s+Vision:+Remarkable+Discoveries+That+Shaped+Modern+Science&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Leaf (Cape Light, Book 4)","description":"Disillusioned by romance and love since her bitter divorce, single mother Molly Willoughby has steered away from personal relationships and abandoned her dream of opening her own catering business, until she meets widower Dr. Matthew Foster, a newcomer who has come to Cape Light to build a new life for himself and his teenage daughter.

Einstein in Berlin In the spring of 1913 two of the giants of modern science traveled to Zurich. Their mission: to offer the most prestigious position in the very center of European scientific life to a man who had just six years before been a mere patent clerk. Albert Einstein accepted, arriving in Berlin in March 1914 to take up his new post. In December 1932 he left Berlin forever.  Take a good look,  he said to his wife as they walked away from their house.  You will never see it again.  In between, Einstein s Berlin years capture in microcosm the odyssey of the twentieth century. It is a century that opens with extravagant hopes--and climaxes in unparalleled calamity. These are tumultuous times, seen through the life of one man who is at once witness to and architect of his day--and ours. He is present at the events that will shape the journey from the commencement of the Great War to the rumblings of the next one. We begin with the eminent scientist, already widely recognized for his special theory of relativity. His personal life is in turmoil, with his marriage collapsing, an affair under way. Within two years of his arrival in Berlin he makes one of the landmark discoveries of all time: a new theory of gravity--and before long is transformed into the first international pop star of science. He flourishes during a war he hates, and serves as an instrument of reconciliation in the early months of the peace; he becomes first a symbol of the hope of reason, then a focus for the rage and madness of the right. And throughout these years Berlin is an equal character, with its astonishing eruption of revolutionary pathways in art and architecture, in music, theater, and literature. Its wild street life and sexual excesses are notorious. But with the debacle of the depression and Hitler s growing power, Berlin will be transformed, until by the end of 1932 it is no longer a safe home for Einstein. Once a hero, now vilified not only as the perpetrator of  Jewish physics  but as the preeminent symbol of all that the Nazis loathe, he knows it is time to leave.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pe25DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Enfield, Connecticut (Images of America: Connecticut)","description":"In the past half-century, Enfield has undergone a transformation from a rural mill-and-farming town of fifteen thousand to a substantial suburban community of forty-five thousand.

Enfield: 1950-1980 traces the changing landscape of Thompsonville, Enfield, and North Thompsonville through the carpet-making days to the town's recent past. Exceptional photographs depict major highway construction and the development of the regional mall district, the destructive forces of the 1955 flood and of fires throughout the years, and the unique leaders, businesses, and events that have shaped the town of today.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=taHihuLxI6kC&dq=Enfield,+Connecticut+(Images+of+America:+Connecticut)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pick-A-Party Cookbook","description":"Thebiggest and most complete party cookbook ever written!

Centering on the infamous World War II firebombing of Dresden, the novel is the result of what Kurt Vonnegut described as a twenty-three-year struggle to write a book about what he had witnessed as an American prisoner of war. It combines historical fiction, science fiction, autobiography, and satire in an account of the life of Billy Pilgrim, a barber s son turned draftee turned optometrist turned alien abductee. As Vonnegut had, Billy experiences the destruction of Dresden as a POW. Unlike Vonnegut, he experiences time travel, or coming  unstuck in time.  An instant bestseller, Slaughterhouse-Five made Kurt Vonnegut a cult hero in American literature, a reputation that only strengthened over time, despite his being banned and censored by some libraries and schools for content and language. But it was precisely those elements of Vonnegut s writing the political edginess, the genre-bending inventiveness, the frank violence, the transgressive wit that have inspired generations of readers not just to look differently at the world around them but to find the confidence to say something about it. Authors as wide-ranging as Norman Mailer, John Irving, Michael Crichton, Tim O Brien, Margaret Atwood, Elizabeth Strout, David Sedaris, Jennifer Egan, and J. K. Rowling have all found inspiration in Vonnegut s words. Jonathan Safran Foer has described Vonnegut as  the kind of writer who made people young people especially want to write.  George Saunders has declared Vonnegut to be  the great, urgent, passionate American writer of our century, who offers us . . . a model of the kind of compassionate thinking that might yet save us from ourselves.  Fifty years after its initial publication at the height of the Vietnam War, Vonnegut's portrayal of political disillusionment, PTSD, and postwar anxiety feels as relevant, darkly humorous, and profoundly affecting as ever, an enduring beacon through our own era s uncertainties.  Poignant and hilarious, threaded with compassion and, behind everything, the cataract of a thundering moral statement.

Interlocutors like Scott will be a helpful challenge to all of us in the \\"emerging church.\\" I consider him a friendly critic and a brother in Christ. -Tony Jones, author of Postmodern Youth Ministry and National Director, Emergent Scott Smith is uniquely suited to enter the Emergent conversation with this helpful volume. Not only is he an analytic philosopher with a razor-sharp mind who has specialized in analyzing postmodernistic views on the relationship between language and the world, but he is also a man who cares for the lost, loves the church, and has an ability to communicate complex truths to people in the pew. -Justin Taylor, Executive Editor, Desiring God Every leader in the new Emergent Movement will want to read this fascinating book. They simply will not find a more engaging, knowledgeable, balanced, and kind treatment of their concerns, ideas, and practices. -Craig J. Hazen, Professor of Comparative Religion, Biola University Scott Smith's study challenges us to take seriously the truth claim of the gospel both in how we proclaim it in words and in how we manifest it in our personal and community lives. -Gary Inrig, Senior Pastor, Trinity Church, Redlands, California","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0ohHqhY0wGYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of Ivy: How a Liberal Ivy Created a Committed Conservative","description":"Like his opinions or not, Travis Rowley's memoir of life as a conservative undergraduate (and football player) at Brown University, perhaps the most predictably liberal major university in the country, is immensely entertaining. With great vividness, his story presents America's culture wars with youthful outrage, humor, disillusionment, and hope-all informed by intense observation and high energy. Mr. Rowley's description of incidents on Brown's politically correct campus are by turns hilarious, infuriating, and intriguing as he provides one of the sharpest and most detailed inside looks at elite higher education seen in a long time, Tom Wolfe's \\"I am Charlotte Simmons\\" included. There are few powerful college interest groups-sexual, ethnic, political or otherwise-that Mr. Rowley won't take on with glee. This guy is a gladiator against PC, and his show would fill the Roman Coliseum, or at least make some parents wonder whether to pay so much to send their kids to fancy colleges. William F. Buckley Jr. launched his career with \\"God and Man at Yale.\\" Travis Rowley, though a regular guy and no would-be Mandarin, may have done the same with his adventures at Brown.-Robert Whitcomb, editorial-pages editor, Providence Journal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uj-qPQAACAAJ&dq=Out+of+Ivy:+How+a+Liberal+Ivy+Created+a+Committed+Conservative&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Started in Futures, 3rd Edition","description":"\\"If you've never traded futures but would like to, this book is highly recommended.

This diverse collection of essays, eight by psychiatrists, is neither for nor against medication, but takes a skeptical view of the unquestioned dominance that medication-based treatments have achieved among mental health practitioners. Its viewpoint is that therapeutic attention to context and relationships, regularly diminished when medications are prescribed, interferes with the development of psychiatric disorders, adds to maturity, and expands consciousness. Clinical examples, by both practitioners and patients, are used to define potential problems that arise from trying to combine a medical model with family systems work and also illustrate the decision-making processes and methods for applying family systems based therapies. This book will stimulate thoughtful conversation among students and practitioners of all mental health disciplines.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5svFBQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The world of Sholom Aleichem","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ENXbzgEACAAJ&dq=The+world+of+Sholom+Aleichem&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Script Analysis for Actors, Directors and Designers","description":"Script Analysis for Actors, Directors, and Designers, Sixth Edition teaches the skills of script analysis using a formalist approach that examines the written part of a play to evaluate its potentials for performance and production.

A former star athlete turned deputy coroner is drawn into a brutal, complicated murder in this psychological thriller from a father-son writing team that delivers  brilliant, page-turning fiction  (Stephen King). Natural causes or foul play? That s the question Clay Edison must answer each time he examines a body. Figuring out motives and chasing down suspects aren t part of his beat not until a seemingly open-and-shut case proves to be more than meets his highly trained eye. Eccentric, reclusive Walter Rennert lies cold at the bottom of his stairs. At first glance the scene looks straightforward: a once-respected psychology professor, done in by booze and a bad heart. But his daughter Tatiana insists that her father has been murdered, and she persuades Clay to take a closer look at the grim facts of Rennert s life. What emerges is a history of scandal and violence, and an experiment gone horribly wrong that ended in the brutal murder of a coed. Walter Rennert, it appears, was a broken man and maybe a marked one. And when Clay learns that a colleague of Rennert s died in a nearly identical manner, he begins to question everything in the official record. All the while, his relationship with Tatiana is evolving into something forbidden. The closer they grow, the more determined he becomes to catch her father s killer even if he has to overstep his bounds to do it. The twisting trail Clay follows will lead him into the darkest corners of the human soul. It s his job to listen to the tales the dead tell. But this time, he s part of a story that makes his blood run cold. Praise for Crime Scene  You could drive yourself crazy trying to figure out who wrote what. . . . But whoever came up with the fine line,  When I meet new people, they re usually dead,  should pat himself on the back.  The New York Times Book Review  A terrific book . . .

His mouth splits open his brown beard. He throws up a hand, palm outward, in an unwilled, futile gesture to ward off death. A killer is hounding the seaside town of Old Tornwich. Residents are gripped by fear and suspicion, and the finger of blame is pointed in all directions. But the bodies keep falling and the crimes remain unsolved, the culprit at large. No mere whodunnit, The Suburbs of Hell its story inspired by a real-life serial killer is a profoundly disturbing psychological drama with a devastating conclusion, the final work of one of Australia s greatest writers. Julian Randolph 'Mick' Stow was born in Geraldton, Western Australia, in 1935. He attended local schools before boarding at Guildford Grammar in Perth, where the renowned author Kenneth Mackenzie had been a student. While at university he sent his poems to a British publisher. The resulting collection, Act One, won the Australian Literature Society s Gold Medal in 1957 as did the prolific young writer's third novel, To the Islands, the following year. To the Islands also won the 1958 Miles Franklin Literary Award. Stow reworked the novel for a second edition almost twenty-five years later, but never allowed its two predecessors to be republished. He worked briefly as an anthropologist s assistant in New Guinea an experience that subsequently informed Visitants, one of three masterful late novels then fell seriously ill and returned to Australia. In the 1960s he lectured at universities in Australia and England, and lived in America on a Harkness fellowship. He published his second collection of verse, Outrider; the novel Tourmaline, on which critical opinion was divided; and his most popular fiction, The Merry-Go-Round in the Sea and Midnite. For years afterwards Stow produced mainly poetry, libretti and reviews. In 1969 he settled permanently in England: first in Suffolk, then in Essex, where he moved in 1981. He received the 1979 Patrick White Award. Randolph Stow died in 2010, aged seventy-four. A private man, a prodigiously gifted yet intermittently silent author, he has been hailed as  the least visible figure of that great twentieth-century triumvirate of Australian novelists whose other members are Patrick White and Christina Stead . Praise for The Suburbs of Hell  Both a traditional murder mystery and a meditation on the random depredations of death.  Australian Book Review  Poetic accuracy is only one aspect of a rich talent...Mr Stow has a narrative gift as well...He is, in fact a real novelist.  Observer  A cleverly crafted whodunit... Stow is an example of the high calibre of Australian writers of yesterday. Many of these authors have been forgotten or perhaps overlooked.

Notwithstanding this basic tenet regarding the Christian life as a participation in the redemptive death of Jesus Christ, theology in the past, as well as much contemporary theology, tends to assign no salvific significance to the event of our own death, focusing instead on death in negative terms as the wages of sin. This work is a significant retort to theological neglect, both Catholic and Protestant, of the positive and transformative aspect of our death when conceived as a dying into the redemptive death of Jesus Christ. The development of Henry L. Novello's proposed theology of death takes place in conversation with the pre-eminent contemporary contributors to this field of theological inquiry. By offering comprehensive critiques of Karl Rahner, Hans Urs von Balthasar, Karl Barth, Eberhard J ngel and J rgen Moltmann, Novello painstakingly pieces together a positive construal of death as salvific and transformative. What is especially distinctive about Novello's work is that he develops the idea of death as a sharing in the 'admirable exchange of natures' in the person of Jesus Christ, from which emerges his theory of resurrection at death for all. The reach of the work is extended by exploring some pastoral and liturgical implications of a theology of death conceived as the privileged moment for the actualization of God's grace in Jesus Christ, and thus being created anew in the power of the Spirit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8fmhAgAAQBAJ&dq=I+Believe+in+the+Holy+Spirit,+Volume+III:+The+River+of+Life+Flows+in+the+East+and+in+the+West&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Prince Valiant, Vol. 14: Sword and Sorcery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=V5YgAQAAMAAJ&dq=Prince+Valiant,+Vol.+14:+Sword+and+Sorcery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Sell Apartment Buildings: The Big Money in Real Estate","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8AIcAQAAMAAJ&dq=How+to+Sell+Apartment+Buildings:+The+Big+Money+in+Real+Estate&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Unwritten Rules of the Highly Effective Job Search: The Proven Program Used by the World&#8217;s Leading Career Services Company","description":"The Proven Program Used by 600,000 Job Hunters!

And I began to think. If these people were put in situations when they could not get food to eat, and had to survive with their body starving, they would not treat food with such casual contempt. However, they were starving their bodies of essential nutrients out of sheer ignorance. They wanted to get thin. Many of them were genetically programmed towards obesity. Others began gaining weight due to the body reaching a stage when it was in such a desperate condition that malnutrition had set in. And that is why it was putting on weight as a last resort in order to protect the body from any sort of future starvation. This book is going to tell you all about ancient food eating practices followed by the wise men of yore. If you say, I cannot do without my potato chips, or my sugar fix, well, you are not ready to live a lifestyle which were followed by our ancestors all over the world, millenniums ago. They ate nourishing food. And they were thankful for what they got. They did not bother much about silly newfangled ideas about calories and in the amounts of calories required to keep you healthy and strong. This of course is a fallacy and is a silly myth, which I am going to explain to you later on, but at the moment I am going to tell you more about how foods were used to heal a number of diseases down the ages, and naturally.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oL8vDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Sun Witch (Fyne Witches, Book 1)","description":"For three nights, Sophie Fyne has dreamed of a man with green eyes.

She learned, among other things, that her instincts are good, her kids are really resilient, and that, in the fight against breast cancer, the journey for patients, family, and friends can be a surprisingly positive, life-changing experience. Some five years younger than the AMA-recommended age for mammograms, Jennie Nash insisted she be tested, not because of a lump but because of a hunch brought on by a friend's battle with lung cancer. Jennie was as shocked to discover as her friend had been that cancer knows no age limits. From detection and surgery to reconstruction and recovery, Jennie gives readers a road map for a journey no one chooses to take. She details both the large and small lessons learned along the way: the importance of a child's birthday cake; the pleasure of wearing a beautiful, provocative red dress; how to be grateful rather than guilty when someone brings lasagne to the door; and that sometimes the only difference between getting to live and having to die is luck. A celebration of survival, Jennie Nash's account transforms one of life's most harrowing experiences into a story of reassurance and enlightenment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_3mii3x9s2AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Drifting to Glory: A Story of the Civil War","description":"This is a novel of the author's great-grandfather's experiences during the Civil War as a member of the Bucktail Regt., Army of The Potomac.

Each denomination offered its own vision of \\"civilization\\": Southern missionaries taught the divine ordination of slavery, but northern missionaries taught that God opposed it.

But Jon B. Gould's provocative book, based on an enormous amount of empirical evidence, reveals that the real reasons for their growth are to be found in the pragmatic, almost utilitarian, considerations of college administrators. Instituting hate speech policy, he shows, was often a symbolic response taken by university leaders to reassure campus constituencies of their commitment against intolerance. In an academic version of \\"keeping up with the Joneses,\\" some schools created hate speech codes to remain within what they saw as the mainstream of higher education. Only a relatively small number of colleges crafted codes out of deep commitment to their merits. Although college speech codes have been overturned by the courts, Speak No Evil argues that their rise has still had a profound influence on curtailing speech in other institutions such as the media and has also shaped mass opinion and common understandings of constitutional norms. Ultimately, Gould contends, this kind of informal law can have just as much power as the Constitution.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tApJtRo2vWsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AutoCAD LT 98: Basics Through Advanced","description":"AutoCAD LT is a 2D version of the full AutoCAD software.

Explanantion and Proof in Mathematics assembles perspectives from mathematics education and from the philosophy and history of mathematics to strengthen mutual awareness and share recent findings and advances in their interrelated fields. With examples ranging from the geometrists of the 17th century and ancient Chinese algorithms to cognitive psychology and current educational practice, contributors explore the role of refutation in generating proofs, the varied links between experiment and deduction, the use of diagrammatic thinking in addition to pure logic, and the uses of proof in mathematics education (including a critique of \\"authoritative\\" versus \\"authoritarian\\" teaching styles). A sampling of the coverage: The conjoint origins of proof and theoretical physics in ancient Greece. Proof as bearers of mathematical knowledge. Bridging knowing and proving in mathematical reasoning. The role of mathematics in long-term cognitive development of reasoning. Proof as experiment in the work of Wittgenstein. Relationships between mathematical proof, problem-solving, and explanation. Explanation and Proof in Mathematics is certain to attract a wide range of readers, including mathematicians, mathematics education professionals, researchers, students, and philosophers and historians of mathematics.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3bLHye8kSAwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Frontier Eyewitness Diary of John Lawrence, 1867-1908","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=p0R4AAAACAAJ&dq=Frontier+Eyewitness+Diary+of+John+Lawrence,+1867-1908&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Secret Love","description":"And now, Stephanie Laurens has created her boldest Cynster yet - Gabriel - a man who has known the pleasure of many women, but who has given his heart to no one.

It has been said that ideas are weapons. That is certainly as true in chess as in any other field. A mastery of a little theory which conveys real understanding of the game is infinitely more valuable than a carefully memorized compilation of endless moves. Paradoxically, a thorough grasp of the ideas behind the openings, which are relatively few in number, is a royal road to knowledge which eliminates much of the drudgery associated with remembering a long series of variations. My object in this work is to present the necessary \\"ideology\\" as concisely as possible. This is one of the great classic works on chess by one of the strongest chess players in history. All to often the most recent chess books are just database dumps based on millions of chess games. Our young chess players often undertake the task of memorizing thousands of variations. Let me let you in on a little secret: The world's leading chess grandmasters do not memorize thousands of opening lines. Rather, they study and work them out. They remember the ideas behind the moves, not necessarily the moves themselves. Once they recall the reasons for the moves, they can work out and re-discover the best moves themselves. There are many new moves and opening variations that have become popular and fashionable since this book was published. However, the ideas behind these openings have remained the same. This book is just as valid as when it was first published. Reuben Fine was one of the world's strongest grandmasters of chess.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HaUfuAAACAAJ&dq=Modern+Ideas+in+the+Chess+Openings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A KNIFE AT THE OPERA","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4Av6zgEACAAJ&dq=A+KNIFE+AT+THE+OPERA&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Having the Billionaire's Baby (With Child...)

Desperate to escape a relationship that has proven to be as stubbornly passionate as it is cold and hateful, Theresa summons up the courage to ask for a divorce. But before he'll grant her request, Sandro demands something from Theresa: a son. The stalemate sickens her. Never mind that Sandro has yet to introduce Theresa to the large family that means so much to him. Or that Theresa overhears her husband on the phone with a mystery woman.

However, unlike the previous text, this edition will focus on a holistic approach to the treatment of these increasingly common injuries with new chapters on nutritional optimization of athletes at risk for stress fractures, systemic treatment strategies for healing including vitamin D supplementation and parathyroid hormone stimulation, and surgical and injectable biologic treatment modalities for enhanced bone healing. This edition will also include guidelines for on-the-field and training room management of stress fractures for team physicians.

Acosta: The Uncollected Works gathers unpublished stories, essays, letters, poems and a teleplay written by Acosta (1935-1974), the legendary Chicano attorney, political activist and writer. All of these works were written between the early 1960s and shortly before his mysterious disappearance in Mazatal n, Mexico, in 1974. Through these writings Acosta reveals a variety of personae: a leader troubled by issues of ethnic, linguistic, and cultural identity; a man who saw himself as a Robin Hood of Mexican Americans; an unstable yet genial wanderer who joined Hunter S. Thompson in a search for the American Dream. Acosta realized that democracy is about speaking out, about feeling uncomfortable, about defining others and oneself through the prism of race and history. With the publication of Oscar ?Zeta? Acosta: The Uncollected Works, the complete picture of a crucial player in the Chicano Movement?described by others as ?our Thomas Aquinas? and by himself as ?the Brown Buffalo??finally emerges.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=460KV5oyidYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Language Truth and Logic","description":"\\"A delightful book   I should like to have written it myself.\\"   Bertrand Russell First published in 1936, this first full-length presentation in English of the Logical Positivism of Carnap, Neurath, and others has gone through many printings to become a classic of thought and communication. It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern thought; it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing, this remarkable book has helped philosophers, writers, speakers, teachers, students, and general readers alike. Mr. Ayers sets up specific tests by which you can easily evaluate statements of ideas. You will also learn how to distinguish ideas that cannot be verified by experience   those expressing religious, moral, or aesthetic experience, those expounding theological or metaphysical doctrine, and those dealing with a priori truth. The basic thesis of this work is that philosophy should not squander its energies upon the unknowable, but should perform its proper function in criticism and analysis.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6KTZcxzEuTcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dick Sutphen's Rush Hour Relaxation","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=l_8PAQAAMAAJ&dq=Dick+Sutphen%27s+Rush+Hour+Relaxation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Libertines (Victorian Erotic Classics)","description":"This notorious tale of a young monk whose experiences of the flesh were not confined to ecclesiastic theory was first published in eighteenth century France.

Focusing each chapter on the culinary and social history of one dish--such as fried chicken, chitlins, yams, greens, and \\"red drinks--Miller uncovers how it got on the soul food plate and what it means for African American culture and identity. Miller argues that the story is more complex and surprising than commonly thought. Four centuries in the making, and fusing European, Native American, and West African cuisines, soul food--in all its fried, pork-infused, and sugary glory--is but one aspect of African American culinary heritage. Miller discusses how soul food has become incorporated into American culture and explores its connections to identity politics, bad health raps, and healthier alternatives. This refreshing look at one of America's most celebrated, mythologized, and maligned cuisines is enriched by spirited sidebars, photographs, and twenty-two recipes.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Od8VAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Detours and Lost Highways: A Map of Neo-Noir","description":"EDetours and Lost HighwaysE begins with the Orson Welles film ETouch of EvilE (1958) which featured Welles both behind and in front of the camera.

For two days, these congressional liaisons, charged with moving their respective presidents' legislative agendas through an independent--and sometimes hostile--Congress, shared first-hand views of the intricacies of presidential-congressional relations: how it works, how it doesn't work, and the fascinating interplay of personalities, events, and politics that happens along the way. Hosted by noted presidential scholar Russell Riley and the University of Virginia's Miller Center of Public Affairs, this seminar also featured a number of invited scholars of American politics, including the eminent Richard E. Neustadt, who appeared just before his death a month later. As explained by Riley, .\\" . . these discussions enlighten in two ways: they provide us a revealing glimpse into the inside, usually hidden, business of Washington, and they afford us the considered reflections of a thoughtful group of political veterans.\\" What makes these exchanges especially compelling, however, is their bipartisan cast, with Republicans Max L.
