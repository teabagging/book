Here, too, are such bizarre figures as the octogenerian triathlete, the man who (before such things were banned) held every world eating record, and the last hangman in his untroubled retirement. Whether exploring the middle of England in the forgotten county of Northamptonshire or accompanying the last tramp through the wilder reaches of Wales, Byron Rogers chronicles a secret history of Britain that is touching, hilarious, magical and the extraordinary lives or ordinary people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zzLBAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dave Zobel's Bent Book of Boatspeak: How to Sound Like a Sailor and Know Just Enough to Be Dangerous","description":"The primary objective of this tongue-in-cheek nautical dictionary is to amuse and then to inform.

As long as we exist, it exists. That's how the argument goes. But longtime Scientific American writer John Horgan disagrees. Applying the scientific method to war leads Horgan to a radical conclusion: biologically speaking, we are just as likely to be peaceful as violent. War is not preordained, and furthermore, it should be thought of as a solvable, scientific problem like curing cancer. But war and cancer differ in at least one crucial way: whereas cancer is a stubborn aspect of nature, war is our creation. It s our choice whether to unmake it or not. In this compact, methodical treatise, Horgan examines dozens of examples and counterexamples discussing chimpanzees and bonobos, warring and peaceful indigenous people, the World War I and Vietnam, Margaret Mead and General Sherman as he finds his way to war s complicated origins. Horgan argues for a far-reaching paradigm shift with profound implications for policy students, ethicists, military men and women, teachers, philosophers, or really, any engaged citizen.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=epvmBQAAQBAJ&dq=The+End+of+the+Battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"WHEN THE PENTAGON WAS FOR SALE: Inside America's Biggest Defense Scandal","description":"Identifies the rampant defense industry corruption during the Reagan years that led to the government's spending $28 million per hour, and explains how this has affected present-day America. 50,000 first printing.

Based on a sustained critique of the formal tradition that underlies the reigning views, he presents an argument for an embedded, participatory, \\"irreductionist,\\" metaphysical alternative. Smith seeks nothing less than to revise our understanding not only of the machines we build but also of the world with which they interact. Smith's ambitious project begins as a search for a comprehensive theory of computation, able to do empirical justice to practice and conceptual justice to the computational theory of mind. A rigorous commitment to these two criteria ultimately leads him to recommend a radical overhaul of our traditional conception of metaphysics. Everything that exists -- objects, properties, life, practice -- lies Smith claims in the \\"middle distance,\\" an intermediate realm of partial engagement with and partial separation from, the enveloping world. Patterns of separation and engagement are taken to underlie a single notion unifying representation and ontology: that of subjects' \\"registration\\" of the world around them. Along the way, Smith offers many fascinating ideas: the distinction between particularity and individuality, the methodological notion of an \\"inscription error,\\" an argument that there are no individuals within physics, various deconstructions of the type-instance distinction, an analysis of formality as overly disconnected (\\"discreteness run amok\\"), a conception of the boundaries of objects as properties of unruly interactions between objects and subjects, an argument for the theoretical centrality of reference preservation, and a theatrical, acrobatic metaphor for the contortions involved in the preservation of reference and resultant stabilization of objects. Sidebars and diagrams throughout the book help clarify and guide Smith's highly original and compelling argument.

To her first husband, she was the perfect wife and mother. But to the other men in her life she was so much more. Daughter of a Welsh Surveyor who had brought his Palestinian wife to Mexico at the end of World War II to seek his fortune, Bianca was raised always to expect the best of everything. She quickly discovered, however, that the best was never going to be enough. Charming, attractive, vivacious and extremely aware of her power over rich and powerful men, she sought nothing less than to be the absolute ruler of international society. Reluctantly but ruthlessly contriving to bring about the end of her marriage to Bernardo, she quickly allowed herself to become wedded to the fortunes of Ferdie, the psychologically unstable scion of the powerful and rich Piedraplata family, whose international concerns include commerce, banking and jewelry. However, when deep cracks start to form in their glamourous jet-set lifestyle together, Bianca turns to the calculating and amoral Philippe Mahfud, an Iraqi business associate of Ferdies, to help her attain the wealth and status she secretly covets.

It could simply and accurately be described as a dazzlingly smart and lively collection of superb works by some of America's most gifted writers. All their surnames happen to end in vowels, true, but that need not affect your enjoyment of this volume one way or the other. America, too, is an Italian name ending in a vowel. Inside, there are nearly seventy excellent things for you to read -- excerpts from novels and memoirs, short stories, essays, and poems -- by the living and the dead, the famous and the obscure. Some date back to the 1930s; others were freshly hatched in the twenty-first century. They are variously moving, funny, poignant, lusty, biting, reverent, witty, loving, angry, and wise. They deal in the most profound aspects of our lives no matter who we are: home, love, sex, family, food, work, God, death. Many feature familiar Italian American characters, settings, and themes, but not all. No matter what they are about, they are all in the end about who and what we are, the essence of history and memory and blood. There are gangsters in here, but there are grandmas too, along side lovers and fighters, thinkers and doers, cops and robbers, poets and grocers, sinners and saints. There are plenty of moms and pops and aunts and uncles and cousins. Frank Sinatra and the Virgin Mary make appearances. This anthology is a genuine landmark -- the first general-reader hardcover collection of writing by Italian American authors.

In his comprehensive look at labor issues during the decade of the Great War, McCartin explores the political, economic, and social forces that gave rise to this conflict and shows how rising labor militancy and the sudden erosion of managerial control in wartime workplaces combined to create an industrial crisis. The search for a resolution to this crisis led to the formation of an influential coalition of labor Democrats, AFL unionists, and Progressive activists on the eve of U.S. entry into the war. Though the coalition's efforts in pursuit of industrial democracy were eventually frustrated by powerful forces in business and government and by internal rifts within the movement itself, McCartin shows how the shared quest helped cement the ties between unionists and the Democratic Party that would subsequently shape much New Deal legislation and would continue to influence the course of American political and labor history to the present day.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rSE6DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Junk Food Vegetarian","description":"Did you know that Fruit Loops, Baked Lay's Potato Chips, and Cracker Jacks are vegan?

'An exhilarating experience ... Genius.' Jamaica Kincaid I dreamt I awoke with one dead seeing eye and one living closed eye ... Guyana. An ancient landscape of rainforests and swamplands, haunted by the legacy of slavery and colonial conquest. It is the site of dangerous journeys through the Amazonian interior, where riverboat crews embark on spiritual quests and government surveys are sabotaged by indigenous uprisings. It is a universe of complex moralities, where the conspiracies of a sinister money-lender and the faked death of a murderer question innocence and inheritance. It is a place where life and death, myth and history, philosophy and metaphysics blur. And it is the birthplace of an epic masterpiece.

This book is the revised James Legge translation which has been extensively reworked and restored compared to the freely available Legge translations. The Analects, also known as the Analects of Confucius, is the collection of sayings and ideas attributed to the Chinese philosopher Confucius and his contemporaries, traditionally believed to have been written by Confucius' followers. It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the Analects was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the Analects grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty. During the late Song dynasty (960-1279) the importance of the Analects as a philosophy work was raised above that of the older Five Classics, and it was recognized as one of the \\"Four Books\\". The Analects has been one of the most widely read and studied books in China for the last 2,000 years, and continues to have a substantial influence on Chinese and East Asian thought and values today. Confucius (551479 BC) was a Chinese teacher, editor, politician, and philosopher of the Spring and Autumn period of Chinese history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZvJBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Berlitz Basic German: The Unique, Simple, and Successful Approach to Language Learning/Book and 3 Cassettes (Berlitz Basic Language Course)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wjBFAQAAIAAJ&dq=Berlitz+Basic+German:+The+Unique,+Simple,+and+Successful+Approach+to+Language+Learning/Book+and+3+Cassettes+(Berlitz+Basic+Language+Course)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mary and O'Neil","description":"WINNER OF THE PEN/HEMINGWAY AWARD ?

During the course of the War, however, many of these same German Catholics raised no serious objection to serving in Germany's armies or swearing allegiance to Adolph Hitler. First published in 1962, German Catholics and Hitler's Wars created a furor, ultimately causing a serious reevaluation of church-state relationships and, in particular, of the morality of war. This work began as an attempt to understand the demise of the German Catholic Peace League. But because of various factors, including the destruction of vital records, Gordon C. Zahn began to consider the behavior of German Catholics in general and the evidence of their almost total conformity to the war demands of the Nazi regime. Using sociological analysis, he argues convincingly for the existence of a super-effective system of social controls, and of a selection between the competing values of Catholicism and nationalism. Although Zahn never speculates, conclusions are inescapable, chief among them that the traditional Catholic doctrine of the \\"just war\\" has ceased to be operative for Catholics in the modern world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QF8FDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dishing: Great Dish -- and Dishes -- from America's Most Beloved Gossip Columnist","description":"An anecdotal memoir by the entertainment editor for \\"Cosmopolitan\\" magazine offers a collection of favorite celebrity recipes, including Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's judge's jailhouse chili, Diane Sawyer's cherry pie, and Dan Jenkins's chicken fr","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xNqSgi0_syUC&dq=Dishing:+Great+Dish+--+and+Dishes+--+from+America%27s+Most+Beloved+Gossip+Columnist&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comic Books and America, 1945-1954","description":"in the confusing decade following World War II, comic books were all the rage.

As the tide of the Civil War turned in the spring of 1865, Abraham Lincoln took a dangerous two-week trip to visit the troops on the front lines accompanied by his young son, seeing combat up close, meeting liberated slaves in the ruins of Richmond, and comforting wounded Union and Confederate soldiers. The power of Lincoln s personal example in the closing days of the war offers a portrait of a peacemaker. He did not demonize people he disagreed with. He used humor, logic, and scripture to depolarize bitter debates. Balancing moral courage with moderation, Lincoln believed that decency could be the most practical form of politics, but he understood that people were more inclined to listen to reason when greeted from a position of strength. Ulysses S. Grant s famously generous terms of surrender to General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox that April were a direct expression of the president s belief that a soft peace should follow a hard war. While his assassination sent the country careening off course, Lincoln s vision would be vindicated long after his death, inspiring future generations in their own quests to secure a just and lasting peace. As US General Lucius Clay, architect of the post-WWII German occupation, said when asked what guided his decisions:  I tried to think of the kind of occupation the South would have had if Abraham Lincoln had lived.  Lincoln and the Fight for Peace reveals how Lincoln s character informed his commitment to unconditional surrender followed by a magnanimous peace. Even during the Civil War, surrounded by reactionaries and radicals, he refused to back down from his belief that there is more that unites us than divides us. But he also understood that peace needs to be waged with as much intensity as war. Lincoln s plan to win the peace is his unfinished symphony, but in its existing notes, we can find an anthem that can begin to bridge our divisions today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zaM1EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"O Pioneers!

Then, in Chapter 2, the consequences of our short-sighted acceptance of the comforts of the present are shown to make it unlikely that the West can survive this century. Exhaustion of resources and overpopulation are the principal reasons. In Chapters 4 and 5, it is shown that our present beliefs in the foundations of science are ill-based; most of those secure foundations are by now shaking with doubt. Then follows the essence of the book. In Chapters 5, 6, 7 and 8 there is presented evidence for the acceptance of the reality of Telepathy and Precognition; of ghosts of people; of the ability of some to leave the body whilst still alive; of experiences when very near to death which seem to be independent of the experiencer's religion. These involve the experience of an intense feeling of love, of the evaluation of your life, etc. The most frequent beginning to such experiences involves the observation of the patient on the death bed - usually in a hospital operating room - of one's own body from high up near the ceiling. After that, the evidence for Reincarnation in new bodies is given. In Chapter 9 is a detailed discussion of what CONSCIOUSNESS means. In this chapter comes a statement of the evidence for a Biofield to explain the ability of some to show that they can change their surroundings by the power of their mind. In the last chapter, some conclusions are given and an approach to a New Paradigm outlined. Humans exist dualistically, the essence of a human is inside his mortal body. This essence is called Consciousness (or the Soul) and it lives on although we do not yet know for how many generations; nor whether this reincarnation applies to all of us. Acceptance of this vital change of outlook, when it spreads to the general population, will cause many changes including the diminishing of Hate and War and an increase in Peace and Love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MrSnPQAACAAJ&dq=The+New+Paradigm&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Freefall","description":"A MOST ANTICIPATED BOOK OF 2019: Entertainment Weekly | USA Today | Parade | Cosmopolitan | New York Post | PopSugar | Goodreads  Jessica Barry s Freefall is not only an enthralling, impossible-to-put down mystery that keeps the pages flying, but it is also a gorgeous, resonant tale of a mother s unconditional love for her daughter.

It is the autobiographical account of a young man s ongoing struggle with anorexia. Michael shared his story as part of the featured health segment  Men Dying to be Thin  on WSVN Channel 7 News in Miami, Florida, in May 1997. Michael Krasnow has had anorexia since 1984, and he chronicles his daily struggles, feelings, and experiences in this book. He writes in a relaxed, easygoing manner that makes the book appealing to all readers. While ignoring statistics and not pretending to be an expert on the disorder, Michael simply tells readers what his life is like and how anorexia has affected--even controlled--it. As of today, Michael has maintained his weight at 75 pounds on a 5-foot, 9-inch frame. Anyone who suffers, or anyone who knows someone who suffers from, anorexia will learn that male anorexia is a serious problem and that there needs to be psychological and medical help for the boys and men who struggle with anorexia. As Michael begins his book,  For years, anorexia existed, but very few people knew of it. Women who suffered from it did not realize that they were not alone. Eventually, as more became known and anorexia became more publicized, a greater number of women came forward to seek help, no longer feeling that they would be considered strange or outcasts from society. Maybe with the publication of this book, more men with the problem will realize that they are not alone either, and that they do not suffer from a  woman s disease. They can come forward without worrying about embarrassment.

The Black Image in the White Mind offers the most comprehensive look at the intricate racial patterns in the mass media and how they shape the ambivalent attitudes of Whites toward Blacks. Using the media, and especially television, as barometers of race relations, Robert Entman and Andrew Rojecki explore but then go beyond the treatment of African Americans on network and local news to incisively uncover the messages sent about race by the entertainment industry-from prime-time dramas and sitcoms to commercials and Hollywood movies. While the authors find very little in the media that intentionally promotes racism, they find even less that advances racial harmony. They reveal instead a subtle pattern of images that, while making room for Blacks, implies a racial hierarchy with Whites on top and promotes a sense of difference and conflict. Commercials, for example, feature plenty of Black characters. But unlike Whites, they rarely speak to or touch one another. In prime time, the few Blacks who escape sitcom buffoonery rarely enjoy informal, friendly contact with White colleagues perhaps reinforcing social distance in real life. Entman and Rojecki interweave such astute observations with candid interviews of White Americans that make clear how these images of racial difference insinuate themselves into Whites' thinking. Despite its disturbing readings of television and film, the book's cogent analyses and proposed policy guidelines offer hope that America's powerful mediated racial separation can be successfully bridged. \\"Entman and Rojecki look at how television news focuses on black poverty and crime out of proportion to the material reality of black lives, how black 'experts' are only interviewed for 'black-themed' issues and how 'black politics' are distorted in the news, and conclude that, while there are more images of African-Americans on television now than there were years ago, these images often don't reflect a commitment to 'racial comity' or community-building between the races. Thoroughly researched and convincingly argued.\\" Publishers Weekly \\"Drawing on their own research and that of a wide array of other scholars, Entman and Rojecki present a great deal of provocative data showing a general tendency to devalue blacks or force them into stock categories.\\" Ben Yagoda, New Leader Winner of the Frank Luther Mott Award for best book in Mass Communication and the Robert E.

It has never been told in any comprehensive way before, and shows Lincoln in a new and engaging light. Lincoln was determined to win the war, yet his generals seemed unable to give him a victory, so he reasoned that a more efficient weapon would have to be invented. However, his main opponent, General James W. Ripley, who sat in charge of army ordnance, believed the war would be short and didn t want a vast supply of expensive arms left over. Standardized guns and ammunition made supplying the troops in the field easier. Lincoln was in the thick of it. He wanted mortar boats to help open the upper Mississippi as they had helped Porter take New Orleans. When he discovered a big snafu had delayed production, one J. D. Mills came to Washington with a crude machine gun that was soon christened the coffee-mill gun. Probably the biggest and longest controversy involved muzzle-loading rifles favoured by Ripley and breech-loading rifles the Soldier s choice, as he could lie down and load a breechloader at least five times as fast as a muzzle-loader. In addition to these and other standard arms, the inventors offered a wide catalogue of innovations: rockets, steam guns, liquid fire, a submarine, explosive bullets, a proposed poison gas, and so on down to the fantastic. This book is a big American story of Washington in wartime, and it will appeal to everybody who ever had any contact with the armed services. For the specialist, it offers quite a quantity of previously unpublished material. Its biggest merit is, however, that it is just plain fascinating reading, the kind of book no one should start late in the evening if he wants any sleep.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1RkkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Daddy by Design (Harlequin American Romance, No. 742)","description":"Daddy To Be Determined by Muriel Jensen released on Jun 22, 2001 is available now for purchase.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tLHfUyMnXooC&dq=Daddy+by+Design+(Harlequin+American+Romance,+No.+742)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Live Healthy Now and Forever","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FsLvPAAACAAJ&dq=Live+Healthy+Now+and+Forever&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Testimonies","description":"Hear the voices of women of color on the most important subject in any age--the word of God.

His ten-year term was a time of relative peace in this fractious new outpost of the Roman Empire, where violence was not uncommon. He was not loved and not quite feared, and might have vanished into obscurity had he not come to preside, with some reluctance, over the most famous trial in history. In this brilliant biography, a finalist for the Samuel Johnson Prize and a masterpiece of scholarship and imagination, Ann Wroe brings Pilate and his world to life. Working from classical sources, she reconstructs his origins and upbringing, his career in the military and life in Rome, his confrontation with Christ, and his long journey home. We catch glimpses of him pacing the marble floors in Caesarea, sharpening his stylus, getting dressed shortly before sunrise on the day that would seal his place in history. What were the pressures on Pilate that day? What did he really think of Jesus? Pontius Pilate lets us see Christ's trial for the first time, in all its confusion, from the point of view of his executioner. Pontius Pilate is a historical figure, like Cleopatra and Alexander, who has been endlessly mythologized through the ages. For some he is a saint, for others the embodiment of human weakness, an archetypal politician willing to sacrifice one man for the sake of stability. Each generation has pressed onto Pilate the imprint of its anxieties and its faith. He has haunted and continues to haunt our imagination. From the Evangelists and the Copts (for whom he was a saint, martyred himself on the Cross) to more recent philosophers, artists, novelists, and politicians, Pilate has been resurrected in different guises for two thousand years. Ann Wroe brings man and myth to life in a book that expands the possibilities of the biographical form and deepens our understanding of the mysteries of faith. It has often been said that Pontius Pilate was fingered by God to carry out the divine plan of salvation, just as clearly as Christ was. Ann Wroe shows how, in his hesitation before God, in his skepticism, his anxiety to do his job and exonerate himself of guilt, Pilate's story is very much our own.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TNrzCVrf3DkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"\\"Know Thyself\\" Jnana Yoga Part 2 (Complete Works-Volume 18A)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=F80PAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22Know+Thyself%22+Jnana+Yoga+Part+2+(Complete+Works-Volume+18A)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cultural Defense","description":"Publisher's description: In a trial in California, Navajo defendants argue that using the hallucinogen peyote to achieve spiritual exaltation is protected by the Constitution's free exercise of religion clause, trumping the states' right to regulate them. An Ibo man from Nigeria sues Pan American World Airways for transporting his mother's corpse in a cloth sack. Her arrival for the funeral face down in a burlap bag signifies death by suicide according to the customs of her Ibo kin, and brings great shame to the son. In Los Angeles, two Cambodian men are prosecuted for attempting to eat a four month-old puppy. The immigrants' lawyers argue that the men were following their own \\"national customs\\" and do not realize their conduct is offensive to \\"American sensibilities.\\" What is the just decision in each case? When cultural practices come into conflict with the law is it legitimate to take culture into account? Is there room in modern legal systems for a cultural defense? In this remarkable book, Alison Dundes Renteln amasses hundreds of cases from the U.S. and around the world in which cultural issues take center stage-from the mundane to the bizarre, from drugs to death. Though cultural practices vary dramatically, Renteln demonstrates that there are discernible patterns to the cultural arguments used in the courtroom. The regularities she uncovers offer judges a starting point for creating a body of law that takes culture into account. Renteln contends that a systematic treatment of culture in law is not only possible, but ultimately more equitable. A just pluralistic society requires a legal system that can assess diverse motivations and can recognize the key role that culture plays in influencing human behavior. The inclusion of evidence of cultural background is necessary for the fair hearing of a case.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LHo8DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Cultural+Defense&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Colorado Cowboys","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=bmkHAAAACAAJ&dq=Colorado+Cowboys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fleecing Grandma and Grandpa : Protecting against Scams, Cons, and Frauds","description":"Scams and cons can target anyone, but the elderly are particularly vulnerable; Alt and Wells review the various frauds, provide advice for avoiding the traps, and offer guidance for what to do if you or a loved one falls victim.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-wQlCXZllv8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vision in Elementary Mathematics.","description":"Sure-fire techniques of visualizing, dramatizing, and analyzing numbers promise to attract and retain students' attention and understanding.

First, he must condition himself to expect his wife to leave him, his friends to point the finger of scorn and his boss to wonder whether he has a future with the firm. So advises Brian Plummer, whose notoriety as a rat-catcher began at age ten. Tales of a Rat-Hunting Man, first published in Britain in 1978, is both a serious book on rats and their habits and an autobiographical account of Plummer's eccentric and entertaining life.

It was William Randolph Hearst who understood how to use cinema to exploit the public's desire for entertainment and to create film propaganda to further his own desire for power. From the start, Hearst saw his future and the future of Hollywood as one and the same. He pioneered and capitalized on the synergistic relationship between yellow journalism and advertising and motion pictures. He sent movie cameramen to the inauguration of William McKinley and the front lines of the Spanish-American War. He played a prominent role in organizing film propaganda for both sides fighting World War I. By the 1910s, Hearst was producing his own pictures he ran one of the first animation studios and made many popular and controversial movie serials, including The Perils of Pauline (creating both the scenario and the catchphrase title) and Patria. As a feature film producer, Hearst was responsible for some of the most talked-about movies of the 1920s and 1930s. Behind the scenes in Hollywood, Hearst had few equals he was a much-feared power broker from the Silent Era to the Blacklisting Era. Hearst Over Hollywood draws on hundreds of previously unpublished letters and memos, FBI Freedom of Information files, and personal interviews to document the scope of Hearst's power in Hollywood. Louis Pizzitola tells the hidden story of Hearst's shaping influence on both film publicity and film censorship getting the word out and keeping it in check as well as the growth of the \\"talkies,\\" and the studio system. He details Hearst's anti-Semitism and anti-Communism, used to retaliate for Citizen Kane and to maintain dominance in the film industry, and exposes his secret film deal with Germany on the eve of World War II. The author also presents new insights into Hearst's relationships with Marion Davies, Will Hays, Louis B. Mayer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Mussolini, Hitler, and the Kennedys. Hearst Over Hollywood is a tour de force of biography, cultural study, and film history that reveals as never before the brilliance and darkness of Hearst's prophetic connection with Hollywood.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-sbeR0K5Vx4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Guide to Coffee Grounds and Tea Leaf Reading (Complete Guides series)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Webster's New World Essential Vocabulary","description":"EXPAND YOUR VOCABULARY--FOR BETTER TEST SCORES AND BETTER COMMUNICATION You probably can't learn all the hundreds of thousands of words in the English language--but you can learn those difficult words you're most likely to need to know.

Joseph Mitchell was a cornerstone of the New Yorker staff for decades, but his prolific career was shattered by an extraordinary case of writer s block. For the final thirty-two years of his life, Mitchell published nothing. And the key to his silence may lie in his last major work: the biography of a supposed Harvard grad turned Greenwich Village tramp named Joe Gould. Gould was, in Mitchell s words,  an odd and penniless and unemployable little man who came to this city in 1916 and ducked and dodged and held on as hard as he could for over thirty-five years.  As Mitchell learns more about Gould s epic Oral History a reputedly nine-million-word collection of philosophizing, wanderings, and hearsay he eventually uncovers a secret that adds even more intrigue to the already unusual story of the local legend. Originally written as two separate pieces ( Professor Sea Gull  in 1942 and then  Joe Gould s Secret  twenty-two years later), this magnum opus captures Mitchell at his peak. As the reader comes to understand Gould s secret, Mitchell s words become all the more haunting. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Joseph Mitchell including rare images from the author s estate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3BQoCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh Call Back Yesterday, Bid Time Return","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SnnOMwEACAAJ&dq=Oh+Call+Back+Yesterday,+Bid+Time+Return&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Madoc: A Mystery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HxhkQgAACAAJ&dq=Madoc:+A+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shining Nights","description":"Shining Night is book three in the Faithgirlz series Lena in the Spotlight, written by Alena Pitts, star of The War Room and tween blogger of For Girls Like You, and co-written with her mother, editor and author Wynter Pitts.

But, as Charles Briggs convincingly argues in this book, received interviewing techniques rest on fundamental misapprehensions about the nature both of the interview as a communicative event, and of the nature of the data that it produces. Furthermore, interviewers rarely examine the compatibility of interviews as a means of acquiring information to one another. These oversights often blind interviewers to ensuing errors of interpretation, as well as to the limitations of the interview as a means of acquiring data. To conflict these problems, Professor Briggs presents an analysis of the 'communicative blunders' that he himself committed in conducting research interviews among Spanish-speakers in northern New Mexico. By focusing on these errors and exploring how they may be avoided, he is able to propose new techniques for designing, implementing, and analyzing interview-based research. These rest on identifying the subjects' resources for conveying information, and the relative compatibility of the shared rules and understandings that underlie their strategies with those associated with interviews. Critical of existing paradigms of interviewing, which he sees as deriving from Western 'folk' theories of reality and communication, Briggs shows that the development of more sophisticated interviewing methodologies requires further research into interviewing itself. Briggs's conclusions provide a basis for the reexamination of current uses of interviews in a wide range of contexts - from social science research to job applications, welfare and health care delivery, criminal and legal investigations, journalism and broadcasting, and other areas of everyday life. His book will appeal to linguists, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, psychologists, as well as other readers whose research or professional activities depend on the use of interviews.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HDbsF4_aeiEC&dq=Learning+How+to+Ask:+A+Sociolinguistic+Appraisal+of+the+Role+of+the+Interview+in+Social+Science+Research+(Studies+in+the+Social+and+Cultural+Foundations+of+Language)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Status Civilization","description":"The Status Civilization concerns Will Barrent, a man who finds himself, without memory of any crime or, indeed, of his previous life, being shipped across space to the planet Omega.

Does any of this describe you? You don't feel good or aren't well and your doctor has been unable to help you feel better? You take pills that are supposed to keep you alive but the side effects make you feel terrible? You wake up tired even after eight hours of sleep. You are overwhelmed trying to fit so much into your life that the thought of taking on one more task sends you into a downward spiral of stress. You're short tempered and impatient with so many people and activities during your day. You've forgotten how to laugh, joke or kid around with your friends and family. You crave sweet or salty foods. You feel you can't afford to take a day off, that all your activities and the people around you are more important than you are. You've gained a lot (or lost a lot) of weight because you were eating without paying attention to what you were eating OR you forgot to eat. You seem to suffer from colds and the sniffles way too often or have a lot of body pain such as lower back or joint pain. It's chronic and the doctor can't seem to find any physical cause. You don't recover easily. You have a major illness or high blood pressure, high cholesterol and other \\"middle age\\" conditions. You suffer a lot of headaches. Things that didn't used to bother you drive you crazy now. You are sensitive to sounds, especially if there are two or three of them, like the radio, conversation and background sounds. You can't figure out why you've hit a roadblock in your life. After all, you're working hard to get ahead. Your current behavior is causing your relationships to deteriorate. You might even be considering dangerous activities such as illegal drugs, risky behavior, or affairs just to feel alive again. In The Diamond Healing Method, you'll not only see the causes for your symptoms, you will also see the solutions. You'll find there are seven life strategies that are more important than what you eat for you to live vibrantly and abundantly. These solutions have brought about massive changes in the hundreds of clients I have worked with. Which factors affect your health most profoundly? Within the pages of this book, you'll find that there are seven major factors that affect your life, health, mental, emotional, and spiritual well being. It isn't just your mind-set; it is also your environment and your interaction with it, whether it's other people, your surroundings or what you put in your body.

Bolt also draws extended comparisons between Kuyper's views and the thought of Alexis de Tocqueville, Lord John Acton, Pope Leo XIII, Walter Rauschenbusch, and Jonathan Edwards. A distinctive feature of this study is its focus on the rhetorical, poetic character of Kuyper's public theology and practice as a political leader. Bolt shows how focusing on Kuyper's rhetorical and mythopoetic perspective, rather than on his theological and philosophical ideas, provides contemporary evangelicals with a more credible and effective theology for the public square.\\"--Jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZGHYAAAAMAAJ&dq=A+Free+Church,+a+Holy+Nation:+Abraham+Kuyper%27s+American+Public+Theology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spencer's Mountain, a Prologue to Love, a Time to Stand, Give It Back to the Lemongrowers, Kirkland Revels (Reader's Digest Condensed Books: Winter 1962 Selections, 1)","description":"This successful book, now in its third edition, continues to provide a comprehensive introduction to the role of epidemiology in veterinary medicine.

It presents the Arabic text, an English translation, and a detailed analysis of a thirteenth-century agricultural almanac (dated by internal evidence to A.H. 670-71/A.D. 1271) compiled by the Yemeni sultan al-Malik al-Ashraf Umar ibn Yusuf, the third sultan of the Rasulid dynasty (13th-15th cent.). This almanac comprises one chapter of al-Ashraf's scientific treatise Kitab al-Tabsira fi ilm al-nujum (Instruction in the science of astronomy and astrology). Al-Ashraf's is the earliest and most detailed of eight extant Rasulid almanacs.\\" \\"The almanac as a literary and scientific genre in Arab tradition has received little scholarly attention, although hundreds of manuscripts exist. This study of almanac information draws the reader across the arbitrary boundaries of disciplines into the full array of medieval science and esoterica. Al-Ashraf's almanac contains information on astronomy, astrology, time-keeping, meteorology, plants and animals, agriculture (including tax periods), health, and navigation not only for Yemen but for other parts of the medieval world as well. It is the earliest source to document the dates of the Indian Ocean sailing periods to and from the port of Aden. The almanac provides a view of a medieval trading network extending from North Africa and southern Europe to the Indian Ocean and China.\\" \\"Information in the almanac is derived from both the general Islamic almanac tradition and ethnographic knowledge of local practice and folklore. Although the almanac is not meant to be a descriptive record of the agricultural cycle, for example, it is obvious that most of the information is based on observation of actual practices and on knowledge of folklore. Details of the Yemeni agricultural cycle, primarily for the coastal region and the southern highlands, are extremely valuable and supplement discussions in extant Rasulid agricultural and tax treatises.\\" \\"Varisco's extensive commentary explains how the terminology and concepts of al-Ashraf's text are related to those of earlier and contemporaneous scientific texts throughout the Islamic world and uses his own ethnographic research on Yemeni rural economy and folklore to enhance his interpretation of the almanac. One of the rewarding aspects of studying the Yemeni almanacs is that many of the agricultural activities mentioned can still be observed and documented. The study of a medieval almanac as part of a living tradition can be accomplished in Yemen better perhaps than anywhere else in the Arab world. The older generation still retains much of the accumulated agricultural and environmental lore from scores of previous generations. Not only would it be impossible to understand some of the almanac terminology without knowledge of present-day Yemeni dialects, but ethnographic study of traditional agriculture and folk science, despite changes over time, helps in the interpretation of old written sources.\\" \\"Because al-Ashraf's almanac addresses a wide range of subjects, readers from diverse disciplines will find this volume of value. Not only will it be a basic reference for anyone interested in Yemen, both ancient and modern, but it has much to offer scholars of medieval economy, science, and technology. Varisco's textual approach of combining historical and contextual analysis with ethnographic fieldwork further enhances the appeal and value of this study.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

The firm hired a variety of workers, including the native-born, immigrants, the skilled, the unskilled, and eventually women and a small number of blacks. Stephen Meyer presents a history of the Allis-Chalmers workers, and of the growth and destruction of the militant, left-wing union they built. The story of these workers and their union serves as a microcosm of the history of American labor in the twentieth century. Meyer describes how skilled workers, fearful of mechanization, worked to develop a robust union in the 1930s. He details the battle for unionization among the more militant CIO, the conservative AFL, Communists, and Allis-Chalmers management officials. Meyer tells us about several of the key players in this battle--Harold Story, the Allis-Chalmers vice president and chief labor strategist, and Harold Christoffel, the electrical worker who became the powerful first president of the union. Meyer also analyzes the technical and social transition from batch to mass production, the social and cultural world of the ordinary workers at the workplace, and the factional struggles on the shop floor and picket line. He concludes by examining the CIO's entry into Wisconsin politics, the subsequent campaign against union leftists, the rise of Joseph McCarthy, the consolidation of Walter Reuther's position as UAW president, and the passage of the Taft-Hartley law.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1j9kQgAACAAJ&dq=Stalin+over+Wisconsin:+The+Making+and+Unmaking+of+Militant+Unionism,+1900-1950+(Class+and+Culture+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fringe Banking: Check-Cashing Outlets, Pawnshops and the Poor","description":"\\"Cogently argued, fills an important gap in the literature, and is accessible to undergraduates.\\"  Choice \\"Dismantles the mythology surrounding pawnshops and check-cashing outlets, and demonstrates that they are no longer on the fringe of our financial system but integral to it.\\" San Francisco Bay Guardian In today's world of electronic cash transfers, automated teller machines, and credit cards, the image of the musty, junk-laden pawnshop seems a relic of the past. But it is not. The 1980s witnessed a tremendous boom in pawnbroking. There are now more pawnshops thanever before in U.S. history, and they are found not only in large cities but in towns and suburbs throughout the nation. As John Caskey demonstrates in Fringe Banking, the increased public patronage of both pawnshops and commercial check-cashing outlets signals the growing number of American households now living on a cash-only basis, with no connection to any mainstream credit facilities or banking services. Fringe Banking is the first comprehensive study of pawnshops and check-cashing outlets, profiling their operations, customers, and recent growth from family-owned shops to such successful outlet chains as Cash American and ACE America's Cash Express. It explains why, despite interest rates and fees substantially higher than those of banks, their use has so dramatically increased. According to Caskey, declining family earnings, changing family structures, a growing immigrant population, and lack of household budgeting skills has greatly reduced the demand for bank deposit services among millions of Americans. In addition, banks responded to 1980s regulatory changes by increasing fees on deposit accounts with small balances and closing branches in many poor urban areas. These factors combined to leave many low- and moderate-income families without access to checking privileges, credit services, and bank loans. Pawnshops and check-cashing outlets provide such families with essential financial services thay cannot obtain elsewhere. Caskey notes that fringe banks, particularly check-cashing outlets, are also utilized by families who could participate in the formal banking system, but are willing to pay more for convenience and quick access to cash. Caskey argues that, contrary to their historical reputation as predators milking the poor and desperate, pawnshops and check-cashing outlets play a key financial role for disadvantaged groups. Citing the inconsistent and often unenforced state laws currently governing the industry, Fringe Banking challenges policy makers to design regulations that will allow fringe banks to remain profitable without exploiting the customers who depend on them.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eeOFAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arts and Culture: An Introduction to the Humanities, Combined (Reprint)","description":"For one or two semester/quarter courses on Introduction to the Humanities or Cultural Studies.

This landmark study is the first to examine analytically the nature of the opportunities that entrepreneurs pursue, the problems they face, the traits they require, and the social and economic contributions they make. Until recently, entrepreneurs have been largely ignored in modern economic theory. But at the dawn of a networked age, marked by the advent of e-business and the home office, there's no question that entrepreneurs have recaptured the popular imagination. Studies now show that most men and women dream of starting their own businesses rather than rising through the corporate ranks. Yet in spite of increased attention by many of today's leading business schools, entrepreneurship has remained largely a mystery, an apparently intuitive sense of values possessed by certain individuals.; This book targets the issues central to successful start-up ventures, such as endowments and opportunities, planning versus adaptation, securing resources, corporate initiatives, venture capital, revolutionary ventures and the evolution of fledgling businesses. Focusing on hard data and evaluations of numerous start-up businesses, including many of today's major industry leaders, this book presents a new economic model-a key to understanding the guts, determination, luck and skills that constitute the underpinnings of corporate success. Written in clear, concise prose, The Origin and Evolution of New Businesses goes behind the charts and graphs of business theory to the true heart of success. It is essential reading for business students, would-be entrepreneurs, or executives wanting to incorporate the vitality of the entrepreneurial spirit into their organization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RovLGDtrjcEC&dq=The+Origin+and+Evolution+of+New+Businesses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Insight Guides Malta (Insight Guide Malta)","description":"There's so much to see and do in Malta: from the Unesco World Heritage Site of Valetta; to the deep blue lagoon on the uninhabited island of Comino; to the ancient Ggantija temples, which date back to 3,600BC.

A Welsh Benedictine monk living at Shrewsbury Abbey in western England, Brother Cadfael spends much of his time tending the herbs and vegetables in the garden but now there s a more pressing matter. Cadfael is to serve as translator for a group of monks heading to the town of Gwytherin in Wales. The team s goal is to collect the holy remains of Saint Winifred, which Prior Robert hopes will boost the abbey s reputation, as well as his own. But when the monks arrive in Gwytherin, the town is divided over the request. When the leading opponent to disturbing the grave is found shot dead with a mysterious arrow, some believe Saint Winifred herself delivered the deadly blow.

Following a teacher, textbook or language course is not enough. They show you the characters, words and grammar you need to become proficient in Chinese, but they don't teach you how to learn them! Regardless of what program you're in (if any), you need to take responsibility for your own learning. If you don't, you will miss many important things that aren't included in the course you're taking. If you study on your own, you need to be even more aware of what you need to do, what you're doing at the moment and the difference between them. Here are some of the questions I have asked and have since been asked many times by students: How do I learn characters efficiently? How do I get the most out of my course or teacher? Which are the best learning tools and resources? How can I become fluent in Mandarin? How can I improve my pronunciation? How do I learn successfully on my own? How can I motivate myself to study more? How can I fit learning Chinese into a busy schedule? The answers I've found to these questions and many others form the core of this book. It took eight years of learning, researching, teaching and writing to figure these things out. Not everybody has the time to do that! I can't go back in time and help myself learn in a better way, but I can help you! This book is meant for normal students and independent language learners alike. While it covers all major areas of learning, you won't learn Chinese just by reading this book. It's like when someone on TV teaches you how to cook: you won't get to eat the delicious dish just by watching the program; you have to do the cooking yourself. That's true for this book as well. When you apply what you learn, it will boost your learning, making every hour you spend count for more, but you still have to do the learning yourself. This is what a few readers have said about the book: \\"The book had me nodding at a heap of things I'd learnt the hard way, wishing I knew them when I started, as well as highlighting areas that I'm currently missing in my study.\\" - Geoff van der Meer, VP engineering \\"This publication is like a bible for anyone serious about Chinese proficiency. It's easy for anyone to read and written with scientific precision.\\" - Zachary Danz, foreign teacher, children's theatre artist About me I started learning Chinese when I was 23 (that's more than eight years ago now) and have since studied in many different situations, including serious immersion programs abroad, high-intensity programs in Sweden, online courses, as well as on the side while working or studying other things. I have also successfully used my Chinese in a graduate program for teaching Chinese as a second language, taught entirely in Chinese mostly for native speakers (the Graduate Institute for Teaching Chinese as a Second Language at National Taiwan Normal University). All these parts have contributed to my website, Hacking Chinese, where I write regularly about how to learn Mandarin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xAK3DAEACAAJ&dq=Learn+to+Write+Chinese+Characters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Chalk Doll","description":"Rose has a cold.

The prospect of teaching writing to a classroom full of students some who speak English and some who don't, can be overwhelming. When students learning English are at different levels, the task is even more challenging.

Writing Sense outlines the classroom conditions necessary for successful writing instruction with English language learners, whether in writing workshop and/or small-group instruction. It includes 68 classroom-tested lessons for grades K8 that show kids at all levels of language acquisition how to make connections, ask questions, visualize (make mental images), infer, determine importance, synthesize, monitor meaning and comprehension, and use fix-up strategies. Like the authors' earlier book, Making Sense, the five main sections are geared to the stages of language proficiency, and lessons are divided into  younger  and  older  students, spanning kindergarten through to grade eight. There are extensive lists of suggested books for mentor texts as well as lists of mentor authors to facilitate teachers' planning and instruction.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-ebSdpGPOD0C&dq=WRITING+SENSE&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Russell Square Park: a true love story","description":"Having recently relocated from Chicago to Los Angeles with a new husband and her first love's daughter, Susan is thousands of miles away from home.

Upon investigating his murder, Susan learns more about herself than she'd realized possible, and thus is finally able to let go of some of the pain that has haunted her for over twenty years.

The Economist ? The Christian Science Monitor ? Bloomberg Businessweek ? The Globe and Mail From the bestselling and award-winning author of Paris 1919 comes a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, a fascinating portrait of Europe from 1900 up to the outbreak of World War I. The century since the end of the Napoleonic wars had been the most peaceful era Europe had known since the fall of the Roman Empire. In the first years of the twentieth century, Europe believed it was marching to a golden, happy, and prosperous future. But instead, complex personalities and rivalries, colonialism and ethnic nationalisms, and shifting alliances helped to bring about the failure of the long peace and the outbreak of a war that transformed Europe and the world. The War That Ended Peace brings vividly to life the military leaders, politicians, diplomats, bankers, and the extended, interrelated family of crowned heads across Europe who failed to stop the descent into war: in Germany, the mercurial Kaiser Wilhelm II and the chief of the German general staff, Von Moltke the Younger; in Austria-Hungary, Emperor Franz Joseph, a man who tried, through sheer hard work, to stave off the coming chaos in his empire; in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife; in Britain, King Edward VII, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and British admiral Jacky Fisher, the fierce advocate of naval reform who entered into the arms race with Germany that pushed the continent toward confrontation on land and sea. There are the would-be peacemakers as well, among them prophets of the horrors of future wars whose warnings went unheeded: Alfred Nobel, who donated his fortune to the cause of international understanding, and Bertha von Suttner, a writer and activist who was the first woman awarded Nobel s new Peace Prize. Here too we meet the urbane and cosmopolitan Count Harry Kessler, who noticed many of the early signs that something was stirring in Europe; the young Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and a rising figure in British politics; Madame Caillaux, who shot a man who might have been a force for peace; and more. With indelible portraits, MacMillan shows how the fateful decisions of a few powerful people changed the course of history. Taut, suspenseful, and impossible to put down, The War That Ended Peace is also a wise cautionary reminder of how wars happen in spite of the near-universal desire to keep the peace. Destined to become a classic in the tradition of Barbara Tuchman s The Guns of August, The War That Ended Peace enriches our understanding of one of the defining periods and events of the twentieth century. Praise for The War That Ended Peace  Magnificent . . . The War That Ended Peace will certainly rank among the best books of the centennial crop.  The Economist  Superb.  The New York Times Book Review  Masterly . . . marvelous . . . Those looking to understand why World War I happened will have a hard time finding a better place to start.

Welcome to Blackwood Farm: soaring white columns, spacious drawing rooms, bright, sun-drenched gardens, and a dark strip of the dense Sugar Devil Swamp. This is the world of Quinn Blackwood, a brilliant young man haunted since birth by a mysterious doppelg?nger,  Goblin,  a spirit from a dream world that Quinn can t escape and that prevents him from belonging anywhere. When Quinn is made a Vampire, losing all that is rightfully his and gaining an unwanted immortality, his doppelg?nger becomes even more vampiric and terrifying than Quinn himself. As the novel moves backwards and forwards in time, from Quinn s boyhood on Blackwood Farm to present day New Orleans, from ancient Athens to 19th-century Naples, Quinn seeks out the legendary Vampire Lestat in the hope of freeing himself from the spectre that draws him inexorably back to Sugar Devil Swamp and the explosive secrets it holds. A story of youth and promise, of loss and the search for love, of secrets and destiny, Blackwood Farm is Anne Rice at her mesmerizing best.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=j-B-z19WFl8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Recovering from the War: A Woman's Guide to Helping Your Vietnam Vet, Your Family, and Yourself","description":"Patience Mason, the wife of a Vietnam veteran herself, has written this book for the thousands of families trying to recover from the Vietnam War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q6pDtAEACAAJ&dq=Recovering+from+the+War:+A+Woman%27s+Guide+to+Helping+Your+Vietnam+Vet,+Your+Family,+and+Yourself&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Surrender on Cebu: A POW's Diary--WWII","description":"A series of accounts from May 1941 to October 1945 describing Bill Miner's service on the island of Cebu and his subsequent capture and imprisonment by Japanese forces.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DKK7YhXscAIC&dq=Surrender+on+Cebu:+A+POW%27s+Diary--WWII&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down Home Ways: Old-Fangled Skills for Making Hundreds of Simple, Useful Things","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"How to Get Started in the Real Estate Appraisal Business","description":"Your step-by-step guide success as a real estate appraiser Real estate appraisers are in high demand and top earners can make a bundle.

Huge commercial databases track you finances and sell that information to anyone willing to pay. Host sites on the World Wide Web record every page you view, and  smart  toll roads know where you drive. Every day, new technology nibbles at our privacy.Does that make you nervous? David Brin is worried, but not just about privacy. He fears that society will overreact to these technologies by restricting the flow of information, frantically enforcing a reign of secrecy. Such measures, he warns, won't really preserve our privacy. Governments, the wealthy, criminals, and the techno-elite will still find ways to watch us. But we'll have fewer ways to watch them. We'll lose the key to a free society: accountability.The Transparent Society is a call for  reciprocal transparency.  If police cameras watch us, shouldn't we be able to watch police stations? If credit bureaus sell our data, shouldn't we know who buys it? Rather than cling to an illusion of anonymity-a historical anomaly, given our origins in close-knit villages-we should focus on guarding the most important forms of privacy and preserving mutual accountability. The biggest threat to our freedom, Brin warns, is that surveillance technology will be used by too few people, now by too many.A society of glass houses may seem too fragile. Fearing technology-aided crime, governments seek to restrict online anonymity; fearing technology-aided tyranny, citizens call for encrypting all data. Brins shows how, contrary to both approaches, windows offer us much better protection than walls; after all, the strongest deterrent against snooping has always been the fear of being spotted. Furthermore, Brin argues, Western culture now encourages eccentricity-we're programmed to rebel! That gives our society a natural protection against error and wrong-doing, like a body's immune system. But  social T-cells  need openness to spot trouble and get the word out. The Transparent Society is full of such provocative and far-reaching analysis.The inescapable rush of technology is forcing us to make new choices about how we want to live. This daring book reminds us that an open society is more robust and flexible than one where secrecy reigns. In an era of gnat-sized cameras, universal databases, and clothes-penetrating radar, it will be more vital than ever for us to be able to watch the watchers. With reciprocal transparency we can detect dangers early and expose wrong-doers. We can gauge the credibility of pundits and politicians. We can share technological advances and news. But all of these benefits depend on the free, two-way flow of information.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oNiK0ROYmbIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Photocraft: Cool Things to Do with the Pictures You Love","description":"Presents more than forty simple, stylish, and affordable ideas for transforming simple photos into attractive keepsakes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=i6C6zQEACAAJ&dq=Photocraft:+Cool+Things+to+Do+with+the+Pictures+You+Love&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"System Safety Engineering and Management","description":"Comprehensive in scope, it describes the process of system safety--from the creation and management of a safety program on a system under development to the analysis that must be performed as this system is designed and produced to assure acceptable risk in its operation.

Man has created codes to keep secrets and has broken codes to learn those secrets since the time of the Pharaohs. For 4,000 years, fierce battles have been waged between codemakers and codebreakers, and the story of these battles is civilization's secret history, the hidden account of how wars were won and lost, diplomatic intrigues foiled, business secrets stolen, governments ruined, computers hacked. From the XYZ Affair to the Dreyfus Affair, from the Gallic War to the Persian Gulf, from Druidic runes and the kaballah to outer space, from the Zimmermann telegram to Enigma to the Manhattan Project, codebreaking has shaped the course of human events to an extent beyond any easy reckoning. Once a government monopoly, cryptology today touches everybody. It secures the Internet, keeps e-mail private, maintains the integrity of cash machine transactions, and scrambles TV signals on unpaid-for channels. David Kahn's The Codebreakers takes the measure of what codes and codebreaking have meant in human history in a single comprehensive account, astonishing in its scope and enthralling in its execution. Hailed upon first publication as a book likely to become the definitive work of its kind, The Codebreakers has more than lived up to that prediction: it remains unsurpassed. With a brilliant new chapter that makes use of previously classified documents to bring the book thoroughly up to date, and to explore the myriad ways computer codes and their hackers are changing all of our lives, The Codebreakers is the skeleton key to a thousand thrilling true stories of intrigue, mystery, and adventure. It is a masterpiece of the historian's art.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3S8rhOEmDIIC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Pocket Guide Thesaurus (Barron's Pocket Guides)","description":"Unlike many another thesaurus with complicated and difficult-to-locate word arrangements, this book of words and their synonyms has been arranged in an easy-to-follow alphabetical format.

But that call to write is often at odds with the realities of publishing and the commercial needs of publishers. Many writers feel they lack the knowledge and experience to cut through the red tape of the publishing industry. In Spiritual Writing, writer and literary agent Deborah Levine Herman and publisher Cynthia Black demystify the process and show writers how to create a book that both remains true to their vision and still conforms to the protocols of the publishing industry. Written with the intention of guiding and informing writers on their journey to publication, the book includes journaling exercises, tips on finding an agent and publisher, guidelines for writing query letters and proposals, a glossary of industry terms, and a comprehensive database that provides specifics on ''spirit-friendly'' publishers and agents. Friendly, humorous, and practical in tone, Spiritual Writing is much more than a ''how-to'' manual. It is also a captivating and motivating look at the spiritual life and the inspirational call to share one's peace joy, and wisdom with the world in writing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WvotzwEACAAJ&dq=Spiritual+Writing:+From+Inspiration+To+Publication&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salt-Water Moon","description":"David French's timeless dramas about the Mercer family have touched audiences worldwide.

(Countdown, No. 12)","description":"The NFL is the most popular professional sports league in the United States. Its athletes receive multimillion-dollar contracts and almost endless media attention. The league's most important game, the Super Bowl, is practically a national holiday. Making it to the NFL, however, is not about the promised land of fame and fortune. Robert W. Turner II draws on his personal experience as a former professional football player as well as interviews with more than 140 current and former NFL players to reveal what it means to be an athlete in the NFL and explain why so many players struggle with life after football. Without guaranteed contracts, the majority of players are forced out of the league after a few seasons. Over three-quarters of retirees experience bankruptcy or financial ruin, two-thirds live with chronic pain, and too many find themselves on the wrong side of the law. Robert W. Turner II argues that the fall from grace of so many players is no accident. The NFL, he contends, powerfully determines their experiences in and out of the league. The labor agreement provides little job security and few health and retirement benefits, and the owners refuse to share power with the players, making change difficult. And the process of becoming an elite football player--from high school to college and through the pros--leaves athletes with few marketable skills and little preparation for their first Sunday off the field. With compassion and objectivity, Not for Long reveals the life and mind of high school, college, and NFL athletes, shedding light on what might best help players transition successfully out of the sport.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Jv9eDwAAQBAJ&dq=December:+Time%27s+Up!+(Countdown,+No.+12)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Free Will (Oxford Readings in Philosophy)","description":"The new edition of this highly successful text will once again provide the ideal introduction to free will.

His characters are the people who live there--the priest, the whore, the doctor, the seamstress, the mayor--and the occasional animal: a centaur, a parrot that recites Homer, a horse called History. Their lives intersect, as lives do in a small place, and they know each other's secrets: the hidden crimes, the mysteries, the little infamies that men commit. Karnezis observes his villagers with a worldly eye, and creates a place where magic invariably loses out to harsh reality, a place full of passion, cruelty, and deep reserves of black humor. These stories recall the masters of the form--the wit and sophisticated playfulness of Saki and the primal fatalism of Prosper Merimee--but they are utterly original and prove that Karnezis is one of the freshest new voices in English fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vxbgrGdrqAEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gradual failure: The air war over North Vietnam, 1965-1966 (The United States Air Force in Southeast Asia)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Lk6CdTcReLgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of the World, The Pelican","description":"Rev. ed. of: The Hutchinson history of the world. 1976.

His secret will fuel him, and get him all the way through the game; he's sure of it. But what he doesn't know is that he's not the only one with a secret. Everyone has something to play for. For Heather and Dodge, the game will bring new alliances, unexpected revelations, and the possibility of first love for each of them and the knowledge that sometimes the very things we fear are those we need the most.

From the earliest days of the war in 1950 through the harrowing battles of 1951 and on into the so-called stalemate period of the hill battles of 1952 and 1953, into the final climactic battles before the cease fire, the Forward Observer, or FO, was there. Korea was and is known as the Artillery War because more rounds were fired in Korea than in all of WWII, and it was the job of the FO to direct these rounds onto their targets. FOs are the eyes of the artillery, and the importance of their job in Korea has been largely overlooked until now. Serving as infantrymen, but not being considered one, Forward Observers lived, ate and slept on the front lines, ever ready to respond to an attack, or defend friendly troops and positions, and sometimes losing their lives doing it. The awesome responsibility and firepower that was placed on a 22 or 23 year-old lieutenant or sergeant was staggering, and after reading these first hand accounts, one can easily imagine what these young men faced on a daily basis. With over 100 interviews of Forward Observers, from all time periods and from all locations and battles of the war, the grittiness and reality of what these servicemen went through in the Forgotten War is brought to life so that their deeds may be remembered for future generations, so the battlefield known as Korea and its veterans will not be forgotten any more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_cEQ_NpbIUMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Good Gifts from the Home: Jams, Jellies & Preserves: Make Beautiful Gifts to Give (or Keep)","description":"Including more than fifty extraordinary, yet easy-to-follow recipes, \\"Jams, Jellies & Preserves invites you to share deliciously sweet and tangy gifts made in your own kitchen from fresh, natural ingredients.

In that year a Finneyite revivalist, John Winebrenner, had led a breakaway movement from the German Reformed Church to form a new denomination, the so-called Church of God.

In \\"real life,\\" as a respected criminal lawyer, he has been involved with the death penalty for more than a decade, including successfully representing two different men convicted in death-penalty prosecutions. In this vivid account of how his views on the death penalty have evolved, Turow describes his own experiences with capital punishment from his days as an impassioned young prosecutor to his recent service on the Illinois commission which investigated the administration of the death penalty and influenced Governor George Ryan's unprecedented commutation of the sentences of 164 death row inmates on his last day in office. Along the way, he provides a brief history of America's ambivalent relationship with the ultimate punishment, analyzes the potent reasons for and against it, including the role of the victims' survivors, and tells the powerful stories behind the statistics, as he moves from the Governor's Mansion to Illinois' state-of-the art 'super-max' prison and the execution chamber. Ultimate Punishment, this gripping, clear-sighted, necessary examination of the principles, the personalities, and the politics of a fundamental dilemma of our democracy has all the drama and intellectual substance of Turow's celebrated fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=E7n1OWEY3CgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of a brigade of South Carolinians, first known as \\"Gregg's\\" and subsequently as \\"McGowan's Brigade\\" (Civil War heritage series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P3s6zQEACAAJ&dq=The+history+of+a+brigade+of+South+Carolinians,+first+known+as+%22Gregg%27s%22+and+subsequently+as+%22McGowan%27s+Brigade%22+(Civil+War+heritage+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optimal Control Theory with Economic Applications (Advanced Textbooks in Economics)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Affirming Diversity: The Sociopolitical Context of Multicultural Education, Fourth Edition","description":"Use a sociopolitical context to explore the meaning, necessity, and benefits of multicultural education Effective multicultural education must consider not just schooling, but also the larger social, economic, and political factors that affect students' success or failure in the classroom.

It illustrates the application of soil physics to practical problems relevant to the characterization and monitoring of the vadose zone. It includes an introduction to physical processes, including basic flow theory, and provides examples of important field-scale processes that must be recognizable by hydrogeologists. Considerable attention is given to the concepts of recharge, including how it is most accurately evaluated in the vadose zone. Field and laboratory methods for characterizing hydraulic properties in the vadose zone are also covered, and case studies illustrating these methods are provided. New and emerging technologies for monitoring the vadose zone, particularly for the purpose of detecting contaminants, are highlighted. In the last section of the book, additional case studies are presented, demonstrating applications related to seepage detection, landfill monitoring, and soil gas investigations. This book is written from the perspective of hydrogeologists and is designed to be directly applicable and to maintain continuity and consistency between chapters. It will be an invaluable primer for environmental or geotechnical consultants, regulators, or students who have no prior formal academic training in unsaturated flow concepts. Because the text contains some of the latest advances in this field, it will be an excellent reference for geologists and engineers currently working on problems of vadose zone hydrology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iPlKDwAAQBAJ&dq=Vadose+Zone+Hydrology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anglo-Saxons","description":"In this major survey, three distinguished historians produce an exciting introduction to the field.

It gained widespread recognition when it was applied to the theoretical study of economics by von Neumann and Morgenstern in Theory of Games and Economic Behavior in the 1940s. The later bestowal in 1994 of the Nobel Prize in economics on Nash underscores the important role this theory has played in the intellectual life of the twentieth century. This volume is based on courses given by the author at the University of Kansas. The exposition is \`\`gentle'' because it requires only some knowledge of coordinate geometry; linear programming is not used. It is \`\`mathematical'' because it is more concerned with the mathematical solution of games than with their applications. Existing textbooks on the topic tend to focus either on the applications or on the mathematics at a level that makes the works inaccessible to most non-mathematicians. This book nicely fits in between these two alternatives. It discusses examples and completely solves them with tools that require no more than high school algebra. In this text, proofs are provided for both von Neumann's Minimax Theorem and the existence of the Nash Equilibrium in the $2 \\\\times 2$ case. Readers will gain both a sense of the range of applications and a better understanding of the theoretical framework of these two deep mathematical concepts.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8doVBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Introduction to Windows '98 Programming","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Curriculum and Aims (Thinking about Education Series)","description":"The revised fourth edition provides a broad perspective on the basic curriculum questions educators face regarding the purposes, content, design, and structure of educational programs.

Elsewhere, a jealous husband pursues his adulterous wife through the streets of Paris, a forbidden book subverts an authoritarian state, a TV crew get considerably more than they bargained for, and a lesbian community in uproar is described with wry humour and tenderness. 'Witty, wholly contemporary, the narrative moves easily over a wide range of material.

Readers learn ten scientific principles they can use to avoid triggering fear and panic in their partners, manage their partners' emotional reactions when they do become upset, and recognize when the brain's threat response is hindering their ability to act in a loving way. By learning to use simple gestures and words, readers can learn to put out emotional fires and help their partners feel more safe and secure. The no-fault view of conflict in this book encourages readers to move past a \\"\\"warring brain\\"\\" mentality and toward a more cooperative \\"\\"loving brain\\"\\" understanding of the relationship. Based in the sound science of neurobiology, attachment theory, and emotion regulation research, this book is essential reading for couples and others interested in understanding the complex dynamics at work behind love and trust in intimate relationships.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=e0MD9NJ05DMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I Married Adventure: the Lives of Martin and Osa Johnson (Kodansha Globe)","description":"This classic, bestselling memoir tells of the often heart-stopping adventures of early 20th-century explorers and photographers Osa and Martin Johnson - now in a new edition featuring additional photos and personal letters from the Johnsons to friends and family.

Recent trends in the travel industry emphasize the appeal of vacations for voluntary identity changes when bankers can become bikers for a week or when  Momcations  allow mothers to leave their families behind. But how do our vacations allow us to shape our identity? Getting Away from It All is a study of individuality and flexibility and the intersection of self-definition and social constraint. Karen Stein interviews vacationers about their travels and down time, focusing on  identity transitions.  She shows how objects, settings, temporal environments and social interactions limit or facilitate identity shifts, and how we arrange our vacations to achieve the shifts we desire. Stein also looks at the behavior, values, attitudes, and worldview of individuals to illuminate how people engage in either identity work or identity play. Vacations say a lot about individuals. They signal class and economic standing and reveal aspirations and goals. Getting Away from It All insists that vacations are about more than just taking time off to relax and rejuvenate they are about having some time to work on the person one wants to be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ifaVDwAAQBAJ&dq=Away+From+It+All&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Weave Me a Song","description":"\\"Weaving has always been vital to Gram's life, the way she expressed the song in her soul, and she has become a respected artist in her later years.

This little-known novella from one of the masters of the form is so unusual for Joseph Conrad's work in several respects, although not in its exotic maritime setting or its even more exotic prose it is unusual in that it is one of his very few works to feature a woman as a leading character, and to take the form of a romance. Still, it's a Conradian romance: a sweeping saga set in the Indian Ocean basin, against a turbulent background of barely suppressed hostilities between Dutch and British merchant navies, told by one of Conrad's classically detached narrators. In the end, the unique perspective of the sharply etched character of Freya is one of Conrad's most piercing studies of how the lust for power can drive men to greatness or its opposite. The Art of The Novella Series Too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story, the novella is generally unrecognized by academics and publishers. Nonetheless, it is a form beloved and practiced by literature's greatest writers. In the Art Of The Novella series, Melville House celebrates this renegade art form and its practitioners with titles that are, in many instances, presented in book form for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6cNvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Freya+of+the+Seven+Isles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Understanding Urban Unrest: From Reverend King to Rodney King","description":"Mob violence - often an interracial expression of the urban poverty found in major cities in the United States - is a phenomenon that has plagued this country repeatedly in the twentieth century. From Reverend King to Rodney King, historical figures and incidents have shed new light on circumstances that bring about violence and the political context in which federal policy responds to the seemingly intractable social and economic problems that underlie the violence. In Understanding Urban Unrest, author Dennis E. Gale compares the federal programs that have been tested since 1966 and makes observations about the probable political response to urban interracial violence and poverty in the future. In addition, he contends that place-based patchwork policies are not effective and that only fundamental changes in the United States's economic structure and federal policy agenda can offer any real solutions for the nation's cities and its poor.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=x4y7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Understanding+Urban+Unrest:+From+Reverend+King+to+Rodney+King&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Queen's Gambit","description":"The basis for the hit Netflix series!

Public health saved your life today you just don t know it,  is a phrase that Dr. Leana Wen likes to use. You don t know it because good public health is invisible. It becomes visible only in its absence, when it is underfunded and ignored, a bitter truth laid bare as never before by the devastation of COVID-19. Leana Wen emergency physician, former Baltimore health commissioner, CNN medical analyst, and Washington Post contributing columnist has lived on the front lines of public health, leading the fight against the opioid epidemic, outbreaks of infectious disease, maternal and infant mortality, and COVID-19 disinformation. Here, in gripping detail, Wen lays bare the lifesaving work of public health and its innovative approach to social ills, treating gun violence as a contagious disease, for example, and racism as a threat to health. Wen also tells her own uniquely American story: an immigrant from China, she and her family received food stamps and were at times homeless despite her parents working multiple jobs. That child went on to attend college at thirteen, become a Rhodes scholar, and turn to public health as the way to make a difference in the country that had offered her such possibilities. Ultimately, she insists, it is public health that ensures citizens are not robbed of decades of life, and that where children live does not determine whether they live.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=AfT4DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Murder in the Bastille","description":"When a woman wearing an identical jacket to Aim e Leduc's leaves her cell phone on a restaurant table, Aimee follows her to return it, only to be attacked and left blind, discovering that the other woman had been murdered.

Gilchrist has a distinctive ear for language, and a deep understanding of her flawed, sometimes tragic characters. These fourteen stories, divided into three sections -- There's a Garden of Eden, Things Like the Truth, and Perils of the Nile -- are about mostly young, upper-class Southern women who are bored with the Junior League and having babies, and chafe against the restrictions of their sheltered lives. Talented and bright, but living in the shadow of men -- their husbands and fathers -- they resort to outrageous actions in pursuit of freer lives and uncompromised love, despite the consequences. This collection first introduced readers to some of Gilchrist's most beloved characters, such as Rhoda Manning and Nora Jane Whittington. PRAISE: \\"It's difficult to review a first book as good as this one without resorting to every known superlative clich ...Gilchrist is the real thing.\\"  Washington Post  A sustained display of delicately and rhythmically modulated prose and an unsentimental dissection of raw sentiment.

Though Flight to Canada has been classified by some as a  post race  novel, the villains and the heroes are clear. Three slaves are on the run from the Swille plantation. Among them, the most hotly pursued is Raven Quickskill, a poet who seeks freedom in Canada, and ultimately hopes to return and liberate others. But this particular Civil Warera landscape is littered with modern elements, from Xerox copiers to airplanes, and freely reimagines historic figures as sacred as Abraham Lincoln. A comedy flashing with insight, Flight to Canada poses serious questions about history and the complex ways that race relations in America are shaped by the past.

However, they are often constrained by lack of adequate resources, sound policies, and national support. It is clear that change and advancements, both systematic and scientific, are needed in a number of forensic science disciplines to ensure the reliability of work, establish enforceable standards, and promote best practices with consistent application. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States: A Path Forward provides a detailed plan for addressing these needs and suggests the creation of a new government entity, the National Institute of Forensic Science, to establish and enforce standards within the forensic science community. The benefits of improving and regulating the forensic science disciplines are clear: assisting law enforcement officials, enhancing homeland security, and reducing the risk of wrongful conviction and exoneration. Strengthening Forensic Science in the United States gives a full account of what is needed to advance the forensic science disciplines, including upgrading of systems and organizational structures, better training, widespread adoption of uniform and enforceable best practices, and mandatory certification and accreditation programs. While this book provides an essential call-to-action for congress and policy makers, it also serves as a vital tool for law enforcement agencies, criminal prosecutors and attorneys, and forensic science educators.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4VH5FhgTXxoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Help Your Child Excel in Math","description":"Offers suggestions for parents on helping their child learn how to do math","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tzFGXWPLcQ0C&dq=How+to+Help+Your+Child+Excel+in+Math&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tessa","description":"Is there no way out?

Yet their very complexity makes it increasingly difficult to produce efficient code and to realize their full potential. This landmark text from two leaders in the field focuses on the pivotal role that compilers can play in addressing this critical issue. The basis for all the methods presented in this book is data dependence, a fundamental compiler analysis tool for optimizing programs on high-performance microprocessors and parallel architectures. It enables compiler designers to write compilers that automatically transform simple, sequential programs into forms that can exploit special features of these modern architectures. The text provides a broad introduction to data dependence, to the many transformation strategies it supports, and to its applications to important optimization problems such as parallelization, compiler memory hierarchy management, and instruction scheduling. The authors demonstrate the importance and wide applicability of dependence-based compiler optimizations and give the compiler writer the basics needed to understand and implement them. They also offer cookbook explanations for transforming applications by hand to computational scientists and engineers who are driven to obtain the best possible performance of their complex applications. The approaches presented are based on research conducted over the past two decades, emphasizing the strategies implemented in research prototypes at Rice University and in several associated commercial systems. Randy Allen and Ken Kennedy have provided an indispensable resource for researchers, practicing professionals, and graduate students engaged in designing and optimizing compilers for modern computer architectures. * Offers a guide to the simple, practical algorithms and approaches that are most effective in real-world, high-performance microprocessor and parallel systems. * Demonstrates each transformation in worked examples. * Examines how two case study compilers implement the theories and practices described in each chapter. * Presents the most complete treatment of memory hierarchy issues of any compiler text. * Illustrates ordering relationships with dependence graphs throughout the book. * Applies the techniques to a variety of languages, including Fortran 77, C, hardware definition languages, Fortran 90, and High Performance Fortran. * Provides extensive references to the most sophisticated algorithms known in research.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=X1QfogEACAAJ&dq=Optimizing+Compilers+for+Modern+Architectures:+A+Dependence-based+Approach&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Builders of the Old World (History on the march)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Authentic Log Homes: Restored Timbers For Today's Homesteads","description":"Each gorgeous log home shown here was built with reclaimed timbers that were hand-hewn at least a century ago.

He was just a frustrated man who sat down one day with pen in his hand and some tough questions in his heart. As he wrote his questions to God, he realized that God was answering them directly through Walsch s pen. And the result was a series of witty, provocative, and profound books that have changed the lives of readers around the world.

In Conversations with God 2, Neale Donald Walsch and God continue their discussion and move on to larger topics than the personal issues addressed in Conversation with God 1. The pair discusses time, space, and politics. It is an honest look at some of the broad issues important to all of us on the planet. Conversations with God 3, the final book of the original three-book series, contains  universal truths of the highest order, and the challenges and opportunities of the soul.  In this volume, the dialogue expands to include more about the nature of God, about love and fear, about who we are and who we may become.

S. Naipaul, and Salman Rushdie have charted the perpetually drawn and perpetually blurred boundaries of identity left in the wake of British imperialism. Arguing against a model of cultural identity based on race, Gorra begins with Scott's portrait, in The Raj Quartet, of the character Hari Kumar a seeming oxymoron, an \\"English boy with a dark brown skin,\\" whose very existence undercuts the belief in an absolute distinction between England and India. He then turns to the opposed figures of Naipaul and Rushdie, the two great novelists of the Indian diaspora. Whereas Naipaul's long and controversial career maps the \\"deep disorder\\" spread by both imperialism and its passing, Rushdie demonstrates that certain consequences of that disorder, such as migrancy and mimicry, have themselves become creative forces. After Empire provides engaging and enlightening readings of postcolonial fiction, showing how imperialism helped shape British national identity and how, after the end of empire, that identity must now be reconfigured.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9m6PteVNcPAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Teenagers from Mars","description":"Max is a grave-robbing 13-year-old who gathers relics to pawn for comic book money.

Embracing the traditional values and techniques of the old masters, particularly Rembrandt and Caravaggio, Nerdrum creates a mythic Nordic world of barren landscapes populated with what appear to be lonely survivors of a lost civilization. His constant theme is that of estrangement -- of man from the world, from his fellows, from himself. Nerdrum repeatedly portrays a longing for reconciliation that can only be described as religious in intensity. A dual strangeness pervades these graphic works. Executed for the most part between 1985 and 1993, they reveal a desolate view of the human situation which the sumptuousness of their execution subtly contradicts. This coupling of a forlorn vision with a paradoxical faith in technical virtuosity and artistic tradition stems from his rejection of modernism, both as a style and as a progressive creed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3RRQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Odd+Nerdrum:+The+Drawings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Food FAQs: Substitutions, Yields & Equivalents","description":"Everyday, novice and experienced cooks confront such questions as How many onions must I chop to get 2 cups? and I dont have any sour cream --what can I use instead?

In our multiethnic world, questions of individual identity are becoming increasingly unclear. Now in ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN bestselling author Jon Entine vividly brings to life the profound human implications of the Age of Genetics while illuminating one of today's most controversial topics: the connection between genetics and who we are, and specifically the question \\"Who is a Jew?\\" Entine weaves a fascinating narrative, using breakthroughs in genetic genealogy to reconstruct the Jewish biblical tradition of the chosen people and the hereditary Israelite priestly caste of Cohanim. Synagogues in the mountains of India and China and Catholic churches with a Jewish identity in New Mexico and Colorado provide different patterns of connection within the tangled history of the Jewish diaspora. Legendary accounts of the Hebrew lineage of Ethiopian tribesmen, the building of Africa's Great Zimbabwe fortress, and even the so-called Lost Tribes are reexamined in light of advanced DNA technology. Entine also reveals the shared ancestry of Israelites and Christians. As people from across the world discover their Israelite roots, their riveting stories unveil exciting new approaches to defining one's identity. Not least, Entine addresses possible connections between DNA and Jewish intelligence and the controversial notion that Jews are a \\"race apart.\\" ABRAHAM'S CHILDREN is a compelling reinterpretation of biblical history and a challenging and exciting illustration of the promise and power of genetic research.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_uO2jMwZVykC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to the Reformation and Protestantism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Homeschooling Reflections","description":"Now that active homeschooling was coming to an end for our family, I found myself pondering its long-term effects: How different am I from the person I would have been if I'd not been a homeschooling parent?

The stories in Almost No Memory reveal an empathic, sometimes shattering understanding of human relations, as Davis, in a spare but resonant prose all her own, explores the limits of identity, of logic, and of the known and the knowable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bUAGAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Magdalena's Song","description":"When the mysterious Count Daniel Vincent Cudzinski visits this industrial village in Ontario, the tightly woven fabric of its traditional culture unravels.

This edited collection of essays covers Olson s diverse non-literary interests, including his engagement with the music of John Cage and Pierre Boulez, his interests in abstract expressionism, and his readings of philosopher Alfred North Whitehead. The essays also examine Olson s pedagogy, which he developed in the experimental environment at Black Mountain College, as well as his six-month archeological journey through the Yucatan Peninsula in 1950 to explore the culture of the Maya. This book will, therefore, be a strong research aid to scholars working in diverse fields  music, archeology, pedagogy, philosophy, art, and psychology  as it outlines methods for close inter-disciplinary work that can uncover the mechanics of Olson s creative, literary processes. Building on the straightforward scholarship of George Butterick, whose Guide to the Maximus Poems remains indispensable for readers of Olson s work, the essays in this volume will also guide readers through the thick allusions within The Maximus Poems itself. New interest in the wide-ranging and non-literary nature of Olson s thought in several recent academic works makes this book both timely and necessary. Physics Envy: American Poetry and Science in the Cold War and After by Peter Middleton as well as Contemporary Olson edited by David Herd have started the process of uncovering the extent to which Olson s inter-disciplinary interests inflected his poetic compositions.  Staying Open  extends the preliminary investigations of Olson s non-literary sources in those volumes by bringing together a community of scholars working across disciplines and within a wide variety of humanistic concerns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xuZ_DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+concept+of+nature+(Ann+Arbor+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Wisdom's Choice: Guiding Principles from the Source of Life","description":"Kathryn Shapiros spiritual journey began several years ago when she contracted Lyme disease and fell into a life-threatening coma.

The authors negotiators and scholars alike demolish stereotypes as they construct an unusually subtle and sophisticated understanding of how culture influences negotiating styles. Culture, they argue, did not cause the Oslo breakdown but it did play an influential, intervening role at several levels: coloring the thinking of political leaders, shaping domestic politics on both sides, and affecting each side s evaluation of the other s beliefs and intentions.After an overview by William Quandt of the history of the Oslo process and the impact of international factors such as U.S. mediation, the volume presents a detailed analysis of first Palestinian, and then Israeli negotiating styles between 1993 and 2001. Omar Dajani, a former legal advisor to the Palestinian team, explains how elements of Palestinian identity and national development have hobbled the Palestinians ability to negotiate effectively. Aharon Klieman, a distinguished Israeli analyst, traces a long-standing clash between diplomatic and security subcultures within the Israeli political elite and reveals how Israeli identity has helped create a negotiating style that opts for short-term gains while undermining the prospects for a lasting agreement. Drawing on these insights, Tamara Wittes concludes the volume by offering not only a fresh appreciation of culture s influence on interethnic negotiations but also lessons for future negotiators in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.Read the review from Foreign Affairs.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kSrWfRY9DqcC&dq=How+Israelis+and+Palestinians+Negotiate:+A+Cross-Cultural+Analysis+of+the+Oslo+Peace+Process+(Cross-Cultural+Negotiation+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An inkeeper's diary","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m50CHQAACAAJ&dq=An+inkeeper%27s+diary&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Acts of the Anti Slavery Apostles","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

Yet nothing could be further from the truth, as Michael W. Harris's history of gospel blues reveals. Tracing the rise of gospel blues as seen through the career of its founding figure, Thomas Andrew Dorsey, Harris tells the story of the most prominent person in the advent of gospel blues. Also known as \\"Georgia Tom,\\" Dorsey had considerable success in the 1920s as a pianist, composer, and arranger for prominent blues singes including Ma Rainey. In the 1930s he became involved in Chicago's African-American, old-line Protestant churches, where his background in the blues greatly influenced his composing and singing. Following much controversy during the 1930s and the eventual overwhelming response that Dorsey's new form of music received, the gospel blues became a major force in African-American churches and religion. His more than 400 gospel songs and recent Grammy Award indicate that he is still today the most prolific composer/publisher in the movement. Delving into the life of the central figure of gospel blues, Harris illuminates not only the evolution of this popular musical form, but also the thought and social forces that forged the culture in which this music was shaped.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=azsxMsljG_cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Heaven Makers","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=clIdAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Heaven+Makers&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oil Lamps II: Glass Kerosene Lamps","description":"The anticipated follow-up to Catherine Thuro's first volume on early lighting, Oil Lamps II: Glass Kerosene Lamps focuses specifically on cased glass, colored glass, and composite lamps that are hallmarks of the golden age of kerosene lighting.

Its true purpose is to describe God's provision for His children that allows them to \\"put forth green leaves when all others around are dried up and dying from the drought.\\" This book tells the tale of Arthur Mathews and his young family, who were missionaries with China Inland Mission in the 1950s. In 1951, China Inland Mission called for an evacuation of all its missionaries in China due to the oppression of the communist leaders there. Two years later, Arthur Mathews finally made it out to Hong Kong, after enduring torture and starvation. Yet his faith remained strong. What gave Mathews such strong faith? What enabled him and his wife to endure what they went through? Isobel Kuhn tells a compelling tale, based on Mathews' own letters, about the Source of his strength: God and God alone. God continually showed Himself faithful to Arthur and Wilda Mathews. Though Arthur and Wilda were unable to do the work they felt called to do, God showed that through their hardships He was more than enough for his children. The enduring faith of the Mathews family was a legacy of incalculable worth to the native Chinese church. As Kuhn asks, \\"What more potent message could God have given these people? No wonder He deliberately sealed the lips of His servants, confined their hands and their feet, and then poured His life through them that the Chinese church might see and might desire ... Was God wrong to do this? In the farthest, most inland part of that great land was God unfair to ask two corns of wheat to die in this world's comforts that others might see for two long years (not just two days: God gave them a good stretch of testing time) how He is sufficient for all these things? He sent them to serve by life and so sealed their lips. It was a much more potent message.\\" God is the true source of life, and God will keep His children even to the end. He kept Arthur and Wilda Mathews, and He will keep you too. This story is an incredible reminder of the truth of God's sustenance and life. - Publisher.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=qjogPQAACAAJ&dq=Green+Leaf+in+Drought+Time&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lens, Light and Landscape: The Art and Technique of Scenic Photography","description":"Revealing much of his own method and technique, the author guides the reader into the best situation for a landscape photograph, with the best equipment, and advises on how to get the best shot.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WIlCOQAACAAJ&dq=Lens,+Light+and+Landscape:+The+Art+and+Technique+of+Scenic+Photography&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Playing Through: Straight Talk on Hard Work, Big Dreams, and Adventures with Tiger","description":"At the heart of Tiger Woods' accomplishments is the special bond he shares with his father, mentor and first goal coach, Earl Woods.

Earl also shares his own stunning story. Raised by his sister after losing both of his parents by the time he was 13, he chose the military over a promising baseball career.

Hawley challenges readers to consider, in light of what is known about healthy child development, the implications of imposing adult sexuality on children in amounts and in forms that can only overwhelm and terrify them. Drawing on vivid, personally observed examples and incidents, he carefully examines what children actually \\"learn\\" from popular culture in which public and private leaders are exposed as philanderers and frauds, in which athletes and entertainment stars are revealed as addicts and child molesters and murderers. The greatest dangers to this era's children, Hawley says, lie where the remedy ought to be: in the ways we tell our collective stories and in the conveyance of our common history. \\"Our children are in danger of being educated to believe there are no healing true stories, that history is the invention of the teller, that nothing finally is verifiable, knowable, safe or right.

An embrace of moral and spiritual contemplation.  The New York Times  A remarkable piece of writing. If read with humility and attention, Kathleen Norris's book becomes lectio divina, or holy reading.  The Boston Globe From the iconic author of Amazing Grace: A Vocabulary of Faith, a spiritual journey that brings joy to the meanings of love, grace and faith. Why would a married woman with a thoroughly Protestant background and often more doubt than faith be drawn to the ancient practice of monasticism, to a community of celibate men whose days are centered on a rigid schedule of prayer, work, and scripture? This is the question that poet Kathleen Norris asks us as, somewhat to her own surprise, she found herself on two extended residencies at St. John's Abbey in Minnesota. Part record of her time among the Benedictines, part meditation on various aspects of monastic life, The Cloister Walk demonstrates, from the rare perspective of someone who is both an insider and outsider, how immersion in the cloistered world-- its liturgy, its ritual, its sense of community-- can impart meaning to everyday events and deepen our secular lives. In this stirring and lyrical work, the monastery, often considered archaic or otherworldly, becomes immediate, accessible, and relevant to us, no matter what our faith may be.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=v_TuyvJFj_gC&dq=The+Cloister&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Bedtime Book (Tell-a-Tale books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5oWcHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Bedtime+Book+(Tell-a-Tale+books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dry Washing for Gold","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Little Wizard of Oz Activity Book (Dover Little Activity Books)","description":"Help Dorothy find the Scarecrow, count sheep with the Cowardly Lion, and watch out for flying monkeys!

K. Warren","description":"The valorous but troubled career of the Civil War general best known for defending Little Round Top and averting a Union defeat at Gettysburg. The lieutenant colonel of a New York regiment and rising star in the Army of the Potomac, Gouverneur K. Warren performed heroically at Gettysburg. For his service at Bristoe Station and Mine Run, he was awarded command of the Fifth Corps for the 1864 Virginia campaign. But Warren s peculiarities of temperament and personality put a cloud over his service at the Wilderness and Spotsylvania and cost him the confidence of his superiors, Grant and Meade. He was summarily relieved of his command by Philip Sheridan after winning the Battle of Five Forks, just eight days before Appomattox. Warren continued as an engineer of distinction in the Army after the war, but he was determined to clear his name before a board of inquiry, which conducted an exhaustive investigation into the battle, Warren s conduct, and Sheridan s arbitrary action. However, the findings of the court vindicating Warren were not made public until shortly after his death. For this major biography of Gouverneur Warren, David M. Jordan utilizes Warren s own voluminous collection of letters, papers, orders, and other items saved by his family, as well as the letters and writings of such contemporaries as his aide and brother-in-law Washington Roebling, Andrew Humphreys, Winfield Hancock, George Gordon Meade, and Ulysses S. Grant. Jordan presents a vivid account of the life and times of a complex military figure.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=07fkCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dead West","description":"In the words of Lee Child on Gone to Dust,  I want more of Nils Shapiro.

It looks at the profound tension that exists between two recent achievements of humanity: greater freedom (over how to live, who to love, what to believe and say, where to trade), and greater interdependence, or 'connexity' (through the financial markets, military structures, the internet, the ecosystem). This tension has led to crisis: institutions, including governments, sense themselves to be inadequate; individuals are faced with a mass of conflicting information and values. The issue we face, which will ultimately determine human survival in our densely packed planet, is how the tension between these two can be resolved, and a new order established. Mulgan presents his own powerful solution to this crisis. It is based around the notion of 'connexity': breaking down our rigid sense of ourselves as isolated units and seeing our lives as part of a system, a positive network of co-responsibility.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EDsHE3yLZasC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hoosiers' Honor: The Iron Brigade's 19th Indiana Regiment","description":"In July 1861 one thousand excited, patriotic Indiana farm boys and shopkeepers left Indianapolis, ready to do their part in ending the rebellion.

As nurturing and tender as they are belligerent and contentious, these are not singular female heroines but the collective common women who struggled for bare subsistence by working in factories, in shops, on the streets, and on the home front while still finding time to participate in national assemblies, activist gatherings, and public demonstrations in their fight for the recognition of women as citizens within a burgeoning democracy. Relying on exhaustive research in historical archives, police accounts, and demographic resources at specific moments of the Revolutionary period, Godineau describes the private and public lives of these women within their precise political, social, historical, and gender-specific contexts. Her insightful and engaging observations shed new light on the importance of women as instigators, activists, militants, and decisive revolutionary individuals in the crafting and rechartering of their political and social roles as female citizens within the New Republic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zHNZKRWcp58C&dq=The+Women+of+Paris+and+Their+French+Revolution+(Studies+on+the+History+of+Society+and+Culture)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metric Pattern Cutting for Children's Wear and Babywear: From Birth to 14 Years","description":"This fourth edition of Metric Pattern Cutting forChildren s Wear and Babywear remains the standard textbook but has three majorimprovements.

Takeshi Kitano","description":"The first volume in Kaya's series examining the work of a new wave of Asian filmmakers who are reshaping contemporary cinema Called \\"the world's most original action auteur\\" by the Village Voice, Takeshi Kitano is already legendary in Japan, where he is known both for his inventive films and for his legendarily caustic alter ego, comedian Beat Takeshi. In the United States, his stylishly noir aesthetic has both influenced and been admired by such directors as Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino. His emotionally intense yet lyrical films have won him worldwide acclaim and honors, including the Grand Prix for Hanabi [Fireworks] at the Venice Film Festival. Now, the long-awaited Beat Takeshi vs. Takeshi Kitano offers a collection of essays on the internationally acclaimed film director by Casio Abe. Despite his impact on contemporary cinema, very little critical work on Kitano's films exists in the United States. Abe's book, originally published in Japan, combines a detailed look at Kitano's filmography with an incisive critique of the consumerist culture which Kitano's films play against. It is also purportedly Kitano's favorite book on his own work. This translation of Abe's writings on Kitano has been updated with articles that discuss Kitano's most recent releases, up to and including Dolls (2002), as well as extensive appendices and footnotes. Abe is one of Japan's preeminent cultural critics, and his book gives a rare and insightful look into the workings of one of the largest media cultures in the world. This will be the first book devoted exclusively to Kitano's work to be published in the United States. Beat Takeshi vs. Takeshi Kitano is the first volume in Kaya's Wicked Radiance series, which examines the work of a new wave of Asian filmmakers who are reshaping contemporary cinema.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9UEcAQAAIAAJ&dq=Beat+Takeshi+Vs.+Takeshi+Kitano&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"They Don't Dance Much","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=01atmgEACAAJ&dq=They+Don%27t+Dance+Much&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Feminine Connection: Freeing the Female Psyche","description":"Dr. Owens' experience as a clinician, researcher and woman convinced her that most women struggle with their self-esteem, and she believes a root cause is that women don't like and accept themselves as women. The patriarchy has deprived women of the knowledge that hidden within their psyche is a treasure trove - the feminine archetype. Women reject the feminine, harming themselves over and over again without even knowing it, because this injury has become the norm. But such feminine qualities as passion, \\"letting go,\\" gentleness and intuition are essential to healthy human functioning and offer an essential contrast and balance to the masculine. On a physical level, her body -- both the earth and the human -- carries and nourishes new life. On a psychological level, she is the unconscious, giving birth to consciousness. Consequently, a continuing interplay between consciousness and the unconscious is crucial to having vibrant, developing minds. In The Feminine Connection, Dr. Owens inspires women in every walk of life to rediscover the value of the feminine. She delves into the psychological theories of Carl Jung and relies on historical perspectives of societies and religions from the dawn of time. By understanding their feminine side, she believes women can assuage problems like midlife crises, codependency and other emotional problems. Only when women recognize and honor the feminine will they be able to honor themselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dsaRj3qjX2UC&dq=The+Feminine+Connection:+Freeing+the+Female+Psyche&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Party Ideologies in America, 1828-1996","description":"Historical analysis of the ideologies of major American parties from the early-nineteenth century onwards.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lo2kDhG646MC&dq=Party+Ideologies+in+America,+1828-1996&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oscar Wilde: Collected Stories","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Honcho (Sundance #13)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=k-O5ngEACAAJ&dq=Honcho+(Sundance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corrigan (New York Review Books classics)","description":"Corrigan is at once a mordant comedy of manners and a very modern morality play.

But when confronted with wide-spectrum antibiotics, birth control pills, steroids, and a sugar-rich diet, this yeast can proliferate, causing a variety of medical problems. Depression, anxiety, tiredness, allergies, and migraine headaches are some of the symptoms. In the past, besides medication, this disease has been treated with a strict carbohydrate-free diet that not only starved the Candida, but also starved the patient. Former Candida sufferer Helen Gustafson and nutritional consultant Maureen O'Shea join forces to create this user-friendly manual for coping with Candida. A symptom chart leads you through the three stages of a specially taliored diet. With over 60 recipes contributed by such well-known chefs as Marion Cunningham, Nasari David, Wolfgang Puck, and Alice Waters, each stage is a veritable feast of possibilities. This innovative collection of exciting dishes would not be complete without an alphabetical listing of different foods and when they are allowed on the diet.

Dead also is Camber of Culdi, who served as the Deryni s most faithful friend in the royal court. With young King Alroy too immature and weak to rule effectively, no one holds the power to halt the reign of genocidal terror that sweeps across the land not even Prince Javan Haldane, Alroy s twin, who recognizes the perfidy of the regents and religious zealots hovering around his royal brother. But there is an equally distressing concern for the surviving children of Camber, whose body remains uncorrupted weeks after his death, suggesting that his soul may be trapped somewhere between earth and heaven and nothing short of the ultimate sacrifice can set Camber free. Award-winning fantasist Katherine Kurtz continues her chronicles of an extraordinary medieval race in a magnificent series that picks up where her acclaimed Camber of Culdi trilogy left off. A story of intolerance, faith, and courage, rich in character, magic, wonder, and evocative detail, Kurtz s brilliantly imagined alternate history is one of the shining jewels of fantasy fiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VQlxCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Llewellyn's 2007 Magical Almanac (Annuals - Magical Almanac)","description":"Featuring favorite authors Ellen Dugan, Mickie Mueller, Susan Pesznecker, Emily Carding, and dozens more!

Stress was like gasoline on the fire of symptoms, and it became clear that she needed to root out the physical and psychological clutter that were the source of her debt and discontent. In this book, she shows us how to pursue practical minimalism so we can create more with less more space, more time, and even more love.

In the process Seattle emerges not as a rough, half-formed frontier town but as a soft city of streets and houses, middle-class in aspiration and achievement; Roger Sale asks how it came to be that way. The methods Sale employs range from demographic analysis and residential survey to portraiture and personal observation and reflection. He highlights what was most important in each of the city's major periods from the founding, when the settlers, in waiting forty years for the railroads to come, meanwhile built a city to which the railroads had to come, down to the post-Boeing Seattle of the 1970's, when the city tried for the first time to discover a sense of itself based on the truths and lessons of its own past. Along the way one finds a good deal that has been obscured or ignored in other books on Seattle and in most books on the history of American cities: a discussion of the economic diversity of late-nineteenth-century Seattle which allowed it to grow; a description of the major achievements of the first boom years, in parks, boulevards, and neighborhoods of quiet eleganced; portraits of people like Vernon Parrington, Nellie Cornish, and Mark Tobey who came to Seattle and flourished here; an assessment of Seattle's new vitality as the result of natives and newcomers mixing both in harmony and in antagonism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xDUnUtKhuSIC&dq=Seattle:+Past+to+Present&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Ghost in the House: Motherhood, Raising Children, and Struggling with Depression","description":"An award-winning reporter for the Washington Post, Tracy Thompson was thirty-four when she was hospitalized and put on suicide watch during a major depressive episode. This event, the culmination of more than twenty years of silent suffering, became the point of departure for an in-depth, groundbreaking book on depression and her struggle with the disease. The Beast shattered stereotypes and inspired countless readers to confront their own battles with mental illness. Having written that book, and having found the security of a happy marriage, Thompson assumed that she had learned to manage her illness. But when she took on one of the most emotionally demanding jobs of all being a mother depression returned with fresh vengeance. Very quickly Thompson realized that virtually everything she had learned up to then about dealing with depression was now either inadequate or useless. In fact, maternal depression was a different beast altogether. She tackled her problem head-on, meticulously investigating the latest scientific research and collecting the stories of nearly 400 mothers with depression. What she found was startling: a problem more widespread than she or any other mother struggling alone with this affliction could have imagined. Women make up nearly 12 million of the 19 million Americans affected by depression every year, experiencing episodes at nearly twice the rate that men do. Women suffer most frequently between the ages of twenty-five and forty-four not coincidentally, the primary childbearing years. The Ghost in the House, the result of Thompson's extensive studies, is the first book to address maternal depression as a lifelong illness that can have profound ramifications for mother and child. A striking blend of memoir and journalism, here is an invaluable resource for the millions of women who are white-knuckling their way through what should be the most satisfying years of their lives. Thompson offers her readers a concise summary of the cutting-edge research in this field, deftly written prose, and, above all, hope.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eh2NyJ57SK0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Solomon & Sheba","description":"This novel takes readers into a magical and richly peopled world which encompasses four generations of African American life.

There are four main divisions in the book. The first is a brief exposition of basic concepts and facts of the theory of error-correcting codes (Part I). The second is a complete presentation of the theory of algebraic curves, especially the curves defined over finite fields (Part II). The third is a detailed description of the theory of classical modular curves and their reduction modulo a prime number (Part III). The fourth (and basic) is the construction of geometric Goppa codes and the production of asymptotically good linear codes coming from algebraic curves over finite fields (Part IV). The theory of geometric Goppa codes is a fascinating topic where two extremes meet: the highly abstract and deep theory of algebraic (specifically modular) curves over finite fields and the very concrete problems in the engineering of information transmission. At the present time there are two essentially different ways to produce asymptotically good codes coming from algebraic curves over a finite field with an extremely large number of rational points. The first way, developed by M. A. Tsfasman, S. G. Vladut and Th.

Jahn and Brenda J. Dunne first embarked on their exotic scholarly journey more than three decades ago, their aspirations were little higher than to attempt replication of some previously asserted anomalous results that might conceivably impact future engineering practice, either negatively or positively, and to pursue those ramifications to some appropriate extent. But as they followed that tortuous research path deeper into its metaphysical forest, it became clear that far more fundamental epistemological issues were at stake, and far stranger phenomenological creatures were on the prowl, than they had originally envisaged, and that a substantially broader range of intellectual and cultural perspectives would be required to pursue that trek productively. This text is their attempt to record some of the tactics developed, experiences encountered, and understanding acquired on this mist-shrouded exploration, in the hope that their preservation in this format will encourage and enable deeper future scholarly penetrations into the ultimate Source of Reality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KP8-90snxOAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knocked Out by My Nunga-Nungas: Further, Further Confessions of Georgia Nicolson","description":"As I was going out of my bedroom door I remembered my nungas.

How should we accept growing old? It's an inevitable progression and yet in Western society the very subject of aging is often taboo and shrouded in anxiety and shame. Not anymore, says Marie de Hennezel, an internationally renowned clinical psychologist and bestselling author. Now that our lives are longer and richer than ever before, it's imperative to demystify our greatest fear and cultivate a positive awareness of aging. In this timely and essential book, de Hennezel offers a fresh perspective on the art of growing old. She confronts head-on the inevitable grief we sustain at the loss of our youth and explains how refusing to age and move forward in life is actually what makes us become old. Combining personal anecdotes with psychological theory, philosophy, and eye-opening scientific research from around the world, she shows why we should look forward to embracing everything aging has to offer in terms of human and spiritual enrichment. The Art of Growing Old is a thought-provoking, brave, and uplifting meditation on the later years as they should be lived.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GsBknXiZ3UMC&dq=The+Art+of+Growing+Old&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From shadows to reality;: Studies in the Biblical typology of the Fathers","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Pons-Kompaktworterbuch: Franzosisch-deutsch, deutsch-franzosisch (German Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BdnsjwEACAAJ&dq=Pons-Kompaktworterbuch:+Franzosisch-deutsch,+deutsch-franzosisch+(German+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"John Szarkowski: Photographs","description":"Each picture is presented with a commentary defining its place in the technical and stylistic development of the camera arts since 1845","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=elwengEACAAJ&dq=John+Szarkowski:+Photographs&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sugartime: The Hidden Pleasures of Making Maple Syrup","description":"Sugaring is the act of collecting maple sap to make maple syrup, an early-spring endeavor that takes place all around the country - in Vermont, most famously, but also throughout New England, as far south as Ohio, and as far west as Minnesota. It is a time-honored tradition that has changed little since the Native Americans sugared centuries ago. SUGARTIME is a beautifully rendered narrative about the act of sugaring, a soulful activity that, like the best of outdoor hobbies, slows time down. Interspersed with the book's lyrical account of a season in the sugarbush are separate sections that serve as a primer to guide the beginner through every stage of surgaring, from selecting trees and hanging sap buckets to finishing off maple syrup. For anyone with an interest in taking up sugaring, everyone who has a maple tree, and all those with a nostalgia for the rural landscape, SUGARTIME will be a joy to discover.

In Karl Barth's Theological Exegesis Richard E. Burnett provides the first detailed look at this watershed event, showing how Barth read the Bible before and after his break with liberalism, how he came to read the Bible differently than most of his contemporaries, and why Barth's contribution is still significant today. As Burnett explains, the crux of Barth's legacy is his abandonment of the hermeneutical tradition of Schleiermacher, which had had such a profound influence on Christian thought in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. This hermeneutical tradition, which began with Herder and extended through Dilthey, Troeltsch, Wobbermin, Wernle, and Barth himself prior to 1915, is characterized by its attempt to integrate broad aspects of interpretation, to establish universally valid rules of interpretation on the basis of a general anthropology, and by its reliance on empathy. Barth's discovery that \\"the being of God is the hermeneutical problem\\" implied that the object to be known should determine the way taken in knowing. This fundamental insight brought about a hermeneutical revolution that gave priority to content over method, to actual exegesis over hermeneutical theory. The development of Barth's new approach to Scripture is especially evident in his R?merbrief period, during which he developed a set of principles for properly reading Scripture. Burnett focuses on these principles, which have never been discussed at length or viewed specifically in relationship to Schleiermacher, and presents a study that challenges both \\"neo-orthodox\\" and \\"postmodern\\" readings of Barth. This is a crucial piece of scholarship. Not only is it the first major book in English on Barth's hermeneutics, but it also employs pioneering research in Barth studies. Burnett includes in his discussion important material only recently discovered in Switzerland and made available here in English for the first time -- namely, six preface drafts that Barth wrote for his famous Romans commentary, which some regard as the greatest theological work of all time. In making a major contribution to Barth studies, this volume will also inform scholars, pastors, and students whose interests range from modern Christian theology to the history of biblical interpretation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2og37UCX6-wC&dq=Karl+Barth%27s+Theological+Exegesis:+The+Hermeneutical+Principles+of+the+Romerbrief+Period&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life's Interruptions - God's Opportunities","description":"What do we do about life's interruptions, those unexpected--sometimes sorrowful--events that stop us cold?

The result was a bold and unique heroweak in body, subtle in mind, dependent on drugs for the vitality to sustain himselfwith great crimes behind him and a greater destiny ahead: a rock-and-roll antihero who would channel all the violent excesses of the sixties into one enduring archetype.

Booknews from The Poisoned Pen When ex Wall Streeter Jacobia  Jake  Tiptree bought a charming 1823 fixer-upper in tiny Eastport, Maine, she figured she d also bought herself a tranquil, stress-free life. But Jake soon learned that appearances can be deceiving, and that even small towns have their share of dark secrets   including murder. Wreck The Halls People hardly ever lock their doors in Eastport. So when Jake and her best pal, Ellie, arrive at Faye Anne Carmody s kitchen door, they knock and walk right in. But though Christmas is just two weeks away, what they find is far from festive: a dazed Faye Anne covered with blood, and her no-good husband   the town butcher, Merle   nowhere in sight. Nowhere, that is, until Jake discovers his body   tidily wrapped in his own butcher paper.... It doesn t take long for news of the murder to race through the small town, and just about everyone has a theory about the grisly crime that has robbed Eastport of its least-liked citizen. But while police chief Bob Arnold considers it an open-and-shut case, Jake and Ellie aren t convinced of Faye Anne s guilt. Jake has enough going on in her life without trying to investigate a murder. After all, she s just married her longtime love, Wade, and the pair plan to spend the winter rehabilitating the paint-encrusted windows in Jake s old house. But Jake has to admit that there are a lot of details that don t add up: for example, Faye Anne s complaint that she was being stalked, and blood-splattered evidence at the crime scene that just doesn t make sense. Then there is the diary that Faye Anne s secret, sometime boyfriend claims is hidden somewhere in her house. Could Faye Anne s own journal be the key to unlocking an even more fiendish murder plot, or is her double-crossing lover trying to frame her? When yet another Eastport citizen turns up dead, Jake realizes the murderer s trail began long before the night Merle Carmody died. But what keeps eluding her and Ellie is the motive behind the mystery. The truth is so close, they can almost taste it   but can they stop the shrewd killer before he chisels another victim s name onto a tombstone?","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sCyeRhQrZa4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Columbia History of the American Novel","description":"Examines the literary history of the American novel, and looks at the contributions of such writers as Herman Melville, Toni, Morrison, and Saul Bellow","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2IA7o-OTyEsC&dq=The+Columbia+History+of+the+American+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Corum: The Prince With the Silver Hand (Eternal Champion Series, Vol. 12)","description":"This first of two trilogies concerning Corum, the Prince in the Scarlet Robe, is the seventh volume in the Eternal Champion series.

Never before has the vast range of American women's experience during this pivotal era been brought together in one book. Now, Our Mothers' War re-creates what American women from all walks of life were doing and thinking, on the home front and abroad. Like all great histories, Our Mothers' War began with an illuminating discovery. After finding a journal and letters her mother had written while serving with the Red Cross in the Pacific, journalist Emily Yellin started unearthing what her mother and other women of her mother's generation went through during a time when their country asked them to step into roles they had never been invited, or allowed, to fill before. Drawing on a wide range of sources, including personal interviews and previously unpublished letters and diaries, Yellin shows what went on in the hearts and minds of the real women behind the female images of World War II -- women working in war plants; mothers and wives sending their husbands and sons off to war and sometimes death; women joining the military for the first time in American history; nurses operating in battle zones in Europe, Africa, and the Pacific; and housewives coping with rationing. Yellin also delves into lesser-known stories, including: tales of female spies, pilots, movie stars, baseball players, politicians, prostitutes, journalists, and even fictional characters; firsthand accounts from the wives of the scientists who created the atomic bomb at Los Alamos, African-American women who faced Jim Crow segregation laws at home even as their men were fighting enemy bigotry and injustice abroad, and Japanese-American women locked up as prisoners in their own country. Yellin explains how Wonder Woman was created in 1941 to fight the Nazi menace and became the first female comic book superhero, as well as how Marilyn Monroe was discovered in 1944 while working with her mother-in-law packing parachutes at a war plant in Burbank, California. Our Mothers' War gives center stage to those who might be called \\"the other American soldiers.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BcQDE0Ce9GAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Christmas Carol","description":"Stunning illustrations by award-winning artist Lee Krutop accompany this timeless Christmas story.

The first half of this work documents his sociological investigations of the bleak living conditions among the working class in Lancashire and Yorkshire in the industrial north of England before World War II. The second half is a long essay on his middle-class upbringing, and the development of his political conscience, questioning British attitudes towards socialism. Orwell states plainly that he himself is in favour of socialism, but feels it necessary to point out reasons why many people who would benefit from socialism, and should logically support it, are in practice likely to be strong opponents. According to Orwell biographer Bernard Crick, publisher Victor Gollancz first tried to persuade Orwell's agent to allow the Left Book Club edition to consist solely of the descriptive first half of the book.

Humanism is not a dogma or a creed, writes Paul Kurtz. Humanists have confidence in human beings, and they believe that the only bases for morality are human experience and human needs. Humanists are opposed to all forms of supernaturalistic and authoritarian religion. Many humanists believe that scientific intelligence and critical reason can assist in reconstructing our moral lives . . . Humanists believe in freedom and pluralistic democracy as virtually our first principle, and we are disturbed by any authoritarian effort to impose one point of view on America. Defense of the open, democratic society should be the first point humanists make in response to the Moral Majority, making it clear that in our reading of the American tradition, pluralism is essential.In Defense of Secular Humanism is a volume of collected essays by one of the leading exponents of secular humanism.

Yet on May 25, 1999, when the top of a massive beech tree snapped off and slammed into 33-year-old, Adirondack logger Scott Remington, his bones exploded. The terrain was unforgiving and the area too remote for cell phones. So the fact that medics reached him is a miracle. So is the aftermath of a freak accident that felt like death to a woodsman who could never sit still. More than the story of one man, this is also about a small town that rescued Scott from despair, and, by accident, discovered the meaning of life. In this well written and extremely compelling book, Amy Montgomery draws us into the essence of living with a spinal cord injury through Scott Remington's moving story. Her portrayal of his struggle to survive and live a meaningful life makes us care as much as the members of his family. In an instant both Scott and I became members of a club that neither of us would ever have wanted to join. But instead of self pity, Scott has demonstrated relentless energy, drive, and willpower that no disability can diminish. Montgomery has captured not only the drama of an accidental tragedy but the power of the human spirit to overcome it.

Her works have drawn millions of readers and continue to sell at a breathtaking pace. Their impact on American culture runs from libertarian politics to the self-esteem movement in psychology to the rugged individualism of Silicon Valley and the Internet. Rand also launched a movement of intellectuals committed to her philosophy of Objectivism. While it has grown dramatically since Rand's death in 1982, however, the Objectivist movement has also fractured into rival camps whose differences over doctrine and strategy are compounded by competition for leadership and bitter accusations of heresy. In Truth and Toleration, philosopher David Kelley analyzes the conflicts that led him to break ranks with orthodox Objectivists and create an independent branch of the movement. Originally published in 1990 as a manifesto, this work has been revised as an analysis of the principles of intellectual collaboration-the terms on which intellectuals and activists can work together in a common cause. Going beyond the immediate issues, Kelley discusses the nature of individual responsibility for the spread of ideas and for their historical consequences. He offers a new argument for toleration based on a non-relativistic theory of truth. He describes the nature of tribalism among intellectuals, showing how the troubled legacy of Ayn Rand has followed a pattern similar to the not-so-civil wars among followers of other original and charismatic thinkers such as Marx and Freud. In a postscript for the second edition, Kelley reviews the growth in Objectivist scholarship and the influence of Rand's ideas over the past decade. Truth and Toleration is an engaging introduction to the Objectivist movement, its core ideas, and its central fissures. At the same time, it offers a case study in the sociology of intellectual movements and a frank discussion of the issues that arise whenever thinkers leave their studies to promote their idea in the public realm. David Kelley is the executive director of the Objectivist Center. Educated at Princeton University, earlier in his career he taught philosophy at Brandeis University and Vassar College. He has written widely on the subject of libertarianism including The Evidence of the Senses; The Art of Reasoning; and is co-author of The Logical Structure of Objectivism.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=C6x38zJL3ccC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Compleat Conductor","description":"In world renowned conductor and composer Gunther Schuller's highly provocative critique of modern conducting, he castigates many of this century's most venerates conductors for using the podium to indulge their own interpretive idiosyncrasies, rather than devote themselves to reproducing the composer's stated intentions. 937 music examples. 35 tables.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=D3c8DwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Compleat+Conductor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hiking Oregon Three Sisters","description":"Veteran hiker Bruce Grubbs guides the outdoorsperson on 75 treks through the pristine Three Sisters Country of Oregon's Central Cascades.

Life with her brilliant, absent-minded, adored uncle has taught Sophia to take care of herself. Then Shadrack is kidnapped. And Sophia, who has rarely been outside of Boston, is the only one who can search for him. Together with Theo, a refugee from the West, she travels over rough terrain and uncharted ocean, encounters pirates and traders, and relies on a combination of Shadrack's maps, common sense, and her own slantwise powers of observation. But even as Sophia and Theo try to save Shadrack's life, they are in danger of losing their own. The Glass Sentence plunges readers into a time and place they will not want to leave, and introduces them to a heroine and hero they will take to their hearts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5uIrEAAAQBAJ&dq=A+Map+of+Glass:+Library+Edition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Higher Education in an Era of Digital Competition: Choices and Challenges","description":"A collection of 14 contributions which explore a variety of issues in the application of information technologies to higher education.

The conventional wisdom offered to an addict s loved ones has been to let the addict  hit bottom  before intervening. Now intervention specialist Debra Jay challenges this belief and offers a bold new approach to treating addiction that provides a practical and spiritual lifeline to families struggling with alcohol or drug abuse. In No More Letting Go, Jay argues that the traditional advice of  letting go  too often destroys both the addict and the family physically, emotionally, and spiritually. Jay contends that addiction is everybody s businessnot just the addict sand addiction doesn t have the right to trump the welfare of a family. In short, highly accessible chapters written with warmth, understanding, and compassion, Jay weaves together philosophical and religious thought; new science on the brain function of an addict; the physical and psychological impact of addiction on family members; and poignant, real-life family stories. No More Letting Go is a powerful, informative guide that provides comfort, hope, and practical advice to anyone affected by a family member s addiction.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0lLe1xQk4LUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quilting the Lodge Look: 24 Quilts, Wallhangings, and Companion Projects in Patchwork and Wildlife Applique (Granola Girl Designs)","description":"24 Quilts, Wall hangings and Companion Projects in Patchwork and Wildlife Applique.

Imported American sluggers some past their primes have found new life in the East and have given credibility to the Japanese game. A succession of Japanese stars like Hideo Nomo left their teams to find success in the US major leagues, enabling MLB International to make hundreds of millions of dollars selling TV and licensing rights to its games in Japan. While philosophical differences remain, You Gotta Have Wa guides you through the strange and fascinating world of besuboru, or baseball.

O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award An award-winning physician and scientist makes the game-changing case that genetic females are stronger than males at every stage of life Here are some facts: Women live longer than men. They have stronger immune systems. They're better at fighting cancer and surviving famine, and even see the world in a wider variety of colors. They are simply stronger than men at every stage of life. Why is this? And why are we taught the opposite? To find out, Dr. Sharon Moalem drew on his own medical experiences - treating premature babies in the neonatal intensive care unit; recruiting the elderly for neurogenetic studies; tending to HIV-positive orphans in Thailand - and tried to understand why in every instance men were consistently less likely to thrive. The answer, he discovered, lies in our genetics: two X chromosomes offer a powerful survival advantage. With clear, captivating prose that weaves together eye-opening research, case studies, diverse examples ranging from the behavior of honeybees to American pioneers, as well as experiences from his personal life and his own patients, Moalem explains why genetic females triumph over males when it comes to resiliency, intellect, stamina, immunity and much more. He also calls for a reconsideration of our male-centric, one-size-fits-all view of medical studies and even how we prescribe medications - a view that still sees women through the lens of men.

Drinking cups, oil-lamps, and walls were decorated with scenes of seduction; statues of erect penises served as boundary-stones and signposts; and marble satyrs and nymphs grappled in gardens. Caroline Vout examines the abundance of sexual imagery in Greek and Roman culture. Were these images intended to be shocking, humorous, or exciting? Are they about sex or love? How are we to know whether our responses to them are akin to those of the ancients? The answers to these questions provide fascinating insights into ancient attitudes toward religion, politics, sex, gender, and the body. They also reveal how the ancients saw themselves and their world, and how subsequent centuries have seen them.

Author Felix Padilla explores the internal dynamics and external conditions, which have prompted this move past individual group boundaries to a broader ethnic identity. According to Padilla, the Latino ethnic identity develops from the cultural and structural similarities of two or more Spanish-speaking groups and often in response to common experiences of social inequality. In that ethnic identities have to a large extent been encouraged by the division of the labor market in America's industrial society, he argues that the Latino consciousness represents a situational ethnic identity which functions according to the needs of the groups. He describes how such conditions as poverty and racial discrimination have necessitated the assertion of a broader Latino ethnic consciousness and behavior, often more successful in social action than individual cultural or national associations. In case studies from the early 70s, Padilla examines Affirmative Action, the Spanish Coalition for Jobs--spurred by activist Hector Franco--and the Latino Institute, and their influence on the growth of Latino solidarity and mobilization in Chicago. In refining the concept of Latino and Hispanic and establishing its significance in society, Latino Ethnic Consciousness serves as an analytic framework for further study of ethnic change in America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Hw4UAAAAYAAJ&dq=Latino+Ethnic+Consciousness:+The+Case+of+Mexican+Americans+and+Puerto+Ricans+in+Chicago&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elements of partial differential equations (International series in pure and applied mathematics)","description":"Geared toward students of applied rather than pure mathematics, this volume introduces elements of partial differential equations.

For Albert Camus, the urge to revolt is one of the \\"essential dimensions\\" of human nature, manifested in man's timeless Promethean struggle against the conditions of his existence, as well as the popular uprisings against established orders throughout history. And yet, with an eye toward the French Revolution and its regicides and deicides, he shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. As old regimes throughout the world collapse, The Rebel resonates as an ardent, eloquent, and supremely rational voice of conscience for our tumultuous times.

In Shakey, Jimmy McDonough tells the whole story of Young s incredible life and career: from his childhood in Canada to the founding of folk-rock pioneers Buffalo Springfield; to the bleary conglomeration of Crazy Horse and simultaneous monstrous success of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young; to the depths of the Tonight s the Night depravity and the strange changes of the Geffen years; and Young s unprecedented nineties  comeback  with Ragged Glory and Harvest Moon. No detail is spared -- not the sex, drugs, relationships, breakups, births, deaths, nor the variety of chameleon-like transformations that have enabled Young to remain one of the most revered musical forces of our time. Shakey (the title refers to one of Young s many aliases) is not only a detailed chronicle of the rock era told through the life of one uncompromising artist, but the compelling human story of a lonely kid for whom music was the only outlet; a driven yet tortured figure who learned to control his epilepsy via  mind over matter ; an oddly passionate model train mogul who -- inspired by his own son s struggle with cerebral palsy -- became a major activist in the quest to help those with the condition. Based on interviews with hundreds of Young s associates (many speaking freely for the first time), as well as extensive exclusive interviews with Young himself, Shakey is a story told through the interwoven voices of McDonough -- biographer, critic, historian, obsessive fan -- and the ever-cantankerous (but slyly funny) Young himself, who puts his biographer through some unforgettable paces while answering the question: Is it better to burn out than to fade away?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rsiBNqqwq_kC&dq=Shakey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Idiom Book of New Testament Greek","description":"A reference book on problems of exegesis, intended primarily for theological students.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ajX85SJjrkUC&dq=An+Idiom+Book+of+New+Testament+Greek&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best Dives' Snorkeling Adventures : A Guide to the Bahamas, Bermuda, Caribbean, Hawaii & Florida Keys","description":"Vacation guide to the best snorkel-swimming and free diving spots in the Bahamas, Bermuda, Turks & Caicos, Caribbean, Hawaii, Florida, Mexico, Galapagos and Australia.

Immediately, this book came pouring forth like a gushing, overflowing, river. It was there in the Mojave Desert where He chose to dictate this inspired book in stenographer pads to Celeste when she was a young wife alone with small children. The Message was a book ahead of it's time. She became the protector of His Message. The author continues to see herself as His simple handmaiden who was allowed to act as His scribe/stenographer. She is still amazed to have become the recipient of this book of inspired spiritual messages. In January, 2000, she was shown this is the time for His Message to be shared with all those who are longing for His love, wisdom, and His Kingdom of Peace. As part of her ongoing adventurous life, she has finally gained courage enough to shout this beautiful message of His divine love and hope from the heights of the majestic Rocky Mountains. He wishes to once again walk and talk with us as He did with our first parents. Are we ready to commune with Him as He desires to commune with us? He loves and misses those souls He created in Eden.

Abba were once reviled by most critics, but now bands like Bjorn Again and Erasure keep the phenomenon thriving. This is their background story. The biography features the early years when as engaged couples as they then styled themselves, they failed to make it as Sweden's entrant for Eurovision with a song called \\"Waterloo\\". It caused a national outcry. It is a history of worldwide hit records, infighting, partner swapping, and financial disaster - they do not get one kroner in royalties for many of their songs - and bitterness. But it is also a story of triumph. A book that is written with the co-operation of the members of the band.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gXQ4GwAACAAJ&dq=Abba:+The+Name+of+the+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rand McNally Deluxe Motor Carriers' Road Atlas 2002: United States, Canada, Mexico (Rand Mcnally Motor Carriers' Road Atlas.

His name was Henry Darger. He had lived in this room for forty years. It was filthy, crammed with his possessions, mostly things found in the garbage. Henry never threw anything out. The room was filled, almost solid, with junk. He was now eighty years old and far too feeble to carry anything down the stairs. So he left everything behind. He had no need of his possessions. Anyway, he was going to an old folks home to die. When he left the room his life was over. His landlord asked him what he wanted done with his possessions. Henry is said to have replied, \\"You can have them, Mr. Leonard.\\" At that moment the gift had no meaning. There was nothing in the room but garbage. Everything would have to be thrown out... When Darger's landlord, Nathan Lerner, assisted by a young student, David Berglund, began to clean out Henry's room they found some surprises: an eight volume autobiography, consisting of 5084 handwritten pages, entitled, The History of My Life which Henry had begun writing in 1963 after retiring. The short auto-biographical introduction to what is otherwise an enormous and utterly fantastic piece of imaginative fiction, provided some of the crucial pieces of evidence underlying the biographical reconstruction of Darger's life that form the first chapter of this book. Then, when the old trunks were opened, they made a far more spectacular discovery: a history of another world called, In The Realms of the Unreal in fifteen volumes, 15 145 type written pages, unquestionably the longest work of fiction ever written. In time the room alsoyielded the three huge bound volumes of illustrations for that work, several hundred pictures, many over twelve feet long and painted on both sides. By accident, the landlord had stumbled upon a concealed and secret life work, which no one had ever seen: Darger's alternate world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MZZlQgAACAAJ&dq=Henry+Darger:+In+the+Realms+of+the+Unreal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chimpanzees I Love: Saving Their World And Ours (Byron Preiss Book)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Battle Chasers, tome 1","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Jumble Madness: Crazy for Jumbles","description":"Filled with wacky, witty fun, the word puzzles in this collection continue in the tradition of the Jumble(R) fan favorites.

Pulitzer Prizewinning author Jon Meacham helps us understand the present moment in American politics and life by looking back at critical times in our history when hope overcame division and fear. ONE OF OPRAH S  BOOKS THAT HELP ME THROUGH  ? NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR ? The Christian Science Monitor ? Southern Living Our current climate of partisan fury is not new, and in The Soul of America Meacham shows us how what Abraham Lincoln called the  better angels of our nature  have repeatedly won the day. Painting surprising portraits of Lincoln and other presidents, including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry S. Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, and Lyndon B. Johnson, and illuminating the courage of such influential citizen activists as Martin Luther King, Jr., early suffragettes Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, civil rights pioneers Rosa Parks and John Lewis, First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Army-McCarthy hearings lawyer Joseph N. Welch, Meacham brings vividly to life turning points in American history. He writes about the Civil War, Reconstruction, and the birth of the Lost Cause; the backlash against immigrants in the First World War and the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan in the 1920s; the fight for women s rights; the demagoguery of Huey Long and Father Coughlin and the isolationist work of America First in the years before World War II; the anti-Communist witch-hunts led by Senator Joseph McCarthy; and Lyndon Johnson s crusade against Jim Crow. Each of these dramatic hours in our national life have been shaped by the contest to lead the country to look forward rather than back, to assert hope over fear a struggle that continues even now. While the American story has not always or even often been heroic, we have been sustained by a belief in progress even in the gloomiest of times. In this inspiring book, Meacham reassures us,  The good news is that we have come through such darkness before  as, time and again, Lincoln s better angels have found a way to prevail. Praise for The Soul of America  Brilliant, fascinating, timely . . . With compelling narratives of past eras of strife and disenchantment, Meacham offers wisdom for our own time.  Walter Isaacson  Gripping and inspiring, The Soul of America is Jon Meacham s declaration of his faith in America.

Whether we form impressions of other people, recall episodes from memory, report our attitudes in an opinion poll, or make important decisions, we often get it wrong. The errors made are not trivial and often seem to violate common sense and basic logic. A closer look at the underlying processes, however, suggests that many of the well known fallacies do not necessarily reflect inherent shortcomings of human judgment. Rather, they partially reflect that research participants bring the tacit assumptions that govern the conduct of conversation in daily life to the research situation. According to these assumptions, communicated information comes with a guarantee of relevance and listeners are entitled to assume that the speaker tries to be informative, truthful, relevant, and clear. Moreover, listeners interpret the speakers' utterances on the assumption that they are trying to live up to these ideals. This book introduces social science researchers to the \\"logic of conversation\\" developed by Paul Grice, a philosopher of language, who proposed the cooperative principle and a set of maxims on which conversationalists implicitly rely. The author applies this framework to a wide range of topics, including research on person perception, decision making, and the emergence of context effects in attitude measurement and public opinion research. Experimental studies reveal that the biases generally seen in such research are, in part, a function of violations of Gricean conversational norms. The author discusses implications for the design of experiments and questionnaires and addresses the socially contextualized nature of human judgment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5uEBAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Model Railroading With MTH Electric Trains","description":"The model railroad empire of MTH Electric Trains continues to steam ahead and revolutionize the O gauge electric train market with its innovative product lines, helping to make O gauge the fastest growing segment in model railroading.

Naomi Greene reveals to English-speaking readers the diverse talents that made him one of the most controversial European intellectuals of the postwar era, at the center of political and cultural debates still vital to our time. Greene presents Pasolini's films to the English-speaking world in full detail and in a rich critical context, using them to trace the evolution of his ideas and the details of his troubled personal life from 1950, when he settled in Rome, to 1975, the year of his brutal murder, apparently at the hands of a young male prostitute. \\"In her concise and sympathetic book, Greene intelligently explicates the political and social context within which Pasolini became both a leading figure and a significant heretic. He was an atheist who directed one of the few genuinely profound biblical films in the cinema, a communist who severely criticized many of the radical movements of modern Italy. Though he publicly acknowledged his homosexuality, he privately referred to it as his \\"sickness.\\" As the book well documents, Pasolini was not a rebel but rather an authentic heretic who worked in contradiction to both his medium and milieu.\\"--Choice Originally published in 1990.

Relentless suspense, breathtaking danger, riveting characters-these are the hallmarks of L'Amour's classic fiction. Off the Mangrove Coast collects for the first time in one volume nine of his extraordinary stories-some long out of print and unavailable anywhere else, some never before published. From the jungles of Borneo to the hidden canyons of the American West, from small-town fight clubs to a Parisian caf  at the end of World War II, these are tales of betrayal and revenge, courage and cowardice, glory and greed, as only Louis L'Amour can tell them. Here are vintage stories of men and women who dare what others will never attempt, who fight for justice and dreams when the odds are against them. A charismatic boxer with quick hands and a hair-trigger temper itches to fight all comers-but if he's ever going to get a shot at a championship, he will first have to fight the man who ruined his father.

Olin Foundation Changed America","description":"In the 1970s, John M. Olin, one of the country s leading industrialists, decided to devote his fortune to saving American free enterprise. Over the next three decades, the John M. Olin Foundation funded the conservative movement as it emerged from the intellectual ghetto and occupied the halls of power. The foundation spent hundreds of millions of dollars fostering what its longtime president William E. Simon called the  counterintelligentsia  to offset liberal dominance of university faculties and the mainstream media and to make conservatism a significant cultural force. Among the counterintellectuals the foundation identified and supported at key stages of their careers were Charles Murray during his early work on welfare reform, Allan Bloom as he wrote The Closing of the American Mind, and Francis Fukuyama as he was developing his  End of History  thesis. Using exclusive access to the John M. Olin Foundation s leading personalities as well as its extensive archives, John J. Miller tells the story of an intriguing man and his unique philanthropic vision. He gives fascinating insights into the foundation s role in helping the CIA fund anti-Communist organizations during the Cold War and its extensive help to Irving Kristol and others as they moved from left to right to found the neoconservative movement. He tells of the foundation s early and critical role in building institutions such as the Federalist Society and the Heritage Foundation, which served to transform conservative ideas into national policies. A Gift of Freedom shows how John M. Olin s  venture capital fund for the conservative movement  helped develop one of the leading forces in American politics and culture.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2oBaEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond Heaven","description":"Beyond Heaven: Chicago House Party Flyers from 1983-1989 catalogs a collection of flyers and other house music related ephemera from the years 1983 to 1989, courtesy of Mario \\"Liv It Up\\" Luna, a DJ living in the Pilsen neighborhood of Chicago during this time. These flyers, also called pluggers, were used for promotional purposes.

Also included in the mix are promoters, record stores, labels, and an assortment of party crews and dance groups who contributed to the growth and atmosphere of house music in Chicago.

Recruited from the \\"Abode of War\\" by means of trade or warfare, slaves began their lives in the Islamic world as deracinated outsiders, described by Muslim jurists as being in a state like death, awaiting resurrection and rebirth through manumission. Many of these slaves were manumitted and some rose to prominence as soldiers and political leaders. Others were not so fortunate. Slaves of African origin, in particular, were often condemned to lives of menial labor. Despite the importance of slavery in Islamic history, this institution has received scant attention from scholars.

But as yet, only a few concordes & a couple of Tupolev Tu-144s have gone into service, on a very few routes & none were ever sold. The cost of developing any supersonic airliner is prohibitive. The prospect of their being able to operate economically is remote. The market for such an aircraft (which would have to charge premium fares, even more than first class) is very small. Manufacturers & government agencies alike continue to base their multi-million research programs on inflated market \\"estimates\\" that combine substantial elements of special pleading & wishful thinking. Statements invariably include a plethora of \\"shoulds\\" & \\"coulds\\" in their predictions; but their assumptions carry little weight, as they are ill-supported by known data. The conclusions drawn to produce market \\"estimates\\" of more than a thousand aircraft neither clear-headed nor objective. This book, written by an experienced analyst who spent most of his career in commercial airline market research & traffic forecasting, explodes the myth. The analysis draws upon known facts, applies simple arithmetic & makes assumptions that are based on technical, operational & commercial sense.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0aj0OwAACAAJ&dq=Supersonic+(airliner)+non-sense:+A+case+study+in+applied+market+research&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Never Sniff a Gift Fish","description":"Here are the hilarious tales of a sportsman's life in the great and often not-so great outdoors.

How distinctive are these voting decisions? Traditional approaches to the study of voting and elections often fail to address these questions by ignoring other elections taking place simultaneously. In this groundbreaking book, Stephen Nicholson shows how issue agendas shaped by state ballot propositions prime voting decisions for presidential, gubernatorial, Senate, House, and state legislative races. As a readily accessible source of information, the issues raised by ballot propositions may have a spillover effect on elections and ultimately define the meaning of myriad contests. Nicholson examines issues that appear on the ballot alongside candidates in the form of direct legislation. Found in all fifty states, but most abundant in those states that feature citizen-initiated ballot propositions, direct legislation represents a large and growing source of agenda issues. Looking at direct legislation issues such as abortion, taxes, environmental regulation, the nuclear freeze, illegal immigration, and affirmative action, Nicholson finds that these topics shaped voters' choices of candidates even if the issues were not featured in a particular contest or were not relevant to the job responsibilities of a particular office. He concludes that the agendas established by ballot propositions have a far greater effect in priming voters than is commonly recognized, and indeed, that the strategic use of initiatives and referenda by political elites potentially thwarts the will of the people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=irkEEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ok Ok Ok","description":"From the team that created the bestselling I Wish You More, this is a motivational picture book for exceptionally OK children!

Due to Doyle s fascination with the supernatural, several of the stories have a supernatural element. Stories in the collection include Egyptian archaeology thriller  Lot No. 249  and the dark, atmospheric s ance story in  Playing with Fire . Full of humour as well as mystery, this is a fascinating collection of stories from Doyle. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) was a British author, best known as the creator of the world-famous detective Sherlock Holmes. Born in Edinburgh, he was educated in England and Austria before studying medicine at the University of Edinburgh. It was during his time at university that Doyle began writing short stories, submitting them to magazines and journals. His first Sherlock Holmes novel,  A Study in Scarlet  was written in just three weeks and published in 1887 to favourable reviews, and more Sherlock adventures followed. By 1893, Doyle was growing tired of Sherlock and attempted to kill him off in the story  The Final Problem , but public outcry caused him to resurrect the famous detective. He featured in a total of 56 short stories and four novels along with his trusty sidekick Dr Watson and made Doyle one of the best-paid authors of the time. The stories have been adapted multiple times; most recently in the successful BBC series  Sherlock  starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman. Later literary works included the Professor Challenger series which began with  The Lost World , in which Challenger sets out to find evidence of prehistoric life. The book inspired numerous adaptations, including the films  Jurassic Park  and  The Lost World . In later life Doyle became captivated by the world of spiritualism and the occult and published non-fiction works about his beliefs including  The Coming of the Fairies . Arthur Conan Doyle died at home in 1930.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=J69kEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heavy Weather Sailing, 30th Anniversary Edition","description":"Since this book was written over 30 years ago by the great British sailor K.

Developed by Geoffrey de Havilland and flown for the first time on October 26 1931, the biplane became the most important elementary trainer used by Commonwealth forces. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before WWII, and subsequently around 4,000 were built in the UK with an extra 2,000 being manufactured in Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Following the end of WWII, pilots could buy and modify a Tiger Moth for recreational use or agricultural crop spraying and use it relatively cheaply. This, combined with its popularity within the aero club movement, provided employment for the Tiger Moths until the late fifties when the more modern closed cockpit aircraft began to force them into retirement. This new paperback edition provides a comprehensive account of the aircraft origins and its development as a trainer of Commonwealth pilots in times of peace and war. It also looks at some of the other roles which this versatile little aeroplane performed such as a crop duster, glider tug, aerial advertiser, bomber, coastal patrol plane and aerial ambulance.

The techniques of Aikido have the power to injure or kill, but primarily their purpose is to control one or more opponents. A few of Ueshiba's students decided to spread their knowledge of Aikido by opening their own schools. Each of these students interpreted the Aikido that they were taught differently, which has resulted in many different 'styles'. One student of Jigoro Kano, Tomiki Sensei devised a systematic and logical curriculum that can be practiced both in kata and randori, which enables a student to make steady progress and regular improvement. the resulting style of Aikido is commonly referred to as Tomiki Aikido.

Quartet and The Underworld USA Trilogy, James Ellroy, presents another literary masterpiece, this time a true crime murder mystery about his own mother. In 1958 Jean Ellroy was murdered, her body dumped on a roadway in a seedy L.A. suburb. Her killer was never found, and the police dismissed her as a casualty of a cheap Saturday night. James Ellroy was ten when his mother died, and he spent the next thirty-six years running from her ghost and attempting to exorcize it through crime fiction. In 1994, Ellroy quit running. He went back to L.A., to find out the truth about his mother--and himself. In My Dark Places, our most uncompromising crime writer tells what happened when he teamed up with a brilliant homicide cop to investigate a murder that everyone else had forgotten--and reclaim the mother he had despised, desired, but never dared to love. What ensues is a epic of loss, fixation, and redemption, a memoir that is also a history of the American way of violence. \\"Ellroy is more powerful than ever.\\" --The Nation \\"Astonishing . . . original, daring, brilliant.\\" --Philadelphia Inquirer","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HwbWFLaJDYYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Finding Hippocrates","description":"Our present health care delivery system operates according to the paradigm of \\"managed care.\\" Managed care has led to the near bankruptcy of health care, 44 million uninsured, and anomalies in the medical profession that place the interests of health plans above those of patients.

He also discusses the new technologies and how they may affect record sales, especially round-the-clock rock and roll on cable television.

In the 1990s, a  purity industry  emerged out of the white evangelical Christian culture. Purity rings, purity pledges, and purity balls came with a dangerous message: girls are potential sexual  stumbling blocks  for boys and men, and any expression of a girl s sexuality could reflect the corruption of her character. This message traumatized many girls resulting in anxiety, fear, and experiences that mimicked the symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and trapped them in a cycle of shame. This is the sex education Linda Kay Klein grew up with. Fearing being marked a Jezebel, Klein broke up with her high school boyfriend because she thought God told her to and took pregnancy tests despite being a virgin, terrified that any sexual activity would be punished with an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. When the youth pastor of her church was convicted of sexual enticement of a twelve-year-old girl, Klein began to question purity-based sexual ethics. She contacted young women she knew, asking if they were coping with the same shame-induced issues she was. These intimate conversations developed into a twelve-year quest that took her across the country and into the lives of women raised in similar religious communities a journey that facilitated her own healing and led her to churches that are seeking a new way to reconcile sexuality and spirituality. Pure is  a revelation... Part memoir and part journalism, Pure is a horrendous, granular, relentless, emotionally true account\\" (The Cut) of society s larger subjugation of women and the role the purity industry played in maintaining it. Offering a prevailing message of resounding hope and encouragement,  Pure emboldens us to escape toxic misogyny and experience a fresh breath of freedom  (Glennon Doyle, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Love Warrior and founder of Together Rising).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gnGbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Pure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Riders of the Dawn: Library Edition","description":"Library Edition 2nd Edition At the time of the earliest Crusades, young noblewoman Elisabeth longs to be the person she s always known is hidden inside.

Barry, author of The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Deadliest Plague in History \\"\\"Timely and needed.

As many experts have pointed out, an influenza pandemic is only a matter of time and that time could be now. Or is it? In Bird Flu, Dr. Marc Siegel cuts through the hype, the facts, the fears, and the realities to explain what has the experts so worried and why there's still plenty of reason to be calm. Among the questions he answers are: * What is bird flu, and who has it? * What can I do to protect my family? * Should I stockpile Tamiflu? * Will this be like the deadly Spanish flu of 1918? * Why is there no bird flu vaccine? * Will the annual flu shot protect me? In his sensible and entertaining style, Siegel looks at the advances we've made in treatments, the research still to be done, and the challenges ahead for Asia to lay out a realistic plan for ending this global threat. While a bird flu outbreak in the United States may or may not happen this year, there's still a great deal of work to be done in readying America for outbreaks of any kind.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rllUjwEACAAJ&dq=Bird+Flu:+Everything+You+Need+to+Know+About+the+Next+Pandemic&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Francis Of Assisi: Writer And Spiritual Master","description":"\\"Francis has left us a written message, one addressed to his contemporaries, to be sure, but also and very explicitly one addressed to men and women of every era. This message does not set forward his personal example Francis is not its center but its servant; what he does is simply to lay out a path for us, one sustained by the Gospel and available to all believers.\\" From Part One Francis of Assisi: Writer and Spiritual Master contains several literary genres (poetry, prayers and legislative texts) all of which were written by Saint Francis himself and an exploration and discussion of these texts by internationally renowned Franciscan scholar Thadd?e Matura. Often overlooked, Francis writings bespeak a theology of tremendous spiritual vision. So many study Francis life, legends and devotions, yet not until fairly recently have theologians begun to take seriously Francis simple, yet powerful words about God, the Trinity and the Christian journey. Unlike any other book on the saint from Assisi, this book brings Saint Francis writings to the forefront and shows how this simple and uneducated man, who possessed only a basic alphabetical knowledge, left behind a body of writing, including two brief handwritten texts on parchment. As Thadd?e Matura writes, Saint Francis was so convinced of the power of the word of God which he had received in faith and which had oriented his life. The necessity of transmitting this in writing for everyone and for all times was a mission for him. This book at hand wants to be at the service and as a prolongation of this mission.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FOPmAQAACAAJ&dq=Francis+Of+Assisi:+Writer+And+Spiritual+Master&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A.D.D. & Romance: Finding Fulfillment in Love, Sex, & Relationships","description":"Provides information on how to help improve the academic, social, and behavioral performance of children with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=37kOAQAAMAAJ&dq=A.D.D.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Art of the Ridiculous Sublime: On David Lynch's Lost Highway (Occasional Papers)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Eighty Million Dollars 87th Precinct Mystery Novel","description":"Stan Gifford was America's most beloved comedian.

His legendary career spanned nearly 26 years, including his titles as the middleweight and welterweight champion of the world and close to 200 professional bouts. This illuminating biography grounds the spectacular story of Robinson's rise to greatness within the context of the fighter's life and times. Born Walker Smith Jr. in 1921, Robinson's early childhood was marked by the seething racial tensions and explosive race riots that infected the Midwest throughout the 1920s and 1930s. After his mother moved their family to Harlem, he came of age in the post-Renaissance years. Recounting his local and national fame, this deeply researched and honest account depicts Robinson as an eccentric and glamorous--yet powerful and controversial--celebrity, athlete, and cultural symbol. From Robinson's gruesome six-bout war with Jake \\"Raging Bull\\" LaMotta and his lethal meeting with Jimmy Doyle to his Harlem nightclub years and thwarted showbiz dreams, Haygood brings the champion's story to life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q_nfLUMzlM0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internet Guide to Birds and Birding: The Ultimate Directory to the Best Sites Online","description":"A directory to more than a thousand Internet sites devoted to birds and bird watching","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4pLNAAAACAAJ&dq=Internet+Guide+to+Birds+and+Birding:+The+Ultimate+Directory+to+the+Best+Sites+Online&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Keeper of the keys","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UVLzPAAACAAJ&dq=Keeper+of+the+keys&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Muslim intellectual;: A study of al-Ghazali","description":"The function of the intellectual -- The world of al-Ghazali.

The Ready to Paint series solves this neatly by providing pull-out tracings from which to work. There are five beautiful projects, each accompanied by a full-size tracing of the initial drawing. 200 step-by-step photographs accompany the easy-to-follow instructions, and a dedicated section on the materials used is also included. This is a great way to learn how to paint these inspiring animals in acrylics and there is plenty to appeal to more experienced painters too. As well as the five projects, there are four further finished paintings to inspire the reader, one of which also has a full-sized tracing, making six tracings altogether.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JUJ9mwEACAAJ&dq=Get+wild+with+paint!:+Easy+step-by-step+instructions+to+paint+jungle+prints&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hardball on the Hill: Baseball Stories from Our Nation's Capital","description":"Including numerous stories and anecdotes, \\"Hardball on the Hill\\" examines theunique relationship between the presidents and baseball, the long and intenserivalry of the Congregessional game, and minor league baseball in Washington, D.C.

The box was the Picture Academy for the Young, a popular encyclopedia in pictures invented by preacher-turned-publisher Johann Siegmund Stoy in eighteenth-century Germany. Children were expected to cut out the pictures from the Academy, glue them onto cards, and arrange those cards in ordered compartments the whole world filed in a box of images. As Anke te Heesen demonstrates, Stoy and his world in a box epitomized the Enlightenment concern with the creation and maintenance of an appropriate moral, intellectual, and social order. The box, and its images from nature, myth, and biblical history, were intended to teach children how to collect, store, and order knowledge. te Heesen compares the Academy with other aspects of Enlightenment material culture, such as commercial warehouses and natural history cabinets, to show how the kinds of collecting and ordering practices taught by the Academy shaped both the developing middle class in Germany and Enlightenment thought. The World in a Box, illustrated with a multitude of images of and from Stoy's Academy, offers a glimpse into a time when it was believed that knowledge could be contained and controlled.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DlenxjSQT1AC&dq=The+compleat+housewife:+The+encyclopedia+of+eighteenth+century+cookery+and+medicine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Godman: Finding a Spiritual Master","description":"Radhasoami Reality explores the emergence of a new religious tradition that is expandiong rapidly across North India and throughout the world.

In a recent contest, Bob has proved himself a matchless sheepdog, and if he wins the trophy two more times, he ll be seen as equal to the legendary sheepdogs of yore. But Bob has a real rival: Red Wull, with his docked tail and bristling yellow fur, a ferocious creature, just like his diminutive master, Adam McAdam, a lonely Scot, estranged not only from his English neighbors but from his son, David. McAdam just can t stop belittling this strapping young man, all the more so since David began courting Moore s beautiful daughter Maggie. But what McAdam really wants is for his beloved Wullie to wrest the prize from Bob once and for all. The story takes a darker turn when a troubling new threat to the local flocks emerges. A dog has gone rogue, sneaking out at night to feast on the flesh and blood of the sheep he is bound to protect. Again and again, new sheep fall prey to this relentless predator; again and again, he slips away undetected. This master hunter can only be among the boldest and sharpest of dogs . . . Bob, Son of Battle has long been a beloved classic of children s literature both in America and in England. Here the celebrated author and translator Lydia Davis, who first read and loved this exciting story as a child, has rendered the challenging idioms of the original into fluent and graceful English of our day, making this tale of rival dogs and rival families and the shadowy terrain between Good and Bad accessible and appealing to readers of all ages.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UcBvDwAAQBAJ&dq=Bob,+Son+of+Battle&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Destiny's Daughter","description":"Separated at birth, three sisters--Leticia, a former call girl; Jamilla, a successful author, and Clarissa, a jazz singer--finally cross paths in adulthood, in this powerful collection of interconnected stories.

It contributes to knowledge of the history, development, and ways in which early modern writings are read and understood by Muslims. By mapping the literary and more broadly cultural consequences of the censure, translation and abridgement of Milton s works in the Arab-Muslim world, this book analyses the diverse ways in which Arab-Muslims read and understand a range of literary and religious aspects of Milton s writing in light of cultural, theological, socio-political, linguistic and translational issues. After providing an overview of the presence of Milton and his works in the Arab world, each chapter sheds light on how cultural and translational issues shape the ways in which Arab-Muslim readers perceive and understand the characters and motifs of Paradise Lost. Chapters outline the ways in which the figures are currently understood in Milton scholarship, before exploring how they fit into the narrative drama and theology of the poem, and their position in Islamic creed and Arab-Muslim culture. Concurrently, each chapter examines the poem s subject matter in detail, placing particular emphasis on matters of linguistic, theological and cultural translation and accommodation. Chapter conclusions not only summarise the patterns and potentialities of reception, but point towards the practical functions of Arab-Muslim responses to Milton s writing and their contribution to the formation of social ideas.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=gColDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Matheson: Collected Stories, Vol. 1","description":"SECOND VOLUME OF 3 OF THE COLLECTED STORIES OF RICHARD MATHESON","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lqzwQwAACAAJ&dq=Richard+Matheson:+Collected+Stories,+Vol.+1&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Practicing the Cosmic Science: Key Insights in Modern Astrology","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"In a Barren Land: The American Indian Quest for Cultural Survival, 1607 to the Present","description":"Award-winning historian Paula Mitchell Marks reconfirms her status as one of the foremost contemporary chroniclers of the American West with this often appalling, yet always engrossing, account of American Indian cultures under siege from 1607 to the present.

The meeting comprised five sessions representing the breadth of disciplinary interest in pheromones, a typical charac teristic of this research area. In the sessions the following topics were presented: (1) control of pheromone production (organized by W. L. Roelofs), (2) sensory processing of pheromone signals (T. L. Payne), (3) neuroethology of pheromone mediated responses (T. C. Baker), (4) use of pheromones in direct control (A. K. Minks and R. T. Card6), and (5) evolution of pheromone communication (c. LOfstedt). All sessions started with a series of 30-minute lectures, after which ample time was reserved for discussion. In each session some participants were asked to serve as discussants and to initiate and stimulate discussion, and a rapporteur was recruited to make notes of these discussions and to summarize the general trends emerging from the session.

If international intervention is to be effective, its first task must be the attainment of viable peace.As the editors of this groundbreaking volume explain, viable peace is achieved when the capacity of domestic institutions to resolve disputes peacefully overtakes the powerful motives and means for continued violent conflict. Getting to this point quickly demands the careful design and coordinated implementation of four mutually reinforcing strategies to moderate political conflict, defeat militant extremism, inculcate the rule of law, and establish a political economy that reduces rather than ignites conflict.Drawing on their firsthand experience of Kosovo, the contributors all seasoned practitioners and policymakers identify the concrete challenges that must be confronted and lay out the practical steps that must be taken to transform a society habituated to violent conflict into one where peace can eventually be self-sustaining.Conceptually innovative yet profoundly pragmatic, this book will change the way that international intervention is conceived and conducted.Read the review on Foreign Affairs.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2zlrF1t3adIC&dq=The+Quest+For+Viable+Peace:+International+Intervention+And+Strategies+For+Conflict+Transformation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Studies in Doctrine","description":"Four outstanding McGrath books are here in one volume that gives a clear, thoughtful, and highly readable introduction to the basic doctrines of the Christian faith.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uNYn17UbMVEC&dq=Studies+in+Doctrine&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Paul Nettl: Selected essays","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Vinnie takes a bow (AlphaPets)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Cy7-cQAACAAJ&dq=Vinnie+takes+a+bow+(AlphaPets)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A First Look at ASP.NET v 2.0","description":"This book provides a first look at the new major release of ASP.

The volume gives a systematic account of many of the most important issues and texts in ancient moral psychology and ethical theory, providing a unified and illuminating way of reflecting on the fields as they developed from Socrates and Plato through Aristotle to Epicurus and the Stoic philosophers Chrysippus and Posidonius, and beyond. For the ancient philosophers, Cooper shows here, morality was \\"good character\\" and what that entailed: good judgment, sensitivity, openness, reflectiveness, and a secure and correct sense of who one was and how one stood in relation to others and the surrounding world. Ethical theory was about the best way to be rather than any principles for what to do in particular circumstances or in relation to recurrent temptations. Moral psychology was the study of the psychological conditions required for good character--the sorts of desires, the attitudes to self and others, the states of mind and feeling, the kinds of knowledge and insight. Together these papers illustrate brilliantly how, by studying the arguments of the Greek philosophers in their diverse theories about the best human life and its psychological underpinnings, we can expand our own moral understanding and imagination and enrich our own moral thought. The collection will be crucial reading for anyone interested in classical philosophy and what it can contribute to reflection on contemporary questions about ethics and human life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=CnoDEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Explaining Society: An Introduction to Critical Realism in the Social Sciences (Critical Realism: Interventions)","description":"Translation of the author's book Att f orklara samh allet.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HkiFswEACAAJ&dq=Explaining+Society:+An+Introduction+to+Critical+Realism+in+the+Social+Sciences+(Critical+Realism:+Interventions)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Millennium's Dawn","description":"Throughout the vast reaches of Shirania there are many places that uplift the spirit of mankind, but the Ozzrin mountains are not among their number. They straddle the southeastern edge of the landmass, forming an element of the various geographical boundaries separating the holdings of the Cyroxiandalusianopherosites from the rest of the peoples who call Shirania home. The worn, gray mountains are far older than any other range in the land, unchanging monoliths that have seen more than one rising and falling of our race. Though the foggy, mossy highlands are quite beautiful in a melancholy sort of way, there is a sadness about them that cannot be solely attibuted to the climate. It's a resonant quality of the crumbling peaks, an unspoken tale of a memory that belongs to us, but escapes our capacity to recall it. For centuries, millennial, the mountains have slept, but on the final day of the year 999 A.F.C., the ancient landscape stirred, and what was once asleep began to awaken... The Millennium Dawn, by James Fross, conveys a parodic take on epic fantasy in an attempt to produce both amusement and reflection in the heart and mind of the reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=drtoCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classroom Assessment: What Teachers Need to Know","description":"\\"\\" I have an extremely high opinion of this textbook.

The ancient wisdom ascribed is found behind the creation of a 500-year-old artifact, the Aztec Calendar. To the Natives it was Teoilhuicatl Apaluaztli Ollin Tonal Machiotl meaning the Great and Venerable Mechanism of the Universe. Dr. Randall C. Jimenez, a former San Jose State University educator, and Richard B. Graeber, an engineering documentation specialist, have collaborated to create the first Technical Manual for the Aztec Calendar ever produced. [Note: The Aztec name was given to the Mechican Indians (ch as in chevron; sometimes spelled Mexican) by the writer W. H. Prescott in the early 19th century.] The Aztec Calendar Handbook, involving thousands of man-hours of effort to create, takes a blueprint style approach to a Historical Reference primer. Illustrated with over 150 technical drawings showing enlargement details, cut-away views, and computer-generated art, this new guidebook has been called the \\"ultimate\\" Aztec Calendar reference treatise. Distilled from over 240 sources and quoting direct eyewitnesses from the 1500's, it further includes a glossary of over 230 native words. This attractive book is made with parchment paper and has a leather-grained cover, making it resemble an ancient manuscript.The research for writing the Aztec Calendar Handbook was assisted by custom software to convert Native date designators into our modern calendar dating system. In this way, a researcher is able to convert and track the dates of events from surviving native history books, known as codices. Mountains of information could be processed more efficiently and accurately when correlating indigenous dates. Inversely, a Julian date can also be converted into the Mayan long-count system. It is then possible for the Mechican calendar-labeling scheme to be transposed over the count to generate a person's Aztec tonallo or spiritual name from their birth date. According to Native tradition, our current long-count cycle will be complete on the winter solstice 2012. A long-count cycle, credited to the Olmec/-Maya, is 5125 years and started in the year 3113BC. No one is really sure what will happen when the cycle ends, but the material in this book offers a solid foundation for figuring it out. By looking at myths, legends & history with an Aztec's perception of God, this new Manual provides needed answers to some important questions. Would you like to know about how and when the Maya influenced the design of the Aztec Calendar? Have you ever seen the Hopi version of the Plumed Serpent? Would you like to put the last 12,000 years into perspective? If so, then your library needs the Aztec Calendar Handbook. You will find yourself referring to it over and over again.

The journey takes us from the Hungary of the 1930s and the ravaged Budapest of World War II to Lukacs's discovery of the New World, his forays into the intellectual life of New York City, and finally his settling in Philadelphia. Along the way, Lukacs examines many of the major currents of our period, including fascism, communism, democracy, anti-Semitism, and the Christian realism from which springs the book's title. What emerges is a mind that brings to bear on the conflicts of the twentieth century the erudition of the European heritage and the independence of the American. In prose as elegant as it is supple, Confessions of an Original Sinner is at once the vivid account of one man's voyage and an important contribution to that small library that brings into sharp focus the major intellectual developments of our time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=R_2fAAAAMAAJ&dq=Confessions+of+an+Original+Sinner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Encyclopedic Reference Bible","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Efy6ZwEACAAJ&dq=The+New+Encyclopedic+Reference+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Trouble at Wild River (Adventures of the Northwoods, No. 5)","description":"Turn-of-the-century northern Wisconsin has proven to be a very imaginative and captivating setting for the Adventures of the Northwoods series.

Moved by an invisible hand that holds the strings of their memories, they still seem to sweep down stone staircases, plot revenge in the darkness of secret chambers, and dance to the gentle notes of lutes and rebecs in the great halls in the glimmering firelight.

By the age of twenty-three, he was performing his first gig in America, facing an astonished audience in his bright yellow dungarees, a star-spangled T-shirt and boots with wings. Elton John had arrived and the music world would never be the same again. His life has been full of drama, from the early rejection of his work with song-writing partner Bernie Taupin to spinning out of control as a chart-topping superstar; from half-heartedly trying to drown himself in his LA swimming pool to disco-dancing with the Queen; from friendships with John Lennon, Freddie Mercury and George Michael to setting up his AIDS Foundation. All the while, Elton was hiding a drug addiction that would grip him for over a decade. In Me Elton also writes powerfully about getting clean and changing his life, about finding love with David Furnish and becoming a father. In a voice that is warm, humble and open, this is Elton on his music and his relationships, his passions and his mistakes.

There has been a lack of information regarding how to say words from text, and why we say words the way we do. The word example for example, has a sound between the consonants in the second syllable. Where does it come from? How do we say this word the way a native speaker would do?  The Book of Letters  examines this, provides the answers and offers students of the language a method of learning to say them in an understandable way. It is different to any previously published available work in that it uses traditional sound representation combined with a simpler and more understandable system, to show sounds that have hitherto been ignored or at best poorly represented. The novelty here is that it approaches an academic subject, in a light-hearted readable style. The book covers every aspect of alphabet letters as written for English to include their history, shape, varieties, sounds, uses, and the consequence of joining one letter with another.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8brWAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chorus Of Voices: Emerging Poets Of The 21st Century","description":"North American Women Poets in the 21st Century: Beyond Lyric and Language is an important new addition to the American Poets in the 21st Century series.

Those basset-hound eyes. That bone-dry wit. There has never been another comedian like Bob Newhart. His comedy albums, movies, and two hit television series have made him a national treasure and placed him firmly in the pantheon of comedy legends.

It has encompassed all the things that the Russians are and that they hope to become. Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish \\"biography\\" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a \\"paradise.\\" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents. In this book, revolutionaries and laborers brush shoulders with tsars, and builders, soldiers, and statesmen share pride of place with poets. For only the entire historical experience of this magnificent and mysterious city can reveal the wealth of human and natural forces that shaped the modern history of it and the nation it represents.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=jPMM7Abnk6EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ghost Towns and Drowned Towns of West Kootenay","description":"Leaning headstones and cow parsnip covered ruins proclaim that people once lived in over fifty ghostly communities of West Kootenay.

John MacGregor draws on his dual training in art history and in psychiatry and psychoanalysis to describe not only this evolution in attitudes but also the significant influence of the art of the mentally ill on the development of modern art as a whole. His detailed narrative, with its strangely beautiful illustrations, introduces us to a fascinating group of people that includes the psychotic artists, both trained and untrained, and the psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, critics, and art historians who encountered their work.\\"The psychotics who haunt Mr. MacGregor's pages desperately fling images at us from the midst of their manias, suicidal depressions or paranoid reconstructions of the cosmos. . . . Mr. MacGregor is able to show that their work is by no means sealed off from culture. However private their visions, the ways they represent them in art are shaped to a surprising degree by the styles and taste that dominate their respective times.

John Currin s work draws upon a broad range of cultural influences that include Renaissance oil paintings, 1950s women s magazine advertisements, and contemporary politics. Labeled as mannerist, caricaturist, radical conservative, or satirist, Currin continues to confound expectations and evade categorization. While his virtuosic technique is indebted to the history of classical painting, the images engage startlingly contemporary ideas about the representation of the human figure. Currin paints challengingly perverse images of female subjects, from lusty doe-eyed nymphs to more ethereal feminine prototypes. With his uncanny ability to locate the point at which the beautiful and the grotesque are in perfect balance, he produces subversive portraits of idiosyncratic women in conventional settings. This much-anticipated volume comes four years after the definitive John Currin, and it features an interview with the artist by Angus Cook and six short-fiction essays by Wells Tower.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hlFOEAAAQBAJ&dq=John+Currin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Garden State Canoeing: A Paddler's Guide to New Jersey","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=m3vWAAAAMAAJ&dq=Garden+State+Canoeing:+A+Paddler%27s+Guide+to+New+Jersey&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Over New England","description":"The great interiors of New England are exposed in this photographic celebration of a decorating style that values purity, simplicity, and a healthy respect for the past. 20,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AqmPv7qFlS8C&dq=Over+New+England&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The life and works of Beethoven (The Modern library of the world's best books)","description":"This book is part of the TREDITION CLASSICS series.

When Maria Galloway dies, she leaves everything to her spoiled, wayward grandson, Vittorio. Her only granddaughter, Molly, whom she raised from infancy, is left to confront the unyielding bitterness Maria harboured against her. As Molly begins to trace the complex interrelationships in her loving but divided family, she recalls her idyllic childhood, spent in her grandmother s sky-blue house in Jamaica. There, surrounded by a jungle of coconut, mango and avocado trees and enveloped in the smells of mouth-watering sweet cakes and spicy Jamaican foods, she received her grandmother s pure and simple generosity, and the return of unconditional love. But as Molly enters adolescence, she grows increasingly aware of her grandmother s vulnerabilities and disappointments, her human frailties. When Maria decides that things might get better if she leaves Jamaica and joins her adult children in Canada, she takes Molly with her. But it isn t long before she, a woman who has always lived on her own terms and has never been afraid to speak her mind, clashes with her children. Even Molly falls into disfavour when Maria discovers that she is romantically involved with a woman. From generational saga to tender love story, \\"The Heart Does Not Bend\\" is a vivid and heartfelt portrayal of an indomitable matriarch and the women who must free themselves from her.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VuMfAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Heart+Does+Not+Bend&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Flight to Arras","description":"This work stresses French writer and aviator Antoine de Saint-Exupery's humanistic philosophy.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PAygAAAAMAAJ&dq=Flight+to+Arras&hl=&source=gbs_api"}]`),M={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:S},data(){return{visibleCount:6,booksData:L,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visibleBooks(){return this.booksData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMoreBooks(){return this.visibleCount<this.booksData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},E=["disabled"],P={key:0},I={key:1};function q(s,i,t,u,r,n){const g=m("PoemCard");return e(),o("section",null,[i[1]||(i[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your Books 📚")])],-1)),a("div",B,[(e(!0),o(f,null,b(n.visibleBooks,(l,p)=>(e(),y(g,{key:p,poem:l},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),n.hasMoreBooks?(e(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:i[0]||(i[0]=(...l)=>n.loadMore&&n.loadMore(...l))},[r.isLoading?(e(),o("span",I,"Loading...")):(e(),o("span",P,"See more"))],8,E)):c("",!0)])}const W=d(M,[["render",q],["__scopeId","data-v-2dd01cee"]]),H=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/32.md","filePath":"drive/32.md"}'),x={name:"drive/32.md"},D=Object.assign(x,{setup(s){return(i,t)=>(e(),o("div",null,[w(W)]))}});export{H as __pageData,D as default};
