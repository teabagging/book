I own a paperback, beat-up, tattered, many-times-read \\"Unabridged\\" edition, A Watermill Classic (Mahwah, New Jersey), that I used when I was teaching Great Books and parenting my three children. Just be aware that much of the richness of the imagistic, original, long-winded, Gilden Age version, I love, is edited out. A picture may be worth 1,000 words; but I am a wordsmith.

My slight disappointment in my purchase is that nowhere in the description did I find that the book is abridged.

It is a magnet for children."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"As others have said, this version is abridged, and the abidgement should be more conspicuously noted. It is a crying shame that such beautiful and numerous illustrations should accompany heavy handed cuts to a perfect work. \\"The Wind in the Willows\\" is known for its adventures, but it also presents much kindness and nobility of spirit, exemplified in the mystical experience of the Divine in the omited chapter \\"The Pipers at the Gates of Dawn.\\" It is a lie to leave out this chapter and claim, which the jacket does, that the book is \\"true in spirit\\" to the original work. And I think it not coincidental that in the editing of the Christmas carol sung by the mice, the verses are cut to leave only secular words (...not to mention, Grahame's rhymed verses are the BEST! - why would anyone EVER touch those?) And Toad's contriteness at the end, proof of his transformed character, is much abbreviated. I can't help but think the editor valued only the adventures and intentionally gave short shrift to the gentle morality tale of this story."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"When publishers abridge classics such as The Wind in the Willows they must be very respectful. And they should not make their own determinations of what a child can and cannot absorb or enjoy. It is very sad that they cut \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" from this edition. Children can and will get something valuable from such contemplatve texts, but only if we allow them access!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"We have this edition - I didn't know about the missing chapters mentioned above - I'll have to look for a complete edition now.

It was my single favorite present of Christmas 2004."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I bought this book for the illustrations, which are gorgeous, rich, often two-page spreads that I expect my children (and myself) to pore over again and again. This is why I give it three stars. I was most disappointed, however, to discover that the book is abridged. Nowhere in the book description could I find that information, and the same thing happened with Inga Moore's beautifully illustrated edition of The Reluctant Dragon. Perhaps it appropriately changes the flavor of the book for the very young reader, so if your children are still little, you might consider this one. But if the full, classic text is what you are looking for, make a different choice!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"This product is abridged and not what I wanted.

I make exceptions for beautifully illustrated classics, like this one.Generally, I hate the idea of abridging a book. And I must admit, I never read the unabridged version. But I can tell you, my kids absolutely loved this book. My boy especially enjoyed the pictures of the car. With a beautiful illustration on every page, they were entranced. My son - age 5 - told me, \\"They shouldn't make books that you don't want to stop reading!!\\""},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"The illustrations are not only perfect, but perfectly fit into the text. The 2 page spread illustrating a spot rat and mole visited on the river is worth the price of the book. I have not read the original, but I know authors of this era tended to be a bit wordy.

I have been reading to him since he was 2, and he has always enjoyed books. However, we had never tried a book this long before (for those who might be afraid this version might be too abridged, trust me, it is not, especially for a kid that age). One reviewer mentions that she was read the unabridged version when she was 4 or 5. Well, more power to her. However, the typical 4 to 5 year old (especially if it is a boy) is not going to sit still for the hours it will take to go through the unabridged version, especially if it lacks the magical illustrations of this book. The idea is to introduce this wonderful story to younger children, instead of reading them yet another Curious George or Babar story. (They can then go back and read the unabridged version when they are older and can read on their own.) There is currently a huge gap between picture books and regular chapter books. This book is a much-needed hybrid to help fill that gap. I wish they would publish more books like these."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I chose this book for a young man who is just beginning to enjoy reading and has some seeing difficulties.It is a classic and can serve him for reading for some time to come."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I received The Wind in the Willows as a gift when I was ten, so I gave my granddaughter in Atlanta a copy on her 8th birthday and spent three evenings reading it to her at bedtime (I had to define many of the British English words for her)."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"The book, of course, is a classic.

Thought I'd better brush up on children's literature--how had I ever missed this? It's hard to believe that anyone could make a Water Rat, a Mole, a Toad, a Badger, and various and sundry rodents so endearing. Why, parts of it even made me LOL! The abridged hardcover edition I bought was only thirteen bucks or so, but the illustrations by Inga Moore make it priceless. Buy this one! You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"Even middle schoolers will enjoy this classic epic of the adventures of four riverside pals braving the huge world. The shy Mole, courageous Rat, boisterous Toad, and the all- knowing Badger will charm you the minute you encounter them.Whenever, I think of Mole I smile. Curious as he is, he discovers the river along with his new-found friend, Rat. Rat is a cunning character who is always ready to lend a helping hand and always knows what is going on. Rat knows all about his friendly riverside neighbors and informs Mole about their personalities. I wouldn't mind having him as my friend, even though he is a rat. Rat's statement about his friend Toad was right on the money, \\"He is indeed the best of animals, so simple, so good natured, and so affectionate. Perhaps he's not very clever-we can't all be geniuses; and it may be that he is boastful and conceited. But he has got some great qualities has Toady.\\" Later on in the book, Toad finds himself escaping jail dressed as a washer woman with no money because he stole a motor car. This comical character keeps the book interesting by adding little stories and always getting into trouble. The last of the four friends is Badger, a hermit who lives deep in the wild wood he is wise, but not one who you can rely on to show up. As Rat puts it when Mole questions when he will meet badger, \\"Badger will turn up some day or other-he's always turning up- and then I'll introduce you. The best of fellows!\\" Last but not least, are the weasels who invade Toad Hall when Toad is imprisoned. It made me laugh to think of these little weasels taking over and having an army-like personality, and it puts a fun twist in the plot.My favorite aspect of this book is the personification Grahame puts into these animals. When I think of the characters in this book I think of them as humans not the animals that they really are. My seven-year old step-sister loved the children's version and I the adult therefore making this book great for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"Terrific Book! Excellent to read to children 5+ years old. It talks about friendship and the loyalty between friends. Great wordings in the book!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"This was a very interesting book. As I read it I felt like Toad was a \`Prodigal Son', who came back only far enough to receive acceptance, then returned to his bad habits till he was in trouble again.It reminded me much of myself, playing at being Christian before really giving Christ all areas of my life. Like Toad I would repent, but then not really change.Rat was wise and resourceful, Mole was tender and caring and awe-full like a child yet also very wise. Badger is like a wise mature old mentor or guide, sent to give direction, and lead one to find one's own purpose in life.Yet the mix of Animal and Human society just did not make sense to me. It felt like a badly planned Narnia novel. It did not explain how the animal and human worlds came to interact and share a language or culture.But over all it was a fun read even if dry in some spots.(First written as Journal Reading Notes in 1999.)"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I bought this copy of Kenneth Grahame's wonderful classic because the illustrations were so lovely. When I read the book however, I realized that this book, albeit with beautiful illustrations, was heavily abridged. I am sorely disappointed by this, and feel it should be clearly marked in the labeling of the book."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I see that other reviewers have graded this edition down because it doesn't include certain favorite chapters.I wish people would review products for what they are, not what they wish they were; the book is clearly an abridgement and does not claim to be anything else. And it is really a very good abridgement. I often, reading to my 5 year old, have to make \\"on the fly\\" abridgements of my own, as I guage his patience, his interest, and the appropriateness of the subject matter. I didn't have to do that with this book.I also looked for \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" when I first opened this book and was saddened to see it wasn't there. But then I went online and found the text of it (as the book is out of copyright, there are a number of e-texts available). It's a truly gorgeous piece of writing - but it really is not going to appeal to the age range at which this book is aimed.The illustrations are lush and colorful, and (important detail when reading chapter books to someone moving up from picture books) there is at least one illustration of some kind on nearly every page. The chapters selected to be presented are vivid and interesting and a good introduction to the book for smaller children.When he's older, I'll read the full version to him - or hand it to him to read himself. But this book is a lovely thing in its own right."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I bought a similar Inga Moore version of this book for my son and we love it. The text has been \\"sensitively abridged\\" to make it appropriate for young children and the result is a delightful story that brings small animals to vivid life. Inga Moore's illustrations are what drew me to this book. They are wonderfully detailed and evocative of the beauty of the Thames Valley."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"This was probably one of my most favorite books when I was young. I remember my mother reading it to me and how wonderfully Mr. Grahame captured the countryside and the wonderful characters. All memorable!But now we come to this one. A totally beautifully illustrated rendition it is (though it really is hard in my mind to beat Ernest H. Shepard's wonderful Rat, Badger, Toad and all!). The reason for the 1 star is two fold. One, it's an abridged version. Yes, I know it's for consumption by younger folk. I was, however, maybe 4 or 5 when it was first read to me. Why do we continue to sell our children short? The biggest reason though for the poor rating is that several chapters have been left out. The one I have always loved the best is \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn.\\" A beautiful tale of heroism, compassion, and love. It's not in this edition. An outrage! I will NOT buy this book and I will certainly NOT recommend it to others!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"For those people who are not familiar with this timeless classic, it is the charming tale of a humble Mole who wanders down to the riverside one day, only to meet a new friend in the local water Rat, and thus begin a series of adventures that will introduce him to the lovable but foolish Toad and the brave but aloof Badger, and a host of other woodland creatures -- all of whom dress and act like people. Most of the action surrounds Toad's exploits and escapes, while most of the heart comes from the friendship between Mole and his friend Rat.It seems that reviewers either loved this book for the peerless color illustrations by Inga Moore, surpassing even the charm of Shepherd's original ink drawings, or they are deeply disappointed by the abridgement.I have to say that I fall into the first category. Moore's many charming and highly detailed pictures are a genuine treasure, and evoke the mood of the book and the personality of the characters pefectly. In my opinion they add to the experience of the book considerably.In the store, before I bought the book, I made a word-by-word comparison for some of the most memorable passages and found no differences whatsoever. So, from what I can gather, the abridgment seems to consist of leaving out a few episodes entirely, rather than shortening here and abbreviating there. I think this approach leaves far more of Kenneth Grahame's original voice intact - a very good thing indeed. I would also add that, at 180 pages, it's not an extensive abridgement; most of the original is still there.Why not all of it? I don't know. But don't let that stop you from buying this lovely book, another gem from the outstanding Candlewick Press."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"Yes, this book is abridged. And while I was disappointed in that at first, when I read it through I was struck by how well the edits had been done. The flavor of the language is left intact and flows beautifully; it is just shortened. The characters still shine through.Here is the first paragraph of Dulce Domum for comparison:This abridged version:The sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin nostrils and stamping with delicate forefeet, their heads thrown back and a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty air, as the two animals hastened by in high spirits. They were returning across country after a day's outing with Otter, and the shades of the short winter day were closing in. They had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now, leading from the sheep-pen, they found a beaten track.And the original text:The sheep ran huddling together against the hurdles, blowing out thin nostrils and stamping with delicate forefeet, their heads thrown back and a light steam rising from the crowded sheep-pen into the frosty air, as the two animals hastened by in high spirits, with much chatter and laughter. They were returning across country after a long day's outing with Otter, hunting and exploring on the wide uplands where certain streams tributary to their own river had their first small beginnings; and the shades of the short winter day were closing in on them, and they still had some distance to go. Plodding at random across the plough, they had heard the sheep and had made for them; and now, leading from the sheep-pen, they found a beaten track that made walking lighter business, and responded, moreover, to that small inquiring something which all animals carry inside them, saying unmistakably, 'Yes, quite right; this leads home!'Now, one could argue that there is important information in the complexity of the original version. And I would agree! For adults and most children I would fully recommend a full-strength, unabridged edition. But this rendition is a smashing introduction for the youngest listeners. And, with the bonus of the beautiful illustrations, this has become an edition that we often give to friends' children on their third, fourth or fifth birthdays.My only knock against is the missing chapters \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and \\"Wayfarers All.\\" But the strengths of the edition are enough to overcome even this egregious mistake."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I bought this book online for reading to our five-year-old, having never read it myself in childhood. Since there are lots of editions and I couldn't see them physically, I struggled a bit, but ended up picking the one with the illustrations I liked best, despite a somewhat higher cost. Aside from being a joy to read, this turns out to be the most gorgeous book I've bought in years. Not only are the illustrations painstaking, rich, and vivid, with a tone that fits the text perfectly -- and there are tons of them -- it is also a large-format hardback with a quality of paper and binding that you just don't see anymore. I would have expected to pay $30 or more for this if asked to guess the price. Every time I open it to read to my daughter I get a little thrill of pleasure just from the quality of the book itself. If it's abridged without acknowledgement, that's unfortunate, but I wouldn't let that deter you from buying this stunning edition."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"The soft whimsical full-page illustrations make this edition a keeper. I'd buy anything illustrated by Inga Moore if this is a representative sample of her work.Excellent accompaniment to the text. If you're a Grahame purist perhaps you might pass on it but most kids (and adults) would enjoy this edition."},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"The illustrations to this edition are all that one could ask for. If I were were rating the book on the strength of the artwork alone, I would give it 5 enthusiastic stars. The scenery is wonderfully evocative of the English Cotswolds, where I was fortunate to live for several years, and the depictions of the characters are perfectly in spirit with the writing.But why did the publishers (and, I must assume, Ms. Inga Moore, the illustrator) omit the book's two best chapters (\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\", and \\"Wayfarers All\\", Chapters 7 and 9). That inexplicible ommission would have dropped my rating (based on the text alone) to one star, were it not for the beautiful artwork. This edition is NOT the full \\"Wind in the Willows\\", but rather an abridged version (albeit with hauntingly beautiful illustrations).All in all, the book is worth buying (and giving to a young reader). But make sure, if you are intending this as a present, to accompany it with a full version of the book!"},{"Title":"The Wind in the Willows","review":"I just finished reading this to my three and six-year old. I was pleasantly surprised by how riveted they both were. This is the perfect read-to-your child book, full of warm and cozy images, adventures, comedy, and friendship. (I bought this when I was pregnant with my first and have been dying to read it to him!) There was a lot that went over their heads, but parents afraid their kids \\"won't get\\" higher-level material should know that kids pick up so much just through context and vocal expression. We will read the unabridged version when they get older- it is a book to be enjoyed at ANY age! (My kids loved Toad and his addiction to fast cars. They thought he was very very naughty!) Beautiful illustrations by Inga Moore. I thought it was tastefully edited."},{"Title":"Airplanes of the World, 1490 to 1962","review":"This was always a favorite book of mine from my youth. It's divided into different historical periods. Each period has a two or three page essay, then the main section has four or five airplanes on each page with a one or two sentence description. All the drawings by Douglas Rolfe are line drawings, but vary the aspect of the plane. They're very good.Douglas Rolfe was British and served in the RAF in WWII. Alexis Dawydoff was a Russian immigrant who came to the US and both were pilots and heavily involved in aviation careers.The book has just about every airplane you can think of up until 1962 ( believe the last revision was in 1971). The notable exception is that nowhere in the book is there any mention of any Japaness airplane! I'm not sure if the authors had some post-war grudge against the Japanese, or if they actually considered their aviation contributions to be that insignificant, or if they just weren't up to tackling all the different planes that the Japanese had. It's a question one probably won't get an answer to now- I think both authors are probably dead by now.It's definitely a neat book to thumb through and hardback copies don't seem to be very expensive. I got a used one for $5.00."},{"Title":"My Soul Thirsts: An Invitation to Intimacy With God","review":"This is an essential book for men and women who have been active in church for years but feel something isn't quite right. Their day-to-day Christianity is delivering a lot less than they had hoped. For them, God is a doctrine, not an intimate friend. This refreshingly practical book is about Intimacy with God from a guy who lives in the Silicon Valley, not a hermit's cave. Steve uses vivid metaphors and personal stories that slip biblical truth through the side doors of our hearts. He updates dusty labels on the jars of life-changing biblical truths like joy (for the \\"humor-impaired\\"), prayer/spiritual power (\\"overcoming life's obstacles\\"), knowing the Bible (\\"hearing God's voice with your whole being\\"), and authentic passion for God (\\"dancing in the Arms of God\\"), making them accessible and motivational! The thought provoking discussion questions at the end of each chapter make this an excellent choice for home Bible study groups or workplace Bible studies. Bottom line: Any follower of Jesus can have an intimate and adventurous relationship with God. It can happen and this book helps show the way!"},{"Title":"My Soul Thirsts: An Invitation to Intimacy With God","review":"This book expecially Chapters 3 and 5 changed my outlook on life. Thank you very much I would recommend this book to everyone who is searching for a deeper relationship with God."},{"Title":"My Soul Thirsts: An Invitation to Intimacy With God","review":"My Soul Thirsts is a rich feast of spiritual delights for Christians seeking a more intimate communion with their heavenly father. Korch covers a wide range of spiritual disciplines and dimensions and issues a challenge to every Christian, no matter how mature, to go deeper. This is a touchstone sort of a book that can be re-visited many times for thoughts and a spiritual tuneup. Korch uses many Biblical references, quotes and illustrations to help bring alive his message. Expect to be challenged by his direct, personal approach bundled with an easy-to-read, friendly style."},{"Title":"My Soul Thirsts: An Invitation to Intimacy With God","review":"Don't pick up this book!... if you're content with mediocrity in life. But if you are dissatisfied, willing, thirsty, there is something powerful about the dangerously transformative path described in these pages. Steve Korch is a master craftsman and communicator, who serves as our tour guide on this journey toward recapturing the essence of experiencing the very presence of God. He deftly brushes off the road signs that are too-often covered by the overgrown tangle of our religiosity, clearing our path toward real intimacy, joy and passion with Christ. There is something about the way Steve writes that resonates with the deep places of the soul; he masterfully peels back the layers so that God can chip away at the stony crust around the heart, to finally uncover and quench our deepest thirst in the One who loves us most, and who longs to be known by us.As a pastor, I love passing on a copy of this rich treasure to those who are tired of mere fads and fluff of religion, and yearn to have their thirst genuinely satisfied in a relationship with the living God. As someone simply longing for more of God's presence, this book has guided me through the twists and turns of rediscovering my own intimacy with God and reshaping my understanding and experience of a lifestyle transformed by Christ. I'm so thankful for how the Lord is using Steve's experiences and reflections to breathe truth and life into all who are thirsty for more."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"This book in the Hornblower series gives us the opportunity to observe Lieutenant Hornblower through the eyes of Lieutenant William Bush. Bush's perspective on Hornblower allows us to see some of why Hornblower is so able to advance in his naval career. Horblower's &quot;moral and physical courage&quot; make him attractive to his fellow naval officers and most likely this is what attracts the reader to Hornblower as well. Throughout the book we see Hornblower's courageous initiative mingled with his great respect for authority. He always knows just what to say to his commanding officers to move them in the right direction and he knows just how to say it so as not to usurp their authority or show disrespect. In the closing chapters we are also able to see that Hornblower is not simply a risk-taker when engaged in naval battle, but it is a part of his character in all situations and he always faces those risks with courage.I have now read Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and Lieutenant Hornblower - next up, Hornblower and the Hotspur.If you have seen the A&amp;E video series based on this book, you will find that there is quite a difference in the ending. I found the mutiny resolution to be much more satisfactory in the book."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"There is one word that best describes the Hornblower novels: Adventure! And 'Lieutenant Hornblower' is no exception. Indeed this is the novel where Hornblower's career in the Royal Navy really begins. From dealing with a half mad Captain to fighting off a Spanish attack on the decks of his ship this is one of the best of the Hornblower novels."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"No greater recommendation can be made than to note that the intrepid and honorable Horatio Hornblower is given as one of the great influences in the life of that other most-famous fictional Captain, one James Tiberius Kirk."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"This book perks up considerably after the \\"first\\" installment of Midshipman Hornblower. Told from an outside perspective (which works admirably, thanks to a likable and relatable narrator), it zips along with high stakes, good action, and some worthwhile character development. Looking forward to the next in the series."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I am a devoted member of the Jack Aubrey Fan Club. If you see me now read Hornblower, it is some kind of ancestry research, to find out about the descent of \`the man'.\`Lieutenant Hornblower' is #2 of 11 novels in the series in terms of plot chronology, but it was written later than some others, as a prequel. It was published in 1952. You get to meet Hornblower's sidekick Bush in the central position. Bush is the spotlighted protagonist, which allows observations of Hornblower as a man through other eyes. It seems he will be a regular friend of the hero in the series.To say it upfront: I still prefer Patrick O'Brian over Forester. And Aubrey over Hornblower. And Maturin over Bush.Granted, Forester is an efficient, direct narrator. He makes skillful use of narrative economics by not stretching out or explaining too much. The price we have to pay for this efficiency is a lack of much that I love in O'Brian, whose adventure stories are wrapped in history, zoology, botanics, geography, society, and all told in lovely language. Forester doesn't bother much with all that, and I can see how that is also in a way a strength.Bush does not remotely have the personality and breadth of Maturin. Based on this one novel I also don't see Hornblower as complex and interesting as Aubrey.The ship that brings the two young lieutenants Bush and Hornblower together in service is captained by a paranoid conspiracy freak, who suspects evil designs and mutiny behind the most harmless small talk. It is a reign of terror on this ship. On the way to the Caribbean during the Napoleonic Wars, the captain overdoes his zeal and has an accident.The mutiny that he feared becomes superfluous. First Lieutenant takes charge, but turns out a bad decision maker. In the hour of need the ship is lucky to have talented 5th lieutenant Hornblower, who gets ample opportunity to show his military capabilities. We get a fairly standard war story focusing on a Spanish position on Hispaniola during the Haitian slave revolution. The ship subdues the Spanish and takes 3 of their ships as prizes. On the way to Jamaica they have to overcome an attempted mutiny by the Spanish prisoners.At arrival in Jamaica there is a lot to explain: what happened to the first captain? How did the ship achieve the stunt against the Spanish? How could it let the prisoners come near to taking the ship?All in all, I am impressed but not overwhelmed. Among the two main themes, i.e. the social problem with the paranoid captain and the actual story of war with the Spanish in the Caribbean, the one that is really interesting is the social one, not the fighting. Forester's priorities seem to be more on the fighting, which he narrates with obvious competence. That alone will however not talk me into expanding my excursions in Hornblower territory.However, given my habitual serial addiction, I just might look some more...P.S. an interesting footnote on language: Forester lets the officers of the Renown call their captain 'mad as a hatter'. That made me suspect anachronism, but the idiom seems to be traceable to the 18th century. So says Wiki."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"The second installment of the Hornblower series builds on the title character in a different way than the first book, &quot;Mr. Midshipman Hornblower.&quot; Instead of experiencing events through Horatio, we instead view his character through the eyes of Lieutenant Bush. And, instead of a collection of short adventures, the reader is submerged into an interesting series of connected events that further define the way Hornblower composes himself in the heat of battle.It is very rare that one comes across a sequel that is better than the first. Instead of building one character, you build two, and you build the one through the other. Aside from the wonderful array of descriptive adventures, Forester weaves new character relationships that are sure to drive further plot lines.This is a wonderful book, and is sure to keep the reader hooked on the series."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I've only read through Hotspur (#3 in chronological order), but I'd have to say this has been my favorite so far. I believe I read it in two days (and I'm a slow reader). This book incorporates great sub-plots (i.e. the suspiciously Queeg-esque captain), introduces Bush, and continues the development of Horatio from scrawny sea-cadet into naval war genius and hero. Most of the action takes place in the Caribbean, and I really hope more of the action goes back there in the later novels. The region and history come alive in Forester's wonderfully simple narrative, and the plot always manages to take new twists and turns in every chapter. Although I'm no expert, I'd imagine this is an accurate depiction of life as an early 19th century naval officer. I know it's exciting!Bottom line: a joyous read for anyone with an interest in naval warfare, military fiction, historical fiction, or just looking for a good adventure novel."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Wonderful book. Between the introduction, where we see Hornblower, with the Lts Bush and Buckland, suffering under the already half-mad Captain Sawyer, to planned revolt, to various successful and unsuccessful Navel actions, to Hornblower's and Bush's near-poverty under the peace, and finally, to Hornblower's confirmation of promotion to Commander at the renewal of war, we see all aspects of the key characters in full color, in fact, I myself nearly gave a shout of joy when Hornblower recieved the letter confirming his promotion. Worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower is not a novel that should be read in isolation. It was originally published in the early 50s after the success of earlier, although chronologically later, Hornblower books and a movie. Forester's purpose was to show the development of the character of Hornblower while providing a good sea story in itself. He succeeded on both accounts.Lieutenant Hornblower is set in 1803, several years after Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. We are told nothing of what has occurred to Hornblower in years preceding the book. Lieutenant Hornblower is seen through the eyes of Lieutenant William Bush, a brother officer, who although slightly senior comes increasingly to look to Hornblower for leadership. Although initially distrusting, Bush sees greatness in Hornblower and the two develop a strong friendship. Bush is portrayed as a dull, stodgy and not too bright English career naval officer. He is also a very decent man and solid friend. One is reminded of the friendship between Holmes and Watson and Conan Doyle's device; which was to make Holmes appear more brilliant by making Watson appear to be slow. In fact, I could imagine a young Basil Rathbone and a young Nigel Bruce playing the Hornblower and Bush roles.As the novel runs its course, the two men overcome a mad captain, a Spanish fort, an attempt by prisoners to overtake the ship, a night in the fleshpots of the Caribbean, a court of inquiry, and perhaps most challenging of all, peace. Forester skillfully develops Hornblower's character while creating some unanswered questions. Was Hornblower responsible for the mad captain's downfall? What was the relationship between Hornblower and the servant girl in London? We learn more about Hornblower but mystery is maintained, perhaps even enhanced.One of the most important things that we learn about Hornblower is that while he is a brilliant warrior, he is also highly aware of war's cost. Hornblower is a reluctant warrior but when driven to fight, he does his duty magnificently. Written as it was shortly after the end of World War II, one can see that Forester was striking a chord in both Britain and the United States. The men of the RN and USN would be the legitimate descendants of Horatio Hornblower.Like Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower does not reach its climax with a battle scene. Instead the climax is a game of wist. During peacetime, Hornblower is reduced to playing wist to survive and must gamble his limited resources to stay afloat. Britons must have been able to relate strongly to this post war poverty. Americans conversely could recognize the gambling scene from any number of westerns. As always, Forester is able to meet the conflicting demands of both British and American readers."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I am new to these Forrester stories on the fictional Hornblower and just love them. The are so real and refreshing and honorable in this increasingly cold and non-spiritual world. And, as a sailor, I found the sailing descriptions to be totally accurate and very interesting.The particular book is very old with yellowed pages but otherwise in good condition. Someone covered the torn but original cover in plastic which was a nice touch, preserving that original cover."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower occurs second in the series by internal chronology, though it was the seventh-written book. Unlike every other book in the series, this one is related from the point of view of Lieutenant William Bush. This alternate point of view allows Hornblower to be presented as a legitimately heroic figure, though it does deprive the reader of the internal thought process of the series' protagonist. The text provides solid background on Hornblower's early career as a lieutenant. Written as a novel, it paces well and has an authentic texture. Indeed, the small-scale combat action is so gripping that in many ways the book eclipses volumes in the series which deal with Hornblower's later career.Plot Summary (with spoilers):The novel takes place from May 1800 to March 1803 aboard a cruise of HMS Renown, a 74-gun frigate. The ship's captain, Sawyer, is dangerously paranoid and believes the lieutenants and warrant officers are plotting mutiny against him. To circumvent their putative desire, Sawyer panders to the crew, encouraging them to be lazy and insolent, and issues additional rations of grog. The situation becomes untenable as Renown reaches its cruising grounds near Haiti. Even so, nobody will take the decision action of attempting to remove Sawyer from command.Fortunately, Sawyer falls down a hatchway and receives a serious injury. There is intrigue surrounding his fall, but no actual witnesses to the accident. Upon Sawyer's physical recovery it is evident his mind is gone--he sobs hysterically and cringes away from everyone. Buckland, the senior lieutenant, takes ostensible command. The unimaginative Buckland botches the ship's primary mission, but disaster is averted when Hornblower proposes an audacious recovery.From that point forward, it is Hornblower who guides the ship as he influences Buckland subtly but correctly. Indeed, the theme of Hornblower leading his superior officers is a dominant thread in the narrative. The ship carries out other duties with great success until Hornblower is placed aboard a prize--whereupon Renown is almost seized by prisoners. Hornblower once again comes to the rescue and recaptures the ship. The novel ends with Hornblower losing his job because of the Peace of Amiens. He takes up lodging in a public house, makes a meager living by playing whist, develops his friendship with Bush, and meets the young Marie Mason."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower is a tale of honor and courage in an era of gallantry and revolution. A wonderful read, the diction clear and concise and yet filled with the \\"language of the sea\\". It is a joy to read, especially for the jaded modern-day soul. I refuse to give away plot to those who haven't seen the A&E movies (which interpreted this book very well in my opinion)...for that, they will have to go to other reviewers!! Read away there! Lively, now!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower by C. S. Forester. Recommended.Lieutenant Hornblower, set in the early 1800s during the Napoleonic Wars, is the second book chronologically in the 11-part Horatio Hornblower series. Forester is a master of combining exciting plots, recognizable characters, realistic naval and period information, and interesting historical detail. As you read Lieutenant Hornblower, you will see how even modern science fiction television and films, from Star Trek to Star Wars, owe a debt to Forester's story-telling technique.This time, Hornblower is seen from the perspective of a more senior lieutenant, Bush, as they serve aboard Renown. Bush, himself a decisive, strong, if unimaginative, leader, finds himself redefining and expanding his concepts of leadership and command as he observes Hornblower's interactions with his junior and senior officers. Hornblower subtly guides them to the actions and decisions that he wants from them without overstepping the top-down chain-of-command structure of the 1800s British navy, in which the captain enjoys the omnipotence granted by the king over crew and officers alike. Hornblower's approach even anticipates today's most current thinking about the nature of corporate leadership.As a character, Hornblower can be too perfect. His suggestions and his actions are always on target and successful, and it is he who saves Renown and her mission time and again. Even when he makes a rare mistake, for example, overheating the shot so that it will no longer fit in the cannons, the error does not affect the outcome of the venture.Forester tries to humanize Hornblower, whom Bush notices carefully hiding his emotions and frailties-even hunger and poverty-lest anyone perceive his weakness. Interestingly, Hornblower survives the paranoia of a mad captain, the indecisiveness and incompetence of an inept first lieutenant, harrowing sea and land battles with the Spanish, and delicate diplomatic maneuverings with the Spanish and with the highest levels of naval representatives, only to succumb to an unattractive but smitten woman.Throughout the novel, there is one recurring question that Hornblower avoids answering. Bush asks it, as does Buckland, the lackluster first lieutenant. Depending on how you perceive the underlying situation-and what you believe the real answer to be-you could see it as a positive reflection on Hornblower's character, or a disturbing aspect of it. Forester deliberately raises this point repeatedly; it adds mystery and a human dimension to a character who could otherwise have become a stock hero, always correct and always victorious (at least in war and politics).If you're like me and love sea adventure, Lieutenant Hornblower is a must-read. Forester is able to explain the workings of a sailing vessel and the machines of war without sounding overly technical, mechanical, or tedious. He portrays the harsh discipline of the British navy so well that you will understand why sailors rapidly disappeared when the press gang was spotted; there was little question of patriotism, only one of self-preservation. Forester also plants in the imagination the horrors of war, where even lieutenants can be cut in two by cannonballs or tormented by mad captains, where decks become slippery with the blood and guts and limbs of the fallen.Lieutenant Hornblower is an exciting, fast-paced read that may convince you to investigate the rest of the series.Diane L. Schirf, 30 June 2004."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower, 2nd in the series, was a super great read. It is full of action; from a crazy ship captain to a land assualt on a fortified fort. Throughout the story, Hornblower again, and again, rises up to meet the challenges that confront him. Without spoiling the book for readers that haven't read it yet, this was one super good book. To give you an idea of how enjoyable this book was; After reading only part of this book, I went ahead and ordered the rest of the books in the series; that is how much I enjoyed this book! I enjoyed the 1st book in the series, Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. I became addicted to this book! You will not be disappointed in reading this one! I can't wait to read the next one; Hornblower and the Hotspur."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"The second book in the Hornblower series the action and the tension in the book made living on a ship of the line more exciting than in reality. Usually serving on a boat, you'd expect to do tedious duties with nothing else except endless ocean across the horizon to look at in the distance. Couple that with the unpleasantness of living conditions aboard a ship of that age with no running water, toilets, or knowledge about contemporary hygiene as well as being commanded by a strict and almost tyrannical command structure and its no wonder that the Royal Navy had to recruit their seamen by force through press gangs.The book's plot tells the story from the perspective of Lieutenant William Bush who had just been assigned to the ship Renown. It is here that he meets Hornblower and go on their crew's secret assignment only known by a suspiciously psychotic captain who thinks that the other officers are planning against him. There is a sense of tension between the captain and his officers as well as injustices that the captain inflicts upon his subordinates. There is also a first lieutenant on board, Buckland, that has served that position for a long time and through his personality the reader will soon realize why he will always be a first lieutenant. Forester has a good vision of putting characters together and making them interact in interesting situations. In reading this book you get to see the personalities of these characters take shape and it is these personalities that direct the plot. About two-thirds of the book was interesting but the last third fizzled and didn't have action at all. Considering that the book is part of a series, the last third was setting up the premise for the next book. But if you read this book on its own you would be disappointed with the ending as the climax of the story happened about a hundred pages before the ending. I consider myself a fan of Forester and I still like the book. Nevertheless, for a casual reader this probably wouldn't be as interesting."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I am very much enjoying this series of novels. I just wish that there were move novels in the series. Lots of excitement and adventure in these novels."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I read this and the other books in the series as a teenager and thoroughly enjoyed them. This book is perhaps the most famous of the series, even though it is the middle one! As well as being actioned packed, it offers a glimpse into what being in the Royal Navy must have been like when Britannia ruled the waves. Horatio seems to be loosely based on Admiral Horatio Nelson. I highly recommend this for teenagers. I recently watched the British-made TV series based on the books (which I see is now available as a boxed set of DVDs) and got a huge kick out of it (although the ship appeared a little scaled down!). So it is highly recommended for adults too!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"While reading 'Lt. Hornblower' It was enjoyable to experience the strong imagery of the white puffed sails contrasting the wave's of a blue ocean while the stretched rigging lines scream of tension to capture the trade winds. I could close my eyes and imagine standing on the quarterdeck of these great wooden walled ships that crack and groan from the ocean's waves which relentlessly attempt to pull the ship to the bottom of the ocean. EUREKA!Then the suspenseful action packed fun begins. From amphibious invasions to mutiny along with the further character development of Horatia Hornblower encouraged me to rate this book with 5 stars! More importantly there is a slight angle of a life lesson embedded within the story. 'You don't know how much you love something until you lose it'..."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Surely, Horatio Hornblower is the most gallant of all in historical fiction. Throughout all the Hornblower novels, C.S Forester introduce us the naval career of Hornblower. Despite Hornblower's sad family background, he endures the hardship of life in the Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, when he starts off as a Midshipman. Through the years, he gains reputation- the &quot;Terror of the Mediterranean&quot;. In Lieutenant Hornblower, he suffers under the command of the crazy Captain Sawyer. Although he is the Junior Lieutenant, he saves the ship from the batteries of Samana, by coming up with his ingenious ideas. Near the end, they are in danger of declared guilty of mutiny."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Unique in the Hornblower series we see the story written from the perspective of Lieutenant Bush who begins as his superior officer and finishes as his junior (maybe?) It is a well written book which gives a better perspective to both characters. As always a ripping and accurate yarn of the sea and the times. Strangely it sufferes in comparison to the latest of the Hornblower series from A&amp;E simply since the Characters of Hobbs and Captian Sawyer are fleshed out in the series but not in this book as much. Since the book is written in the eyes of Bush this could not be helped but it is a minor point. As always we see resourcefullness , action and of course Whist. A great book from a great series. It's worth the money."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Vintage Hornblower. His progress up the ladder of command is fascinating, exciting and always entertaining. Forester is a master at painting an excellent word picture that gives the reader a feeling of \\"having beent there\\" as to life on an 18th-19th century British ship of war. For anyone enjoying the Hornblower series I would strongly recommend \\"The White Jacket\\"[ASIN:1598180703 White Jacket] by Herman Melville. It is a superbe account of life on an American ship of war during the same period of time as Hornblower. If you have served in the navy, be glad it was in the 20th-21st centuries."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"The novel is narrated through the eyes of Lt. William Bush, and begins when Hornblower greets Bush as the latter comes aboard the 74 gun British battleship HMS Renown (a third-rate ship-of-the-line, not a frigate). Bush and Hornblower are both lieutenants (above midshipmen, but below commanders and captains), and they quickly establish that Bush is senior to Hornblower. Bush will be the third lieutenant whereas Hornblower will be the fifth lieutenant. Bush emerges as a man of action, brave and competent, but not terribly bright.In the early weeks of the voyage, it becomes apparent that the captain is paranoid and insane, and the first problem becomes what to do about him. He eventually is permanently incapacitated by a \\"fall\\" down a ladder between decks; the strong implication is that Hornblower took matters into his own hands, but he is far too smart to let on, even by a wink or a facial expression, that he did so.Command goes to the 1st Lieutenant, Buckland, who is dull and indecisive. The conceit of the novel is that Hornblower is a prodigy at naval warfare who manages to remotely captain the ship through his superior officers by means of tactful suggestions to the latter. He proves to be not only a genius at naval warfare, but also a genius at diplomatically managing his senior lieutenants, and prodding them to take what (to him) is the obvious course of action.The last third of the novel is quite slow, and is mainly about how, in peacetime, Hornblower is reduced to poverty and is forced to support himself by playing whist (a trick-taking game similar to Bridge) for money. A superman is hard to identify with, and I think Forester realized that he had made Hornblower a bit too much of a naval genius and that, for purposes of drama and human interest, Hornblower would have to have bad luck in the timing of his career, and also be very awkward around the fair sex.One slightly anachronistic technical term is \\"port,\\" as in port and starboard, whereas at the time \\"larboard\\" and starboard were used for (bow-oriented) left and right. Port replaced larboard only later, in the 1840s. But I think it a nice aspect of the Hornblower novels that Forester does not try to overwhelm and befuddle us with period-accurate language and terminology."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I first read this book decades ago when it was originally published, and I remember enjoying it thoroughly in my youth. It has weathered the years nicely, but now threatens to be done-in by a shabbily edited edition for the Kindle.I have no idea why it should have been such a challenge to port this over to the Kindle, but the copy editing is atrocious; it gives the appearance of an OCR conversion that was unchecked by any human. It's hard to excuse 5 to 10 copyediting errors per chapter, which is often the case in this book. By way of comparison, my recent reading of the Kindle version of \\"A Dance with Dragons\\", a book of about 1000 pages, had perhaps a dozen such errors in toto.The bottom line: read the book, but not on the Kindle. A shame really, as the Kindle is a very nice piece of technology. Too bad the content here was so lackadaisically edited.One final note: when reading this series, you will often find it useful to have access to a compendium of nautical terms,many of which do not appear in the Kindle's very useful reference documents."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Before reading this book, I had seen the A&E; Horatio Hornblower miniseries. Then I began with the books by readingHornblower : Beat to Quarters(the first Horatio Hornblower book written, Hornblower is an experienced captain) and thenMr. Midshipman Hornblower (Hornblower Saga)(Hornblower in his early days at sea). The first was good, but a poor starting point, beginning midway through his career. The second was enjoyable and provided a good introduction to Hornblower, but as a collection of short stories, it could feel a bit disjointed at times.This book, Lieutenant Hornblower, is when I felt the real fun began. This book is where the plot for the 5th and 6th TV episodes, Mutiny and Retribution, came from. This is Horatio Hornblower at his best, brilliant, daring, but also prone to seasickness and nerves at times. This book shows Hornblower through the eyes of Lieutenant Bush, who is senior to Hornblower, and it's interesting to see him through another's more objective eyes. Hornblower has a tendency to second-guess himself and overlook his own accomplishments. In this book, Hornblower proves his mettle and his leadership as a junior lieutenant. We see the strengths that allow him to lead men senior to him, but also see his flaws. There's plenty of adventure and character development.As a starting point to this series, I recommendMr. Midshipman Hornblowerfirst, but starting with this book wouldn't be that bad either. I look forward to continuing on through the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"C.S Forester is a wonderful writer. I love his Hornblower series. It was recommneded by a friend, who had read all of them, to read his books. My friend said he thought them better than Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturan series. I disagree, having read all 21 of the O'Brian books. Forester is long on action but short on the in depth character development that O'Brian excels. I love them both, but O'Brian was the better writer of books of this genre.

He's a man of rules and regulations, and if I may quote a different book for a minute, \\"The skies would fall before Bush neglected his duty.\\"Lieutenant Hornblower is the sole book NOT in Horatio Hornblower's point of view, but obviously, Lieutenant Bush's. At first, we see Hornblower as a cold, unfeeling youth.

This book is key to understanding not only Bush's character, but Hornblower's as well. Hornblower's lack of self-confidence DOES play in when *minor spoiler* he loads the cannons with shot that get too hot. Bush notes that this is the first, and only (according to him) mistake Hornblower's made, and is amused by the man's frustration at being what Hornblower calls himself, \\"a careless son of a swab.\\"Now I am ending this before I practically rewrite the ENTIRE book, but I highly recommend this book, and once my late paycheck comes in, I shall DEFINATELY buy this first."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I could not put this book down.

This one is probably tied in my mind with \\"Beat to Quarters\\" as the best Hornblower novel. The Horatio Hornblower series by C.S. Forester is, quite simply, the best in naval adventure literature.In this novel, the Renown is dispatched to the West Indies on a secret mission. The captain becomes incapacitated, and the ship's second in command is nowhere near up to the job of captaining the Renown. Hornblower's intelligence and leadership ability must overcome the fact that he is a junior officer who must at all times be deferential to his superiors. And yet only Hornblower has a clear idea as to how the Renown might accomplish its mission. How he handles his superior officers under these circumstances is a wonderful study in character and leadership.This is a novel about leadership, and how Hornblower, an emerging leader, deals with a series of crises. This book starts at a sprint and before it is done it breaks the sound barrier--the action never stops, and yet somehow in this novel there is time for analysis and introspection also. Forester's writing is fast-paced, his storyline never dawdles or drags.This is one you'll want in hardbound form.

And I must say, it's one of the better books. CS Forester could be a compelling writer, but some of the Hornblower novels feel a little disjointed. Not this one.Lieutenant Hornblower is written from the point of view of Lieutenant Bush, whom Hornblower meets in this book. The result is that Hornblower is a more interesting character. It also, unlike some of the other books in the series, primarily covers a single plotline dealing with Hornblower's last mission as a lieutenant, so it hangs together very well. The result is a book that I had trouble putting down until I had read the whole thing.

It was originally published in the early 50s after the success of earlier, although chronologically later, Hornblower books and a movie. Forester's purpose was to show the development of the character of Hornblower while providing a good sea story in itself. He succeeded on both accounts.Lieutenant Hornblower is set in 1803, several years after Mr. Midshipman Hornblower. We are told nothing of what has occurred to Hornblower in years preceding the book. Lieutenant Hornblower is seen through the eyes of Lieutenant William Bush, a brother officer, who although slightly senior comes increasingly to look to Hornblower for leadership. Although initially distrusting, Bush sees greatness in Hornblower and the two develop a strong friendship. Bush is portrayed as a dull, stodgy and not too bright English career naval officer. He is also a very decent man and solid friend. One is reminded of the friendship between Holmes and Watson and Conan Doyle's device; which was to make Holmes appear more brilliant by making Watson appear to be slow. In fact, I could imagine a young Basil Rathbone and a young Nigel Bruce playing the Hornblower and Bush roles.As the novel runs its course, the two men overcome a mad captain, a Spanish fort, an attempt by prisoners to overtake the ship, a night in the fleshpots of the Caribbean, a court of inquiry, and perhaps most challenging of all, peace. Forester skillfully develops Hornblower's character while creating some unanswered questions. Was Hornblower responsible for the mad captain's downfall? What was the relationship between Hornblower and the servant girl in London? We learn more about Hornblower but mystery is maintained, perhaps even enhanced.One of the most important things that we learn about Hornblower is that while he is a brilliant warrior, he is also highly aware of war's cost. Hornblower is a reluctant warrior but when driven to fight, he does his duty magnificently. Written as it was shortly after the end of World War II, one can see that Forester was striking a chord in both Britain and the United States. The men of the RN and USN would be the legitimate descendants of Horatio Hornblower.Like Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, Lieutenant Hornblower does not reach its climax with a battle scene. Instead the climax is a game of wist. During peacetime, Hornblower is reduced to playing wist to survive and must gamble his limited resources to stay afloat. Britons must have been able to relate strongly to this post war poverty. Americans conversely could recognize the gambling scene from any number of westerns. As always, Forester is able to meet the conflicting demands of both British and American readers."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"It's hard to write an objective review of Lieutenant Hornblower, chronologically the second novel in Forester's epic saga. Put simply, this was the book that addicted me to Horatio Hornblower and condemned to spend a small fortune acquiring the entire series.This tells the tale of Horatio's first real mission. He is assigned to the Renown, a ship of the line destined to fight Napoleon in the Caribbean. It is here that Horatio really begins to distinguish himself -- helping his crew deal with a mad captain, then leading them into the teeth of a powerful Spanish presence in Haiti. We see his decisiveness, his daring and his courage -- as well as his darker side.This book is cunningly different from others in the series in that Hornblower is not the main character. Rather, we see him through Lieutenant Bush -- destined to become one of Horatio's closest companions. At first, Hornblower seems distant and aloof. With Bush, we question his abilities and courage. And like Bush, we quickly see Horatio's heroism and intelligence. And it ends with a flourish that will have you scrambling to amazon to buy the next volume.Once again, I must deduct a little bit for Forester's occasionally opaque description of the working of a ship of the line. But most of the time, he makes the action clear as crystal. During the most intense rivetting action scenes, I was never confused as to what was going on.This is where the Hornblower series really takes off. Don't even hesitate to buy it."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"As a long-time fan of the Hornblower series, I had not read Lieutenant Hornblower for many years. Imagine my surprise upon rereading this outstanding book when I discovered that Lieutenant Hornblower is a remarkable primer on management!If you have not yet read Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, I strongly urge you to read that book before starting Lieutenant Hornblower. Lieutenant Hornblower is written from the perspective of one of Hornblower's superior officers, a senior lieutenant named William Bush. Bush is a master at getting a ship to perform under all circumstances, but has placed little emphasis on how to defeat the enemy. Without the background of Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, I'm afraid you will miss some of the nuances of what the author is suggesting in the book.The book opens with Hornblower as the newest and most junior lieutenant on the Renown, a British ship of war about to head off on a lengthy cruise to parts as not yet disclosed. Captain Sawyer immediately begins accusing his lieutenants and midshipmen of conspiring to undermine his authority. At the same time, Captain Sawyer cannot do enough for his crew, including extra grog rations. Discipline is rapidly diminishing. What's a young lieutenant to do with a captain who isn't getting the job done? You will find the story fascinating if you imagine being a newly appointed general manager of a small division in a company where the CEO is running the firm into the ground. If the firm goes down, so do you!Later, the ship finds itself under difficult orders, orders which if followed in the usual way will lead to death, destruction, and failure. What do you do now as a junior person in the situation? You certainly cannot dictate . . . but perhaps you might tactfully suggest alternatives. This circumstance recurs in the novel, and I draw your attention to the adroit way that Hornblower combines respect, a sense of his place, and timely suggestions to provide the same leadership that he might have applied as captain.Students of game theory will also be fascinated by the ways that Mr. Forester included those kinds of concepts into the decisions that Hornblower makes.In the end of the book, Hornblower has fallen on hard times. How he responds is a lesson to us all. He sees adversity as a temporary setback that will be redressed in due time by a shift in circumstances to match the underlying odds, not unlike sticking to good strategy for winning at cards. A strategy may not always win, but an effective one will win more often than not and will be profitable to pursue (such as card-counting in playing blackjack).Hornblower also finds himself the potential beneficiary of kindness from friends. You will be interested to see how he is affected and how he responds.Lead from wherever you are!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower is definitely one of the best books in C.S. Forrester's classic series! Set aboard the 74 gun ship of the line Renown, we see a Hornblower that is only apparent in this book. He still young enough to be the boyish hero, but with a maturity that gives him a presence that everyone from the lowest seaman to the highest admiral recognizes and respects. We see the birth of the lifelong friendship that forms between the loyal lieutenant William Bush and Hornblower. Bush outranks him, and is initially suspicious of our brilliant young hero, but soon grows to respect and like him as their captain's madness threatens the ship. This novel is unique in the Hornblower saga as it is told entirely from the perspective of Bush. This prevents the reader from having to listen to all the self doubt that plagues poor Horatio, which can get rather annoying after you've read 10 books of it. I wouldn't recommend starting with this book, as it is set between Mr. Midshipman Hornblower and Hornblower and the Hotspur. Follow a loyal reader's advice, and start with one of the Captain books. But, definitely read this one as soon as you can. The battles, the scenery, and even the characters are described in Forrester's typical fashion, in deep detail. The details really make the novel come to life. I would also recommend seeing the excellent Horatio Hornblower movies done by A&amp;E. The Welsh actor who portrays Hornblower, Ioan Gruffudd, does an absolutely amazing job. See the movies, it doesn't matter whether you've read the books or not. Start these books when you've got a lot of free time, because I guarantee that you won't be able to put them down!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"In this book Lieutenant Hornblower finds himself on a ship with a paranoid captain and a crew unfit for duty. But soon the ship finds itself under fire from heated shot, in a battle with Spanish prisoners (many of them women) and Hornblower comes out as a energy filled man of action (who still gets seasick). But right when things look great and it looks like Hornblower is about to go like a rocket up the chain of command the war ends. Oh, the horror. But don't worry, it always looks darkest before the dawn.(If you like the Hornblower series, make sure to look for books on naval history. Lots of good ones out there.)"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Young Mr. Gruffudd makes a marvelous performance and his well trained acting abilities pour through with astounding affect! He slides easily in and out of characters and accents. There's never a break to make one lose the feel and atmosphere of the story. And, he delivers the story surely as real as C.S. Forester could have dreamed it! One need only to close ones eyes and be taken back into the days of Horatio Hornblower!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"C. S. Forester wrote many novels, including \\"The African Queen,\\" but is best known for the successful Hornblower series. The novels were written out of order and, in this novel, Forester stepped back to fill in the details of Hornblower's service as a lieutenant. This is the novel where he first meets Bush, who figures prominantly in other novels in the series (up through \\"Lord Hornblower\\" where Bush is killed).The story is well known, although the latest motion picture (made for TV) series changed the details. Hornblower and Bush are serving under a somewhat sadistic captain, until the captain falls down a hatchway, is disabled, and later is conveniently killed. Hornblower is given the chance to distinguish himself, and plays a major role in carrying out the ship's successful mission. He survives when others fall.Hornblower is given a field commission as Commander but, alas, the Peace of Amiens brings a temporary end to the war, and his commission is not confirmed. He finds himself on the beach as a half-pay lieutenant under stoppages, supporting himself as a whist player.It is his ability at whist that puts him in the right place at the right time, and leads to the next novel in the series, \\"Hornblower and the Hotspur.\\" This is also when he meets the woman who will become his first wife.Forester was an exceptional writer, particularly when filling in Hornblower's early career after the fact. Most of his novels were about naval warfare, although \\"The General,\\" \\"Rifleman Dodd,\\" and \\"The Gun\\" were about land warfare. \\"The African Queen\\" was a somewhat unique book, taking place during World War I, mostly on a river - it was a popular motion picture."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Hornblower is as valiant and human as ever in this book. His involvement in the carribean campaign lets his true worth shine to all. It is also a dark chapter in the life of the hero though, as he faces a possible life of never being in the service of his country as a sailor again. Yet, Lieutenant Hornblower is an excellent book in the series. Lieutenant Hornblower differs from its predicessor in that the view has changed from Hornblower himself to his shipmate and friend, lieutenant Bush. But what Bush sees in Hornblower is completely satisfying to the readers view of the hero of the story. Forester has a magnificent writing style that leads the reader to subtle, yet poignant observations of the characters and plot. He is never so rude to address difficult subjects without a tremendous amount of tact and honor. His knowledge of the sea and life therein is impeccable. His knowledge of human nature is similarly trustworthy and completely satisfying from cover to cover"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Unlike all the others, this story is seen through Bush's eyes. The trick only partially works for me. The first part seems to copy the Mutiny on the Bounty, and it drags on until the ship reaches Haiti.However the last three chapters present the best single Horatio Hornblower episode ever. During the Peace of Amiens, HH is reduced to playing whilst in the Long Rooms for his living. His landlady, Mrs. Mason, is after him for his overdue rent. Mrs. Mason's daughter, Maria, on the pretext of cleaning his coat, slips a half-crown into HH's coat. When HH reaches into his pocket-the man who fires the broadsides that freed the Renown from the mud; who storms the Spanish fort; and who recaptures the Renown from the prisoners - he blanches.After HH wins big at whilst that night, he tells Bush that he wishes the money had come a day earlier. Before shipping out again, he repays the 2s. 6d. by marrying Maria even though he knows he is making a mistake. The last sentence of the novel sums up their relationship succinctly. 'And already there was something a little proprietorial about the adoration, and perhaps there was something wistful about the kindness.'"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"This book was requested by my 19 year old daughter.

Lieutenand Hornblower flowed much more smoothly and had greater character development and rates a solid 5 stars."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower (1952) is C. S. Forester's second Hornblower novel chronologically, seventh by publication. Horatio Hornblower, now a lieutenant, is serving on HMS Renown under the mad Captain Sawyer, who sees mutiny all around him. At the same time, Renown is sent to the West Indies on a mission to take a Spanish base. Following the resolution of these dramas, Hornblower's career is threatened by the Peace of Amiens.This novel introduces William Bush, Hornblower's fellow officer, who becomes Hornblower's good friend and who appears in most of the chronologically succeeding novels. Bush is a phlegmatic character, and a thoroughly competent, if unimaginative, officer. Lieutenant Hornblower is told from his perspective rather than Hornblower's. This spares the reader all of Hornblower's inner drama, self-criticism and inadequacies, and Hornblower comes off (through Bush's eyes) as slightly eccentric but purely heroic.Forester does a fantastic job of character development here (much better than in the previous Mr. Midshipman Hornblower). Lieutenants Bush, Buckland and Hornblower are all well done and well fleshed out - each man has distinctly unique strengths, weaknesses, desires, concerns, and personality. Forester gives the reader some particular insight into Hornblower's character at the end of the novel, when, because of the cessation of hostilities, Hornblower must earn his living as a gambler. The man always does the charitable thing, the caring thing, and yet he does it not because he necessarily cares genuinely, but because he is bent on mastering himself, and, as far as possible, overcoming the weakness of his humanity.Lieutenant Hornblower has an excellent mix of action, drama and suspense. It seems like the use of archaic naval jargon is less here than it was in Mr. Midshipman Hornblower, but perhaps I've gotten used to it, or, perhaps, the superior storytelling has marginalized its distractive impact. Lieutenant Hornblower also has several of those great little moments, those quirky, memorable instances that define both a character and a book.In all, Lieutenant Hornblower is an entertaining, well-written book, and as good a work in this genre as you're likely to find."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Forester's work combines great drama with a sailor's insight.

However, this book is structured a little differently from the rest, from the eyes of Lieutenant William Bush, who will follow behind Hornblower in many more novels."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"C.S Forester describes every action so clearly that you can almost hear the cannons firing. His fight scenes are wonderful, you can't help but love the main character, and the history... all together the series is one of the best historical fiction series ever written!"},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"This series is about Horatio Hornblower as he progresses through the ranks of the British Navy during the Napoleonic Wars. It's similar to Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin series. I prefer Aubrey/Maturin because I find the characters and plot a lot more intricate, but this series is worth reading if you like this genre.I enjoyed the plot but don't want to give too much away. This is one of the better books in the series, and I think it's mostly because of Lieutenant Bush. Bush just seems to be a more interesting, intricate character than the other books that I've read (I'm through Flying Colours). Hornblower is a more likable character. The Maria character is shallow and almost an afterthought.I have given this book a 4. The 5 stars rating has always been a bit too arbitrary to me. For me, a 5 is a book that 1) I would recommend to others regardless of whether they read the genre and 2) will most likely reread again in the near future. A 4 is one that 1) I'd recommend if they like the genre and 2) may read again. A 3 I liked, a 2 was just ok, and a 1 was a waste of time and is a strong candidate for the next church used book sale fundraiser."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"This is arguably the best book as \\"literary work\\" in the \\"Hornblower\\" series (although my personal favorite is the collection of short stories called \\"Admiral Hornblower in the West Indies.\\") This story has two aspects that make it unique:1) it is told from the viewpoint of Hornblower's comrade Bush (who is senior to Hornblower) and provides a completely different view of Forester's diffident hero.2) It shows how Hornblower functions and succeeds as subordinate while working through some thorny ethical dilemmas that stump Bush and the rest of the characters.The story line is terrific, as always, with dramatic action \\"drawn from the files\\" of the Napoleonic Naval Gazette providing the backdrop to life at sea.Like Forester's other books, this can be read by adults but it is for young male teens, and suitable for even younger ages. If you like Hornblower, and want a similar story by the same author, read the stand alone novel \\"The Captain from Connecticutt\\" which looks at the naval war of 1812 from the American point of view and, as a book, is better than most of the Hornblower series."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"I had been deterred from the Hornblower series because it came out in the 1950s and 1960s and, frankly, because of the cheesy name.

Bly of Mutiny on the Bounty), spurs gallant plans and vaulting action against the Spanish on Hayte during Toussaint's slave revolt, suffers an inquiry, and is put ashore to live by his card-wits. Despite being set on the West Indies station, the deadliest in all the budding British Empire, no seamen here suffer from tropical disease. Forester writes unevenly here, rather than sustaining the glories of the original trilogy (Books 6-8). This is partially due to our viewing Hornblower only through the eyes of another lieutenant, Bush, who is stolidly dull (Forester resorts to telling us what Bush's inchoate feelings WOULD be if only he could express them!). At least we can't see Hornblower's self-doubt that tiresomely emerges in later books whenever he awaits the onset of action (a small price to pay for such glorious stories). In this story, Bush witnesses the emergence of Hornblower's seeming deference and the brilliant tactical and interpersonal skills that blossom in his later commands."},{"Title":"Lieutenant Hornblower","review":"Lieutenant Hornblower is sent to the West Indies with Lieutenant Bush and the HMS Renown.

In the end the captain is killed and Hornblower is the hero. Returning to England he marries Maria, probably his only mistake but in life who are we to judge.

I have enjoyed many stories on Audio CD's as I travel the highways. Anyone who listens to Audio CD's knows that a good reader needs to be understood and an excellent reader can consistantly change his/her voice to identify the key players of the story. Jim Dale and the Harry Potter series are an excelent example of this. Nicolas Coster does neither. He acts the part he is reading but cannot change his voice to reflect the character who is doing the speaking. When Hornblower or Bush are contemplative his reading is a wisper almost to the point of silence. I find myself unconsiously turning up the volume and replaying that portion of the story. Then Hornblower or Bush act with a \\"shouted command\\" causing me almost to loose control of my auto as the words are blasted into my vehicle.

The final third of the novel is very interesting as it carries the most action and introduces the Maria character, as well as solidifying the relationship between Hornblower and Bush.

Too many real people brought in just to make a book, mixed in with invented folk who read like cliches. The true and known stories from 1876 are strong enough without inventing sex in the tipi (Indian side), the jocular inventions in the Bismark brothel (soldier side), and the invented conversations between the Custers (tho fortunately Skimin does draw the veil with Autie and Libbie). And why use a real person's name and make him a racist/sadist if you're going to invent a Jewish victim? Why not invent the sadist too? That didn't seem fair to the real sergeant. Mr. Skimin willingly invented half a dozen Indians and gave them leading roles. Why not the sadist?Aside from mixing up Miles and Myles, at the end of the book the man we've come to know and admire as Frederick Benteen suddenly becomes Thomas Benteen. Fred's brother was there? Clearly there was no editor on this project, but Mr. Skimin must have been napping when he read the galleys.Mr. Skimin did a very good job of building a narrative around Custer's last winter. This may be the first time I can tell you where he was from December to May 1876, and I've read everyone from van de Water to Utley.But I didn't appreciate the fictionalized last stand, with Keogh or Keough being run through by our Indian hero, nor the detailed inventions of how many times Tom Custer was shot or that Cooke was shot twice and also hit with an arrow. The book just isn't written well enough to make that stuff work. For someone who did that fine, try Hoffman Birney's \\"The Dice of God.\\"You can tell this book by it's cover.

This fictional novel, based on historical events, was found to be extremely light. Robert Skimin fleshed out characters, at times, in odd ways. I especially disliked the way real people were saddled with sexual, sadistic, and/or prejudicial characteristics. At times characters seemed to be introduced in a helter skelter manner just to add to the list of real people that he included in the novel. In places, I felt, he mixed combinations of traits just to add a new twist. For example, he had a former Jewish Russian solder, who was a black belt in Judo, defend himself against a sadistic, bigoted and not too bright sargent. Robert Skimin did stay with the historical facts surrounding General Custer and the events that led up to his defeat at the Little Bighorn but as a whole any grade school history student could have easily gotten the same information about the Sioux, Cheyenne, and the 7th Calvary.Also recommended: Custer's Luck, Crazy Horse: The Strange Man of the Oglalas, Killing Custer, Black Elk Speaks, The Road to the Little Big Horn-and Beyond,"},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"Robert Skimin's The River and the Horsemen is a slashing good yarn that grabs you and never lets go...with a blending of fact and fiction that works a special kind of magic.

The dialogue is stilted. An example: Custer says to his wife Libbie, &quot;You are uncommonly wanton, Madame.&quot; Libbie responds, &quot;I like that term, you handsome devil, but you didn't answer me.&quot; (p 5) In addition, the characters are little more than caricatures, so the reader does not really get involved with them.As history, the book demonstrates that Custer's decisions were arguably defensible based on the information he had--in one sense, &quot;Custer's luck&quot; had simply run out and the fates worked against him. All things considerred, though, Custer was responsible for the disaster because he was an egomaniac who, thinking he was invincible, recklessly entered into a battle he could not win. Although the book does a decent job of presenting the catastrophe from various perspectives, the book shows signs of carelessness. A minor but telling example is that the spelling constantly alternates between &quot;Miles&quot; and &quot;Myles&quot; Keough.The River and the Horsemen will appeal to people interested in Custer's last stand, but will not hold the interest of the general reader."},{"Title":"The River and the Horsemen: A Novel of the Little Bighorn","review":"This is a wonderful novel written by a gifted author.

Trouble in July goes deep into the psychology of what makes common white men into brutes and those who work for them into victims.Like many men McCurtain finds it easier to ignore what is going on rather than try to contain the trouble. The more that he tries to wash his hands of the affair the worse it gets. Those in power see the political and economical ramifications of the act and call on him to jail the accused. After all,McCurtain is their political puppet to be manipulated at will.Such an intriguing drama exposes the hypocrasy of the law and shows how fear can make even the most honest of men betray their basic values of justice. Fear reduces the \\"negro\\" community into one that becomes terrorized and beaten into submission. Fear allows the upholder of the law to allow things to get out of hand merely because he wants to be voted into office next year.Although the characters are simple; their motives, thoughts and values are complex as they struggle with their consciences in carrying out their heinous acts of cowardliness. You have laid out before you the ugliness of a system that dehumanizes everyone involved. The foreward by Bryant Simon in this edition gives us the background which gave rise to this novel. According to Simon, the author has made a significant transition in his work by revealing the south's racism in a straightforward manner. He doesn't hold back the punches.Caldwell has given us a masterpiece about American Terrorism at its zenith in the United States. You will be repulsed, angered, and yes, fearful as you follow the crowd. Our author won't let us become mere voyeurs. We become the lynch mob, the negroes, the soiled politicians and all that is sick in southern terrorism. Read this outstanding work, feel the terror and learn about overcoming the mob psychology in your life. I was deeply moved by Trouble In July and you will too."},{"Title":"Trouble in July","review":"Written after the enormous successes of 'Tobacco Road' (1932) and 'God's Little Acre' (1933) and the critical and popular failure of 'Journeyman' (1935), Erskine Caldwell's 'Trouble In July' (1940) is an earnest but listless novel which addresses the lynching of Negroes in the Deep South. Taking place during the period in which it was written, the novel is neither a black comedy burlesque like 'Tobacco Road' nor an example of the more private, pseudo-surrealist fiction Caldwell produced with 'Journeyman' or some of his many short stories of the era.Instead, 'Trouble in July' attempts and fails to achieve a finely poised balance between realistic fiction and a kind of Keystone Cops comedy. But pointed exaggeration at every level was Caldwell's forte, and the novel, which was written with difficulty over a period of several years, is redundant, flat, predictable, and anticlimactic, despite the piling up of several reoccurring cinematic plot devices, such as the worst possible person walking in the door or phoning at the absolute worst time.In Chapter Six, heavily put-upon sheriff and protagonist Jeff McCurtain conceives a plan to escape his duties by inventing a threatening posse of masked bandits, only to find himself held at gunpoint by an identical gang in reality.'Trouble In July' features several politicians who are only concerned that the lynching, which they see as inevitable and acceptable as long as it reflects \\"the will of the people,\\" not turn public opinion against them, a sheriff's deputy whose great joy in life is \\"hunting possums between midnight and dawn and tracking down runaway Negroes at every opportunity,\\" vigilante gangs for whom the routine killing of blacks is the umbrella answer to most of life's problems, a religious zealot who is outraged that bibles depicting Christ as a black man are circulating in the Negro community, a signature-gathering campaign to \\"send all the Negroes to the country of Africa without delay,\\" a black character, the object of the lynching, who is little more than a wide-and-wild eyed caricature, and, among other Caldwell stock characters, a fifteen year-old uneducated white girl with an inordinate appetite for sex and attention.'God's Little Acre' used a similar formula, but that novel, Caldwell's best, was fraught with tension and conflict, and, as a result, contains one of the most suspenseful and poignant climaxes in all of American literature. Perhaps due to the seriousness of its subject, Caldwell's creative exposition in 'Trouble in July' is cautious to the point of being half-hearted, and as a result, the novel, which is never quite believable on any level, creeps and crawls tentatively towards its conclusion rather than galloping confidently ahead."},{"Title":"Trouble in July","review":"Sheriff Jeff seems to not have a mind of his own. His only thinking was to keep his position and politics. Author did attempt to show small kinder side to him. The rest of the characters in the book were lunatics but descriptions were great.

I have always been intrested in this time period and thought I would have liked to live then. I don't think I would have made it long. I would have been shot for fighting for human rights.

The tragedy of Southern race relations after Emancipation is allegorized in the lynching of a young black man for the rape of a white sharecropper's daughter.The closest thing to a main character is the Sheriff of the county, Jeff McCurtain. McCurtain is convinced to \\"keep the lynching politically clean.\\" Representing the political powers of the inter War South, McCurtain is afraid to stand up to the people in the name of the law. As he tries to avoid contact with the lynch mob, he also seeks out a Black man who he considers \\"harmless\\" and therefore shouldn't be mixed up in the whole lynching.Characters represent the three commonly thought views of Black Americans held by Southern whites at the time. The rich landowner wants the sheriff to catch the suspected racist, so as life can get back to normal and other blacks will keep working his plantation. The catalyst of the incident, a politically involved woman who may be sleeping with the pastor, is circulating a petition that all blacks should be rounded up and sent back to Africa. Yet the third is a man in the mob who is against the petition:\\"The best way is just like I said. String one of them up ever so often. That'll make all of them keep their place. Hell, if there wasn't no more niggers in the country I'd feel lost without them. Besides, who'd do all the work if the niggers were sent away?\\"Caldwell appears to have his finger on the pulse of white social-economic view of black Southerners. Like the helots and the Spartans, the backward stagnant economic system of the interwar South is based on white Southerners keeping black Southerners in virtual economic servitude.\\"Trouble in July\\" is the most real of Caldwell's novels in his \\"cyclorama\\" that I have read yet. The allegory is not too far from the tree as the almost surreal characters in \\"Tobacco Road\\" and \\"God's Little Acre.\\" However, it does not have the full emersion in the world of the sand hills that the other two have. One almost expects the end where McCurtain begins to question his own actions during the story.All in all I find it not a great work. Its subject matter is more important to the modern reader than some of Caldwell's other works as he like Ida B. Wells, throws the Southern view of civilization upon its head. Additionally, it reminds us why the words of people like Kelly Tilghman, the Golf channel anchor, and Bill O'Reilly (declaring he would lynch Michelle Obama if there was evidence) are so dangerous. People are quick to join mobs and the law is slow to challenge what seems the will of the people even if it is against the very things we stand for."},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"Carl L. Becker's book on the Declaration of Independence first appeared nearly eighty years ago, and yet it is still a valuable and stimulating study of its subject. It is dated now, for two large reasons:First, Becker wrote before the revolution in studying the history of ideas, and thus unavoidably predates the close-focus examination of the controversy between Great Britain and her American colonies in the years from 1765 to 1776. Two recent books should be read alongside Becker's monograph -- Pauline Maier's AMERICAN SCRIPTURE: MAKING THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE (New York: Knopf, 1997; Vintage paperback, 1998), and John Phillip Reid, CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION, abridged ed. (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1995).Second, Becker focuses on Jefferson as *the* author of the Declaration, neglecting that he was actually the draftsman selected by the Continental Congress and his colleagues within the drafting committee. Thus, the Declaration -- no matter what Jefferson said about it in later life -- was not primarily a window into his own thinking about natural rights and democracy, but rather the final statement by Congress as to the reasons for breaking ties with Britain. To be sure, later generations have read it as an expression of Jefferson's mind -- rather than of &quot;the American mind,&quot; as he put it. But, as Maier shows in AMERICAN SCRIPTURE, Jefferson's thinking was nowhere near as unique or advanced on these subjects as later hero-worshipping biographers have suggested.In particular, as Maier has shown, the age-old dispute about whether Jefferson was or was not influenced by Locke is somewhat beside the point. Even so, Becker's fine book is indispensable for deciding whether we should read the Declaration through Lockean or Jeffersonian lenses, and whether we should regard it as a codification of American aspirations or as a hypocritical catalogue of principles we cannot live up to.R. B. Bernstein, adjunct professor of law, New York Law School"},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"In high school, kids spend time reviewing the Declaration of Independence and learning its meaning. This book goes well beyond that to inspect the thoughts and ideas that were prevalent in the late 18th century and how they influenced the document. Becker goes into great detail about natural rights theory according to John Locke and explores the ins and outs of its implications. This to me was the strongest and most enjoyable part of the book. He also explores the thoughts and ideas that were circulating Britain at the time.Building on this foundation, he weaves a tale as to why certain things were worded as they were (like Britain being run as a ruthless tyrant), and why certain things were left out altogether (like slavery). He also closely examines the changes that took place in the drafts and attributes them to individuals who proofread Jefferson's draft. I really could have done without his granularity in this area.In all, this was a fascinating read. For those of you who want to extend your knowledge beyond the simple presentation of the document you received in high school, I highly recommend buying this book!"},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"This easy to read book disects the wording and phrases in all the various drafts of the declaration.

As an example, it serves both as a source for and wonderful companion to Bernard Bailyn's book &quot;The Ideological Origins to the American Revolution&quot;"},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"In all my studies of the Founders, the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence over the last quarter century. I have found no other single book that allowed me to so clearly understand (from Mr Beckers perspective) the feelings, enviornment, philosophies that enriched and motivated the leves and character of our founders like this book does. Becker is a genious in the way he presents step by step the methodical and ever changin adjustments of their reasoning during that critical time in our history. One should not feel their studies complete or even rational until they have obsorbed this unique work. Then and only then can they put all they have learned, studied and pondered into that mixer we call our brains and come up with a true appreciation of the founders and their great work of that era. A must reading. I would only add that even though Becker is perhaps correct in his assertion that Natural Law allowed the colonist to justify their stance against Britan. There is a truth about their religion that I believe should have been emphasised in more detail. Individually many of them were very Godly, the natural law argument allowed them to justify Independence but was not as ingrained into their souls as their religious beliefs were. Otherwise this book is one of a kind."},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"I have read this book, off and on, several times. It never ceases to amaze me. I tend to be a controversialist and rely upon this book often to help those who seem convinced that the Founding Fathers were of a particular religious persuasion. While foundationally on a personal level this may be true, in general they bowed down to a higher power: Reason. Yet this was not new to them nor were their political theories. Their roots came from somewhere else and that somewhere else was from the European soil they had left.Becker does an awesome job dissecting the Declaration and its influences primarily from Jefferson through Locke. The natural rights philosophy chapter is awesome. This book is over seventy five years old and its arguments have been revisited and even countered but the book is still foundationally necessary for anyone who seeks to study the Declaration of Independence. In terms of studying the Declaration, there is before Becker's book and there is after.There are many revealing insights and oddities that appear when Becker displays the lines that have been cut from the original draft (e.g. notice there is no mention of slavery in the final version; the reasons for its excision are included in the book). These little tidbits opened my eyes a bit to the relatively benign history of this document that I had been taught. A little knowledge is a dangerous thing so have a little fun and check this book out."},{"Title":"The Declaration of independence,: A study in the history of political ideas,","review":"Becker's classic informs the reader about the nature of the Revolution; indeed, it was not simply about home rule (independence), but who shall rule at home (revolution)."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I've long wanted to read this book and finally did in two days. It was a rewarding experience. Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \\"big house\\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades. He started the school from nothing raising all the money from contributions and the hard work of he and his students. The school still exists today and is thriving.\\"Up From Slavery\\" is an inspiring book.

Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book.

Of all the self-help books published today, Washington's autobiography reads realistic and true for courage, solid advice, and practical solutions.Washington takes the large view to the race problems of his day. He is more concerned with building better human beings, male and female, regardless of race.

He only seemed to care about his school and work, not personal life. He states that he doesnt play any games of any sort. Read this book if you want a refreshing view of post-Civil War race relations."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Up from Slavery, autobiography by Booker T. Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \\"A Slave Among Slaves\\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \\"The Great Accomodator.\\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T. Washington and, at the time, placed him in the forefront as one of the leading authorities of his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book is a fascinating historical account of the atmosphere of America during Reconstruction. The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters.

I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington.

Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic.

It is fascinating to read Booker T. Washington's account of a childhood in slavery followed by his rise to national prominence as the founder of the Tuskegee Institute.While some may argue that Washington was naive and overly accomodating, I was amazed at his ability to forgive and see the best in people. He did not nurse grudges or let others bring him down.

I also recommend the fictional The Journal of Darien Dexter Duff, an Emancipated Slave, The Diary of a Slave Girl, Ruby Jo, and The Journal of Leroy Jeremiah Jones, a Fugitive Slave.

Would order from you again."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Washington was born into slavery as a result of his mother having been raped by her master. This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \\"Black politician.\\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \\"raise yourself by your boot strap\\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \\"the Great Booker T. Washington.\\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \\"accommodationist,\\" \\"or \\"the great compromiser,\\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \\"Uncle Tom,\\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \\"selling his people out.\\" By making a \\"virtue, out of personal necessity,\\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \\"manual arts,\\" and \\"the trades.\\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \\"stooge\\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \\"the white man,\\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told. Slavery was a lot harsher than Washington wrote it was, this book was too carefree in dealing with the harshness of slavery. He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money. He was the Benedict Arnold of the black folk."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read this book, here in Cear&aacute;, a state of Brazil.Even being an agronomist, I love to read books.This book is 100% available for free reading, on internet.This book was writen about 100 years ago, by an african-american , Booker T. Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \\"World of Yesterday\\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it.

He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM!

As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong?

This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it.

Look at his life, what he wrote and how he approached life and you will see similarities between his thoughts and those of other achievers. Such individuals usually: read extensively, travel widely, and pursue education. This book is loaded with Christian success principles that transcend time and location. I found this book to be extremely inspiring.

Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T.

Reading this autobiography I'm inspired to teach as much as I've learn to others less fortunate. And I may end up being a career academic like Booker T as well. Having started a career in public speaking before reading this book I feel even more inspired to continue this pursuit because its such an effective tool. Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels. I highly recommend this book to all non-white South African especially those of mixed decent and black people in general. Booker T was what is called in modern South Africa a \\"coloured\\" person. He has a white father and a black mother."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Washington potrays a resilient and resourceful man in his autobiography, \\"Up from Slavery.\\" With little formal education as a child, his abilities and outward accomplishments are astounding to read about. Tuskegee being the most well known, but not his only significant achievement.Stripped to its barest elements, Washington presents a philosophy that those with character and industry will succeed. Despite deep racism and prejudice, persistence in an American form of opportunity can result in success over time, as evidenced by Washington's life.Washinton makes no excuses and moves forward despite unfair and unreasonable treatment."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \\"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \\"freedom\\" meant \`I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \\"live by their wits\\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \\"made it\\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \\"made it.\\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \\"a job well done.\\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \\"Talented Tenth\\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \\"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \\"educated fool\\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \\"But we've come so far!\\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \\"reverse engineer\\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \\"accommodating Uncle Tom\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies.

This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \\"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves. Being born a slave was a major set back in their lives. Booker was determined to received and education at any cost, and he succeeded. Nothing was handed to him. Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race. Together they worked to build one of the finest educational institution in the south-Tuskegee, renamed Tuskegee University."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \\"bringing up the black race\\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student.

I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \\"Up From Slavery\\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \\"Up From Slavery\\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \\"Up From Slavery\\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \\"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \\"Up From Slavery\\" \`s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \\"Up From Slavery\\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"One of the most inspiring books I've read.

This book details the triumphant acts of Booker T. Washington's efforts to not only develop the famous Tuskegee Institute, but to positively build bridges with America. A former slave who became a self taught, political mastermind came from the worst of what humanity had to offer to meeting and influencing American Presidents. What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students. This man and his \\"cadres\\" fought for and provided educational opportunities in a country that treated them worst than second class citizens. This book should be a required reading in ALL schools, especially those predominantly filled with African Americans!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I bought 10 to give to my black friends, in just two chapters you can discover what a great man this was,he had a great preception of people and life.

Washington was a brilliant scholar and compassionate human being. His detailing of life as a young slave boy, and life during/after the Reconstruction, is heart-wrenching, but must be read in order to fully understand the era. At times, I felt that Mr. Washington was too \\"kind\\" in trying to understand and explain the motives of the white people. He was a visionary and tireless worker for the African Americans; therefore, this work is a must-read for all Americans."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"It was a pleasure to meet this great man through this, his, book. A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \\"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \\"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \\"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T.

Each pearl of wisdom is such a treasure, I wish that this book could be instituted as required reading for all students. I loved it and have since bought 6 books to give as gifts."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church. (!)Washington's message, repeated over and over, was \\"learn a useful trade.\\" As he correctly reasoned, human nature being what it is, if you are the best blacksmith, brick maker, or furniture maker in your community, your community is going to respect you and want to keep you.In the year 2012, this advice strikes me as eerily prescient. Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta. Which is the better path? Skip college and qualify as a first-rate plumber, electrician, carpenter etc. -- or go to college and wind up unemployed with $100,000 in student debt?There's a lot more in this book! It's an excellent portrait of America in the late 19th century, and it will surprise you at many turns."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I devoured this book on my newly purchased Kindle! I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them. I can dig that.Overall, this was a great read! A great start to my kindle love affair! :)"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"A riveting account of Washington's extraordinary struggle fueled by boundless optimism.However, Washington's faith appears overly buoyant when he writes the following about the Ku Klux Klan: 'To-day there are no such organizations in the South, and the fact that such ever existed is almost forgotten by both races. There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book reminds us of the great truth, that hard work will always in the end be rewarded.

The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about.

Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \\"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \\"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \\"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful.

Great for doing a book report."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \\"least offensive\\" is another reader's \\"Uncle Tom\\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \\"Negro \\".

Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering.

READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept.

It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context."},{"Title":"The first 100 years, Basilica of St. Adalbert, 1881-1981","review":"This is a book on the history of the church and school that I attended while growing up.

The themes of the work are woven like threads through the tapestry of the political landscape in Louisiana.The story is universal and has as much relevance to California, Chicago, and New York as it does to New Orleans, Baton Rouge and Lake Charles, Louisiana.Most importantly, this book delivers what most novels only promise. The pages turn themselves; you cannot put the book down till the end.One of the most difficult things in storytelling is accomplished effortlessly by the author - - people whose lives are lived in stereotypical roles (Candidates for Governor, Political Staffers, Corporate Officer, Media and even Mafia) are not presented as stereotypes at all, but rather as real people. And all of the major players have entourages and those entourages are drawn so that the distinct characters within the groups emerge as clearly as the principal players in the drama.The plot is not something this reviewer wants to hint at, except to say that if one is only going to read one fast paced, complex, colorful novel this spring, this is the book to buy.This seemingly Louisiana story by a Louisiana writer is anything but a regional story. It's a big story that could play out anywhere. In setting the story in Louisiana, the writer did the reader a favor because he knows Louisiana as well as anyone who has set a story here.This should become a film. When one finishes reading the book, all one can hope for is the chance to see it on the big screen."},{"Title":"Pelican Games","review":"Pelican Games starts fast and keeps going. I was drawn into the plot immediately, then kept involved by the superb character development. In fact, the character development was good enough to make me actually despise one of the characters. I don't often get such a reaction to a novel character.The author was once a reporter and his eye for detail helps round out story line with very rich images.Several of the plot threads are ultimately resolved in ways that I didn't see coming. That was a nice change from the formula endings that seem to permeate novels.As a bonus, the chapters are short, making this a great bedside reader."},{"Title":"Pelican Games","review":"Ron Gomez has pulled off the unimaginable!!!Louisiana has long been infamous for its corrupt politicians and special interest dominated elections. Yet, no one has been able to accurately portray the totality of contemproary Louisiana politics in a single manuscript (fiction or non-fiction)until Ron Gomez penned Pelican Games. Pelican Games is an insightful, albeit fictional, account of the inner workings of \\"play-for-keeps\\" Louisiana gubernatorial politics. More importantly, the author has contrived a plot and created attendant characters that are guranteed to keep the reader spell bound and wanting more. The plot is indeed very plausible for Louisiana and never, ever predictable. This book can easily be charaterized as a fast-paced, \\"thriller\\" in every sense of the word. Yet, the author's clear writing and lucid descriptions allow time to literally stand still during the intense heat and fast pace of an all out \\"battle-royale\\" election for closest thing to a monarchy in America-the Lousiana Governorship. Gomez also goes to great lengths to explain the intricacies and oddities of Louisiana's political system.Written like a fine Dick Francis novel, Pelican Games provides the reader with a crystal clear expanse of the author's literary genius. Consequently, the reader does not have to possess a background in politics or, even like politics for that matter, to fully enjoy this book. Ron Gomez simply provides our wildest imagination for us! All we need do is show up and turn the pages."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Factually shaky at many points, pedestrian prose, self-aggrandizing and a page turner only for wanting to finish the awful thing. What I found most offensive about this book was the author's egotistical disdain for the, \\"lesser climbers\\", of the team. In fact she and her fellow leaders showed nothing but hostility to many members and they all come off as smug, arrogant jerks. Having been on climbing expeditions before, there is a great deal of stress, raw feelings, etc, but the raw and condescending behavior of the author and trip leaders is disgusting. Don't even get started on their ugly American \\"analysis\\" of Asians on Denali.Read this book if you one day want to write a mountaineering book and this one will point to every flaw in doing so."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Facing the Extreme, by Ruth Anne Kocour was a welcome addition to my growing collection of mountaineering stories. Unlike most 'epic' stories, I found this one to offer a little more insight and to be a little more personal than other stories I've read.I didn't pick up this book because it was a woman's story, although it WAS nice to read a mountaineering adventure from a woman's perspective. I suppose that it's inevitable that I would find myself identifying more strongly with a woman but I think that men will really get a lot of of this story too. I suspect that we all share similar dreams, fears &amp; emotions where mountains are concerned. Kocour just seemed to be able to articulate the experience better than most.That being said, there is certainly no shortage of technical information... much of which was new to me. I enjoyed learning some of the inner workings of a high altitude mountaineering expedition. Facing the Extreme was more comprehensive than most books in this regard.The challenges and tragedy faced by this group during the worst storms to ever hit Denali were incredible. What I particularly appreciated was the way that (I believe) she remained true to the experience and did not get caught up in sensationalizing the event. Even more surprising is that I never felt that the story was too slow. Detailed descriptions of day after day of being trapped in a cramped, frozen tent could have been almost as torturous to read as it was to experience but not in this book.Rather than breezing over these parts of the adventure, Kocour described with honesty I'm not sure I could summon, her personal struggles, thoughts &amp; feelings &amp; her observations of team mates' experiences.This is a wonderful, personal &amp; unpretentious story. Anyone who has experienced the seductive, almost gravitational pull of a mountain will appreciate &amp; enjoy the experience of reading it."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"The author was part of a team that spent ten days on an ice shelf on Mount McKinley, trapped by a storm that packed 110 MPH winds, minus 47 degree air temperatures. The team of nine mountaineers (2 professional leaders and seven amateurs) became the first group that reached the summit in 1992. When reading this book, you feel like your friend is sittling beside you telling their dramatic story.What makes this book unique is the candid descriptions of the author's thought processes and sensations. I read many books about how to succeed and reach goals and most of them suffer from vagueness. This book does not have a single platitude about attitude. It describes clearly and practically what she does to keep herself on track.For example, when food got scarce, one of the team members lined up for seconds before everyone had eaten first. The author tells her reaction.&quot;I looked away to hide my growing rage from Craig and anyone else who might be looking my way. I worked to focus on the beauty that surrounded me instead of Jack's selfishness.All around, hues of pink washed the sky and melded into the soft blue shadow of the earth against the atmosphere.....&quot;She is illustrating an important success principle- that each of us determines where our attention goes. Through controlling our attention and thoughts, we can change our emotional state. She shows this to us- here and throughout the book. Her descriptions of conversation make for interesting and gripping dialogue, although she does come through as overly critical of others at times.She tells her motivations for mountaineering, the dynamics of the team, and the actions of the two professional guides that made them effective leaders. For example, at one point, she has trouble with a weak and exhausted teammate who is roped behind her. The leader asks her what is wrong and puts that team member behind him, taking the hardest task on himself.She conserves energy, turns inward, has a great sense of humor, and solves problems. This book would help management consultants and seminar leaders for examples of success principles."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described, more eloquently than I can, why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean, pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I found the author to be overly dramatic and dreadfully overused tired cliches and crude, offensive language. She was absoulutely obsessed with outdoor urination and defication. The only redeeming quality to the book is it's meticulous description of the boredom of being trapped during a storm for days on end in a small frozen tent. She talks about being offended by people being interested in the deaths and gore, yet she endlessly talks about body bags, the removal of the dead Koreans, etc. If you want to know climbing from every conceivable angle, it's worth a read, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I have read all the bad reviews about this book. She tells us at the beginning of the book that this is \\"her story\\" the way she lived it. She admits that there are other stories to be heard. My opinion, this is a good read. Maybe she did put down most of the other climbers and is arrogant and a bit intolerant. .... It is her story and this is who she is - the end. The story engrossed me. I couldn't put it down. I learned more about mountain climbing than I imagined. What more can I say. I highly recommend it. I can still feel the snow blowing. Brrrr."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I agree that the book is a egocentered blurt that only was successful b/c of the popularity of &quot;Everest&quot; stories. I can easily imagine her friends and husband, &quot;Oh Ruth Anne, you really MUST write your book...&quot; Of course the ghost author was limited by her journal and interviews, I hope he was well paid. I have climbed all the mountains she writes about (and more) with women as equals, and Ruth Anne's story is incredible in its simplistic vision of &quot;women&quot; and &quot;mountains&quot;. I agree that she slights her climbing partners, deifies the guides (hey, nice guys, I know them by reputation), but she is yet another &quot;drone&quot; with a big enough check book to &quot;climb&quot; the mountain. Everest, Ruth Anne? Okay, but I hope Dawa Sherpa has a tight rope that day. Sorry folks, if you think this is a book about climbing, it isn't, it's a book about a woman who pays people to take her climbing. Okay, it was a good story at times, especially re: the storm bound days at 14, but if you want passion and commitment try Sacred Summits by Boardman!"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I don't disagree with the criticisms of her writing, but I have to admit that while I was reading the book, I found the story compelling. Yes, Into Thin Air was much better overall and much better written, but give the woman a break --it was still an interesting account and refreshing to hear from a female climber stuck in a male climbing world. For the hour or so it took me to read it, I did not develop any animosity towards the author and simply kept reading to find out what happens. And boy was I glad to be able to walk outside and get some sun when I finished."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"This book, though poorly written, has a story to tell, though it could have been better told by someone who knows how to write. It is, however, an easy, quick read and moderately interesting. It does have some merit, in as much as it chronicles the author's ascent of Denali.Most of the book is spent recounting the time during which she and her team mates were trapped on Denali at 14,000 feet, caught in one of the most severe storms on record which saw eleven people perish. Her description of the horrendous weather conditions and sub zero temperatures, which pinned her team down for a period of about two weeks, is graphic, though repetitious. She was lucky to have been with two experienced guides who knew what they were doing. This is undoubtedly one of the main reasons she and her team mates survived their ordeal.Disconcerting are her repeated racist references to Asian climbers. Her comments are unworthy and make her sound ignorant. It cannot help but affect one's opinion of her, and that opinion is unflattering.

Krakauer writes well of the horror of failed mountain climbing, but Kocur seems to catch the essence of what it is like to be stranded in a fatal storm high up a mountain better.The one truely off-putting part of this book is the dreadful proofreading. Typoes and &quot;spellcheckos&quot; are all too common, distracting from Kocur's prose. I can only hope that, some day, editors will go back to editing.For me, as a woman, the most delightful part of the tale was how Kocur was treated as a woman. Once she got on the mountain, her gender seemed to be a non-issue, with one small exception. She did not make a big deal of this, and I found it refreshing to read a book about women and men where gender games didn't happen.I give this book to my library patrons who liked Krakauer's _Into Thin Air_, those who read about women and those who enjoy well-told tales."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Ruth Anne Kocour, the greatest female climber of all time documents her extreme valor in saving all souls on the mountain. Climbers live by a certain code, we help each other. Ms. Kocour apparently believes she is above and beyond helping the sick and dying climbers. She believes that &quot;the best thing mountaineers can do for others is to take care of themselves&quot;. When sitting in camp, not even a particularly high camp at that, climbers help one another. The summit is the goal but it is not what is most important. Ms. Koncour could not find the time to help out a climber who was in need of medical attention because she was busy clearing snow from her tent, something she did every few hours. she could not help this wretched soul? Remember she is only at 13,000 feet. While this may sound high, it really is not. Conditions in a storm of the magnitude experienced that half week on denali are not fun, but the situation is not like K@ or Everest where medical help and resupply may be an impossobility depending on ones altitude. THe height that Ms Koncour refers too is still well within range of airplane and helicopter support. What we learn from this book and Ms. Koncour is that if ever we are on a climbing team with her, find another team, you wont regret it. Based on rep alone, i would not climb with her."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I have to agree with others reviewers that Kocuour's ego is a huge obstacle in reading this book. I'm reminded of people who in conversation do nothing but bad-mouth others to compensate for their lack of confidence. Everyone else is weak, unrefined, stupid, or otherwise worth mocking. I'm stuck with the passage where she gets mocks a fellow climber who has brought a book to read about jet airplanes. That's the depth she goes to in her pettiness.The story itself is interesting and should be compelling, but getting past the author's tone soured the reading experience for me.I have many mountaineering books. Ones I'd heartily recommend are Joe Tasker and Peter Boardman's &quot;The Boardman Tasker Omnibus&quot;, Jim Whittaker's &quot;A Life on the Edge&quot; and Peter Potterfield's &quot;In the Zone&quot;. These authors not only write well, but can convey the challenges and trials of mountaineering without narcissism. These books all sit proudly in my bookcase. Kocuour's book is in a cardboard box in my basement."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"This book would be a joke if it were not dangerous. There's nothing wrong with being guided on a mountain...in fact, it may be a comparatively safe way to enjoy an outdoor experience (and it keeps many climbers employed. There's also nothing wrong with writing about the experience of being guided...David Roberts, Jon Krakauer, and others have done that entertainingly and tastefully. But to title it &quot;the extreme...true courage...death-defying survival...a quest&quot; shows serious signs of self-delusion. I am most concerned that some innocent will pick this book up, enjoy it, and do something really stupid.Hint: If you liked this book...if you really found it exciting...stay home!(1 star, in honor of the book's value as kindling, and because there is no lower rating.)"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"This book is a great companion read to &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and the lesser books from that 1996 moment because it, in a refreshing and unique way, exposes the folly and incredible stupidity of some of the people climbing mountains now days. Kocour gives unforgettable and near-comical insights into some of the characters she found herself among on a serious mountain expedition. But this is not a light-hearted book. You'll forever remember the fellow-climber who claimed to have been a tour guide on a particurally famous mount, only to accidentally reveal later, while lacking oxygen, that he'd only been a tour-guide at a recreation of the mount at DisneyLand."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Scrolling through the reviews of Facing The Extreme, it is easy to pick out, from their words, the type of climber I would choose to climb with and those I would not. Kocour's mean-spirited book clearly gives climbers and women a bad name In fact, the best lesson to be gleaned from the chronicle of this arrogant and self-serving woman is: choose your team members as carefully as possible whenever possible. The most insightful comment made by any of the reviewers was the one who said he would not want to be roped up to Ruth Anne Kocour. Who would?"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Reading this book is like witnessing an accident: terrible but you just have to look (or keep reading). Ms. Kocour is certain to become the Ed Wood of mountaineering authors. Her book is so bad that it is ipso facto quite entertaining--Plan 9 From Outer Space on Denali! The author, who fancies herself a world-class mountaineer when she was in fact a paying guest on a guided climb, has absolute contempt for anyone other than herself and her guides. This includes nearly all other climbers and guides on Denali that season. She uses a broad brush to paint a particularly contemptuous picture of Oriental climbers on Denali, past and present. My disbelief in the fact that this book was ever published gave way to merriment midway through the read as I alternately laughed and screamed at the author and read the most outrageous passages to my wife. Of course, this book will be a source of amusement among my climbing and skiing companions for years to come. So for good laughs, rate this book five stars. For good mountaineering literature, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"This was a real page turner. AND it came as close to an explanation I expect I'll ever get, as to why anyone would want to climb a mountain in the first place. The descriptions are terrific. The author sees with an artisit's eye and captures for the reader the raw beauty of Denali. She also captures the feel of the elements. Reading late into the night, I went out to walk my dog in a down parka, hat, gloves, etc....and folks, I live in California where it was 54 degrees outside. Ah, the power of the written word. This is a very different approach to climbing than portrayed by Krakauer's book, very team oriented. I never would have read either book, except I have a friend who climbs and have been trying to understand why for years, Kocour's book helped me do that whereas Krakauer's made me think I should reevaluate my friend's sanity. I am glad that I read both, but I think FACING THE EXTREME has by far the most to offer."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I received a copy of this book as a gift and out of courtesy I read it despite misgivings spawned by the liner notes. In a poorly writen, poorly edited, poorly researched tribute to herself the author tries to describe the horrific ordeal she and her team mates (mostly her teammates, on whom she was merciless in her criticisms) endured on Denali. They were &quot;trapped&quot; at the 14,200' camp on Denali in a severe storm that claimed 11 lives in May of 1992. The 14,200' camp is as large as any k-Mart parking lot and just as flat. The idea of &quot;clinging&quot; to the mountain from this camp is ridciulous. The camp had a ranger hut, staffed by park service rangers and volunteers as well as a medical station. I am sure that their stay there was uncomfortable,but far from life threatening. The author attempts to exaggerate her own situation at the expense of those who were truly in danger on the mountain and those who died there. Her attraction to a body bag containing the remains of a man who died at the 14200' camp (of natural causes) was ghoulish and nauseating. She put me in mind of the rear echelon soldier who presents second hand stories of the horrors of war as his own. The author claims that on &quot;the mountain&quot; the other climbers called her &quot;The Woman&quot;. I would venture to guess that her team mates called her a lot of other things as well. In summary, the Author attempted to portray a professionally guided climb on the easiest, busiest route on Mt. McKinley as something much more than it was and did so at the expense of others. *Note to the editor* Orizabo is not the second highest peak in North America. Mt. Logan is much higher and far more difficult. Talkeetna is about 70 miles from Denali, not 250 as stated over and over in the book"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers' criticisms of Kocour's writing style and her contemptuous attitude toward other climbers. I would add that for her to refer to her experience as &quot;extreme&quot; shows her complete lack of credibility as a climber. Ms. Kocour was bored, cold and scared, and her feet got cold -- that's all. Meanwhile, others died in the same storm. If you want to read about an &quot;extreme&quot; experience on Denali, try Davidson's Minus 148 or Waterman's In the Shadow of Denali. I also second those who recommended the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Not a classic like Ino Thin Air, but pretty good to kill a few hours"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":".... I've climbed Denali and Kocour's book is the best account of climbing that mountain from a &quot;real&quot; person's point of view than any. No book on the market tells it like it is and in as esciting and readable a manner as Extreme. As for Kocour's ability, I know Robert Link, a world class guide who is written about in Extrme, and not only does he like this book, but he says Kocour is a solid female mountaineer who he'd climb any mountain with. I'd recommend her book to anyone, whether climber or not, as a superbly written example of what can go wrong and what it takes to make the summit of any mountain."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book!

I wish she could had written the book better! I admire mountaineers but this book was frustrating to read. She sounds so arrogant in this and just not a nice person. I can understand being on a team with some annoying or inexperienced people but that is the chance you take being part of a team. If she didn't want to listen to someone talk all the time or deal with someone that didn't have her experience she should have hired a private guide to take her up the mountain. She always mentioned her compliments and her achievements and how she triumphed eventhough she was a girl-and how the guys on the team would make comments- OH PLEASE. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME.

Her descriptions of the cold, the storm, and her relationships with the other climbers were right-on. This is the world of climbing as it exists today, and it gives excellent insite into the high-mountain disasters of recent history. I've climbed over 100 mountains higher than 11,000 feet--several of which were winter ascents and required technical ability. I'm not a professional mountain climber and I've never hired a guide. But I probably will hire a guide some day. To put this book down because the author isn't a full-time mountain climber is weak. I have a professional life outside of mountain climbing.

Instead, I plowed through this tedious, annoying book to find that the more I knew about Kocour, the less I liked her.She continuously harps on the most minor failings of others, while viewing herself as superior to the other clients that she's climbing with. Rather than trying to understand her teammates, she only talks about them in order to point out their mistakes. She is so smug that she routinely reveals her own failings as a climber without realizing it.By the time I was finished with this book, I had great sympathy for her teammates. I only had to tolerate her for 250 pages. They had to live with her for weeks!If you want to read a good mountaineering book, try the Boardman-Tasker Omnibus.

Facing the Extreme, by Ruth Anne Kocour and Michael Hodgson is filled with many seemingly small factual errors, which in the end add up, and made me question Ms. Kocour's journalistic credibility (though she is not a journalist by trade, it is still her responsiblity as an author to get it right). Though not a factual error, in the Author's Note, Ms. Kocour tells us that she has changed the names of her fellow climbers (with the exception of the guides) as she cannot &quot;...speak for them or tell their story&quot;. What she dosen't come right out and tell you is that her portrayal of her fellow climbers is focused almost entirely on both their personal and mountaineering shortfalls. If we are to believe Ms. Kocour, she was the toughest, mentally and physically, the most skilled and the person with the fewest personality shortcomings. After elevating herself, she clearly had no choice but to change the names of her fellow climbers. My biggest problem with Facing the Extreme comes with the obvious lack of fact checking. Ms. Kocour states that Talkeetna is 70 miles from Anchorage, when it is approximately 114 miles. She also tells us that Denali is 250 miles from Talkeetna and the single engine Cessna made the flight to Denali Base Camp in 40 minutes, an obvious impossiblity. Denali is actually only 60 miles by road from Talkeetna. In addition, there are serious climbing factual errors as well, all the more shocking considering Ms. Kocour's oft repeated (in the text anyway) expertise. Ms. Kocour claims that while camped at high camp at 17,200 feet the climbers had now entered the &quot;death zone&quot;. Actually, the &quot;death zone&quot; as it is known to climbers, begins at approximately 26,000 feet, nearly 9,000 feet higher than high camp on Denali. In fact, Base Camp on Mount Everest, where climbers spend close to 2 months at a time is at approximately 17,700 feet, some 500 feet higher that high camp on Denali. Ms. Kocour also states that she &quot;...had been to 23,000 feet on Aconcagua&quot;, difficult to do since Aconcagua is 22,841 feet high, a seemingly small error, but an important distiction to climbers. If you want to spend money reading books by female climbers/explorers I suggest The Climb of my Life by Laura Evans, or Artic Daughter by Jean Aspen."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"This is an as-told-to tale of enduring a ferocious storm for almost two weeks on North America's highest peak, Mt. Denali (Mt. McKinley). It is a tale worth telling for Denali, while not a technically difficult mountain to climb, is known for the worst storms on earth. The first problem is Ms. Kocour's exaggerations and misinformation diminishes the very story she wants to tell.The second problem is Ms. Kocour herself. Her own words make her sound like an arrogant, bigoted,self-satisfied, braggart. Her lack of charity toward her teammates and fellow climbers is breathtakingly insensitive. She has a fawning regard for her professional guides and an almost girlish awe of chance meetings with elite climbers Jim Wickwire and John Roskelley, but a rare good word for her fellow amateurs.The author continually refers to being trapped in the \\"Death Zone,\\" a height where humans cannot acclimate to the altitude, and the human body deteriorates. This \\"Zone\\" is above 26,246 feet. The camp where the author was stranded was 8,000 feet below this extreme. To give a comparison, Everest's base camp (the beginning of the climb) is higher than the camp at which Ms. Kocour was stranded. The entire route her party took has fixed lines, and they were roped to their guides at all times during their climb. It was not what anyone would call an intrepid, daring ascent. The \\"ledge\\" where her team bivouacked accommodated six tents, a ranger hut and a large medical station, more resembling a mall parking lot than a ledge.The descriptions of the storm are good, and it is easy to imagine the fear, the claustrophobia, and the boredom of being confined to such close quarters in the monstrous elements for such an extended period of time. It is a cautionary tale for anyone who thinks Denali is a walk in the park. It is not.I awarded the second star for Ruth Anne's self-portrayal of a lady you'd love to see get her comeuppance. Makes you want to see a book by one of her teammates describing the trials and tribulations of climbing with Ruth Anne."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Yes the writing is terrible, (high school essay level I'd say). The dialog is appalling and I definitely could have lived without all the little detours into her personal past. What were her ghost writer and editor thinking? I am also quietly amazed her fellow clients didn't sue for defamation of character. However Ruth Ann's comments on Asian mountaineers merely reflect a widespread and often justified perception that Japanese, Korean and Taiwanese climbers take reckless chances - and all to often pay the price - not personal racism on her part. She also makes it quite clear that her expedition, dispite a close call or two with crevasses and running short on food, was never in serious danger - merely cold, hungry and generally miserable. Still, however safe one may be personally, it isn't pleasant to find oneself surrounded by death and disaster as she did. 'Facing the Extreme' is not a great addition to the literature of mountaineering. I dont plan to reread it and don't recomend it."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"After reading \\"Into Thin Air\\" by Jon Krakauer and \\"The Climb\\" by Anatoli Boukreev with G. Weston DeWalt, both of which were excellent and engaging books, I turned to \\"Facing the Extreme\\" by Ruth Anne Kocuour. Like Krakauer and Boukreev, Kocuour found herself high on a dangerous mountain in a blizzard. Like them, she survived, while others met their death. Unlike Krakauer and Boukreev, she did not write a great book about her experiences. The biggest problems with this book are the constant flow of bad jokes and puns, the constant put-downs of several of her climbing companions, and her total lack of modesty. Krakauer opines in his book that who lived and who died was a matter of chance, and that he could have easily died. Kocuour repeatedly tells the reader that it was her skill and planning that made her a survivor. I found her and her book to be obnoxious and less than entertaining."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I've been immersed in books of this genre in preparation for a class I'm planning to teach, and I have to say that this was one of the most annoying. Yes, the description of the storm and the deaths of other climbers is harrowing, but gosh. Ruth Anne is so impressed with herself that it's hard to get past her self-descriptions and appreciate the narrative. The others on her team (with the exception of her tentmate and the guides) are all unworthy of being there. The other teams on the mountain are all unworthy of being there. Everyone is either foolish, obnoxious, a danger to others, or just plain weak. But not Ruth Anne. She is the best climber, the best, most supportive tentmate, the most patient teammate. At the end, she quotes one of the guides as saying, &quot;I'd climb with you anywhere.&quot; Maybe he would, but such self-serving comments are a distraction. As a comparison, read Roskelley's Nanda Devi. Equally harrowing, but Roskelley has no qualms about portraying himself as arrogant and impatient, and one can see how his presence on a team can be destructive. I wish Ruth Anne had been a bit more scrutinizing of herself. Or maybe she really is a mountaineering saint."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Poor Ruth Anne. She is bitter and unnecesarily contemptuous in many of the passages about her fellow climbers and I found her attitude to be nasty at best, not to mention immature. At one point, when describing the first time she met one of her teammates, she insulted his looks and called him &quot;ugly.&quot; How shallow can a grown adult get? At any rate I gave it two stars because it is fairly interesting in that it is an account of the terrible storm she had the misfortune of being a part of. The writing is bad but then you have about twenty other reviews here which delve into this so I'll leave it alone. If you want to read some truly inspiring mountaineering stories check out some of these books: Minus 148 Degrees: The First Winter Ascent of Mt. McKinley by Art Davidson; Alaska Ascents, edited by Bill Sherwonit; Seven Summits by Dick Bass, Frank Wells, with Rick Ridgeway; High Exposure by David Breashears; The Last Step: The American Ascent of K2 by Rick Ridgeway; Everest: Southwest Face by Chris Bonington. There are many others but these are a great start."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Like another reviewer of Facing the Extreme, I had just read Krakauer's Into Thin Air and had to read more on mountain climbing. I choose Facing because of the title and because it was about one of &quot;The Seven Summits&quot;.Kocour portrays herself as an accomplished mountianeer, but imho her writing is far from accomplished.I wished the book had included a good map so I could follow the progress of the group up the mounain. I also needed a Dramatis Personae. (I finally wrote-up my own.)I was annoyed as Ms. Kocour's words revealed her over-idealization of the guides and her general contempt for the other climbers (except for her tent-mate). (It would be nice to read a book about the climb written by one of the others; I wonder how they saw her.)Her writing imho is juvenile and, especially disconcerting, are the numerous (unintended, I assume) puns.Still, I'm glad her friends et al encouraged her to write the book and overall I'm glad I read it. I know more about climbing than I did and more about Denali aka Mt. McKinley.Before her next book, and I hope she writes again about her climbs, I hope she will enroll in a good basic writing class; one in which she will Face an Extreme(ly) rigorous teacher!"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"I really wanted to like this book. Most climbing accounts are written by superstars of the sport. Ms. Kocour's book held promise of an honest account of an amateur &quot;weekend warrior&quot;. The struggle of a group of amateur climbers thrown together to climb Denali has all the elements of a superb human drama. Unfortunately, the depiction of the human spirit is perhaps the Mt. Everest of writing, and Ms. Kocour is not an Everest climber - in either the mountaineering or the literary sense. Her character development is one-dimensional at best. The guides are all-wise guardian angels whose cosmic connection to the mountain is boringly infallible. Her fellow clients are either hapless bumblers or selfish dolts who would run off in panic were it not for the heroic presence of the author. Ms. Kocour's dialogue is downright silly. She apparently equates crudity with authenticity, which perhaps accounts for her preoccupation with the many ways to defecate and urinate on the mountain. Upon her deliverance off the mountain, she gushes to her guide, &quot;You did a great job of leading - a tribute to your family's storied mountaineering and guiding history&quot;. Do you think she really said that? Do you talk that way? Ms. Kocour compounds the problem by trying to portray her trip (and her role in it) as an astonishing mountaineering feat, which it was not. Sure, there was a bad storm, but while Ms. Kocour was spending several chapters admiring her own ability to sit in the tent waiting for her guides to cook her dinner, Park Service rangers and mountain rescue personnel were out in the teeth of the storm, working to help climbers. Their presence is barely acknowledged. Climbing Denali on a guided trip is a tremendous physical and mental challenge, and Ms. Kocour is right to be proud of it. However, her trip should not be confused with a right of passage to &quot;serious&quot; mountaineering. Any reasonably fit individual with three weeks and a few thousand dollars can sign on with any one of several excellent guide services to be led up the West Buttress of Denali. Hundreds of people do it every year. Ms. Kocour's very accomplished guides told the clients when to get up, what to carry, what direction to go and where to camp. The customers, including Ms. Kocour, followed their guide every day, tied in line to a rope. To assert, as Kocour does, that being led up the West Buttress of Denali along with two or three hundred other people qualifies her to climb Everest is the sort of hubris that has contributed to so many deaths on that mountain. All in all, this is just a bad book. It could have been the story of an individual's triumph over her own limits. Instead, it was a tiresome tribute by the author to herself. Were it not for the mass market success of Jon Krakauer's Everest account, this book would have been rightly relegated to the bargain bin. I won't even start on the editing"},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"...well, I'd say read Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Or even Boukreev's The Climb or David Brashears High Exposure. I thought this book would be interesting because it's a different summit and a female climber. It does move at a brisk pace but it's definitely not up to par with the other titles.To be fair, Kocour is not a professional writer. And while her interment on Denali might have been suspenseful for her, considering most of it was spent tentbound in a blizzard where she never appears to be in real danger there's not a lot going on for the reader. She is also (as other reviewers have observed) rather ungenerous towards her fellow climbers. Even her tentmate, the only one she seemed to get along with, gets described as \\"pleasant to look at, though not particularly handsome.\\" And despite the assistance of a professional writer, some of the wording is awkward bordering on hilarious. Example: on complimenting one of her guides upon reaching the summit, she calls him \\"a tribute to his family's storied mountaineering history.\\" Who talks like this-hands? Her ethnic stereotyping of some Korean climbers is also tiresome.Still, it's an easy read and it does have some interesting detail about Denali and climbing in the death zone. And it's one of the few mountaineering books that I've seen written by a woman. So, read at your discretion."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"Only a woman could capture the art of the summit. This a refreshing change from the &quot;conquering&quot; storyline. Rather it's the story of one woman's endurance, physical and mental, and her singleminded focus and survival and summit. As a male reader, who genetically relates to &quot;beating&quot; the mountain, this book captures what wilderness experience is all about. In the end, it's the elements who are in charge, and we are &quot;granted&quot; windows to this world.

I couldn't put it down. Ruth is awesome too. Aside from being in the death zone at 17,200 and thinking that she might walk off the six thousand foot drop while shoveling snow off her tent at the ice shelf at 14,200, my favorite part was when she said that Bradford Washington has the first ascent of Mt. Denali. Thats awesome. To set the facts straight the first ascent was in 1913 by walter harper as a member of the hudson stuck expedition. and bradford WASHBURN has the first ascent of the west buttress in 1951. This is an awesome book."},{"Title":"Facing The Extreme: One Woman's Tale of True Courage, Death-Defying Survival and Her Quest For The Summit","review":"If you are seriously considering climbing Denali,or are dying for a harrowing adventure to read about, then this book is a good read. But if the answer to the above question(s) is no, think about skipping it.The author is a literary lightweight, leaving one to wonder just what she needed the co-author for in the first place; the writing still is weak. Truly bothersome is the mostly feeble attempts at humor in the conversations between herself and her climbing partners, especially &quot;Craig&quot;. In the early going, her goody-goody humor is dull; but if you can stick it out and get to the section where the massive storm engulfs their camp, the book does indeed become engrossing.I am not certain that the author had , as of this climb anyway, yet attained the claim of &quot;world-class&quot; mountaineer. Clearly she seems to be a solid climber with good instincts and a good understanding of preparation. But from her writing in this book I am convinced she is a ..., and would, like other reviewers of this book, love to read an account of this climb from any of her companions' perspectives. I have climbed and camped with people that didn't belong on the mountain and had personalities that can repel even the most sympathetic of individuals; I wouldn't dream of trashing them in a book the way this author did. Sure she changed the names of all but the two leaders, but ....The paperback edition has decent b&amp;w photographs, but lacks a map.

Unfortunately, I choose Ruth Ann Kocour's book, which reads like an account of a life-threatening adventure as told by an adolescent.

You should read this book too."},{"Title":"Sun Tzu on Investing: 15 Strategies for Dynamic Investments","review":"I found that learning about Sun Tzu's meticulous martial mind was a great way to explore and rediscover some basic truths about what moves markets. Sun Tzu's lessons apply to bourses just as much as battlefields. The book points to the importance of a well-thought-out but flexible investment strategy, the danger of herd thinking and the importance of logical methods to predict potential gains and losses. The book also taps into the wisdom and experience of more traditional market gurus, such as Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffet and uses examples from Asia and around the world to illustrate its points. While many of the lessons have been told before, it is refreshing to see a book like this come out of Asia, using ancient Asian teachings and Asian examples."},{"Title":"Sun Tzu on Investing: 15 Strategies for Dynamic Investments","review":"I am going to be in the minority here, and give the book a negative review. This book is only suited to those who have very little experience in fundamental analysis, or those who are a little interested in the Chinese culture. For those who want to learn about Sun Tzu's work, this is probably not a good place to start as the book covers only a small portion of it. Montgomery tries hard to make analogies between Sun Tzu's combat strategies and investment, but only manages to sound convincing half the time. Each new chapter will begin with Sun Tzu's philosophy. Parallels with investment strategies are made. The rest of the chapter would then concentrate on fundamental analysis. The sections of Montgomery's book on fundamental analysis are sound, and the case studies he cites are interesting. Investors who are new to investment would certainly enjoy stories of great investors such as Warren Buffet. The section on how to read financial statements is simple and will gently lead beginners into the area. Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of the book is Montgomery's incessant criticism of technical analysis, day-trading, and swing trading. A biased one-sided comparison given during introductions should be enough to vent his apparent anger at day-traders. Instead, the author launches a fresh salvo every chapter, and enjoys associating technical analysis with tea leaves reading, and likes to take his time to equate day-traders with fools. I think a more grounded argument would have been preferable to petty name calling. One wonders why 1/5 of the book is spent on bashing people who don't do long term investments. A chip on his shoulder, perhaps? If he had any training in technical analysis, he would realise that Sun Tzu's philosophy of universal truths also applies well in that area. My advice: For the price of $30+ (current price), there are far better books on investment (fundamental analysis), and certainly much more enlightening ones on Sun Tzu. If you see this book going for $10 one day, buy it for a change from other investment books. This book is ideal for beginners who want to kill two birds with one stone."},{"Title":"Sun Tzu on Investing: 15 Strategies for Dynamic Investments","review":"When I first came across the title of the book.

But it actually ends up being a meshing of the driving forces of the two sections that preceded it; those looking for prurient interest are likely to be quite disappointed. That said, the book is never less than readable, and Roach's personal quest, which is what the thesis of this book boils down to, is engaging enough that it's unlikely the reader will find himself with an overwhelming necessity to, say, throw the book under the couch to feed the dustbunnies.I get the feeling there could have been more to this book-- a lot more, perhaps-- but an equal part of me feels that it simply wouldn't to do get rid of the mystery altogether, would it? ***"},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"Redheads have fascinated me nearly my entire life. I have no idea why. I'm not a redhead nor are there any redheads in my family. Maybe it's ingrained into my Irish genes. Who knows? In any case, I'm always searching for a deeper understanding of this subconscious obsession. So, I read this new book by Ms. Roach.In The Roots of Desire we do get a bit of insight into the meaning of red hair. Part history, part science report, part memoir, in this book Ms. Roach combs out some intriguing information: stories from religion & myth, genetic codes & psychological research, personal anecdotes. Overall, however, I was left a bit disappointed.Perhaps I was simply hoping for something more or different, but I felt I was left unchanged by this book. I found it to be meandering when I wanted it to come to a point. I found it to be scattershot when I wanted more focus. In the end, I felt I knew more facts about redheads but nothing more about myself and my connection to them. Still, for someone who has an interest in redheads, this is a hard book to pass up. It has its pleasures which should be experienced."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"i actually got this book as a replacement for a friend whose book i borrowed and accidentally destroyed the cover, so now i have her old copy. im not a red head, but she recommended the book so i read it. i dont really like the author's tone, though thats more of a personal preference. it is very interesting and easy to read, so it was easy for me to look past the fact that i found the author to be a bit annoying."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"I have red hair, as did my mother and her mother. Other books I have support many theories and facts that MARION ROACH includes in this book about red hair. There were, of course, sections included that strayed from this main topic, but I assume it was the author's well-intended attempt to familiarize/personalize herself with readers so we could learn & know more about her as a person. She is talented and dynamic. I am also gonna bet that she's like me, O-Negative.

It is very interesting and has a lot of good stuff in it."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"I found a number of inaccuracies in this book, causing me to wonder about the veracity of other information presented. I was at the Witch Camp mentioned in the book; the author not only had several facts wrong, she cited two different numbers for total attendance; each figure was incorrect, but I was amazed that an editor didn't catch the inconsistency of her inaccuracies. In her stretch to use \\"fresh\\" language, she sometimes completely ignored the meanings of words. While using \\"hair\\" terms, such as \\"braided\\" cleverly, the impact was dulled by redundancy. The book contains many loose ends. For instance, she has heard that witches are often red-headed and goes to witch camp to check on this - yet she never tells us how many - if any - red heads were there. On the other hand, she claims that there were a preponderance of witches named Lilith - personally, I know of only two by that name in attendance then. She claims that the Vikings were red headed. While this may be so, the more common assumption is that Vikings were blond; Eric the Red was so-called because of his unusual and therefore distinguishing coloring. Perhaps an editor could have salvaged this book; as it is, it's a carelessly written bit of nonsense."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"I was given this book as a gift and as a redhead myself I was excited to read it.

So I went to see what other reviewers thought, and redheaded fan is (according to the Wish List attached to their review) also named Gary Taubes. Not the same Gary Taubes who gets thanked personally in the acknowledgments to this very book?! Wow, that would be TOTALLY inappropriate, to go to some site (or anywhere I'd say) and give a ravey review to an old friend who thanks you in that book.

I sure hope that it never makes the library."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"This book poses somewhat of a conundrum. Is it an over-thought monologue on the author's own hair color, or an exceedingly dull scholarly treatise? The answer: it is both! It's a hodge-podge of historical references, anecdotes, and Patty Scialfa. Never delving deep enough into the history, it manages to still lay on what it does say with an all-too heavy brush, dripping with overindulgent prose.In the end, it is sound and fury signifying... the onset of sleep.

I kept waiting for it to get good, or have a real point to it. I am a real redhead and was excited to learn all about the genetics and myths surrounding my haircolor. While I learned some things, I could have read a 10-page essay instead of this wordy 220-page book. Seriously, she would write an entire chapter on something that needed only a paragraph to explain.I loved how with 20 pages left to go she comes to the realization that a redhead's identity is shaped not just by the myths and by genetics, but also by one's personal experiences. Gee, you think? I couldn't relate to much of what this woman wrote about. Also, she makes sweeping generalizations about redheads, many of which were not true in regards to me. For example, apparently I am the only one on the planet to have never heard that all redheads are witches.In regards to being anti-Christian, she writes that she understands why someone would not want to be Lutheran without explaining it. Um, that's certainly not respectful of the Christian religion. There are other slights which someone super sensitive might be taken aback by, and which those that are anti-Christian wouldn't even begin to notice. However, as a Christian I didn't put this book down offended on a religious level, but more on a redheaded level. The idea that we all share the same identity is ludicrous."},{"Title":"The Roots of Desire: The Myth, Meaning, and Sexual Power of Red Hair","review":"This is an absolute waste of paper and money.

It meanders around, skipping here and there, wandering off on tangents, and never getting to the point. There were a few tidbits of good information sprinkled throughout, but the lack of focus and organization just made the book a big disappointment.I did get one good piece of information, though.

She flows into tangent after tangent, with moments of wit, and then fails to deliver any \\"final knowledge.\\"As far as any allegations of an anti-christian nature to the book, well, it's called superstition, and christians weren't exempt from that, however much they would try to deny it.

Maybe becasue she's a redhead, she wanted to be so very, very special, so she took a few supposed facts and made a whole concept from them. Come on!

As a 10 year old, I wanted to hang out with Alvin and Shoey. The books are full of laughs, adventure, and great storytelling. They take us back to small town America, before kids had to deal with grownup problems.If you have a kid, buy this book for him. Buy it used, buy it on Ebay, buy it at a used bookstore! The other titles (all very good) in the series are ALVIN'S SECRET CODE, ALVIN'S SWAP SHOP, ALVIN FERNALD FOREIGN TRADER, ALVIN FERNALD MAYOR FOR A DAY, and ALVIN FERNALD SUPERWEASEL. All are great.

Kids are free from dealing with divorce, AIDS, broken promises, puberties-gone-bad and all the other bibliotherapy themes that seem to permeate the current books for children. Not that those aren't important, but this one is a time-out from seriousness, and is a roller coaster ride, a non-stop comedy routine, and a mystery which actually develops in a BELIEVABLE manner. It is such REFRESHING FUN. The story line is so adeptly crafted by its author, Clifford B. Hicks, a talented writer of much expertise and experience. Books like this separate the usual books that have plagued the children's market for the last several years by formula hack writers from those written by truly talented children's writers, like Clifford B. Hicks. It's such a relief to read something so enjoyable and so NOT-FORMULA. Single this book out for your children and leave the over-used theme, big yawn books to others less discriminating.

Thankfully, stories of mystery, danger, and plucky kid geniuses still hold sway with American juvenile readers (witness the success of the Magic Treehouse series and the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew graphic novels from Papercutz).Treat your elementary school-aged kid(s) to a reading of this book--you'll both enjoy it.

First one , than the other, and they were gone all summer. So I found this box, way back in the back of the garage, and inside, was a huge treasure of books.

In the previous volume, Avtokrator Likinios of Videssos is overthrown by one of his generals and his family is wiped out. Sharbaraz King of Kings decides to take back the lands relinquished to Likinios while punishing the usurper Genesios.In this novel, the Maniakai had been banished to Kalavria by Likinios after Sharbaraz was restored to his throne and then they had been left in exile by Genesios. The elder Maniakes is Governor of the island and the younger Maniakes is his deputy. Their residence is within the fortress above Kastavala, the main city on the island.After half a dozen years on the island, the Maniakai spot a ship heading toward the harbor and the younger Maniakes goes down to the quay to learn the news. The ship is carrying passengers, grandees from Videssos the City. They all want to talk to Maniakes the Elder.Kourikos is the spokesman for the group and also the father of the younger Maniakes's betrothed Niphone. When the elder Maniakes comes into their presence, the grandees all fall into a full proskenesis before him. They have come to ask him to overthrow Genesios and take the throne of the empire.Genesios has been a very bad Avtokrator, killing his supposed enemies right and left and ignoring the depredations of the Kubratoi and the Makuraners. He is widely hated and feared, but admired by none. The basic question is whether anyone will defend his right to the throne.Maniakes the Elder refuses to try for the throne, but he offers his son as an alternative. The grandees agree to back Maniakes the Younger for Avtokrator, but not without inner doubts. The younger Maniakes and his cousin Rhegorios sail with most of the ships and troops of Kalavria to overcome the current Avtokrator.In this story, the small fleet sails across the Sailors' Sea to Opsikion, another provincial city larger than Kastavala. There the governor, the military and naval leaders, and most of the citizenry join his cause. After integrating the army with his troops, Rhegorios heads overland toward Videssos the City.Maniakes the Younger adds the naval forces of Opsikion to his own and sails toward the Key, a major naval base protecting Videssos the City. About a third of the fleet join him before he gets to the Key and most of the rest declare for him near the island. While he is integrating his forces and planning the battle ahead, a sorcerer attacks him and the naval commander Erinakios. Bagdasares the wizard saves him, but Erinakios is murdered.When they reach Videssos the City, the sailors have to protect him from the adoring mob. Genesios flees the palace, but is found by the sailors. Maniakes the Younger executes him on the spot.This story puts the younger Maniakes on the throne, but he is faced by all the problems created by Genesios. The Makuraners are still in the westlands and the Kubratoi are still raiding in the north. The treasury in very low and the army troopers are scarce. He institutes a recruiting and training program, but no revenues are coming in from much of the empire.Avtokrator Maniakes sends for his father, uncle and cousin in Kastavala to come to Videssos the City and sends messages out to commanders in the westlands asking about his brothers. He receives word that Tatoules is missing in action and may be a prisoner of the Makuraners. He hears nothing at all about Parsmanios.Avtokrator Maniakes tries several times to turn things around, but has little success. He keeps trying to do more than Videssos is capable of doing at the time. Things are looking very gloomy for his reign.This tale is loosely based on the history of the Byzantine Empire, starting with the overthrow of Phokas in 610 AD and the ascension of Heraclius as emperor. The story presents a modified -- and enhanced -- version of these historical events. The reversed and distorted geography and renamed sites are only the start of these modifications. The character names are also changed. However, little is actually known of this period in Byzantine history, so there is plenty of room for creative expression in the dialogues.This work ends with an upturn in the fortunes of Avtokrator Maniakes and his empire. Hopefully, the next volume will continue this trend. Enjoy!Highly recommended for Turtledove fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of foreign cultures, military combat, and marital relations.-Arthur W. Jordin"},{"Title":"HAMMER AND ANVIL (Book II of The Time of Troubles)","review":"In which Maniakes seeks the throne of Videssos ...This is the second of the original four books of the \\"Time of Troubles\\" quartet. It is set in the same world as the \\"Misplaced Legion\\" books, but several hundred years earlier. Anyone buying the books of this sequence has to be careful because of a change in the way the volumes are organised in more recent printings.As originally published, the four books of this story were:\\"The Stolen Throne\\"\\"Hammer and Anvil\\"\\"The Thousand Cities\\"\\"Videssos Besieged\\"\\"The Stolen Throne\\" and \\"Hammer and Anvil\\" have also been published together as \\"The Time of Troubles Part I\\"; similarly \\"The Thousand Cities\\" and \\"Videssos Besieged\\" are published together as \\"The Time of Troubles Part II\\".The \\"Time of Troubles\\" series works best if you read the components in chronological order, but it does not particularly matter whether you read them before or after the \\"Misplaced Legion\\" or \\"Krispos\\" books.\\"The Stolen Throne\\" is told from the viewpoint of Maniakes, son of Maniakes, who helped Abivard put the rightful King of Kings back on the throne of Makuran in the first book.At the start of the book a vile usurper and tyrant, Genesios, is on the throne of Videssos. Fearing a potential rival, the previous legitimate Emperor had sent the Maniakes clan to a distant island where the father was made governor. Consequently they were not at hand to be executed when Genesios launched a reign of terror in which he killed almost every prominent man in Videssos the City. But to save the city, Maniakes is asked to proclaim himself emperor...The central figure of \\"Bridge of the Separator\\" and principal bad guy from the \\"Misplaced Legion\\" quartet, Rhavas or Avshar, has an offstage part in this book. Genesios has a very powerful court wizard, who is noy named but who is very obviously Rhavas: the cover art shows a monster which Rhavas sends to attack Maniakes in his bed. Very fortunately for Maniakes, at some stage since \\"Bridge of the Separator\\" Rhavas appears to have lost the power to make anyone literally drop dead just by cursing them.This series alternates between books told from the viewpoint of Abivard the general of Makuran, and books told from the viewpoint of the Videssian, Maniakes.I enjoyed \\"The Time of Troubles\\" sequence and recommend it.There are currently 12 novels set in the \\"Videssos\\" universe of which \\"Hammer and Anvil\\" is chronologically the third. The full list is as follows (dates assume that years in Videssos correspond to those in our world.)c. 850 BC - \\"Bridge of the Separator\\"c. 700 BC - The Time of Troubles series\\"The Stolen Throne\\"\\"Hammer and Anvil\\"\\"The Thousand Cities\\"\\"Videssos Besieged\\"c. 550 BC - \\"The Tale of Krispos\\" trilogy\\"Krispos Rising\\"\\"Krispos of Videssos\\"\\"Krispos the Emperor\\"56 BC - \\"The Misplaced Legion\\" quartet\\"The Misplaced Legion\\"\\"An Emperor for the Legion\\"\\"The Legion of Videssos\\"\\"Swords of the Legion\\""},{"Title":"Elementary theory of equations","review":"Dickson was the first truly great mathematician from the United States. A gifted number theorist, he also cared very deeply about the pedagogy of mathematics. For those of you who teach high school mathematics, and who teach the quadratic formula every semester, have you ever been asked by precocious students about the cubic formula? the quartic formula? Dickson explains them and gives very well-written exercises throughout the book. His exposition on symmetric polynomials is first-rate (and a good introduction to Galois Theory the way that Galois would have done it). By defining polynomial differentiation by the binomial theorem for (x + delta x), he allows the power of analysis to be used without any of the thorny topological considerations best left for a Real Analysis course. I crack this book open at least once a semester. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Elementary theory of equations","review":"I agree with the other reviewer concerning the content. And this is my favorite from Dickson.So I want to address the actual qualit of the reprint. This is a photocopy of the book, which is not in itself a total negative, but for the price the publishers really have to justify it.How do they? Well the one good point is that it is enlarged, so the presentation is better than an electronic version to a certain extent.Is it worth it to you for a printed copy which is enlarged for easier reading? I don't know, that is for you to decide.I personally find the price a little high for an enlargement.But this is a great text by the author. There is gold in this book for the true students of math."},{"Title":"Memo : To : The Boss, from : MacK, Contemporary Rendering of the Prince by Niccolo Machiavelli","review":"This book has kept its relevance for the most part over the last half a century or so. The book cites examples given throughout history and are mainly used from the Italian Renaissance. The masterpiece by Machaivelli can be compared to none. This epic holds more information in the hundred or so pages it contains than your average five hundred page novel. The Prince has lasted over the years and is almost a philosophical type of novel. The rules it provides continue to be useful in today's world if applied right."},{"Title":"A Stubborn hope: Without disappointment","review":"I took this book to the beach for a little light reading and ended up not being able to put it down!! I read the whole book in about six hours.The author, Jeanne DeTellis, tells about her life and her dreams of serving God as a missionary and how that dream finally became a reality. But the truly inspiring part of the book, is what happens to her personally along the way, and how she came through it with an even stronger faith in God than before.Reading this book made me realize that no matter how much life tries to get you down, if you stay focused on God, you can and will get through anything that happens to you on this earth.I had the very wonderful pleasure of meeting Jeanne DeTellis recently and she is just as full of life and love for God and the people she serves in Haiti and the Dominican Republic as she reveals in this book. Her bubbly personality is contagious and being around her, and knowing about the trials she has come through with flying colors, is truly a blessing.I HIGHLY recommend reading this book. I laughed, I cried and I praised God for this woman and her family!!"},{"Title":"A Stubborn hope: Without disappointment","review":"This book is very therapeutic. As Jeanne shares her hurts and God's faithfulness, you think of all the valleys He's brought you through and give thanks to God. I gave this book to a friend who just lost her sister to cancer and she said if she didn't have this book to read and relate to ...she would not be making it through this dark time. Thank you Jeanne for opening up your heart in this book so we can learn to have a stubborn hope in the Lord. He is faithful!"},{"Title":"Creating Space: Essential Home Organization","review":"A few helpful hints among 160 pages of wasted space. Not a solution in the book. Nice pictures, but not practical for the family looking for storage and orgainzation ideas. Even the choice of font and layout make this one difficult to read. If you are looking for a practical home orgainization book (I was looking for a home office organization book), skip this one."},{"Title":"Creating Space: Essential Home Organization","review":"I was anticipating more forward thinking solutions to the home organization problem. I was not, however, disappointed with the photographs. Having recently purchased the Lighting Design Sourcebook by Wilhide, I knew, at the very least I would be getting some beautiful photos. The book is broken down into areas of the home (kid's rooms, living spaces...)and attacks each one separately offering &quot;stylish&quot; storage solutions. This book is clearly aimed at the homeowner looking to throw out the cardboard closet organizer and add a built-in, not the professional designer looking to supplement a design library with novel storage design resolutions."},{"Title":"Creating Space: Essential Home Organization","review":"This is one of the first books I read which suggested truly individualized ways for home owners, office planners, etc..to think about the way they used their space - rather than suggesting a cookie cutter approach to room and storage function. I really liked that approach.This point was driven home early in the book where one homeowner showcases a collection of lunchboxes - not something that just anyone would collect - and, obviously, requiring an innovative use of wall space to highlight them. In other, more traditional rooms, other storage ideas were suggested, along with floor plans to make the maximum use of space. There is a strong emphasis on form, function and aesthetics - in short, great ideas which also look good."},{"Title":"And All These Roads be Luminous: Poems Selected and New","review":"she is angela jackson from woodside california, by way of chicago, by way of woodville mississipi, born from the goddess...her poems speak blues, religion, jazz, down-home cooking, long lasting sugar kisses and journeys by astral travelling. she is a spider walking across the face of history a spook opening her heart to reveal her family secrets...this book is poignant, powerful, sexy, and shows the capabilities of lamguage when placed with someone who has respect for it....very few poetry books have moved me...this one does...."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"This is a wonderful text full of history and thought, and beautiful illustrations. The author extensively explores the origins of numerous Christmas traditions,e.g., lights, evergreens, yule logs, etc. by tracing these customs to the occurance and celebration of the winter solstice, and in later history, to many Roman celebrations. The text adds greater richness, understanding, and appreciation to many Christmas traditions. The author also offers suggestions for celebrating the winter solstice as the important celestial event that it is."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"Very complete with history and lore as well as activites. Two thumbs up on this one. Great pictures too. Information is presented in a very straight-forward way. I love this book - made for a much more meaningful christmas for me this year. The table of contents has:1) The Solstice Dream (this chapter talks to Solstice celebrations and lore across the world and across the ages - from egypt to china to Rome. Poetry and prose from other sources are included.) All chapters end with celebration activites2) Child of Wonder (this chapter talks to the birth of different gods across the ages - such as apollo, mabon, jesus)3) The Green Bough (this chapter talks to the symbolism of the tree, the use of evergreens versus cherry tree etc. Green man is also discussed)4) Old Sir Christmas (this chapter talks to the jolly old elf as well as the Shaman in the Tree and others across the cultures)5) The Solstice Animals (this is about the slaughter of animals - 'nough said there - go vegetarian!)6) The 12 days of ChristmasAt the end of the book is a few pages on additional resources/references which is pretty good.Great book! Most complete I've found and I like how it looks across cultures."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"I almost didn't buy this book because it had Christmas in the title and I supposed it would not have much in the way of the pagan holiday. I was very wrong. This is the best book I have ever read on the solstice. It tells of celebrating Yule before Christianity abducted it. &quot;The Winter Solstice&quot; has the look of an arty, coffee table book but it is definitely worth the read. It offers a couple of small rituals and some great phrases for ceremonies. It is more of a scholary history than a magickal book. I cannot wait to read it again next December to get me in the Yule spirit!"},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"One of the better books I have seen when it comes bringing religion and folklore together - from the origin of the Christmas tree to the meaning behind the Twelve Days of Christmas. A must buy to the pagan as well as the Christian."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"Most people who celebrate Christmas know that numerous elements of our modern traditions come from older religions than Christianity, but the range of source traditions astounds me. There is, for instance, no one source of the practice of observing the winter solstice itself, of myths involving the death or sacrifice and rebirth of a deity, or of father and son symbols for the old year and the new. Many sources are cited in the book as possible origins of Santa Claus, of the giving of gifts, and the custom of bringing greenery indoors.It's not the diversity of customs that fascinates me so much as the variety of myths and stories that impact on an emotional level. When I consider the winter solstice traditions presented here, as a whole, I realize how similar all cultures are in their most basic concerns. The winter solstice was a time of great disquiet to people who lived close to the earth, more than a couple of centuries ago. The shortening of days, scarcity of food, and intense cold of winter carried far deeper implications for those who lived directly off the land and couldn't quickly transport needed goods. It's no surprise some important and deeply meaningful traditions arose from the resulting insecurity about the future.Whatever the reason behind the timing of Christmas so near the solstice, and whatever your beliefs about it or your reason for reading, you'll find a wealth of information in The Winter Solstice. This impressively researched book even contains ideas for creating celebrations and traditions of your own. It's a fitting tribute to this most ancient holy day. If your celebration centers around the birth of Jesus, never fear. There's a wealth of commentary and research included on traditions specific to Christianity. But an open mind is required to sift through the myth, legend, history, and blending of customs. This is not a book conducive to fundamentalist thinking about religion-any religion, Christian, pagan or otherwise. It's far better suited to those with a penchant for myth and speculation.A few of the subjects covered in the first chapter are The Returning Sun, Chambers of the Sun and Sun-Rites, with mention of those ancient structures built for the purpose of calculating or demonstrating the sun's return at the turn of the solstice, such as Stonehenge in England, New Grange in Ireland, and Mayan ruins. Zuni houses in North America contained objects and windows designed to catch the rays of the returning sun. Saturnalia, New Year rites, the Celtic Calendar, and the sun gods of Egypt and elsewhere are also mentioned, as well as a fifteen hundred-year-old Jewish commentary on the Babylonian Talmud. This is just a taste, mind you, and only from the first chapter.The information is presented in short sections, so it's easy to pick up and read a few paragraphs. But these paragraphs will easily draw you in for a longer read. It can be read straight through, or enjoyed as a coffee table book to share with friends, and to stimulate discussion and speculation. It's a must-read, for me, during the December holidays."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"I've always loved Christmas. But a few years ago I deconverted from faith; I found myself, as an atheist and humanist, longing for a connection to the holiday I loved. This book helped me forge a new perspective on, and a new connection with, Christmas as a worldly and human celebration.Each chapter provides cross-cultural connections to the ideas, customs, and icons of Christmas. Even when Matthews seems to be reaching a bit, it makes for engaging reading, and provides the rest of us with a way to connect with America's (and much of the Western World's) most important holiday season. It's especially engaging to know the origins of certain figures and beliefs; rarely are the origins religious, but cultural and traditional. [My favorite chapter was on the Twelve Days of Christmas.] The presentation of faith-free rituals at the end of each chapter was especially welcome, and I have already incorporated some small, new traditions into my holiday activities.I recommend it to readers of all faiths or non-faiths. Every open-minded reader can find something of interest. Only literal Fundamentalists will be offended!"},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"The Winter Solstice (as with the solstices and equinoxes) hold a special place in our world because anyone can celebrate them. So many cultures and religions have customs, beliefs, rituals that occur on or around the Solstice.This book highlights some well known and not so well know European Solstice and Yule customs. It also delves quite a bit into Christmas customs that were influenced by eariler Pagan ones. But the information in this book is extended outside the Euro realm and reaches many cultures - really emphasising a common bond between all people.The book is nice enough to offer as a gift or a coffetable treasure. It has a wonderful layout and lots of beautiful pictures, drawings, and poems. In the back of the book it has a couple of Rituals/ Plays that are suitable for public Ritual or a seasonal play.This book can be enjoyed by anyone but definitely appeals to Pagans or curious/ liberal Christians."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"I'm a teacher and the author of a book on the winter solstice for children. I wish this book had been available as a resource when I was writing mine. My book Is extensively researched, but I had to pull the pieces together from many scattered sources.Mr. Matthews has done a remarkable job with this very slippery subject. The origins of solsltice traditions and its symbols are shrouded in the mists of time. It's not easy to disentagle the historical truth from myth and legend.When I was teaching elementary school, the children in my class were from China, Japan, Mexico, the Phillipines, Saudi Arabia, and many other countries. Teaching about the winter solstice allowed me to bring all the various traditions together and to emphasize my students' common humanity.Hats off to Mr. Matthews!Ellen Jackson, authorTHE WINTER SOLSTICEThe Winter Solstice"},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"I have one, and sent one as a gift this holiday.

It is partly to redress this trend that the present book has been written... In this book we shall consider the origins of the customs surrounding the Solstice, including such matters as the significance of the timing of Christmas...\\" (Pg. 8)He observes, \\"In our own time the Solstice is indissolubly linked with the festival of Christmas, though it was not always so. The myths of the festival are so deeply imbedded within us that we no longer ask why we decorate a fir tree at this time, or why we place green boughs and candles in our home... Yet even here we forget the season is really twelve days in length---we sing the carol 'The Twelve Days of Christmas,' but we have little understanding of its origin.\\" (Pg. 6)He argues, \\"several of the more familiar customs originate in surprisingly different places and times. For example, the Yule Log, originating in pagan Scandinavia, once celebrated the turning of the magical year... The Christmas Tree began life as the Solstice Evergreen... Santa really derives from an even earlier set of figures---the shamans who were the first priests and magicians of the human race.\\" (Pg. 7)He states, \\"For the people of the old world, the solstices effectively divide the year in two, a dark half and a light half... This was above all a time of celebration, of ritual acts designed to align the individual with the cosmos.\\" (Pg. 15) He adds, \\"The Solstice is a time of quietude, of firelight and dreaming... All around us the season seems to reach a standstill---a point of repose. Then, as the Solstice sun moves across the heavens, the new year wakens, the darkness is dispelled, the days grow longer, and we prepare for new beginnings.\\" (Pg. 42)He suggests, \\"We can be certain that from the time of our earliest ancestors the existence of plants that were 'evergreen,' which did not wither and die with the onset of the long dark days of Winter, were perceived as a metaphor for the undying gods of the natural world. Just as the Midwinter fires celebrated the longed for return of the sun, so did the evergreen tree signify the continuing presence of burgeoning life in the midst of Winter's sleep of death.\\" (Pg. 78)This extremely interesting book contains a wealth of detailed information about these traditions that are often underlying the traditions of Christmas that we are accumstomed to; it will be of great interest to anyone studying the background of Christmas, as well as the other winter holidays."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"a fascinating and stimulating account that seems to put things into the proper perspective.

I was not only disappointed but surprised at the lack of research that resulted in the remark that in the United States, Southerners evidently believed that shooting at a tree with mistletoe would cause the plant to fall to the ground. In the most exact sense that is true: mistletoe grows at the top of tall oak trees, and actually shooting it down is the easiest and safest way to obtain it; not some \\"whammy\\" ignorant people use to obtain a desired object. I think a little more work would have resulted in a little less disdain."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"All the questions I had on Saturnalia were answered and with color and cross references to other and similar practices. I believe that the authors missed the fact that Xtianity consciously coopted pagan ritual and practice to make the new faith less of a radical change from the old ways of pagan worship and also to put an end to customs which included human sacrifice and orgiastic behavior. It like a how-to manual on neo-paganism. Since I believe the monotheistic faiths are superior manifestations of our incomplete understanding of God, I cannot accept parallels which were never taken more seriously by the church than to rid the human race of the dark side of paganism. This book is scholarly to a point but what I was looking for would best be found in a book about the transition from paganism to christianity. I am profounly disappointed that the faith of western christianity has been so weekened that a book on the restoration of pagan practices can gain a mass audience and seriously be considered on a par with the traditional faiths: Judaism,Christianity,Islam."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"Any look around in December will tell you that Christmas is not just about the birth of Jesus Christ. As a Christian, I have long known that the celebration of the birth of Jesus was imposed on a much older tradition, Saturnalia, the Calends of January, and so on. This book did not in any way criticize or downplay the traditions I hold sacred and, in fact, it validated them with excellent historical research. It is for the broader background to the holiday and customs that I purchased this book, and I found it packed with information on the historical St. Nicholas, and the conglomeration that has become known as Santa Claus (Old Man Christmas). How do the Winter Solstice, Yule, gifts, evergreens, lights, mummers plays, frivolity, and abundance of feasting come into the picture? This book researches Christmas's earliest pagan customs and traditions. I did enjoy the perspective on the twelve days of Christmas, which emphasizes the festival aspect of this season spanning many days; our commercial society has lost the festival aspect in favor of celebrating a single holiday. At the center of the season, whether you are a pagan, Christian, or otherwise, is the Winter Solstice, the death and rebirth of the sun, and I plan to try some activities suggested in this book to mark that event. We are drawn to the hearth, we admire twinkling lights, and we keep candlelight vigils in celebration of the coming of the sun of light into the world; it's no wonder this season became forever after intertwined with the Christian tradition of the Incarnation, the birth of the Child of Wonder who is the Light of the World."},{"Title":"Winter Solstice","review":"Excellent Book.

How could we possibly insult our children by making them think they're THIS ignorant?One child was swift to point out, \\"Does Larry have a last name, too? Or is he sharing the last name of Lilly? As in 'Harry and Lily Potter' do?And I had no choice but to confirm that yes, there is indeed a reason why these books are so.. uh... disturbing. They're related. And happily dating.Btw, the first book, \\"Larry Potter and his best friend Lilly...\\" you can clearly see in the book cover that Lilly, for a best friend, is a little too snug on the \\"personal space\\" touching. Even Ron wouldn't be caught in that pose with Harry and they're REAL best friends! So does that cover count as a spoiler? Cause for some strange reason \\"More than just friends\\" was more of a joke than a surprise. .Glad it was borrowed and not bought.And grats on little Kathrine smart enough to figure out the mystery behind the nonsense! &lt;3"},{"Title":"Larry & Lilly Potter: More Than Just Friends","review":"My cousin bought this book to read to his young sons. I decided to read it first before he did.At first I thought it was going to be all right. But as I started to read the story. I found that it was flat and not moving like you would have thought. Plus the title itself states sexual possiblities between Lilly and Larry Potter.Now don't get me wrong here, More than just friends is a term that most older adults would use for their 'sexual partners' who are not married to them. If I told my friend that I'm more than just friends with so and so person, the first thing that comes to their mind is oh she's having sex with him.I didn't read past the first three pages which is more than I did with the other books, I returned the book to my cousin and told him return it for a refund or an exchange of another book that is worth your time to read to your sons.Don't waste your money on this book it's not worth it."},{"Title":"Larry & Lilly Potter: More Than Just Friends","review":"you may not take me seriously because i am a teenager but i am a big fan of the harry potter books. larry potter pails in comparison to harry potter and basically any other book it also uses similar termonoilgy and is a copycat that is why i even brought up harry potterso dont waste your time reading this book life isnt long enough"},{"Title":"Larry & Lilly Potter: More Than Just Friends","review":"I came down very hard on &quot;N.K.&quot; Stouffer's work in another review, so here I'll give her a small amount of credit. This isn't a great book, but for what it is -- a simple book aimed at very young readers -- it isn't bad. Young children might enjoy guessing what relation Larry and Lilly are to each other, and the book is actually a good deal better than the atrocious &quot;The Legend of Rah and the Muggles.&quot; I didn't love the illustrations, but children might not be so fussy.It probably goes without saying that Larry and Lilly Potter aren't wizards and bear no resemblance whatsoever to Harry and Lily Potter, but if you're looking for a fun book for a beginning reader this isn't a terrible choice.

Take my advice- save a tree and ditch this terrible book!"},{"Title":"Larry & Lilly Potter: More Than Just Friends","review":"I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers."},{"Title":"A Hero in Every Heart: Champions from All Walks of Life Share Powerful Messages to Inspire The Hero in Each of Us","review":"This is a great book.

The true mark of any book is whether or not the author can transport the reader into his/her world, commanding their rapt attention from the opening page until the last and McCoys' 'Guide to Radio Programming' fits snuggly into this mold. The books takes the reader carefully and swiftly from Mr. McCoy's humble radio beginnings in Utica, New York to the present day. It is in the journey that we learn where Quincy gained his radio genuis. Well known programmers like Paul Drew, Jerry Clifton, and Bill Tanner are interviewed by McCoy and speak to him about the science of radio programming and creativity not only as a subject for an interview but as a dear and respected friend. Among the legendary radio personalities that Mr. McCoy reems an enormous amount of information and insight from are Dan Ingram, Chuck Leonard, and John Mason.This book is an absolute MUST for any radio professional (or future professional) who wants to learn the basics of radio programming, and more importantly creativity; an art somehow lost through in this age of over consolidation."},{"Title":"No Static: A Guide to Creative Radio Programming","review":"As a person in the radio industry, &quot;No static&quot; gives one the straight goods.

He developed a reformist philosophy which sought to persuade all people to rearrange society so that the means of production were owned in common by all members of the society. He tried to establish these ideas in practice by experimentation in his home town of New Lanarck, England and in the United States.In 1825 he purchased 30.000 acres in Indiana near the present town of New Harmony, Indiana. He established a self-contained community on that location which lasted just three years. He then returned to England and tried other experiments their and did extensive writing on his ideas.This book contains a short survey of Robert Owen's life and a sample of his ideas taken for his writings. It is a worthy addition to any history library."},{"Title":"The life and ideas of Robert Owen","review":"The Life and Ideas of Robert OwenBy A. L. MortonBook ReviewBy Richard E. NobleI stumbled across the name Robert Owen cross-reading for my book, America on Strike. My book is on the American Labor movement and deals with various famous strikes throughout American History.Mr. Owen was most notable for operating a factory in New Lanark, Scotland that was opened by David Dale and Richard Arkwright in 1785.Robert Owen took the factory over in 1800. Prior to that time he had been running a successful textile factory in Manchester, England. And thus began one of the most unique experiments in industrial history. With about 2000 poor and destitute - drunks, homeless, poverty stricken, criminal, uneducated rabble - including 500 children from various poor houses, Robert Owen built a successful and quite prosperous Mill town community.This experiment in social engineering was so successful that people came from around the world to see with their own eyes this, thought to be impossible, miracle. My hometown of Lawrence and its sister city of Lowell were supposedly fashioned via inspiration from Mr. Owen and his ideas and example.Robert Owen was born May 14, 1771 and died in November of 1858. He is the quintessential model for the self-made man. Born to a large working family he set off at the age of ten to make his fortune. And he did.He went to London and then to Stamford in Lincolnshire. There he apprenticed himself to a well established draper.By the time he was a young man of just twenty years of age and now experienced in business and factory work, he made his boss, Mr. Drinkwater, a proposition to take over and manage his factory and run it more profitably than ever before. The boss accepted and Robert fulfilled his boast and bought into the firm as a partner.In 1779 he went on a business trip to Glasgow and met Anne Caroline Dale, daughter of mill owner David Dale. He ended up marrying Caroline. And in time, he became manager and partner in the Manchester factory and then talked his partners into purchasing the factory in New Lanark.His success at New Lanark astounded the world. He became very wealthy and well respected.He had \\"discovered\\" a philosophy. Men were the product of their circumstances. Their characters were not made by them but for them. Provide men, women and children with positive circumstances and they will live positive productive lives. Men are not to be judged or to be praised. They are therefore not responsible and should be treated reasonably and fairly whatever their actions. Clarence Darrow had a similar philosophy.He became a philanthropist and a Utopian. He attempted colonies or communes in the New World. One was called New Harmony and was attempted in Indiana.He was a man of unlimited self confidence. He loved children and dreamed of creating a perfect world. He made written plans for this New World and even named it. It would be called New Jerusalem. Talk about being a man with a plan.He supposedly coined the word Socialism. It was designed to be contrasted with the word Individualism. Individualism had grown to represent selfishness and indifference to one's neighbors and the community. Socialism would be the opposite of individualism and it would represent the spirit of social responsibility - man's love and sense of obligation to one another.This book is a patchwork of writings and ideas of Robert Owen. It is bits and pieces and slices from the writings of Mr. Owen. It provides a good overview of Mr. Owen and his ideas and philosophy but I find it somewhat disjointed and bumpy. Owen wrote an autobiography in his later days. Unfortunately he went over the deep end as an old man and fell off into the world of spiritualism and talking with \\"spirits.\\" He was not a fan of organized religion and spoke openly and publicly about the perils of religious thinking.Robert Owen was a giant in the advancement of Labor and fair play for the poor in Britain. He was a talker and a doer. He put his money where his mouth was. I'm not a fan of communal life but Owen and his ideas on cooperative businesses and social structures may be having a comeback. I will be looking into his thoughts.He was quite a character too. He was a man of overwhelming self-confidence. From what I've read so far he was a man worth knowing and I want to learn more about him.Richard Edward Noble - The Hobo Philosopher - Author of:.\\"Noble Notes on Famous Folks\\" Humor - satire - facts."},{"Title":"Nothing But Net","review":"I purchased this book when it first came out.

I live in a community where the Day of the Dead is celebrated locally. I own several fiction and non-fiction books on the topic, which I use in my primary grade classroom. While other non-fiction children's books on the Day of the Dead do a better job of explaining what happens during this celebration, this is the only book I have found that explains on an emotional level why one would want to celebrate one's dead relatives.Although the relationship between Rosalita and her grandmother is established too quickly to cause the reader any distress when she dies on the third page of the text, Rosalita's dilemma is made clear. She works through the process of remembering and grieving her \\"abuelita\\" (grandmother). She thinks about what she can place on the family altar to symbolize her relationship with her deceased grandmother. She wonders what it will feel like when her grandmother's spirit returns on the Day of the Dead.

It serves as a nice introduction to Day of The Dead, which is celebrated in Mexico, on November 2. The author fails to mention this in the book but instead makes a note of it in the authors notes. Therefore,for clarity, the adult might want to incorporate this fact into the storyline. Use of another book, likeThe Day of the Dead / Dia De Los MuertosorMexican Day of the Deadas a supplement will enrich the students learning about Day of the Dead. The story is rather flat, as noted in one of the editorial reviews here but the salvation of the book are the rich illustrations. The artist when to great lengths to create dimension in the art, resulting in exquisite drawings that will captivate the young audience. The story evolves around young Rosita's loss of her mentor and grandmother to an undisclosed sickness. After she dies Rosita longs for abuelita(grandmother) and her grandfather(abuelito) and family teach Rosita how to honor the dead. They teach her about making abuelita's favorite goodies and making an offering to her spirit at home and at the graveyard. Rosita questions whether she will \\"encounter\\" abuelita or not but is eventually touched by her spirit. This is a very cool book that explains how grief for the departed is handled in Mexican culture. As stated the illustrations are magnificent and worth the price of the book alone. Bilingual students , or those learning a language, whose first language is either English or Spanish, will benefit from the text, if read to in both languages.

The writing is engaging and erudite. For those that love nature no other guide gives you as much as this guide.HOWEVER, \\"Time Out Patagonia\\" should not be considered as your primary travel guide. It is more of a companion guide. It offers only a handful of restaurant and hotel recommendations, and often these recommendations are the most expensive. The small maps in this book are pathetic, and will help you locate nothing of significance.\\"Time Out Patagonia\\" fills in the gaps that the other guides have.

I have read it numerous times and will again in the future."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"I too read this book (1956 printing from a university library) given the influence it has had on the writing and investment philosophy of William O'Neil. To a large extent, conceptually speaking, if you've read O'Neil's major works, you've already read Loeb. The benefits I gained out of reading Loeb were: 1) Finding that time-tested investment wisdom does exist, and that O'Neil (and even Loeb) are simply restating those pearls. 2) A laugh here and there. A couple of anecdotal sections regarding Loeb's affinity for sweets were a nice diversion. But these are few since he sticks to the point. You have to dig for the humorous gems. 3) Realizing again that whether you are a business or an investor or a financial consultant, serving your client 112% and maintaining strict integrity still works. The Biblical principles upon which this country was founded didn't fail Loeb as he developed his customer base.The internet and the availability of info has changed tons of what Loeb has written, however. Reading a few reviews of his book a few decades later may well give you the meat with less effort."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"A few years ago I redHow To Make Money In Stocks: A Winning System in Good Times or Bad, 3rd Editionwhich was one of the best books on investing in stocks I've ever red. The author of that book mentionned he had over 2,000 books in his investment library with only a few very good books. He gave a list of 10 books he found best, which I've all red. Most of them were very good books (certainly for someone like me with some 150 books on investing). Books likeHow I Made $2,000,000 in the Stock MarketorReminiscences of a Stock Operator (Wiley Investment Classics)were all superb books. This was one of only books I had not red from the list. So I ordered it and began reading it with high expectations. As you can see in my rating, I did not like it all. To be honest I find the whole book one mess.

Loeb's advice to cut losses promptly helped to inspire me to develop the strategy found in my &quot;Investing: More Success With Less Stress&quot;, which I consider to be an extension of Loeb's strategy, quantified. No matter what the pros say, the buy-and-hold strategy is obsolete."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"After reading this book, all I can say is &quot;wow.&quot; That was one long book. It was full of so much information on stocks and when to buy and sell. But the information was not the same old stuff that I have heard before, I was introduced to a whole new theory of buying when everyone else says that you shouldn't because you have sound information on your side. Loeb also talked about putting a good amount of your available money in a smart investment, and watch that investment carefully. A main point that he stressed over and over was not to invest just to invest, only invest when you are going to put in the effort to make money. I thought that it was a difficult book to read because it was about economics, but I think that it might come in handy once I do get money to invest. It was written a long time ago, but I think that the advice that Loeb gives in the book can still be used today."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"This book contains lots of valuable gold nuggets but you have to find them. The book is not well organized, more than a narrative, it is a reference book but without an index. Once you have marked it up, it will become a useful reference book. I use little 3M colored tabs to do so but I think they no longer sell them.Loeb is a momentum player rather than a long term buy and hold investor or a day trader and much of his advice is pertinent to his investing style. But I found other ideas much more interesting, specially the ones about capital management. A lot of what comes out of academia and earns Nobel Prizes is appropriate for funds, mutual, hedge and others, but not necessarily for the individual investor. For example, one concept in particular that dogs funds is volatility which they equate to risk. Often an individual investor can ignore short term volatility if his investment horizon is measured in years as opposed to funds that measure performance on a quarterly basis. For funds volatility is risk. For individual investors it need not be. Once you realize the different needs of individuals vs. collective funds, you can appreciate Loeb's advice and apply it to your own investing style.This is a book worth reading but make sure you mark the places where the gold nuggets hide."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"This is the book Nicolas Darvas and William O'Neal both used as their \\"Bible\\" in stock trading as they both made millions. Since these men are my mentors through their writing and I admire both of them I had to read this book. I was not disappointed after years of reading and trading this book took me to a new level and improved my style. If you only take away a few principles from this book it will pay for itself many times over, if you study it and use it with dedication you will eventually become a millionaire through smart investing. Gerald Loeb was a top broker for E. F. Hutton and also made a fortune in his own account. He opened my eyes to very important concepts and made them clear. For one, stocks are for selling, people buy them so they can later sell them for a profit. So what we are looking for is simply a stock that others will buy in hopes of a future profit. A stock's prices do not top out at the height of the underlying businesses fundamentals, they top out when expectations for the the future is the highest. We should not look for a $1 profit on a thousand shares of a stock it would be better to look for a $10 profit on 100 shares. We should not even risk our capital on a stock unless it has the potential to increase by at least 50% in a reasonable time maybe 12 months. Do not over diversify for portfolio he agrees with Warren Buffett that we should but all our eggs in one basket and watch that basket carefully. It is actually safer to invest with companies you know inside and out. Buy a stock by starting with a small initial buy, if the stock goes up by more, but only buy after your first purchase makes you money, if it does not sell because you were wrong. This is a small taste of the wisdom this man has given us with his 40 years of experience. This book was originally written in 1935 with its last update coming in 1965 its wisdom is priceless and timeless. This edition by Wiley investment classics is nice and will be the center piece or your stock trading library and one of the few you will ever need."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"Before there was John Kelly and Edward Thorpe, it appears that Mr. Loeb knew early that concentration with a well thought out plan was much better than a diversified portfolio. As some have said, and as I apprehend to be somewhat true over the years, a diversified portfolio are for ones that don't know what they have as a diversified portfolio tends to let the losers run, and teases one to take early profits on the winners.Mr. Loeb is not totally anti buy-n-hold, just that he advises that one should spend more time on studying and trying to find a more sure, or statistically possible, big thing verses just hoping for market averages. As Mr. Buffett ascribes, one should only have twenty (20) punches and use those punches very wisely. If so, and if followed, then toss in some Charles Munger and some Kelly Optimization and bet big.Is this method for all, probably not, but the experience Mr. Loeb provides should help all to both become better investors and evaluating advisors whom ascribe their sometimes suspect knowledge that really is a veiled sales pitch. His wisdom still passes the test of time as it still reads somewhat contemporary though written many years ago.All in -- A good compilation of articles and book, and the hardback edition should be a part of any serious investor's collection."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"One of the best book written by Gerald Loeb. I liked the way he said put all your eggs in one basket and see the basket grow. Ofcourse before you put all the eggs in one basket you may want to research on the stock very carefully both the fundamental and technical details and most importantly the market needs to be in a uptrend. 3 out of 4 stocks fail in a market downtrend. Loeb bought most of his winning stock as the market was in a confirmed rally and the leaders were on the verge of breakout on higher volume. A recent such phenomenon happened on 29th Aug 2007 when the market confirmed a new rally and in that rally Baidu, Dryships, Vimpel communications rose over 100% in less than 3 months. A phenomenon seen so often."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"I can fully see why Nicolas Darvas was so adamant about this book along with Tape Reading & Market Tactics By Humphrey B. Neill. When this book was written in 1930s, it was one of the very few pure trader's books. In todays standard, it still is."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"Gerald Loeb was a well-known Wall Street profile for over 40 years. As a partner of the investment bank E.F. Hutton he broked stocks, but more importantly, he invested his own and other investors money. On top of all, he wrote popular columns in Barron's and Wall Street Today about his investment strategies and how they kept him out of the market mayhem in 1929 to 1932. As Loeb had become somewhat of a celebrity by the time this book was released it was an instant hit. It has been in constant demand from traders henceforth with reprint after reprint.Two years into Loeb's career and just when he had started to manage clients' money, the crash of 1923 wiped out most of the funds he had responsibility for. The losses and the apparent riskiness of stocks affected the young Loeb deeply and formed the investment philosophy he used going forward. In a stock market where you have to \\"fight for your survival\\" Loeb advised to only invest in the strongest leadership stock in upwards trending markets. If the market trend is down, stay in cash. If you are unsure if the trend is up or down, stay in cash. \\"The way to build long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs.\\"Loeb's book came out at about the same time that Ben Graham's Security Analysis was released and in some ways it is the antithesis of Graham's teachings. Loeb is almost agitational when it comes to valuation multiples. Intrinsic values might exist, or they might not, but while waiting for the market to, at some time in the distant future, accommodate your view of this highly uncertain value the investment was exposed to the whims of the market. For Loeb this was an invitation for disaster. I think what Loeb is really arguing against is a buy-and-hold-strategy rather than a value strategy per se. Given his 1923 experience and the vindication he received in 1929/32 this is no wonder. I also think the approach is highly relevant today. The market has historically moved in 15 to 20 year-long valuation driven cycles. Right now we are in a phase where the secular trend is sideways, with violent cyclical swings. Hence the risk of not being fully invested in the stock market at all times is low. In a few years from now the market will have grown into its valuation and then the risk of not being fully invested will be high. Hence, today is not the time to be a buy-and-holder, but in a few years it might be.For anyone who has read a more modern day text on trend following or trading, most of the advice Loeb gives will be very familiar. This is no surprise since this is one of the creeds for all the later books. Loeb searched for a combination of roughly 5 - often cyclical - companies at the time with leadership positions in their line of business, with strong corporate financials and where the trend of the stock and the trading volume was favourable. He only bought stocks where the potential was massive or else the risk was that the investment would turn sour. He wrote down the \\"single ruling reason\\" for his investment and reviewed the investments after they have been terminated. Further, Loeb cut losses short and rode his winners. He advised to understand the psychology of the crowd but try not to join it. Timeless advice.In its original 1935 edition the book had 33 chapters of 3 to 4 pages each. In the later 1965 edition another 45 similar sized chapters consisting of miscellaneous articles was added. Given that the organization of the original book is non-existent the randomness of the topics in the added chapters doesn't change the character of the book - the text is confusing, repetitive and un-organized. The reading experience is saved by Loeb's passion, deep market insight and real life examples. There are plenty of nuggets here but you have to dig hard for them.There are few other books where the author is as in sync with the market. Loeb isn't handing us his insights on a plate but there is plenty there for those who are ready to do the work.This is a review by eqtbooks.com"},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"This classic and Hasletts \\"Economics in one lesson\\" shine the light of history on markets and policy."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"I found the \\"Battle\\" educational and entertaining.

It covers such essential topics as market timing, portfolio selection, hedging one's losses, switching stocks, investing in new products and much more.David CollettiFounderStockTradersHQ.com"},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"I've read many recently published books on how to profit from the financial markets. Too many of them leave me feeling like I wasted my time and money.I decided to go back to the &quot;classics&quot;--Schabacker, Edwards and Magee, Graham, Hamilton, Rhea, and of course, Gerald Loeb.The more I read these &quot;classics&quot; of investment literature, the more I see the market hasn't fundamentally changed at all. All of those books have taught me something important, but I will always have Loeb's &quot;Battle for Investment Survival&quot; close to the top of my list.Loeb demonstrates he is fundamentally honest. Unlike most books, that get you to think becomming a millionare through daytrading is easy, Loeb teaches that there is no such thing as &quot;easy money&quot; in the financial markets, nor are there &quot;safe investments&quot; (bonds) as the value of money is constantly depreciating.He also teaches that there are NO guarantees, and that most people WILL lose money regardless of what they do. I think this is true, but most people cannot face it--even those &quot;efficient market&quot; types who advocate the buy and holding of index funds. (I believe Loeb would be a big fan of Exchange Traded Funds, however)So, what is one to do in order to preserve purchasing power? His answer: intelligent speculation and the ever-liquid account.To speculate intelligently, Loeb advises focusing on actively traded stocks--not illiquid &quot;penny stocks&quot; for your SPECULATIVE activities.Let's be clear--Gerald Loeb is no &quot;buy and hold&quot; advocate. Loeb could be considered an advocate of the &quot;relative strength&quot; approach--before the concept of &quot;relative strength&quot; ever existed.The moment your stock is failing to deliver superior profits, and you have no fundamental reason to believe its uptrend will continue, he advises you sell and look for another. If you can't find anything interesting, or the market is going down--you stay in cash. For Loeb, you MUST avoid catastrophic losses like those sustained in the crash of '29. A stock that doesn't rise (or fall if you like to short) is a waste to be avoided.Loeb is not a fan of too much diversification. He thinks it is a crutch that guarantees mediocre performance.His most important teaching would focus on money management (what we would now call &quot;asset allocation&quot;). Loeb would consider it foolish to allocate a significant (more than 50%) of your capital to stocks. You always need a cushion for those inevitable losses in trading operations.I've taken Loeb's advice to heart. His advice is even more applicable to options trading.By keeping a small amount of money in a volatile asset, and ruthlessly cutting losses, you give yourself a chance to match the market or even outperform, but with significantly less risk (volatility), due to the large cash reserves.Loeb's advice isn't easy to follow. But making money isn't easy. And by following Loeb's advice, I'm quite pleased."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"This is a book to challenge every preconception you have about investment. The world today is full of buy and hold investors (isn't that how Buffett made his billions?). And it is not hard to be a committed buy and holder when the Dow is fast approaching 7000. Buy and hold has been very profitable and almost any fool could play.But it has not always been so. Sustained bear markets do exist. And in a bear market the mugs in mutual funds become more than passingly skittish. Buy and hold was once unfashionable and it will be again. This is a book (first published in 1934) from the period where buy and hold was as deeply unfashionable as it has been any time in history. Loeb is an extreme pesimist. If the Dow ever sees 4000 again he might become popular.Loeb does not think that fundamental analysis makes any sense. He illustrates with companies which have been overvalued for years at a time and with companies where persistent undervaluation has occured.Loeb does not believe in buying good stocks and holding them. Though buying good stocks before events likely to cause revaluation might be a good idea.Loeb does not believe in diversification. A diversified portfolio will get beaten around in a bear market just as surely as an undiversified one. Moreover, a diversified portfolio will reduce the attention you can pay to individual stocks. Loeb advocates putting all your eggs in one basket and taking extra care to watch the basket.Loeb thinks that if you do not know what to do you should be in cash or near equivalents (short dated high quality paper). If you are in stocks you are in for a hiding.Loeb believes in firm (and irrevocable) stop loss rules. If you buy a good stock and it goes down sell it. Buy and holders might just be inclined to buy some more and suffer more damage at the hands of capricious bears.That these views are deeply unfashionable comes as no surprise when the buy and holders have had such a good run. I come from Australia where the index peaked at 2310 in October 1987 and has only just broken 2400. It spent years in the 1200-1500 range. New Zealand has never broken the pre-crash levels. These are markets where the general populace is scared of stocks. Mutual fund madness is unknown here. I know no Australian who invests in mutuals.I do not think that Loeb is right. But he knows a few things that very few people do know in the US market. Maybe that makes them worth knowing.This is a book about the psychology of a sustained bear market. Dow investors will not recognise it. It is more familiar to us in the Antipodes. Read it so that you will recognise it. And when everyone you know is thinking like Loeb, and the baby boomers have become 'mutual shy', pull out Graham and the other buy and hold bibles and go shopping on Wall Street."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"Gerald Loeb, stockbroker and financial writer for over 40 years, first published \\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\" in 1935 with 14 years experience in the stock market. The book has been revised 3 times since, and this edition contains the text of the 1965 revision. Loeb is distinguished by being an investor who opposed the buy-and-hold philosophy, which wasn't popular in his day anyway, but it sets him apart from many popular investment pundits today. Most of the book's contents are intended for \\"the average inexperienced investor\\", although I think a novice would be hard-pressed to make sense of Loeb's advice.Loeb's investment philosophy can be summed up neatly: Base stock purchases on fundamentals, but keep your eye on price movement and sell when it goes down. Loeb was an investor with some of a trader's sensibility. He advocates holding onto a security only 6 months to a year and a half. The trouble is that \\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\" is poorly organized, repetitive, sometimes contradictory, and burdened by overloaded, awkward prose. Loeb is a poor writer. He makes simple concepts seem utterly labyrinthine. He has one basic philosophy and about a dozen \\"dos and don'ts\\" to offer. Instead of giving us a dozen straightforward chapters, \\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\" has 33 short, overlapping, convoluted chapters.\\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\" is only 153 pages long. The second half of the book, chapters 34-78, is miscellaneous articles by Loeb in which he offers further investment advice, comments on a variety of financial topics, and shares his opinions on American architecture and \\"How an Ice-Cream Soda Should Be Made\\". These articles are more colorful, as well as more readable, than the main text of the book, though less essential. Chapter 64, \\"I Don't Sell -People Buy From Me\\", is an interesting account of Loeb's early days working at brokerage houses in San Francisco. In sum, I've nothing against old investment or trading books. They sometimes offer keen insight and have interesting stories to tell. There is nothing wrong with Gerald Loeb's principles. But \\"The Battle for Investment Survival\\" presents them poorly, and there are plenty of other books out there that do it better."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"The Battle for Investment SurvivalHailed as a must-read classic, I decided to pick up a copy. Having first been published in 1935, I wondered just how relevant its teachings are today (the copy I read was from 1965). I also wondered how successful Loeb was in his own investment endeavors. Sure, he spent many years at the now defunct E. F. Hutton, eventually becoming chairman, but how well did he do or the company for that matter under his guidance? I certainly would not want to take advice from someone who was only moderately successful or worse yet, a failure. I almost put the book down just as quickly as I picked it up - Loeb's writing style is difficult to follow, convoluted and extremely random at times. It may be a reflection of the prose of his time or perhaps he's just a poor writer, nevertheless, it is his first chapter - \\"It Requires Knowledge, Experience and Flair\\" that inspired me to continue.Sadly, I could only make it through 15 of the core 33 chapters. As I mentioned before, Loeb's writing style and lack of organized thoughts makes this book just too unbearable to read. I would imagine that most readers never make it past chapter 5 which could explain why after being in publication since 1935, there are so few reviews (anywhere).I did find some good nuggets of information but for the most part, the effort-to-reward ratio was just not good enough to justify further reading. Most of his concepts (and that's about all they are) have been repeated by many financial artisans for many years and I'm sure for many years to come. Whether they are Loeb's ideas or not, it's unlikely you'll be able to tell for sure.What follows, is a chapter-by-chapter analysis of what I personally got out of his book.Chapter 1 - It Requires Knowledge, Experience and Flair\\"Nothing is more difficult, I truly believe, than consistently and fairly profiting in Wall Street,\\" and \\"... the problem which the \`Man on the Street,' often far from a success in his own field, thinks he easily can solve\\" and several other bold statements in the same vein, provide a subtle, yet in-your-face analysis of the arrogance of the average investor who hopes to get something for nothing. As a result, Loeb states that it takes real knowledge gained from real experiences to even have a chance at success and even then, your success is questionable.He also believes, and I found this quite interesting, that market pricing is much less based on a company's fundamentals (balance sheet/income statement) than on a whole host of other influences including emotion.Even with the requisite knowledge and experience and even flair, you still might not succeed. This whole first chapter is a bit of \\"tough\\" love whereby Loeb wants you to know just how difficult it is to succeed in Wall Street and how (likely) ill-equipped you are at succeeding based on your more than (likely) common and unimpressive laurels. If you really want to succeed in Wall Street, you better \\"step-up\\" your \\"game\\" in a big way.If you haven't been traumatized too badly, Loeb rewards you with your first rule:Rule #1 - Buy only something that is quoted daily and can be bought and sold in an auction market daily.This is really quite simple and helps avoid one of the greatest pitfalls of trying to do too much, too fast and getting in over your head. Buy stocks you can easily sell if the need arises.To summarize, it's extremely difficult to become a successful investor in Wall Street. Most don't have what it takes and aren't willing to put in the time to be successful. If you aren't willing, move on. But if you are, work hard, very hard and good luck.Chapter 2 - Speculative Attitude EssentialWhat I think Loeb was saying here is that preservation of capital can only be attained through speculation. Let's clarify the meanings of \\"preservation of capital\\" and \\"speculation\\". \\"Preservation of capital\\" should mean that any offsets (e.g., taxes, inflation, fees, etc.) of capital should not diminish the future value of your initial capital investment. That is, capital invested today should have at least the same purchasing power in the future that it has today. For example, if you invested $1000 today into a tool yielding 3% annual interest, you would lose 1% of your capital at the end of one year if the annual rate of inflation was 4%. Thus, you would not be preserving your capital. Speculation in this context means to engage in an opportunity (investment) where the chance of reward is high. I don't believe he means one should throw caution to the wind, however.I think the chapter title is misleading. Ultimately, the goal is to make good money, but at the very least, one should preserve capital. This can only be done by engaging in opportunity that offers high reward - speculation. One or two large gains should offset and hopefully improve upon the several smaller losses one is likely to have. Go big or go home should be the message in this chapter.Chapter 3 - Is There an Ideal Investment?As if you really need to ask; but if you do, then \\"no\\" there isn't. Really, this is all he should have said and left it at that. Instead Loeb decided to go off on a journey where random thoughts came and went like fireflies in night. Nothing, really, was cohesive and one thought did not appear to be logically linked to the next. I found myself repeatedly reading the chapter over and over and each time feeling just as frustrated.There isn't an ideal investment but if you really want to succeed, you must separate yourself from the herd; don't do what everyone else is doing because their results are at best, lackluster. True success, just like true leaders is not found on every street corner. You must work hard to stand out and succeed.Chapter 4 - Pitfalls for the InexperiencedRestrict and focus your efforts; don't try to do too much. You must become an expert in the basics before you can even consider other investment vehicles. Start with \\"active, seasoned issues, listed on a major Stock Exchange\\" - echoing Loeb's first rule.Avoid the many distractions - IPOs, penny stocks, sucker mailings, etc. - that often prove fatal to the inexperienced. Specialization is preferred to dabbling. Be the best you can be in one or two endeavors, not \\"so, so\\" in many. Don't try to be a \\"Jack of all trades, master of none.\\" The bottom line, KISS - keep it simple silly.Chapter 5 - How to Invest for Capital AppreciationThis chapter was filled with random thoughts and left me asking \\"what does all this have to do with how I might invest for capital appreciation?\\" The chapter has several general suggestions that don't tell me how, that might be better served in another chapter - \\"General Guidelines\\" perhaps. I'll leave the reading of this chapter to you to determine what you think is important.One thing is clear, however, Loeb believes your investment philosophy should be to invest for appreciation rather than income (e.g., dividends, etc.). Going one step further, he believes it's better to \\"let cash lie idle\\" rather than to invest for income. He believes this policy can keep you out of a potentially dangerous market. You could extrapolate that if there aren't any stocks worthy of investment, it's because the market has turned or is turning negative.Loeb promotes gaining more experience and suggests maintaining only one position at a time, with no more than 100 shares. Before moving on to another position, close out the current position. He believes this will offer you greater experience and allow you more time to focus and become more aware of the characteristics of successful investing. This philosophy of one position is opposite of diversification - a fairly radical approach even in today's market.Another of his conflicting mainstream philosophy is his advocacy of timing. He believes there are good and bad times to enter a position. I believe he's primarily concerned about timing stock purchases, but market timing surely plays a large role in that as well. What isn't clear is how he defines timing. He could mean the very short-term timing one might use as a day-trader or timing in the respect of not buying into a position until it's close to making a substantial movement. I would tend to think it would be closer to the former as he also promotes short-term investing over long-term - another highly polarized investing philosophy.Chapter 6 - Speculation vs. InvestmentIf you'll remember from chapter 2, speculation means to engage in an opportunity (investment) where the chance of reward is high. Loeb offers a specific goal: shoot to double your money. Investment, on the other hand is to play it safe - perhaps a 3-5% annual yield. Loeb argues that taking the investment approach offers little reward and provides little room for error, that even a single mistake could end up in a loss. Conversely, if you speculate to double your money, even falling short of your goal by 50%, for example, still leaves you making money. At the very least you preserve your capital. In short, the greater the risk, the greater the potential for reward.Chapter 7 - Sound Accounting for InvestorsThis chapter is comprised of about 2 pages that leaves you, quite frankly, scratching your head. The chapter could be easily summed up in one brief paragraph:You should regularly evaluate your holdings - he recommends monthly- to ensure they are meeting your goals, you are accounting for taxes and other costs and are staying on course. This should provide a general checkup of the health of your investment efforts.Chapter 8 - Why Commitments Should Not be HaphazardThe core meaning of this chapter is to stress how important it is to be fully aware of your commitments - your investments - and the management surrounding them. Most investors purchase a stock they like with hopes it go up in price - they have no idea how high it will go or how long it will take for that matter. They have very little awareness of their commitment. Loeb wants you to know \\"why it was opened, what one expected to make, how long it was expected to take...\\" and so on. The first paragraph of this chapter is crystal clear: know all you can about your commitments.Have an exit plan. We've all heard this before and people like William O' Neil provide suggestions such as cutting your losses at 8%. Loeb goes a step further, and if you follow his advice here, it should help increase your chance for success. Loeb's exit philosophy isn't limited to just when a loss is occurring, but also for when the commitment is doing well or not doing well but not taking its expected course. For example, let's say you buy a stock and expect an increase of 25% over the course of one month. What is your exit plan? Do you sell once you achieve your goal? Do you sell at the end of the month even if you did not achieve your goal? Loeb wants you to think deeply about every aspect of your commitments. In other words, know it like the back of your hands.Chapter 9 - Some \\"Don'ts\\" in Security ProgramsDon't invest solely for income or merely to \\"keep capital employed\\" or investing \\"to hedge against inflation.\\" Loeb asserts (conflicts with his theme that it's unlikey you will succeed) that once you attain a certain level of competence, are able to speculate for large gains and you are able to \\"expertly\\" time purchases, there is no need for diversification and your perceived risks will in fact be conservative over time.You should buy the best and at the best time. Bargains are normally found when the masses fear and are afraid to buy. Buying when everyone else is buying and the sentiment is high is a recipe for poor opportunities.Get into the habit of thinking about your ultimate results rather than current or daily results. Your goal should be 100% gain over a longer period rather than many short gains over a short period of time.Chapter 10 - What to look for in Corporate ReportsHe really doesn't tell you specifically what to look for in a corporate report. He does, however, impress upon you the need to thoroughly scrutinize any company you might choose to be involved with. Look for strong cash reserves. With few exceptions - smaller upstarts - companies that finance growth and expansion with debt do not exhibit sound cash management decisions. (This is quite interesting since the companies listed in Wall Street are doing just that and many quite successfully. But I would speculate that what Loeb is getting at is that few cash savvy companies expand without going into debt or at least limited debt and those are the ones you want to consider.) He feels that companies that must constantly rely on financing imply \\"an unprofitable field, poor management, or unwise overdevelopment.\\" After all, a company that has strong financials can finance their own expansion (or at least much of it) without going into debt.Look for unwise decisions such as write-downs and as previously mentioned, expansion financed with debt. Read between-the-lines; a one million dollar increase in revenue may not be all that exciting if there was a one-time asset sale of 750K during the same period.At the end of the day, you want to find a company with strong fundamentals, a company that can manage its finances and show profits. Again, Loeb doesn't offer specifics here but does leave you with the impetus to learn.Chapter 11 - Concerning Financial Information, Good and BadAnother long-winded, drawn-out chapter filled with convolution; one sentence was longer than most average paragraphs. The message in this chapter is to pay close attention to your information and try to fully understand its meanings and implications, for the road to success is full of pitfalls. Even insider information is dangerous and at times no more advantageous than the information the average person already has access to. In fact, in some instances it can be detrimental - especially when the information provided is inaccurate or comes from someone with less than honorable intentions.Chapter 12 - What to Buy - and WhenThis chapter provides a considerable amount of relevant information and is worthy of a detailed reading. Loeb offers many general guidelines that need further research to expound his thoughts. He promotes the \\"buy low and sell high\\" mantra. In order to find these rare gems, there are a few prevailing characteristics:* Popular market sentiment should be bearish.* The securities market should be well liquidated (sold to the point where prices are very low).* Current business conditions are poor or expected to become poor.* The stock is \\"out of favor\\" with the general population. It will generally have a low rating.* Earnings are abnormally low or expected to become low.* Dividends are non-existent or lower than normal.* The stock price must reflect the current sentiment. A low outlook of a stock should have an equally low price.As already stated, you'll need to expound on some of his concepts but the ideas are there. As the speculator, you need to take an opposing position. In your mind, that stock that is \\"out of favor\\" with the masses, and receives low ratings is really a diamond in the rough and its current share price is not a true reflection of its potential. But don't take this stance blindly. You must back your decision with sound information. I'm not sure what he means by \\"sound\\". If a stock's fundamentals are weak, how can one choose it based on \\"sound\\" information?You buy low when the stock is out of favor and undesirable to the masses. Then when the masses take notice and start buying, it will push the share price higher; to an eventual sell point. Think of the \\"institutional sponsorship\\" concept promoted by William O' Neal. According to Loeb, \\"the objective is to always buy that which the majority thinks is speculative and sell it when the majority believes the quality has reached investment grade.\\" However, weigh the \\"possibilities for profit vs. the risk for loss.\\"Chapter 13 - Importance of Correct TimingLoeb repeats the importance of getting into the market only when the pros outweigh the cons. Based on his concept of speculation, I'd say the pros must heavily outweigh the cons. Once an investment is entered, your decision process becomes much more difficult. There are many more variables to consider and you must have the fortitude to ignore emotion - especially in times of loss. Losses must but cut swiftly and for the most part, forgotten. I like the concept of forgetting - it helps you move on and avoid that negative tendency of dwelling on \\"what ifs.\\" Moving on allows you to focus on the future.If you set your return goals high and achieve a high rate of return, you can sit on the side-lines for greater periods of time while searching for the next great investment. Cash reserves allow you the opportunity to enter a position when the timing is right.Chapter 14 - Statistical Analysis, Market Trends, and Public PsychologyLoeb asserts that statistics are rarely of value because they are mostly concerned with theory or academic s and ignore the more import fundamental trends. I'm not really sure what he's trying to say here. Surely, statistics can be made about fundamental trends. For example, one might say \\"the average bear market lasts 10 months.\\" This could be statistically supported and would be related to the fundamentals of the market.Market trends should be determined first before looking at a stock purchase. The best stock will likely do poorly in a down trending market if you bought expecting to go long, for example. Predicting market tops and bottoms is not possible and trying to do so will lead, ultimately, to failure. You aren't really looking at where the current market is at, but where it's going - trending.Loeb states, \\"The most important single factor in shaping security markets is public psychology.\\" You want to try to determine the state of the masses and approximate where you think they are heading and benefit from their actions. He goes as far as claiming the name of a stock \\"is an important factor in securing or losing public favor.\\" I would imagine, as having at times witnessed extremely odd, opposing and conflicting behavior that market psychology is a difficult thing to gage consistently.And his final piece of information is to keep in mind, when performing other analysis, a securities past appraisals as guidance to its future price. What is he trying to say here? Does it relate to market psychology or market fundamentals or both? I'm not really sure.Chapter 15 - Price Movement and Other Market Action FactorsActual price movement is the most important factor in forming an opinion on the general trend of the market. So while you might think a security has some theoretical value (and trading above or below) or the market should be trending one direction or the other, it really doesn't matter. It's what is actually occurring that matters most.It's dangerous to resist the market's trend - despite thinking or knowing you are right. Prices of securities sell for exactly what the market thinks they are worth at any given time. One could extrapolate that certain security valuations (such as EPS), have little to do with a stock's ultimate price than how desirable or undesirable a stock is to the public at any given time.The market behaves due to many factors - important or not. The current market is a reflection of all these factors. One of the most important (and in my humble opinion, the one most are least apt to predict) is market psychology.Loeb outlines three types of investors ranging from \\"sheep\\" (my words) to the \\"successful type\\" (his words). Public sheep follow the market up or down with no real reasons for buying or selling. If selling is taking place, as reflected by the market, they will sell and vice-versa. The second group, chart and tape readers are rarely successful if that's all they rely on for buying and selling. (But it would appear he's just guessing.) The successful investor takes all things into consideration - market direction, fundamentals, incompetence, etc. - and tries to determine if what is currently taking place is supported by current data and will continue into the future.Loeb has often mentioned how much of a role market psychology plays and emphasizes how difficult it is to interpret and predict. However, he states \\"the action of the market itself can be expected under most circumstances to stimulate buying or selling in a manner consistent enough to allow reasonably accurate forecasting of news in advance of its actual occurrence.\\" What does this mean? Does he mean that if the market is trending up and negative news occurs, that we can expect this to negatively impact the market or least have a minor impact, for example? I've witnessed too many days where stocks fall on good news and rise on bad. Too often there seems no rhyme or reason. I highly doubt Loeb's suggestion for predicting market moves based on market psychology is anything much more than a coin toss.Timing also plays a critical role when evaluating the market. The same event can have different and opposite meanings depending on when the event takes place. For example, bad news at the end of a long bullish cycle can signal a pending change in the market direction and reaction by the market might be swift and overreacted. Bad news during a bearish cycle may have little impact as the status quo continues bearish.Loeb doesn't really believe in confirmation analysis yet provides suggestions of his own confirmations. He also doesn't put much faith in technical analysis. He feels both market confirmations and technical analysis are theoretical in nature and not likely of much value in reality.To summarize Loeb's thoughts, you need to be able to evaluate and interpret all variables (most importantly market psychology) in order to establish any type of solid conclusions as to the market's behavior. Even then and for various reasons, it's easy to draw the wrong conclusions. Loeb concedes then, that this endeavor is \\"the most inexact sort of science.\\"* Market direction and price movement are two very important indicators.* Look for confirmation. Are other stocks following the market leaders?* High volume with light concessions can indicate a bullish sentiment, especially if the negative news would normally be expected to result in a greater price decrease.* Look for stocks showing strength when going up and resistance when going down. IOW, when the general market is climbing, its price is increasing more than the average and when the market is declining, its price is decreasing slower than the average.* Don't fight the tape."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I read this book after seeing it in the bibliography of a Wm. O'Neil book. While the observation that \\"if you've read O'Neil's major works, you've already read Loeb\\" has some truth to it, I would argue that there is at least one point that Loeb expresses even more clearly than O'Neil, i.e. the fallacy of holding a declining stock because \\"it will come back.\\" Suppose you were forced to sell the stock today, he asks. Now, suppose you were trying to figure out the VERY BEST investment to try to recoup your loss. Would it be to repurchase your loser? Almost certainly not. To me, that question crystallizes the argument for ruthlessly cutting losses better than I have ever heard it expressed.The same point is recast in a number of different ways, e.g. the excellent chapter on \\"Sound Accounting for Investors\\", in which he advocates always \\"marking to the market\\", rather than ignoring \\"paper\\" losses or focusing on current income. \\"Gaining Profits by Taking Losses\\" and \\"The Ever-Liquid Account\\" bring additional perspective to the same theme.In fact one of the nicest features of the book is the way it is broken up into almost 80 chapters. The main themes are repeated several times, but with different emphases. As a result, the more one browses and rereads selected sections, the more one appreciates the strength of the iconoclastic theory of investment that Loeb advocates."},{"Title":"The Battle for Investment Survival","review":"I read this book on the advice of William J.

Best known for his cartoons which appeared in the Daily Express and his work as an illustrator, Lancaster also had an inimitable prose style, dry and tongue in cheek. In The Saracen's Head, the timid hero, Willy de Littlehampton, is the black sheep in a family of military heroes. Thrust quite unprepared into King Richard's crusade in the Holy Land, by a series of unlikely events, Willie ends up besting El Babooni, the infidel champion, and carrying the royal standard up the walls of a fortress.Ostensibly written for children, this slim volume is probably best appreciated by adults, who can better appreciate the wry pokes at notions of military glory.

Stefanski has recently published several papers on measurement error models with Carroll. Here they have teamed up to write a statistics text on a unique topic. Measurement error models are common and practical when dealing with covariates that have measurement error. Least squares estimation in linear regression is based on the assumption that the predictor variables are measured without error. There are many articles and an excellent text by Fuller \\"Measurement Error Models\\", published by Wiley in 1988 that deals with the linear case. Also look at a section in Chapter 5 of Miller's \\"Beyond ANOVA, Basics of Applied Statistics\\" that refers to the problem as the error in variables problem. For the nonlinear case this is the first treatment. Well written and well documented, this text provides an up-to-date account of the theory and methods and provides real applications (e.g. the Framingham Heart Study).

We were sold the completely unsustainable notion that contraceptive sex....that is, recreational sex, is the ultimate sign of power and control over our lives. In fact, the opposite is true. Recreational sex has left a trail of tears, abortions, STDs, broken homes and children without in tact families. Perhaps, worst of all, recreational sex has left us with hardened hearts, incapable of hearing the good news about a truly humane version of sexuality......a quite revolutionary and seldom seen phenomenon today......monogamous, married sex!Dr. Morse has sharpened our cultural lens by revealing the truth about recreational sex. First, she explains that today's notion of sexual freedom has required an inhumane definition of freedom. Today's false notion of freedom, according to Morse, is being COMPLETELY unencumbered by relationships. To sustain such a tortured understanding of freedom, women have bought into the \\"Sex in the City\\" version of freedom, or as Dr. Morse coins it, \\"consumer sex.\\" Trading boyfriends, girlfriends, marriages, children from multiple fathers, fathers acting as merely \\"sperm donors,\\" all the while pretending that this is normal, healthy behavior, has left us in a permanent state of adolescence and chaos.The truth is that every human being is created for relationships because every human being is created for love. But love is not a sentimental momentary feeling of gratification, nor is it a domestic arrangement agreed to by consenting adults and it is most certainly not found in the promises of career success, financial security and autonomy. The most curious and beautiful irony of the human experience is that love is most deeply felt when it is given away. We find the gift of our very lives as we give our very lives away through our most fundamental and permanent family relationships: spouse, children, parents, brothers and sisters. Lest you think that I am suggesting that only the married can be happy, I offer you the example of Mother Theresa....whose happiness and fulfillment were realized in the love and compassion she so generously gave to others. The ambitions of every human heart, it turns out, are truly realized when we are capable of self-giving love: our sexuality is only fulfilled when given in permanent, committed and exclusive love.These realities alone will leave the reader \\"weak in the knees\\" with much to contemplate about the meaning of their own lives, but Dr. Morse continues with an even more astounding proposition. She proposes that our very freedom as a society depends on this self-giving love. Her background as an Economist (Professor of Economics for Yale and George Mason Universities and a Senior Research Fellow for the Hoover Institute at Stanford University) serves her thesis well. She is uniquely qualified in her analysis as a committed libertarian and advocate for the free society, combined with her experience as a mother, a foster mother and an adoptive mother and especially after many years as a career academic researcher and former devotee of recreational sex! (Oh, come on, we can all brag about that!)Her life changing discoveries came as she learned about the irreplaceable role of the mother, father and immediate family that develops and the role that these relationships play in forming the human conscience. After adopting a two year old Romanian orphan who had been completely raised in an institution, Dr. Morse and her husband embarked on an amazing journey into child development as they learned how to parent a child with severe attachment disorder, the condition that often accompanies such children raised in chaotic, institutional settings. Dr. Morse's background as a libertarian immediately tuned into the socio-economic implications of a whole generation of children raised by day care centers, broken families and successive foster homes.Turns out, that no society can truly be free if its citizens do not operate from a healthy, self possessed conscience and, further, it turns out that science is discovering that a human being's sense of worth and self possession is uniquely created by the care and nurturing of the relationships he or she is born into. The ability to attach to other human beings and to feel compassion for other human beings is developed in infancy and early childhood. The biological processes of brain development are dependent on early attachment to a loving family. Multiple caregivers and institutions can not create the necessary bonding that infants and children need for later brain development in language, relationships and learning. And a free society can not remain free when it's citizens are not nurtured and cared for by their families. In short, the family cannot be \\"out-sourced\\" as a free market commodity!Read this book, but be ready to challenge the assumptions that you may have absorbed by our very self indulgent, self-loathing and sexually confused society-it will be the best present you can give yourself to ensure healthier and happier relationships....remember, it's what you were created for!Angie Vogt, M.A.Co-Host \\"Sound Insight\\"Sacred Heart Radio AM1050Seattle-Tacoma"},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"As with all self-help books, Dr. Morse offers a promise to help us \\"Find Life-Long Love in a Hook-up World.\\" But, unlike most self-help books with \\"sex\\" in the title, Dr.Morse offers no suggestions on how to choose the perfect lover, or how to improve our lovemaking techniques. Instead of reassuring us that we too can find the perfect mate, or have the perfect marriage, she reminds us that none of us are perfect in an imperfect world. And, those who seek such perfection in a mate are doomed. While she offers some practical suggestions on how to deal with feelings and communication, and she begins the book with the promise that Smart Sex \\"is about how and why to stay married,\\" the real focus of Smart Sex is much deeper. Early in her book, Dr. Morse advises us that \\"the self help books aren't going to be enough because they deal with the superficial symptoms of much deeper problems.\\" Instead of techniques, Morse focuses on the nature and meaning of sex and marriage. Instead of easy answers, Morse explodes some of modern society's most cherished and destructive myths about the \\"joys of recreational sex.\\"Of course, this has not stopped amazon.com from suggesting on these very pages that customers interested in this title would be interested in a link that promises to help readers \\"Hook up with more women through doubleyourdating.com.\\" Dr. Morse would probably be amused by this because it really proves the point she has made throughout her wonderful book--that the idea of sexual freedom has reduced sex to a commodity-and has left people more empty than before."},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"Jennifer does an excellent job of highlighting a topic that needs to be discussed.

This easy-to-understand treatise by Dr. Morse, a free-market economist and former professor at Yale and George Mason universities, is both rational and passionate. She uses enough good logic and hard data to be convincing without overwhelming and enough personal experience to be disarming. \\"Smart Sex\\" examines the idea that sex is nothing more than a private act between consenting adults with no moral or social significance. It explains how ideas about sex have consequences for individuals and society, in particular our society's erroneous idea that freedom means being unencumbered by relationships.The sections about how male and female hormones knit couples together are most interesting. Dr. Morse shows how these hormones can blind a cohabiting couple's judgment about their compatibility, just as these same hormones may make it difficult for a battered woman to leave her abuser and enable those in arranged marriages to fall in love."},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"SMART SEX is the second book I have read authored by Jennifer Roback Morse. Although I found her first book a fine effort, her second book is more clearly written and her central thesis is more practical and more effectively articulated. I read an excerpt from SMART SEX in class to my students. My efforts paid off, students had a clearer understanding of a complex theory.I have two critical issues regarding the text that I feel will be useful to any potential reader. First, is the title [SMART SEX]. I wish it was entitled something else. I felt a bit embarrassed reading the book in an airplane or waiting for my daughter in my car. Initially, the title suggests that the book is a sex manual that offers 101 positions in order to increase satisfaction within a person's intimate life. Rest assured, SMART SEX is not a sex manual -- anything but. It is a snappy excursion into how Christian values relate to the sexual expression. Roback Morse doesn't preach, but rather she lays out Christian [particularly Catholic] values in a logical manner that reads rather sectarian. Many people who read this book will be placed in a position to assess their own sexuality from a value base. Such an outcome is not what one would expect from the title. Thus, I suspect that giving the book such a racy title was not an accident. It was meant to jockey readers into a position of self reflection. If my hypothesis is correct, the author and publisher did an excellent job in achieving their goal.Second, I found chapter one a bit alarming and thought that the author made a fundamental change within her value-base expressed in her first book. Some years ago, I read a paper entitled, \\"When is enough, enough?\\" The paper took the position that some people are such poor parents, they groom children to become destructive psychopaths. Later, the author takes the position that our legal institutions need to reconsider forced tubaligation and abortions. Roback Morse, of course, doesn't take this position. I find it intellectually stimulating that a single set of empirical facts can be the foundation for both the pro-life and pro-choice positions. At any rate, the first chapter was an epiphany.One day, I took this book with me to read while my daughter was in choir practice. A couple of church ladies approached me and wanted to know what I was reading (I was hiding the cover so no one could see the title). When they saw the title, I had to go into great detail about the content of the book. Although I felt a bit awkward in summarizing Roback Morses' book, the two women were mesmerized by my comments. Both agreed that there must be a linkage between Christian values and the sexual experience. When they parted, I suspect they logged on to Amazon to purchase the book. I think the book will be the central focus of an upcoming meeting of the church's book club."},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"As a Christian Apologist who is a single male, I take my interest in sex seriously and think of it from a theological perspective and see how our society has twisted it. When people ask me what books come to mind on the topic, I have two. I think of Lauren Winner's \\"Real Sex\\" and I think of Jennifer Roback Morse's \\"Smart Sex.\\"Morse's book is quite different from Winner as Winner writes more from a biblical perspective. Morse shares the worldview, but she writes from a perspective for the outsider. Thus, this book is far more helpful for those who don't share a biblical worldview.Morse brings her economic mindset to the table and she does this though without quoting constant statistics over and over. She looks at the actions themselves and explains why these actions don't work and what they result in. For those who think this is a fundy writing, she admits also that she writes from experience as one who has tried these and found they don't fulfill.Morse's work is gripping and has a unique gift many books and sermons on sex don't have. They often give only the negatives. Morse gives the negatives but in doing so, she shows the positives in what ought to be and leaves one with a desire of what that should be like so a guy like me who's single can read that and say \\"Yes. That's the way I want my marriage to be someday.\\"The format is also non-technical. This is an easy read that anyone can understand and hard-hitting. (It can definitely cause a stir also if you read this book in the break room at work. One great benefit of books like this is people will want to know what you're reading if they know that sex is involved in any way.)Morse's reasons hit on all grounds. She covers the experiential side, the pragmatic side, and the moral side. In the end, she does reveal her theological perspective, but I don't think any reader would say that theism was being shoved down their throat.In a day and age where we are constantly being told that we need to re-define our views on sexuality, Morse is right on. The Christian worldview on sex has stood the test of time and it is the view of sex that needs to be upheld.Buy this book.

The author is an economist and as such, she often uses economics, or the language of economics, to make her points with rationality.Aside from the rational arguments, however, the author also shares parts of her own story. There is a lot of personal experience behind her words - she has done most of the very things that she has now realized lead to poor outcomes. At one point she admits: \\"I committed just about every sexual sin in the book: adultery, fornication, cohabitation, group sex, same-sex sex. I had an abortion; I was married and divorced.\\" This book is clearly the outcome of a lot of personal anguish that forced the author to rethink her own life and to change her ways and her views.Definitely worth the read, especially by those who are struggling for ways to explain these things to others, or by those who are wondering what ethics and rules about sexuality and marriage should govern their own lives."},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"jenny has done a great job explaining why many marriages suck worse than an airplane toilet, why we should care and what single and married people can do about it.morse shows that if we want continued freedom then we'd better fix the fundamental infrastructure of the good society, i.e.-the home.in addition, morse takes no prisoners slam dancing the nuevo sexual revolutionaries of the 21st centuries who are screwing up our neighborhoods, cities and nation by their mechanized view of sex and their low and lawless view of marriage.also, this is a great read for the righteous rebels who want heavy verbal artillery to answer the licentious naysayers in the high school and college classrooms. do yourself and us a favor by both reading and implementing this book.Doug GilesClashRadio.com"},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"Dr. Morse brings practical and scientific advice that explains the problems with the \\"sexual freedom\\" that has been pushed on us by Hollywood and the media.

The book benefits from a relatively uncommon blending of disciplines such as economics, gender and identity politics, Libertarianism, religion, and the quest for personal fulfillment. The prologue excellent sets out the modern dilemma: We want love and we want freedom, and yet we often have less money and certainly less time than our counterparts might have had a generation or two in the past.The author incorporates a personal touch into what could easily become a dry, theoretical work, openly discussing lessons she learned and even mistakes she made in the course of adopting a demanding Romanian two-year-old in 1991 and then giving birth to a second child in the same year. She candidly admits that prior to having children, she had taken her own self-actualization and self-esteem to the point that they \\"were really just garden-variety selfishness.\\"To her credit, not only does she take her lessons wherever she can find them, but she then passes them along to her readers. \\"Infertility [and the learning process the author went through about how one can't necessarily always get what one wants] was excellent preparation for parenthood.\\"In another admirable piece of self-disclosure, she summarizes the multifarious sexual activities in which she was involved, which more or less cover the full gamut.The author is at her best deconstructing the truly absurd concept called \\"date rape.\\" She suggests, after pages of detailed analysis, that \\"date rape\\" often represents a post-event reconstruction, and reconceptualization, of a sexual encounter as unwanted because that approach allows the woman to reinterpret an unsatisfactory yet voluntary encounter in the way that is most congenial to her. Another star moment is her proof that \\"both extra-marital sex and divorce typically impose costs on other people.\\"The author is equally trenchant regarding some women's exploitation of men through paternity fraud. She is right that \\"live and let live\\" is not enough for the most committed sexual revolutionaries, who seem determined to silence moral objections that might influence others to experience distress about their actions. \\"The sexual revolutionaries seemed to believe that it is possible to create a world in which there are no costs, only benefits. I don't believe that such a thing is possible. Nor do I think it would be desirable.... Feeling bad about doing wrong is a good thing.... Life without guilt or shame is neither possible nor desirable.\\"Also enlightening, though in a very different way, is Morse's section near the end on what she calls the \\"Law of the Gift\\": \\"we find our greatest happiness not in isolation, but in seeing ourselves, and others, as gifts.\\" The author is eloquent in support of her unfashionable yet persuasive theory that giving offers a bounty of benefits. \\"In the area of human sexuality, the best and most reliable way to pursue our happiness is to give ourselves completely to our sexual partners.\\" She scores some points showing internal inconsistencies in the current (and as Warren Farrell has shown, utterly unjustified) focus on gender differences in average salaries. \\"It appears easier to attribute different patterns of earnings to some injustice that can be rectified than to admit that some differences in underlying patterns of skills and interests are hardwired. But maintaining the fiction that men and women are identical in every socially significant way requires a staggering amount of self-deception.\\" Applying the Law of the Gift greatly enhanced her marriage, though it took some time, effort, and adjustment on both their parts.Smart Sex is replete with repeatable quotes, often illustrating the author's all-too-uncommon common sense. \\"We can't build happy home lives around the ideas of equality and freedom.\\" \\"[T]he notion of freedom as complete personal independence is incoherent at the social level and inhuman at the personal level.\\" \\"You cannot coherently claim that every person has a constitutional right to eat without getting fat, and call it \`gastronomical freedom'... By analogy, it doesn't make sense to argue that everyone has a right to unlimited sexual activity with a government guarantee that no one will ever become pregnant. Calling it \`reproductive freedom' doesn't alter the underlying biology.\\"Jennifer Roback Morse is confident that marriage matters. Why? \\"A free society needs people who can control themselves and use their freedom without bothering other people too much. But no one develops a conscience and self-control in a social vacuum. We develop the groundwork for our conscience during the first eighteen months of our lives, in our relationships with our parents.\\"I admire the risks the author took. She succeeds more often than she fails. But a combination self-help and social analysis book is bound to butt its head up against the stubborn fact that a given volume can only address so much without producing a blurring of the author's focus, not to mention the reader's eyes.The book's cross-disciplinary virtue becomes somewhat of a detraction, not to mention a distraction, as the author seemingly careens from topic to topic, not quite out of control but not necessarily quite in control either. Some of her syntheses of different topics (as one in which she tries to unite date rape, the \\"walk of shame\\" the morning after a date, and cohabitation) are less than fully convincing. We delve in and out of such hot-button topics as Christianity (which the author more or less assumes applies to the reader) and abortion with scarcely a chance for the reader to catch his or her breath.On the technical and admittedly minor, even nitpicky end, a handful of typographical errors crop up, not bad at all for a book of this length and seriousness. The note numbers in Chapter 2 are off by 1, making it hard to be sure what references the author intends to cite for a given proposition.The religious turn the book takes in its last two chapters seems somewhat incongruous. The author pulls herself back together and finishes with a rousing cheer to marriage, tough and unfair though it can be.This fascinating, ambitious, passionate, generous, and highly original book deserves a careful read, as truly its organizational shortcomings are easily outshone by its undeniable bounty of strengths."},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"Great book.

Amazingly well researched as well.Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World"},{"Title":"Smart Sex: Finding Life-Long Love in a Hook-Up World","review":"This has got to be one of the worst self-help books I have ever seen. The author starts with the warning \\"Please remove your political hat beofre reading. This book will self-destruct in the hands of politicians and policy wonks.\\" Clearly, the author intends to be non-political, right? WRONG!Of course, I should have been smart enough to know that a book endorsed by Chuck Colson (Founder of Prison Fellowship Ministries) would be anything but apolitical, or anything but a piece of propaganda for the religious right. But I thought maybe Ms. Morse could get beyond that. On the contrary she used the religious right's platform as her beginning arguments and tried to make them fit the complex world of sexual relationships. In the process she develops some rather strange and dangerous concepts.For example, in a section describing the horrors of cohabitation, she describes how oxytocin is pumped into a woman's bloodstream when she is in labor, breastfeeding, or having an orgasm. She also says that oxytocin is known to decrease a person's cognitive ability and impair memory. Then she concludes that \\"This combination of factors may also explain why domestic violence is so much more prevalent among cohabiting couples than among married couples.\\" What? How does a marriage license decrease oxytocin unless the age old joke about marriage decreasing the frequency of sex is correct.Without understanding Maslow's heirarchy of human needs, Ms. Morse pokes fun at statements by Gloria Feldt of Planned Parenthood saying reproductive self-determination is a fundamental freedom. Ms. Morse claims that sex was meant to have consequences of pregnancy and to remove that consequence is both irrational and wrong. Clearly, the progress that we have made since distributing information about contraceptives was illegal should all be turned around. Ms. Morse liked things just fine when people were required to accept the consequences of unintended pregnancy. And the higher the risk, the better. The fact that women almost always bear the greater burden is lost on our sexist Ms. Morse, who thinks that must be the natural order of things.She even re-defines date-rape so she can blame the victims who are \\"talked into\\" having sex. If it were real rape it wouldn't need to be called \\"date rape\\" she claims, thus eliminating in her mind any seriousness to the problem. In fact she says, \\"If sex were really no big deal, just another activity, then being talked into unwanted sexual activity shouldn't be any bigger deal than being talked into going to a ball game when you would have preferred a movie.\\" If a man had compared date rape to being persuaded to attend a ball game, he would never hear the end of it. Ms. Morse should be called on this as well.Don't bother to buy the book. Check it out of the library if you must but this sort of pseudo self-help shouldn't be encouraged."},{"Title":"Secret of the Number Twelve","review":"Well, after reading the book the first time I was amazed how the number 12 is repeated during the history.

The \\"highlight\\" of the book is her trial for bigamy, more than 35 years after leaving Hervey and some years after the Duke's death (the charge initiated by the Duke's disinherited nephew). Before and after her conviction, the story concentrates on her legal problems, her travels and her interest in buying up property -- I could barely slog through the second half of the book and admit to skimming some of it.I am very interested in 18th century English history and have read all the popular history I could find, especially biographies of fashionable ladies like the Duchess of Devonshire, Mrs. Fitzherbert, Mrs. Jordan, Countess of Bessborough, Lady Caroline Lamb, among others.

Not only does the book make a good case for having succeeded in these aims, it also provides material for a very careful and provocative reinterpretation of Hegel's Phenomenology that should prove readable and insightful for both general readers with interests in the history of philosophy as well as trained philosophers.Russon shows that the body that animates the forms of experience that Hegel studies in his text cannot be adequately conceived as reducible to the merely physical organism. In an important early chapter, Russon gives an account of the systematic way in which Hegel's philosophy challenges and overcomes the dualism of immaterial mind and physical body that stands at the heart of early modern philosophy and science. He argues that the body as we experience it is not merely a natural entity (physis), but is a construct of habit and institutions; our experience of the body is not one merely of nature, but of second nature, as Aristotle described the habitual formation of social dispositions (hexis). The final chapters of the text aim to show, moreover, that this &quot;habit-body&quot; should be conceived ultimately as emerging through communicative activity (logos), and that the ongoing process whereby we (non-arbitrarily) constitute ourselves and our world along with others is precisely what is thematized in Hegel's dialectical phenomenology.Considering the difficulty of the topic, and the vast resources that the argument draws upon, the text is remarkably clear (and concise, at just 137 pages). You need not have spent several years poring over the details of Hegel's challenging and dense text in order to gain much benefit from reading Russon's book. In addition, the book has the merit of demonstrating (against a number of prejudices from a number of sources) that Hegel's philosophy can be a rich resource for thinking through a number of topics of contemporary concern. Russon's conclusions in fact converge nicely with recent efforts in a number of disciplines to draw attention to the embodied character of experience, cognition, and culture."},{"Title":"The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Toronto Studies in Philosophy)","review":"Russson's book is nothing less than a re-organization of the *Phenomenology of Spirit*, one that makes explicit the conceptual commitment to embodiment that may have been concealed from many readers. This re-organization is accomplished with an all-too-rare philosophical sophistication, as Russon draws on a variety of sources and informs his reading with a strong command of 20th century phenomenology.Among the book's strengths is a startlingly lucid and original reading of Hegel's text, a reading that illuminates many familiar passages and arguments in striking fashion. Russon's account of the master and slave, and his account of Sittlichkeit, re-animate texts often thought to have been exhaustively understood, revealing both the richness of Hegel's text and the power of a serious reader like Russon. But Russon is also adept at uncovering new insights in passages under-represented in the literature, and it is perhaps here that this book makes one of its strongest contributions. Russon on the reason chapter, and on the unhappy consciousness (the analysis of which is one of his central arguments), provides original and compelling arguments for the centrality of embodiment to the Hegelian understanding of self-consciousness.But arguably the most significant contribution made by this book is that it reminds us that a Hegelian argument can and should be a philosophical argument. Rather than limiting himself to contributing to ongoing debates within Hegel circles, Russon has engaged philosophical inquiry itself, and shown how Hegel's text, at the hands of a keen reader, can speak, indeed argue successfully, to the broader philosophical community. This book is an argument for the complete understanding of phases of embodiment as conditions of self-consciousness, and thereby an argument that brings phenomenology and Hegel into the centre of important contemporary discussions."},{"Title":"The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit (Toronto Studies in Philosophy)","review":"I highly recommend John Russon's _The Self and its Body in Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit_ to anyone with a philosophical interest in Hegel or the body: 1) It gives a compelling account of how Hegel would have to conceive body, and thus gives a new understanding of just what Hegel's phenomenology of spirit is concerned with, and what our bodies are. The latter is of central concern in much recent philosophy, and in everyday life in our political and technological culture. 2) It gives a lucid and convincing interpretation of Hegel's difficult book, one that proceeds through an engagement with historical positions in philosophy and science, and more important, through an engagement with the experience of trying to act responsibly in a situation, which experience haunts philosophy from the very beginning and is a most familiar element of life. Russon thus gets to the heart of Hegel's philosophy in a way that is illuminating for both the novice and the dedicated student of Hegel. And he thereby arrives at an important understanding of the body as that sphere of communicative and expressive existence which develops itself so as to enable responsible action in the first place. 3) The book's situation of Hegel in relation to ancient philosophy, transcendental argument and recent phenomenology invites a renewed engagement with Hegel, which is important given the role of Hegel in many current philosophical debates. In particular, Russon's discussion of the body and the unfolding of the Phenomenology of Spirit in terms of phusis (nature), hexis (habit) and logos (here meaning \\"expression\\") gives a very comprehensive and original way of grasping both the body and the Phenomenology. Likewise, his interpretation of Hegel's dialectic in terms of the relation of the empirical ego and transcendental ego and focus on recognition help clarify many crucial themes in Hegel. In general, Russon's elucidation of a concept of body in Hegel opens rich ways of thinking about our selves and our bodies."},{"Title":"A Boy Named Boomer (Hello Reader!

It is set up like a diary with reflections on many different events in Boomers youth. He relates stories such as giving a girl a valentines gift, fishing with his dad, building and wrecking a fort with his friends, playing baseball with friends and picking the weakest player first, etc.As I was reading this book I thought that a better title might have been &quot;Random Thoughts of My Childhood by Boomer Esiason&quot;.

I have been using this book to help my students try to understand concepts related to: motivation, never giving up, having dreams, and honor.Boomer grew up in a single family home, like many of my students do, and has found a successful life. I hope my students can use him and the book as a role model.Being one of those kids not good in sports with many brothers who were, I truly related and felt for the child who was not very good but picked by Boomer anyway. Boomer was that kind of child. If you think it is just fiction or filler for the book, it actually is not. The memories I have of him is that he was always very nice to me. He consistently stuck up for me when people picked on me. I alway kept that memory with me as I grew up and moved away from NY.In times of his career when he got bad publicity I remembered his kindness and was his strongest advocator.I like this book because it is a bit different from other children's books, is an easy non fiction read,( And they are so hard to find in k-2 literature) talks about keeping with your dreams, having perserverance when times get tough, and goal setting.I do have to do a lot of background building because most of my students are Hispanic but they pick right up on the theme.

Huff writes to inform and entertain his readers, and he includes amusing, understandable pictures as a guide for his readers. Although the book was written in 1954, the issues Huff discusses are still prevalent today. Statistics are still used to deceive, and Huff considers statistics to be a secret language used to appeal to a fact-minded culture. I believe any one interested in a quick, informative read should consider Huff's How to Lie with Statistics. Individuals should interpret statistics used in the media and other sources with a skeptical attitude that Huff encourages. Huff provides a self-defense against these statistical tricks in his book; however, because statistical deception still exists today, I worry that the techniques he discuses have been used more for harm than good. Writers may have gained popularity, readers, or attention over the 50 years since the book's first publication by using some of the techniques Huff discloses and demonstrates. I encourage any one who encounters statistics in their lives to read his book because I believe statistical deception still occurs frequently in many publications.Huff begins with the obvious technique of sampling. Most readers, including myself, consider themselves aware and immune to such simple deception; however, the technique is important and used frequently. I believe Huff wants his readers to first realize that these techniques may be obvious, but they are often overlooked. Any casual reader can be tricked by sampling. Huff includes an example from Time magazine. The article states that the average Yale graduate from the class of 1924 earns $25,111 a year. Based on the year, this is a lot of money. After reading an article with a statistic like that, a casual and credulous reader might think Yale graduates are all making a lot of money. I am sure this type of deception occurs all the time. Readers may assume the statistics and surveys were done properly and accurately, and the numbers used are not misleading or false. This especially is the case with well-known or reputable publishers such as Time magazine. I believe Huff is proving a point in his example by using an example from Time magazine. Perhaps he is informing his readers that even well known publishers deceive their readers with statistics included within their articles. I believe readers often let their guard down when they trust a publisher or have been a loyal subscriber for many years. It is a common mistake, and Huff could have addressed this issue more specifically. The fact of the matter is that sampling simply does not give accurate results, and when a writer is trying to prove a point, he or she is not always concerned with collecting a variety of samples from the proper representative population. This is especially the case when certain samples do not represent the article's purpose.As I previously mentioned, I worry that Huff's book explains too specially how to deceive and not how to detect deception. In his section on graphs, he explains the steps towards creating a misrepresentative graph. An individual can create a simple, uninteresting line graph such as increasing income of households over a period of time. The increase could be the result of something as normal as inflation. Huff instructs the reader to literally cut the graph in half. This split removes the excess numbers, which are not included on the line in the graph. Although this technique does not change any of the numbers, it may change the reader's interpretation of the graph. Readers may now interpret the graph to be more dramatic. A line graph may not gain extra attention from readers, but it can further emphasize a point a writer is having difficulty representing in words. This technique is not as obvious as sampling but is just as simple. I worry that Huff explains too well how this technique is done, but I understand this is the best way to explain a deceptive technique. Huff explains how to deceive frequently throughout his book. It is a good method of teaching the reader just how easy it is to deceive readers through statistics without it being obvious to the readers. Huff warns his readers about one-dimensional pictures. Any graphs that include bars which change widths and lengths while representing a single factor, are misleading to the common reader. Huff again explains by demonstrating. A simple comparison of wages of carpenters in the United States and Rotundia is all Huff needs to demonstrate bar graph deception. Huff demonstrates the effect that pictures and sizes can have on the interpretation of a bar graph. He changes the bars to moneybags and increases the width of the larger statistic. The United States' carpenters are paid $60 dollars while a carpenter from Rotundia is paid $30. By doubling the width of the U.S. statistic and changing the bar to a moneybag, many readers will interpret the difference to be much bigger than twice as much. Certain topics such as line graphs cannot easily be explained without showing the process behind the deception, but perhaps the instructive methods he uses to inform his readers counteract his book's overall purpose.Throughout the book, Huff frequently digresses. Some readers may dislike this and wish him to stay on the current topic, but I enjoyed this style. I believe it added his personality to his writing by making the writing seem less formal. He frequently reminds the readers of deceptive techniques he has already covered in his examples. For example when he uses numbers, he reminds the reader to question where and how these numbers were collected and even digress further by stating that a number such as 59.83 seems more official and representative. I believe the book was not written to be strict to its outline. Huff seems more concerned with its overall purpose, and I enjoyed this style.Overall, Darrell Huff wants to show his readers how easy it is to deceive individuals through statistics, graphs, tables, and other figures in his book How to Lie with Statistics. He does this by giving plenty of examples and instructions. Although I worry the instructions may be too specific, they gave me a better understanding how of a certain technique is created and used. I worry for Huff that his book has been used as a guide on how to trick people with statistics, but I also know it has been informative and entertaining for me. I recommend this quick read to any one interested in gaining every-day knowledge towards interpreting articles including statistics. Huff certainly succeeds in providing a self-defense against statistics for the common reader."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"What is published here is common sense.

They were going 'hot and heavy', trying to introduce statistics to 'built the quality into our products' instead of 'trying to inspect quality into the products'. The problem?- none of the supervisors or management really knew anything about statistics, either. After I quoted this book a couple of times it seemed to 'disappear' from our Technical Library. I didn't see it again for nearly twenty years and then another ten years passed before I saw it advertised on Amazon.com . Graphs, especially those truncated and showing only the top part of what is being charted- such as a change from 95% to 98% can appear as almost a doubling at first glance. A saying we had was- &quot;Figgers don't lie- but liars can figger!&quot; You too can learn about statistics and phony charts, or maybe really learn how to interpret the data presented. The numbers still work but the book doesn't appear to have been updated over the years; the annual income examples, etc. especially seem wildly low and unless you can relate to them take away some of the relevance to todays economy. Realize this is a bit of a classic, though, and you can have some fun with it!"},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"The book is about how statistics can be used to lie and mislead. Despite the cynical title, it is really about how to see through claims supported by bogus statistics. It is concise, amusing, and vastly educational. I cannot say enough good things about this book! The book was written many years ago, and as a result, some of the examples are dated, but these do not detract from the value of the book. I personally find them rather quaint. I recommend this book highly. It is one of the most useful books I can recommend to anyone who would like to better understand how advertisers, politicians, business, and advocates use and abuse numbers."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I graduated college in 1961 with an engineering degree from a highly rated school. A required non-engineering course was economics. I remember very little from that class except for a little red book authored by someone named Huff and that that book was one of the most enjoyable and educational books from my whole college career. [After an exhaustivesearch for the book, I found it and] I grabbed it! This book has saved me untold dollars by teaching me to look at most statistics with a very jaundiced eye and to laugh at most commercials. I just put my copy in with the materials I use to teach a class at a local community college since I expect that we [will be able to use the book to discussvarious issues related to current day politics.] I am also ordering several copies for gifts including one for my college freshman grandaughter. So what if the author states that a Yale graduate is doing well at an annual salary of $24,000. Everything else is current."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"How to Lie with Statistics, written by Darrell Huff, was written with the intent of illustrating how deceitful statistics can be and how easily authors of such deceitful claims can persuade the masses. Throughout the book Huff demonstrates the math behind statistics, the common purposes of presenting statistics to an audience, and how statistics that are mathematically correct can blindside those who are not adequately prepared. In addition, Huff provides a plethora examples of how statistics have been used by \\"swindlers\\" and \\"crooks\\" in the past, why these statistics were used, how to understand statistics correctly and above all else, how to avoid being falsely persuaded by statistics in the future. According to Huff, \\"The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate, confuse, and over simplify\\"(10). The book is written from the perspective of someone who has a great understanding of the tricks behind these sneaky stats and it almost appears as if the book were written to benefit those who intend to use deceitful statistics. However, Huff claims that while the book, \\"may seem altogether too much like a manual for swindlers\\"(10), it doesn't do them any good because most of them already know the tricks to using statistics. In addition, Huff claims that those who are targeted by deceitful statistics often do not know these tricks and in order to protect themselves, \\"they must learn them in self-defense\\"(10). How to Lie with Statistics provides a helpful explanation of statistics in great detail and thoroughly educates readers in the methods of both detecting and avoiding deceitful statistics.Throughout the book Huff discusses many commonly used forms of statistics, however, two of the most influential issues discussed are the concepts of sampling and averages. In regards to samples, Huff goes into great detail about how to gather an appropriate sample that is representative of the population it represents. He discusses what a stratified random sample is, how a sample should be selected, and how to avoid common mistakes in the sampling process. In order to emphasize the importance of obtaining an adequate sample, Huff claims that, \\"the result of a sampling study is no better than the sample it is based on\\"(17). In addition, he discusses how to generate useful statistics from samples and how to avoid letting biases influence the results. In addition to sampling, the use of averages is another important aspect discussed in the book. Huff states that averages are, \\"a trick commonly used, sometimes in innocence but often in guilt, by fellows wishing to influence public opinion or sell advertising space\\"(26). Huff goes on to describe mean, median, and mode, which are the three \\"meanings\\" of averages that are commonly used in order to deceive. Furthermore, Huff describes that in many situations, the \\"average\\" that is chosen is the most compelling of the three types, not necessarily the most relevant or useful. In addition to the concepts of sampling and averages, the majority of the concepts discussed in the book can have a profound impact on any decision making process and the understanding such concepts is vital to making effective and efficient decisions.Many potential readers may, at first glance, feel that the topic of statistics may be too dry and mundane of a topic to be worth reading about, however, the book How to Lie with Statistics presents an interesting and entertaining perspective regarding the importance of statistics in society and how the understanding of statistics can prove to be extremely beneficial. The writing style of the author, Darrell Huff, engages the reader and keeps them entertained throughout the book while thoroughly explaining the concepts behind statistics in an easy to understand mannerthat does not leave the reader overwhelmed or confused. He breaks down each topic by discussing real-world examples of how specific types of statistics were used deceitfully in the past, which are usually quite comical, and then explains the math behind it step-by-step. Huff also demonstrates how to spot deceitful statistics and how to avoid letting them influence any given decision. In addition, the book has an illustrator who has crafted a variety of unique and sophisticated cartoons that are individually tailored to the topic at hand, which help keep the reader entertained while adding depth to the concepts presented.In a society that is so focused on \\"the bottom line\\", it can be extremely detrimental to blindly follow statistics without knowing what they mean, how they were calculated, and how that information is relevant to the underlying issue. Not only are the consequences of not understanding statistics significant, but the ease with which they can be created and used (or abused!) is astounding. For many people, statistics appear to be mathematically \\"complicated\\" and they may not see the value to asking questions about their origin. In addition, those who do not understand statistics may incorrectly assume that the statistic itself was created by some \\"expert\\". Unfortunately for those who make this assumption, anyone can create a statistic. Those who generate deceitful statistics may base them upon information and/or data that have little to no relevance, or they may create them without any supporting data whatsoever! Fortunately for readers, the information presented in the book will give them the information they need to develop an advanced understanding of useful statistics and give them the insight to avoid deceitful statistics. Overall, the book How to Lie with Statistics is an entertaining book that keeps readers engaged by illustrating the significance of understanding statistics, discussing the impact statistics have on anything and everything in modern society, and by giving them the necessary tools to protect themselves in a world filled with deceitful messages."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"\\"How to lie with Statistics\\" adds no more bewilderment to an already perplexing world of numbers. Author's advice is pretty simple and easy to comprehend for professionals and greenhorns alike. Darrell Huff avoids the wonkish stuff and instead builds his work around the common traps in the statistical world. Sometimes, these traps are intentionally deployed by the vested interests whereas a lot of times such pitfalls inadvertently sneak into the picture doing even more damage. One of the basic traps in statistics, according to Huff is the built-in sample bias (a sample is biased when a sample doesn't adequately represent the population from which it is drawn).There is no doubt that the outcome of a sampling study is as good as the sample it is based on and that determining a true random sample us an impossible scenario yet almost everyone claims to have found one. Huff asserts that observers need to be highly skeptical each time they look at research data since there is always a bias hidden somewhere.'How to lie with Statistics' is an old-fashioned, honest manual (despite its name) on statistical artifices that has withstood the knocks of time and is still as pertinent as it was 60 years ago. The fact that it's a recommended book in some of the undergraduate statistics courses around the world is in itself a grand testimony to its relevance. I strongly recommend this book to those who have a tangential knowledge of statistics and those who work with data day in and day out and feel besotted by all the graphs, trends and averages."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"How To Lie With Statistics was originally written and published by statistician Darrell Huff over 50 years but the message of the book is still timely: people and organizations can (and often do) use statistics in such as way as to intentionally or unintentionally mislead. Large organizations and those with an ax to grind have used various statistical methods to prove a point while those who disagree have used the same data to prove the exact opposite to be true.One way that statistics can be used to mislead is by stating that a number is an \\"average\\". Well, what exactly do you mean by average? To a layman, the word average is mostly to be taken as meaning the \\"mean\\". A mean is all of the data points added up and then the total is divided by the number of data points used. However, an average could also be the \\"mode\\" or the \\"median\\". The mode is the most common data point and the median is a number at which half the data points are higher and half are lower. Depending upon what a person is trying to prove, they can choose the unqualified term \\"average\\" to report their results while choosing whichever average-mean, median, or mode-proves their point.Huff's book makes the point that there are many ways to lie with statistics: by using graphs that can mislead; claiming that the results are an average without identifying which method of average is being used; sampling errors; convoluted statistical techniques, etc.How To Lie With Statistics is a quick, cute, and informative read. While the book is outdated in terms of the examples used, the message isn't and I would suggest the book for anyone who feels that the messages they are getting from the media are contradictory. Huff's book arms you with the mental weaponry to think through a topic for yourself and to come to a good-if not necessarily correct-conclusion. How can a conclusion be \\"good\\" but not necessarily \\"correct\\" you might query? It can be a good decision if you use all of the data and research that is available to you, look for hidden bias and sampling error and understand that you are an individual and not a data point-what might be true for the average may not be true in your particular situation.Towards the end of the book, Huff makes an important point:Extrapolations are useful, particularly in that form of soothsaying called forecasting trends. But in looking at the figures or the charts made from them, it is necessary to remember one thing constantly: the trend-to-now may be fact, but the future trend represents no more than an educated guess. Implicit in it is \\"everything else being equal\\" and \\"present trends continuing.\\" And somehow everything else refuses to remain equal, else life would be dull indeed."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"The Media holds an insane amount of power.Turn on the TV at almost any time of day and almost any news station will be prominently displaying some sort of poll to either reaffirm what you already know or turn your world upside-down.After all, numbers don't lie, right?But just as guns themselves aren't guilty of killing people, the numbers themselves are innocent--but the Media controlling the use of those numbers can be found guilty of twisting them around to their liking.In 144 fun and generously illustrated pages, Darrell Huff is your guide to this number-infested field, pointing out what is good, what is bad, and why.The cartoons do a great job of literally illustrating his points and make this potentially dry subject much more palatable. As for the written portion, there are plenty of real-life examples that show how even big-name companies are often guilty of bending the figures in their favor. I guarantee you'll never look at the word \\"average\\", a line graph, a bar graph, or even a pictograph, the same way again.One thing I find ironic about this book is the quip at the bottom that \\"Over Half a Million Copies Sold--An Honest-to-Goodness Bestseller\\". This may be the case, but if you read this book you'll find yourself even skeptical on those words. Is Darrell Huff slyly implying that because half-a-million copies have been sold that his book is a GOOD book? The answer is that sale-numbers by themselves are meaningless here. If Bill Gates bought all 1/2 million copies of this book, that says nothing about whether he LIKED the book, it just states the fact that he bought them.Even the Amazon reviews in favor of this book--to include mine--aren't completely authoritative as to how good or bad this book is. All you know is that out of 100+ reviewers the \\"average\\"--there's that word again--rating is over 4 stars. This of course says nothing about the billions of people on our dear planet earth who haven't read this book, or those that have read it and have not bothered to review it.As far as Amazon is concerned, only about a hundred have reviewed this book and billions have not, and although my opinion may not count for much, I think it is worth reading and encourage you to join the ranks of those that have."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Love this little book.

And, given that we all watch the news / read a paper / listen to our friends at the water cooler / make powerpoint presentations / listen to a salesman... that's all of us.Huff goes through all the little lies and explains how, with some creative thinking, numbers can be bent to any purpose. This isn't just a manual on how to deceive - it is an education to turn the reader into a critical audience. Huff's not teaching us how to lie, he's teaching us how to get to the truth. (That's a bit of a soaring statement, but it works - if we all had the sense & the knowledge to ask the right questions, we'd be living in a much nicer, more orderly world).Huff also writes to the lowest common denominator. This isn't meant to sound offensive - instead, the book is aimed to bring anyone - no matter how numeraphobic (is that a word?) - up to the level of proficiency. His timeless doodles and illustrations are worth the cost of purchase alone, and his anecdotes are brilliant. This is 'statistics' as taught to you by your mate at the bar, not in a dusty classroom.A must-read. I've assigned it to everyone at the office, a move which has paid off ten-fold...

Before the jury deliberated, the defense pointed out that but 1 in 2500 women abused by their husbands or significant others went on to be killed them.For its part, the Prosecution could have -- but did not -- reveal the competing statistic that of all women who died by homicide, 90 percent had been killed by the man who had previously assaulted them.And in this way, a critical point is made about statistics: that they lie when we use them to dramatically convey only part of the story.But still, statistics have a unique power to convey important information. We need to be aware of the size of our population and which parts of it are more susceptible to certain diseases so we can better service them.This book is a very short and very accessible some one hundred and forty pages. It is heavily interspersed with graphs and charts so even a slow reader should be able to finish it off fairly quickly.What's more, it's written in a very simple and accessible style so that even younger readers can pick up and easily understand its lessons.So buy it and read it: after all, 100 percent of people who do will be better informed about the uses and misuses of statistics."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"This excellent book is something very unusual.First, it's about numbers but manages to be both extremely easy to read and very entertaining.Secondly, although it is so accessible that a ten-year old of average intelligence should be able to understand everything in this book, the points it makes are so universal in application that even someone with much greater mathematical knowledge - and I write this as a graduate with two degrees in a discipline which requires statistical understanding - can find it full of useful reminders and even the odd valuable idea you might not have thought of or heard of.The book is about how numbers can be manipulated, by accident or design, to trick people into making false conclusions, and how to spot when you are being fed misleading numbers. In this day and age the ability to spot bad statistics is extremely important to everyone and can literally be a life-saver.I was very surprised indeed to see that a previous reviewer had described this book as \\"not for everyone.\\" I could not disagree more strongly.If every voter read this book, fewer bad politicians would be elected on the basis of dishonest campaign statistics, if every consumer read it, fewer bad products would be sold on the basis of dishonest advertising statistics, and if every journalist read it there might be less harm done by scare stories based on bad statistics.Despite the fact that this book was written many years ago, every single word in it is still very relevant today.However, anyone with a serious interest in the subject who wants an update on some of the more recent examples of how statistics are misused should still start by reading \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" and then follow up with the equally good \\"Damn Lies and Statistics\\" by Joel Best, and his sequel \\"More Damn Lies and Statistics.

Almost every day I see a Gee Whiz graph which makes something look like it's skyrocketing out of control before I check the scale. Then it turns out that a 5% or 10% bump looks like 600% to 1,000%. The trick is to abuse the visual impact of the graph.A company might cut wages 30%, then later increase them 30% and claim that they have restored the cut.

Darrell Huff wrote a witty explanation and guide of all the uses of statistics. With Irving Geis's humorous illustrations this book is a perfect read for everyone. The book is important because it helps discredit all of the numbers, averages, and rates thrown to you from the media, advertisers, bankers, and anyone else who wants to prove their point. The book also shows you how you can prove your point by using the same methods. As with the information gathered in Dr Howard's class, this kind of information will help you in your career, simply because it helps to persuade others and influence them with your ideas.The book begins with an easy to relate incident, where the authors' father notes on how much more crime there is in California than in his little home back in Iowa. Right from the start he gives an example that demonstrates bias and other tricks used to swindle the unaware. Huff gives many kinds of examples, one of which became our assignment in Dr. Howard's class. We are always exposed to averages. We are bombarded by statistics whether we are choosing the neighborhood of our residence to the number one glass of orange juice next to our cornflakes. The principle of the average can be stretched to fit any means. The one that we were asked to further explore in our assignment was for finding the best way to represent the average income of company employees. In a large corporation you can have very few workers who earn millions compared to the millions of workers who earn very little. By this you can come up with really high arithmetical average, a semi smaller median, or most likely a small mode. As an example, when applying for a job, an employer may tell you some statistical data of their salary and employment status; after already reading this in the book, the acquired knowledge will give you the upper hand in the conversation.Furthermore another aspect that makes this a good read is the style. Huff writes in a simple language that does not require a college degree in arithmetic to understand what he is talking about. There is no complicated arithmetic vocabulary that you would need to look up. On the contrary it is meant for everyone who wants to better educate themselves. The straightforward writing makes this book a quick page turner and it is not hard to retain the given information. This makes the book very effective because it makes its purpose easy to understand and apply in your life.The book was first published in the 1950s so most people overlook it; thinking is completely out of date. Most people would think that the information just doesn't apply to the 21st century, but likewise advertising has not changed a lot, except for maybe the new sex appeal. A lot of products are still marketed using statistical data in favor of their merchandise. Also, in my own little research I have found a lot of websites that use statistical data too. A good example is www.landlord.com, they have a page of web statistics that informs the visitor of the frequency of hits, of what percentage of viewers are real estate holders, investors and developers.The book doesn't only read as a warning guide. It offers a great deal on what to watch out for, and it shows you how easily you have been lied to. It also presents you with the information needed to learn all the tricks for yourself. The book is filled with examples of the use of statistics for every category, and it follows up with how to make them work to reach a certain goal. Huff didn't want this book to be a \\"manual for swindlers.\\" Instead he justifies it \\"in a manner of the retired burglar whose published reminiscences amounted to a graduate course in how to pick a lock and muffle a footfall.\\" Further on he explains that \\"the crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.\\" This works perfectly for the simple American mom buying the cough medicine with the most favorable statistical data, or the psychotic conspiracy-theory buff who blames the media for his rash. Furthermore, this book is good read, even if it's going to be the only math book you will read.After reading this book you don't have to let anyone deceive you using statistical data. With everything there is to learn about statistics in this book, you can comprehend its daily exploitation and utilize it yourself. There are so many ways that you could apply what you learned to daily life. \\"The fact is that, despite its mathematical base, statistics is as much an art as it is a science\\" -Darrell Huff."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Someone once said &quot;there are three kinds of liars: liars, damn liars, and statisticians.&quot;I read this book in high school, and it shaped my judgement of the news media, business, and advertising ever since.

Though there is a little bit about deliberate deception, in such things as &quot;The Gee-Whiz Graph&quot; (about how the graphical display of statistics can be twisted so that one can get any desired result, though the stats aren't changed), the meat of the book is regarding sound statistical reasoning, something that people today really need to consider.For example, every person who listens to the latest survey showing a correlation between certain food and certain health problems or benefits should read &quot;Post Hoc Rides Again&quot;, in which people erroneously leap from statistical correlation to a cause-and-effect relationship. An example given in the book is a report in which it was found that smokers had lower grades in college; ergo, said the researcher, smokers wishing to improve their grades should quit smoking! Of course, a statistical study showing that there's a &quot;significant&quot; relation between smoking and low grades doesn't show which causes the other -- perhaps educational failure draws people to smoke! My own theory would be that the =type= of person who is given to smoking is also given to not doing well in school; instead of cause and effect, one has a correlation from a shared, third (and unnamed) cause. One comes across these fallacies in the news =every=day=; I've been reading my online news, and in the science section I've already found two suspicious cause-and-effect reports. As Huff notes, it's not the statistics which are in question -- it's how they're used.Some of the figures and examples used are funny due to their datedness (I love the picture of the surveyor asking a doctor what brand of cigarette he smokes, and the cigar-smoking baby just makes me smirk). It seems to me if you multiply every monetary amount by 10, you might get a better idea as to what it's worth (I don't know what it is actually worth, as I don't know what the inflation from 1954 is (another suspicious statistic)).More to the point, with the help of this book, you need not have blind faith in the numbers or disgustedly throw all stats away. The mathematics of statistics guarantees them to have great power, as long as you know how to interpret them correctly. You might be pleasantly surprised to find that more common sense than math is involved in this book, but the truth is most modern abuse of numbers happens well after the numbers have been calculated. Of course, once you talk back to statistics people may think you're crazy; at least you won't be fleeced by false reasoning."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Statisticians hate the old adage \\"Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics\\", but statistical methods do have that reputation with the general public. There are many excellent accounts, some even understandable to laymen that explain the proper ways to analyze, study and report the analysis of statistical data. Huff's famous account is illustrative and well written. It gives the average guy a look at how statistics is commonly misused (either unintentionally or deliberately) in the popular media. Graphical abuses are particularly instructive. Readers should recognize that statistical methods are scientific and with proper education anyone should be able to recognize the good statisticians from the charletons. For now Huff's book is still a good starting place. As a statistician I hate the public image portrayed in the quote above. However, I do sometimes have fun with it myself. As I write this review I am in my office wearing a sweatshirt that reads \\"When all else fails manipulate the data.\\"A modern book by a consulting statistician on the same topic is \\"Common Errors in Statistics and How to Avoid Them\\" by Phil Good.

This book really is for every one. In fact, if you're a no-equations reader, this book will be especially helpful.It shows all the little tricks that advertisers and propagandists, government agencies included, throw at you every day. One, p.85, is an impressive sounding news article about teachers' pay. At first, it looks as if a generous government outlay had doubled or tripled teachers' salaries. Looking closer, however, one sees an odd cluster of unrelated numbers flying in close formation. None of the numbers quoted has any bearing on any other, at least none that the article's reader can discover.Duff also points out the fallacy of correlation. Oh, it's a useful enough measure, if (!) a number of mathematical requirements are met. It is not causation, however. For example, there is a strong correlation between a school child's height and the child's score on a given spelling test - taller kids do better. The fact is a lot less surprising when you see that first graders tend to be smaller than sixth graders, and tend to know fewer words. Maybe the example sounds silly, but no sillier than lots of the numbers in the news every day.This is a quick and approachable read, and true even if the examples are now dated. Despite its name, this book really is aimed at honest people, readers who want real understanding of the data thrown at them, and presenters who want their numbers to be understood properly. And best, you don't have to be a mathematician to see what's going on.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"My introduction to this book was by way of the 'required reading' list for my undergraduate statistics course. Bad first impression. But the book turned out to be fun to read, and enormously instructive. The class material for my college statistics course taught me HOW to do statistics, but this book gave me a good beginning understanding into the common methods of the abuse of statistics. Conversely, by implication, it also teaches how to present information in as truthful a manner as possible. The knowledge served me well as I further studied statistics at a graduate level, and continues to serve me as a Government Technical person, constantly working with statistical tools.The book gives a good jump start into the interpretation of data presentations. Now, when I see a &quot;Gee-Whiz Graph&quot; I immediately know that the fluctuations shown in the line or bars are magnified, and I begin at once to look for the real difference (base 0) in the data points.This book is living proof that learning can be fun.

This is exactly what author Darrell Huff shows readers in his book, How to Lie with Statistics. Huff explains how easy it is to manipulate statistics and what a common practice this is. How to Lie with Statistics informs readers so that they are not mislead, because \\"the crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.\\"Interestingly, Darrell Huff was not a statistician. He was merely an American writer, living from 1913 to 2001. He studied sociology and journalism at the University of Iowa. Duff was once editor of Better Homes and Gardens and Liberty magazines. During his career, he wrote hundreds of \\"How to\\" articles and books.The first chapter entitled \\"The Sample with a Built-in Bias\\" explains the errors, intentional and unintentional, that can happen while producing statistical research results and how these errors lead to influenced or inaccurate conclusions. Huff says that much of the information we read in newspapers and magazines is incorrect because the sample used is not a representative sample--one in which every source of bias has been eliminated. To support his theory, he uses an example in which Time magazine claimed that \\"the average Yaleman, Class of '24 makes $25,111 a year.\\"Huff informs his readers that there are three different types of averages and if one type is used incorrectly it can cause misinterpretation of the data and inaccurate conclusions. The word average is very loose term, not giving a reader any real information unless it is specified as to what kind of average it is--mean, median, or mode. The mean is the mathematical average or the sum of all the numbers in a series divided by how many numbers are in the series. The median tells that half the numbers in the series are above and half are below than that number. The mode is the most common number within the series. Huff provides the example of the company that boasts that their average annual pay is $5,700. This number is actually the mean. The median is only $3,000, meaning that only half the people at the company are making more than this. Furthermore, most people at the company are making $2,000, which is therefore the mode.Huff shows how graphs are often modified to deceive readers. Misrepresentation arises when the visual representation of the data is contradictory to the numerical representation. This often happens when a person wants to \\"'win an argument, shock a reader, move him into action, [or] sell him something.\\" Huff uses the example of how national income increased ten per cent in a year to demonstrate how to take a graph and present the conclusion the author desires. In both pictures below, the numbers and curve are the same. The only difference is that the bottom of the graph has been cut off, giving the impression that the line has climbed halfway up the graph.Huff teaches his readers how to defend themselves from deceit by learning how to talk back to a statistic. The first thing he says to do is ask, \\"Who says so?\\" Often the name that is cited is not supporting or authenticating the information. It is also important to look for both conscious and unconscious bias. The next thing to do is look for how the person reporting got their information. Data, and therefore statistics, will be very inaccurate if it is drawn from a biased sample, such as those that are too small, not representative of the whole group, or that is self-selecting. The reader must search for what's missing. The absence of relevant information, such as the type of average, the base of an index, or the factor that is causing a change to occur, are clear indicators that the information may not be completely truthful. The reader needs to make sure the author has not switched subjects between the raw figure and the conclusion. Finally, the reader needs to ask himself, \\"Does this make sense?\\" If it contradicts common sense, such as an impressively precise figure, then it probably it not true.One misperception that Huff tries to educate his readers on is the relationship between two things or the lack there of. The author says that if there is a correlation between any two incidents, meaning that a relationship is present between them without providing insight into the direction of the relationship, it does not mean that one causes the other. For example, event one could be caused by event two, event two could be caused by event one, or event one and two could be caused by an unknown factor, event three. Huff encourages readers to question relations between things or events.How to Lie with Statistics is an outstanding book complete with tons of examples and amusing pictures. Although written over fifty years ago, this book is not outdated. Because the book is easy to read and understand, it's no wonder that it is the best selling statistics book in history. How to Lie with Statistics provides readers with a new perspective and point of view when looking at information."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"This charming, cynical, wittly little book exposes many of the cheap tricks, bogus techniques, and cunning deceptions employed by Madison Avenue, politicians, corporate PR departments and even -- dare we admit it? -- scientists. I am surprised to find that some statisticians here have panned this book. Do they imagine their craft is only used for the good of mankind? That their colleagues are all upstanding citizens who would not think of deceiving members of the public, employers, stockholders, or Members of Congress? Yes, the techniques described here are simple, and any professional should see through them. For that matter, any banker should see through common stock swindles and Ponzi schemes, yet in the business section you will often read about prestigious banks and long-established investment firms that were taken in by these schemes and robbed of huge sums of money. Experts fall for stupid tricks too. Anyway, the book was written for the general public, not for professionals. And the professionals should remember Huff's main point:&quot;The fact is that, despite its mathematical base, statistics is as much an art as it is a science. A great many manipulations and even distortions are possible within the bounds of propriety. Often the statistician must choose among methods, a subjective process, and find the one that he will use to represent the facts. In commercial practice he is about as unlikely to select an unfavorable method as a copywriter is to call his sponsor's product flimsy and cheap when he might as well say light and economical.&quot;My mother was a professional statistician. She recommended this book to me at a tender age. I am not much good at mathematics but I never forgot the definitions of average, median, bias, error rate, causality and correlation. The book shows several ways to plot a deceptive graph. It shows how to select a biased sample, and how to take meaningless, small, random fluctuations and blow them up to look like a trend. This may seem a little subversive until you remember, as the author puts it, &quot;the crooks already know these tricks; honest men must learn them in self-defense.&quot;The illustrations by Irving Geis are cute.The book is in its 46th printing.

In How to Lie With Statistics, author Darrell Huff describes the tendencies and strategies of how company's fool people with statistics. This book is an easy read, filled with valid, interesting information. It holds plenty of examples to help the reader understand the concepts within, and its comically illustrated for the reader's enjoyment. There may be some difficulty in fully understanding all the examples because they were all examples from the 1920's to the 1950's. For instance, people making average yearly incomes of two to three thousand dollars. The book has been in print ever since 1954, which speaks wonders about it quality and relevance even today! The author is able to discuss the lackluster subject of statistics in an entertaining way. It will certainly cause you question the reliability of the incessant statistics thrown at you on a daily basis. Huff takes a skeptical look at how most data used in advertising and other areas, is presented to fool its audience.The key to fooling people is not to use false statistics, but rather present statistics that are so worthless to an audience that they may as well be untrue. How can so many companies get away with this procedure so much of the time? Companies are successful in deceiving people with statistics because they know that the untrained reader does not know the correct questions to ask in order to determine if the data is valid or not. They use extra minuscule print at the bottom of a page to conceal information that may significantly change how the data is viewed. They also out-right omit crucial data that is necessary to correctly interpret the given statistics.Taking a biased sample is a quick and easy way for statistics to loose their validity right from the beginning. The book discussed an instance when Time Magazine published that the average Yale graduate from 1924 makes $25,111. Most readers will read by that kind of statistic, believing that it is accurate and fully trusting the source that broadcasts that information. In order to test the legitimacy of a statistic, one must inquire as to how that information was obtained. In this case, the writer for Time probably had no idea before including it in his article. Well, when you pick apart the way this sample was obtained, it is surprising how fast it loses all authority. Yale mailed out a survey to a sample of the graduating class of 1924, twenty-five years after commencement. The author points out first, that the university will have a much easier time contacting the very successful and well-known graduates, whereas the unsuccessful one might have fallen off the face of the earth, so to speak. He made the argument that maybe less successful graduates no longer wish to stay in contact with the school for whatever reason, if anything because they cannot afford the trips to the class reunions. Then, of the people who received the survey only a small portion of them will respond. Many recipients will immediately throw it away in the garbage, or forget about it, or be unwilling to take the time and hassle to fill it out and mail it back to the school. If someone is willing to fill it out the survey is asking a rather personal question: How much do you make in a year? This now opens the door for dishonesty. Some people out of embarrassment will exaggerate their income to feel better about themselves and to not be revealed as inferior or below average. Others might play down their income out of fear of taxes because they don't want to contradict themselves on some other document. After a biased sample has been taken, another way that the data gets skewed comes when just one kind of average is given and does not specify which average it is. There are three different averages: the mean, median, and mode. The mean is the exact average of the data. This number can be highly skewed by just one or a few individuals with extreme incomes, either much lower or much higher than normal. The median is the middle number. Half of the incomes are below this and the other half are above. The mode is the most common income in the mix. A quick way to get deceived is to be told an average and to not know which of those numbers you've been given. Companies throw the term \\"average\\" around loosely because they know that they can dish out one of these averages, and the everyday individual will not even think to ask which number he has been given. Do not think for a second that companies hold this knowledge without using it for their benefit to confuse and to falsely represent their product.Another common method companies mislead customers is to pick one trial for display with desired results out of a myriad of others with inconclusive results. As we have been shown in class, people do not know what randomness looks like. So, when a trial comes out with eight or nine out of ten with the desired outcome, people assume that the product is a success, not realizing that in one hundred or in one thousand trials, that kind of outcome is not completely unlikely. It also helps that the number of trials is not broadcasted or advertised up front and center, if at all.For one final note: BEWARE of pictures, graphs and diagrams. They are usually in place to mislead. Easy to find warning signs include: graphs that don't have clear units on both axes, graphs that don't start at an unclear point on either axis, graphs that don't show zero, or graphs that are so zoomed in that you cannot see any kind of long-term pattern. Also do not be fooled by pictures of doctors with medications. These are often actors wearing white lab coats.Companies are often using statistics to fool and deceive. You should not give them the benefit of the doubt, if you are thinking about giving them any of your money. Darrell Huff shows us how people are most often fooled and how you can be on the lookout for statistical scams. This book was an enjoyable and easy enough to read that I did not want to stop reading it. It has been a trusted source of information on its subject for over fifty years. I trust it and I enjoyed it and I think you will too if you are at all interested in statistics trickery."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I read this book when it first came out, fifty years ago, and thought it was hilarious.

Although they're outdated, the examples from daily life make all the ideas easy to understand. I definitely reccomend this book not because you need to know each specific way numbers can be twisted, but more because Huff instills a general skepticism in the reader.

Best to view it as the first class of Statistical Self Defense 101, rather than a master course."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"How to Lie with Statistics is a fun and informative look at the was in which statisticians try to decieve the public with misleading statistics. Every chapter contains plenty of real-world examles that provide excellent insight into the concepts. The book is a quick read (only 142 pages) and it holds the reader's attention; both are necessities for an educational work. How to Lie with Statistics is perfect for the beginning statistics student or anyone who wants to learn how they can be decieved through the manipulation of numbers. The reading level and math make this more appropriate for high school or college students than for younger students. Using three randomly selected paragraphs, the mean Flesch-Kincaid grade level was 10.4; thus this book is excellent for sophomores or advanced freshman. Although the writing is a little dated (1954), it is still clear and highly relevant. Overall, this is a highly recommended and worthwhile read."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Do you know the difference between the mean, median, and mode? If yes, chances are this book won't do much for you.The author addresses how those with an agenda may use any of the \\"averages\\" to create a story that fits the narrative they want to tell. Others may rely on very small (or biased) samples to advertise a seemingly large effect that arises just by chance and would go away with a larger (or representative) sample. That is, unfortunately, all the meat there is to this book.I don't know if I'm just not the target audience for the book. I almost feel bad giving it two stars, as the examples are at times somewhat amusing. However, the book took me only two hours to read, suggesting the \\"light on content\\" critique may not be entirely unfair.As an alternative reading, I would suggest Nate Silver's \\"The Signal and the Noise: Why So Many Predictions Fail-but Some Don't.\\" Nate Silver's claim to fame is his tremendously successful forecast model for the last two presidential elections. The book deals more with forecasting (and the problems that arise there) than statistics... however, these topics are closely connected and an interest in the latter, I'd imagine, comes with an interest in the former.Forecasts (maybe even more so than statistics) are something we're exposed to all the time, and we often do not look too closely at how those forecasts came about. Deception there, too, is common: the weather channel, for example, openly admits to exaggerating the chances of rain. Why? If it says there's a 10% chance of rain and it does rain (which, if the model is accurate, happens one every ten times), people will not have planned for it and will be upset that the prediction wasn't \\"clearer\\". With 25% chance of rain, people will grab an umbrella and won't have the same bad reaction to unexpected days on which it won't rain. So the interesting twist is that we may be better off with a \\"wrong\\" prediction than a right one."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Darrell Huff's How to Lie With Statistics explores all the different ways that statistics are and can be used to dupe rather than educate people. He goes into great detail thoroughly explaining each kind of \\"statistical lie\\", educating his readers so that no one will ever be lied to with statistics again. He then explains how to avoid each of these lies in one's everyday life, touching on issues such as sampling, well-chosen averages, the probable error, tricky graphs, and the post hoc fallacy.Huff begins taking a deeper look into statistics based on samples. He points out many real-life examples in which the statistics are obtained from a sample that is not randomized. For instance, the average amount a graduate from Yale earns per year was taken from those Yale graduates that could be found, leaving out all the \\"barely surviving writers\\" and \\"unemployed alcoholics\\". As it turns out, rich people are easier to find in the first place, so there is no way that sample could give an accurate average of a Yale graduate's income. Huff's real life approach to this issue makes it easy to understand and apply to everyday life. Another point he makes, is that often when asked about income, people tend to exaggerate, something we can all understand. Huff clearly points out how important a sample is to gaining accurate statistics.Huff moves on to discuss the idea of the \\"well-chosen average\\". Anyone who has ever bought a house has risked being lied to with statistics by a real estate agent. Huff explains this \\"trick\\" in detail, which can help anyone looking into real estate, or even a new job. A real estate agent may say that the average income in a certain neighborhood is $20,000; however, that statistic could mean that the majority or the neighborhood has an income of $3,000 with a couple rich neighbors living down the block. Huff also points out how this method is used to fool those seeking jobs. Being close to graduation, I appreciate this information, because soon enough I am going to find myself in a situation where I need to be aware that just an average number is not sufficient, and that I should always ask for more detailed information.One chapter that I was particularly interested in was chapter four. In chapter four, Huff discusses the probable error and the standard error. He uses the Stanford-Binet IQ test as an example to show how probable error can affect results. In his example, the error is 3, which can mean the difference between being above average IQ or below average IQ. This struck my interest because my mother used to always tell me that I was above average; however, the average results on the IQ test are not 100, but rather, according to Huff, between 90-110. Luckily, I don't know what I scored on the IQ test when I was younger, or my confidence might take a beating.Huff addresses the way that graphs can be used to fool and trick people. If an amount doesn't increase much between 20 and 25, then using smaller increments between the numbers on the y-axis can give the graph a greater visual impact. I often tend to look only at the line on a graph, which I thought gave me a good idea of how great the amount on the x-axis was growing. Thankfully, Huff has pointed out the trickery in graphs. I now check the numbers on each axis first before even glancing at the line, which has most likely saved me from being duped by statistics.Huff then does an excellent job of explaining how to avoid being fooled by the post hoc fallacy. His in-depth explanation teaches the reader to take a statistic and turn it upside down and around, examining it from all sides, before assuming it is true. One study shows that smokers make lower grades than non-smokers, concluding that smoking causing a student to make lower grades. Huff teaches the reader to consider the statistic from a different angle. Couldn't it be possible that the reason those particular students are smokers is because they are making bad grades? By flipping the statistic around, one can see that the study's results may not be necessarily true. Knowing how to avoid the post hoc fallacy comes in handy in every day life, and Huff does a great job of exposing post hoc fallacy at its best.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed Darrell Huff's How to Lie With Statistics. I had such ease applying his examples to my everyday life, which made his ways of beating bad statistics very helpful. In addition, I find myself exposing lies that use statistics all over the place, specifically in the junk mail! I highly recommend this book because it is not only very informative, but also an enjoyable, light read."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"This book is a classic.

At the end of each course, it becomes a highlight in the course evaluations - noted more times than not as one of the best parts of the class. Business professionals and students alike have much to gain from this very simple and entertaining reading."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Despite having been written over half a century ago, \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" is a timeless look at how statistics have been used to mislead or draw unsubstantiated conclusions. Ignoring the slightly dated examples- many references to the events of the 50's and monetary examples that are humorously off as a result of inflation, \\"How to Lie with Statistics\\" still has plenty to offer to readers in our fast-pace, data-driven world.Author Darrell Huff managed to create a wonderfully light and humorous read while still managing to convey a tremendous amount of information. This relatively short book is practically a quick introduction and handbook for many of the most common means of manipulating statistics. It is down-right amazing how many questionable practices you are able to spot after learning the content in this book. From tooth paste advertisements to election polls, the truly essential skills taught by this book help teach you how to dissect claims, and understand what is behind the marketing twists and biases.One of the most wonderful aspects of this work, is the ability to convey a tremendous amount of information in a way that any laymen would be able to pick up and understand. The topics covered include: how sampling introduces bias, the various ways of reporting \\"averages\\" (mean, median, mode), how advertisers pick and choose among statistics, unreported probable error, manipulation of graphs, irrelevant data, and (of course) correlation vs. causation. One might go so far as to say that this handbook guide is an advertiser's worst nightmare, pointing out the many ways that numbers are used to convince us of incorrect conclusions.While I certainly wasn't new to statistics, this book brought forth a breadth of information, presented in a fun, light-hearted way, and broken up with amusing illustrations. But, don't let its length or appearances fool you, the things you can learn are extraordinarily useful. I would highly recommend this book to a wide audience, anyone with a passing interest in how numbers are being used to deceive."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I bought the original edition of this book (26th printing) in the early 1970s, when it was required for an \\"introduction to statistics for the liberal arts\\" course in college. It was - and still is - an outstanding introduction to statistical thinking, and encouraged me to go further in the study. (I am not a statistician, but I use a number of statistical methods in my work.) It does require some interpretation of money values in particular, because it was written in 1954. If you can accept that, it does not hinder understanding the concepts.When my wife restarted her college education in the late 1990s, one of the texts for an introductory statistics course was ... this book! Since I still have my original copy, that was one book that she did NOT have to purchase ... because the current edition is a re-issue of the original 1954 work. (Since mine originally cost $1.95, she saved 84%* at the bookstore that semester.)I highly recommend this book. It is easy and fun to read, but packed with learning. Some things you will learn almost without realizing it are: there is more than one \\"average\\"; why the range of values may be more important than any of the \\"averages\\"; most graphs don't tell the truth even when the numbers are accurate; those percent of error numbers actually mean something (for example, if the error ranges of several values overlap, you can't make a meaningful distinction between them); the idea that when two or more things change at the same time it does NOT necessarily mean that one \\"caused\\" the other; what the dreaded asterisk (*) can mean; and much more.(* She saved 84% based on the retail cost of that book, without regard to the cost of other required textbooks or 25 years of price inflation.) The book explains how to think about perfectly accurate statistics like this (1.95 is 16% of 11.95, so 100% minus 16% is 84%) and consider what is hidden from you, the reader. In this case, what is hidden is the cost of all the OTHER textbooks she required for that semester! If that is included, you will readily see that saving a paltry $10 is trivial after considering the total cost of (probably) a couple of hundred dollars."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I got this book for a course in college back in the late 60's. I thought it was a great book then and I believe it is even more important today. We are bombarded with stats every day in every way. This little book helps cut through the lies and deceit that masquerade as fact today. Whether it's in a contracted poll or sifting through data supplied by the government, stats are used to lead us in one direction or another. Get this little gem and enjoy the old-fashioned graphics and the simple message. How to Lie With Statistics is a keeper. I lent my copy to a physician years ago and have regretted it ever since. He kept it and moved from the area. Argh."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I really enjoyed the book and I thought that the material was well presented and well researched. Darrell Huff seems to be exceedingly versed and extremely knowledgeable in statistics. Despite that, he does a great job at making the material easy to understand and follow without sounding condescending or delving into too much statistical jargon. The majority of material in the book deals with how statistics are sometimes used to deceive people and distort data for cynical purposes. Each chapter deals with a different method of how someone might mislead or fool others with statistics and with each method the author gives many examples and he thoroughly explains each one and how they are deceptive. Also, he uses some wonderful illustrations that demonstrate the different types of deceptive line and bar graphs. He uses these illustrations in order for the reader to better visualize exactly what he is trying to convey. The only downside to the book that I could think of, if you could even call it a downside, more like a drawback, is that it is rather outdated. A lot of his examples come from articles that were in some very highly regarded magazines at that time, and even now, such as Time, Harpers, Literary Digest, and Fortune. Even so, most of the examples are very old and difficult to completely put into perspective because they deal with things that are much different now then they were then. Nevertheless, the issues and subject matter presented in the book are still very relevant today as they were back then, seeing as some of the same deceptive statistics that are described in the book are still being used today, even among a few of the more reputable news media outlets on TV and in print. The last chapter is probably the most important because it gives the reader some worthy ammunition for recognizing and refuting questionable or suspicious statistical claims, i.e., the author goes back and tackles each topic in order to give the reader some tools to help spot and properly question statistics that are intentionally or inadvertently dubious. I highly recommend for everyone to read this book because it teaches an especially valuable lesson of why it is important to always be skeptical of statistical claims no matter where they come from."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"I have just finish reading this book and, in my opinion, I thought that it is a very simple and funny whey to learn statistic.However, for people who intend to purchase something with more details about tests and analyses, I don't recommend this book."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"An old book, but a must read for understanding the world today.

Even though the examples are a bit dated this does not diminish the value of the book. If anything, I would argue that the book is more relevant now than it was when Huff wrote it 50 years ago. Why so? Because in this crazy-busy world in which we live, on the whole we are more susceptible than ever to accepting statistical data, carte blanche, no questions asked. This state of affairs is an unfortunate reality that unscrupulous advertisers, politicians, special interest groups, and others are well aware of and continue to take advantage of.Finally, don't be dissuaded by those who criticize the book for being light on statistical theory.

Like wine, the book has aged and even got better with time.This book was path breaking in its time, and some of its innovations live on to this day - a provocative title, use of 'cartoony' illustrations, humorous writing against the backdrop of a serious subject, and more. Short at 144 pages, readable, humorous, it covers a variety of 'lies' spoken in the language of statistics. It won't educate you on statistics per se, on such terms as the bell curve, standard error, sampling error, confidence intervals, etc... but that is not the purpose of the book.How to Lie With Statistics is written by Darrel Huff, a former editor of a magazine, \\"Better Homes and Gardens\\", and freelance writer. He was not a mathematician or statistician by profession. Yet, his book has sold more copies than any other text on statistics. Amazing, isn't it?There is a part of the human brain, and indeed heart also, that is so eager for the 'truth', in whatever context, in whatever form, that we look at numbers with a reassuring feeling - numbers convey accuracy, preciseness, and authority, which in turn leads us to accept them as being truthful. Words can be used to lie, numbers cannot - so goes the seductiveness of numbers.\\"The secret language of statistics, so appealing in a fact-minded culture, is employed to sensationalize, inflate,confuse, and oversimplify. ... But without writers who use the words with honesty and understanding and readers who know what they mean, the result can only be semantic nonsense.\\" [page 8]\\"Users report 23% fewer cavities with Doakes' tooth paste, the big type says. You could do with twenty-three per cent fewer aches, so you read on. These results, you find, come from a reassuringly \\"independent\\" laboratory, and the account is certified by a certified public accountant. What more do you want?...The principal joker in this one is the inadequate sample - statistically inadequate, that is; for Doakes' purpose it is just right. That test group of users, you discover by reading the small type, consisted of just a dozen persons.\\" [pages 37, 38]Chapter 5, \\"The Gee-Whiz Graph\\", briefly gets into the area of lying with graphs. By using a scale that does not start at zero, or a line graph that is truncated to show only a small window of the actual graph, or by means of a broken graph, and more, graphs can be used to lie. Ample illustrations in the book and in books like TheThe Visual Display of Quantitative Information,Envisioning Information,Information Dashboard Design, etc... cover this in a lot more detail and with erudition.Chapter 6, \\"The One Dimensional Picture\\", is a continuation of the topic on lying with charts, and here the use of representing a single measure along a single dimension along two axes is described\\"If you can't prove what you want to prove, demonstrate something else and pretend that they are the same thing. In the daze that follows the collision of statistics with the human mind, hardly anybody will notice the difference.\\" [page 74]Wall Street thrives on such numerical machinations...\\"There are often many ways of expressing any figure. ... The method is to choose the one that sounds best for the purpose at hand and trust that few who read it will recognize how imperfectly it reflects the situation.\\" [page 82]Chapter 8, \\"Post Hoc Rides Again\\", is on correlations and causality. The title of the chapter is taken from the Latin phrase, \\"Post hoc ergo propter hoc\\", which means \\"after this therefore because of this\\". If the newspaper is delivered everyday at 7am, and if you go to the toilet at 7:30am, then did the newspaper delivery cause you visit the loo? You would most likely argue not. But you cannot dispute there is a strong correlation, though causality would be disputed, and rightly so, unless there is something in the newspaper content, everyday, that causes 'movement'.The title of chapter 9, \\"How to Statisticulate\\" could have come straight from an Asterix comic book.\\"Misinforming people by the use of statistical material might be called statistical manipulation; in a word (though not a very good one), statisticulation.\\" [page 100]\\"For a spurious air of precision that will lend all kinds of weight to the most disreputable statistic, consider the decimal.

She said that 'price cutting in the southwest ranged from 14 to 220 percent.'

It's the things we know that just ain't so. These words by Artemus Ward have for a long time held a prime place on my desk, its true wisdom reaching far beyond the simple-minded language. How To Lie With Statistics could best be described as the book world's equivalent to this quote. But don't be fooled by its publishing date (1954), its appearance (classic cartoon-type cover) or language (addressing the reader as he/she is a four-year-old). You will enjoy it on a three-hour train ride and you will be lied to a lot less. The author, Darrell Huff, is a well-known American editor, researcher and author of a series of \\"How to\\"-books, of which this one has outshone all others by impact and sales.The part of the phrase \\"the dismal science\\" (i.e. economics) that has irked me the most, has always been the word \\"science\\". As for the first part it's hammer on nail. But any exercise in which there is absolutely no - or a very limited - clear line between cause and effect in an observable environment, should not be labelled as a science. Economics, as well as finance in the short run of course, is surely much more art than science. Anything dealing with interactions between people is, in particular if it is being practised outside of a controllable environment (a.k.a. the \\"real world\\").However, the fascination, attention and trust with the myriad of numbers and stats being produced daily around the globe are mind-boggling. Its impact has actually travelled in the opposite direction to its relevance; the less it matters the more the markets crave it. Case in point: U.S. payroll data. The bonfire-cult of this has baffled me for a long time, being one of the worst offenders for both predictability (its revisions are legendary) and relevance (it is, at best, a lagging indicator of the health of the economy. At worst? The mother of all red herrings). So much talent and so many hours are spent prognosticating the changes down to the second decimal - like it would matter! \\"Statistical challenges\\" indeed.To get my senses straight again after a recent avalanche of U.S. payroll data and Chinese macro numbers, I re-read the classic How To Lie With Statistics. As an equity analyst, I have always tried to keep the lesson of the five-foot man who drowned crossing a river with an average depth of four feet, close to my heart. There is simply no support in averages, medians or means in the world of intrinsic values. And as the book points out, using averages without intimately knowing and understanding a series' skew and mode (the most frequent occurring number in a series) is simply meaningless. It could even be outright dangerous. The book also brings up important topics such as correlation does not imply causation, the dangers of faulty sampling (to fit ones purpose) and the simple tricks one can use in distorting charts. The outline of the book consists of a chapter by chapter walk-through of some of the most commonly used methods of using statistics to serve one's own purposes (fooling the recipient in the meantime), each chapter being a little more \\"advanced\\" than the previous one.Statistics can be as useless as Lehman Brothers' Tier 1 ratio the week before bankruptcy: 16,9 per cent. It can also prove that it is a six-sigma event that U.S. house prices would decline on a nationwide level. Or, it can be a real aid in helping to understand the world we live in. It all depends on the purpose, intent and the eye of the beholder. Again, this book will disappoint you if you are on the lookout for a tome that will wrestle you intellectually, stuffed with complex math along the way. But I like it for its freshness, common sense and humour. Three traits one could really enjoy in higher dosages while trying to navigate the choppy waters of financial markets. And one and a half million copies sold could not lie, could they?This is a review by eqtbooks.com"},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Great this had been that by someone I knew that had year many yrs andr still hold true today.

Speaking as a professional statistician I recommend it highly. Very readable and entertaining, the book goes through the basic ways in which statistics are misrepresented, and how a little common sense can (very often) reveal when extravagant claims are being made. This books is a little dated now (it was written in 1954) but very much worth reading - the ways statistics are manipulated haven't changed much. This book is not a textbook of statistics and is not aimed at college students. Rather, it is aimed at high school students and members of the general public who want to be on their guard against being manipulated by advertising and &quot;studies&quot;.

I've just pulled it off my top honors bookshelf to read again."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"In this small book full of funny examples, the author warns us against the danger of misuse of statistics. He advises us not to trust blindly all those means, standard error, region of confidence, etc...Indeed, at best statistics is a fabulous tool to reveal patterns that are not obvious at first sight in data, or to get information on the significance and validity of measurements. But at worse, it can be used to hide under several layers of sophisticated calculations an intrinsic flaw, or a bias in the analysis.The book is particularly focused on elementary use of statistics in the daily context of newspapers articles on economics and business. Thus, those that are seeking examples of misconduct of statistical analysis in more quantitative fields such as scientific research might be disappointed. To those people, I advice to consult the relevant sections in 'introduction to scientific research\\" by E.B. Wilson for example.Depending on your literacy in statistics you might find the book too introductory, chapters tend to stretch a little bit too much. In that case you might want to jump directly to chapter 9 (how to statisticulate), which is always interesting because it illustrates all the concepts introduced previously with many good examples.Overall I think the author does a very good job at demystifying numbers, and at stimulating people to dig into the core of information in a pragmatic and causcious way instead of being impressed by sophisticated formulas (But of course, there would not be anything more silly than to over interpret this book and start to systematically despise the use of statistics. Statistics is an essential tool in alll disciplines of science). I put only 3 stars because there's nothing mind blowing either in the book. I was amused reading it, but I didn't learn much."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"This book was recommended to me, tangentially, on the subject of 'software engineering project management metrics'. Part of the point of the recommendation was to understand how seemingly irrefutable metrics can be used to persuade, mislead, and worse - support forgone conclusions.This books teaches that well... \\"Numbers, when tortured, will confess to anything\\". It teaches how numbers can misrepresent, how to spot when that is occuring, and how to garner the real information the numbers might be telling you.I read this book in 2 evenings - maybe 90 minutes each evening. For about the attention span of a few TV shows, I have gained some knowledge that will give me a new perspective in many important situations.If I were to pick this book up in a bookstore, a quick glance would have made it seem... outdated. the graphics, the language, and some of the facts anf figures are from the 1930's-1950's... but if you get past that, it is more relevant than ever, because we all encounter abuse of statistics every day. (I heard a radio ad the other day that said people in a certain career make 'up to $60,000 or more a year on average'... What does that MEAN? Up to OR MORE? You could stick ANY number between those two statements and have it be true. On AVERAGE? Isn't an average a hard and fast calculated value? Doesn't EVERY career have an 'average salary' of 'up to $60,000 or more'? Heck... doesnt' every career have an 'average salary' of 'up to $1,000,000 or more'? Just another example of tortured numbers...)"},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"This book in simple language teaches basic critical analysis and thoughtful consideration of the kind of statistics and graphs that consumers of modern media are presented with every day.

It's also a fun and easy read.No, statisticians and mathematicians probably wouldn't learn much. I'm a scientist with a Ph.D. though, and keep a copy in my office because I work in a business world where too many PowerPoints make use of exactly the kind of misleading presentation techniques described in the title of this book."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"How to Lie with Statistics, by Darrel Huff, should be required reading for everyone. The cachet of numbers are used all the time in modern society. Usually to end arguments--after all, who can argue with &quot;facts&quot;? Huff shows how the same set of numbers can be tweaked to show three different outcomes, depending on where you start and what you use. The fundamental lesson I learned from this book is that mathematical calculation involves a whole set of conditions, and any number derived from such a calculation is meaningless without understanding those conditions.He also mentions that colleagues have told him that the flurry of meaningless statistics is due to incompetence--he dispatches this argument with a simple query: &quot;Why, then, do the numbers almost always favor the person quoting them?&quot; Huff also provides five questions (not unlike the five d's of dodgeball) for readers to ask, when confronted with a statistic:1. Who says so?2. How does he know?3. What's missing?4. Did somebody change the subject?5. Does it make sense?All this is wrapped up in a book with simple examples (no math beyond arithmetic, really) and quaint 1950s prose. In addition humor runs from the beginning (the dedication is &quot;To my wife with good reason&quot;) to the end (on page 135, Huff says &quot;Almost anybody can claim to be first in something if he is not too particular what it is&quot;).

You might have had suspicions about several things but did not have enough back bone to speak up or contest those figures because you simply did not know what questions to ask.This book guides one through the maze of statistics, their misuse through wrong calculations and unconcious optial illusions of graphs to influence our perception of the way we view a situation.When management, a salesperson or a politician starts talking about averages on a graph; Ask them which average are they actually talking about. Are they talking about the average mean, average mode or average median? I actually started inquiring with authors of previous presentations that I have received in the past. Some of the experts presenting these facts and figures did not know the calaculations used to atttain their results because they had acquired them from 3rd or 4th sources. It shows how many clueless presentors we have in this world.Sampeling is another one of those statistics some of us forget to ask about. When we see figures indicating 30 percent &quot;YES&quot; verses 70 percent &quot;NO&quot; from any given survey. Seventy percent of how many people said &quot;NO&quot;? Did they ask 100, 200, 600 or 1,000 people? Did they interview men, women, children, dogs or snails? Were the questions biased toward one group or the other? All of these questions are very important and the majority of the people fail to ask these questions when being presented with statisics.Some of the language is old and outdated but it is exactly this which makes it a charm to read. Excellent, Excellent....."},{"Title":"How to lie with statistics / by Darrell Huff","review":"Since our schools regularly let us through without a single course in statistics, this book is for the general reader who is in peril of learning facts that aren't facts. It won't teach you statistics, but it will teach you what to look out for when you read the paper and see numbers and graphs. Since most institutions who report these data care little whether they are accurate or significant, you must rely on yourself to determine whether they are good numbers.The problems with statistical data are still relevant today, and it is shocking to realize how contemporary many of his examples seem. The problems of bias, averaging, and confusing correlation with causation all dupe even the most well-educated people, and the advantage lies with the person who can spot fallacies and not be fooled. While learning statistics would be ideal, this book shows the first step towards understanding and critiquing statistical data. It is not longer or more complicated than it should be, and is simple to understand.

It was a fun way to learn not only about math but about the way that people use that math.

And the sad thing is, both illustrations are true, in their own way. What is this, the 2012 Presidential election? No, this is just one charming and witty illustration from Darryl Huff's powerful little book, HOW TO LIE WITH STATISTICS, which was published nearly 60 years old but is still going strong.How is this malarkey still a daily event? Incompetent and falsely alarming (or mollifying) \\"statistics\\" drawn up by incompetent or complicit \\"statisticians\\" give the lie to empirical matters of fact and confuse a credulous population, Huff tells us. Watch out for the \\"average\\" statistic that is based on nothing or nobody average, \\"average wages\\" for example. Or the shocking graph with a mischevous, misleading hunk cut out in the middle; or the logic that the public is begged to construct that doesn't exist in reality (the differences between the number of cases of a malady some \\"expert\\" infers versus the number of reported cases versus the number treated, for example).Huff's prose is clear and strong and what we'd today call \\"reader-friendly.\\" But HOW TO LIE WITH STATISTICS is not a statistics textbook. We learn of survey techniques but aren't forced into calculating standard deviation or regression (though at one time he brings the reader close to the former, without using advanced mathematical languge). We still live in a world of manipulated figures promulgating implausible, sometimes fantastic conclusions (how can costs be reduced by 220 percent? they can't) put out by governments or NGO's or labor unions or corporations for their own purposes. Really, there is little or nothing wrong with this informative, fun and fast-paced little (144-page) book. If the much lower dollar costs of wages and prices from the 1950s seem distracting, as they can become over time, simply multiply the examples by ten (wages of $5,000 becoming $50,000, and note how Huff's principles stand firm). HOW TO LIE WITH STATISTICS will benefit anyone from high-school current events or consumer-math students on up to today's citizens awash in numerical manipulation to (temporarily) force talking points rather than convey reality. I read the book several decades ago, remembered it fondly, and feel I have benefited from it just now on my second reading.

While it is by no means exhaustive, it is certainly broad and deep enough for anyone to run their non-profit more efficiently and more ethically. It covers excellent project, team and board building strategies, as well as nearly every type of fundraising and solicitation. Additionally, there is good information on employing the internet for communication, engagement and fundraising -- STILL a fairly new field for many.Appendices A-C cover some very good tools and examples. Though the listed government grant sources in appendix D focus mainly upon the Humanities and the Arts, valuable web sources are given for finding grants in other areas."},{"Title":"Managing A Nonprofit: Write Winning Grant Proposals, Work With Boards, and Build a Successful Fundraising Program (Streetwise)","review":"This book covers a lot of topics relevant to operating a typical nonprofit organization. None of the topics are covered in much depth, but they are identified and discussed adquately. Just about all the topics covered are what a nonprofit Executive Director really should become expert in BEFORE she tries to found and run a nonprofit of her own. Unfortunately far too many nonprofit leaders try to become Executive Directors, Development Directors, or the like before they are ready. They probably haven't read this book when they should have.This book is split into 5 sections:I. Understanding nonprofit agencies (1-2)II. Guiding a nonprofit to success (3-6)III. Fundraising 101 (7-13)IV. Marketing, public relations, and the Internet (14-17)V. Appendices (18-21)And the five sections are split into 21 chapters:1. What is a nonprofit agency?2. Crafting a mission statement3. Building a nonprofit team4. Working with a board of directors5. Improving your day-to-day management skills6. Paperwork: corporate bylaws and financial statements7. Making fundraising your best friend8. Special events9. Corporate donations: learn the rules & reap the benefits10. Direct mail11. Understanding foundations and endowments12. Obtaining grants13.

Sample grant proposal21. Government grantsThe real beauty of this book is that it identifies topics relevant to managing a nonprofit. After you read the cursory explanations for each, then I highly recommend you do some Google searching on the terms in order to find more in depth coverage. Treat this book like an outline for a research project on how to run a nonprofit and you will be really happy you got this book.I think the book would have been better if it had a chapter on Capital Campaigns and the feasibility studies necessary to have a good capital campaign. And I would have liked to see a chapter on major gift fundraising. And the book would have been more special if it had a resource chapter that listed great books on nonprofit management and fundraising. But none was included.I would have liked the book better if the section on fundraising had been organized a little differently. I think of fundraising as being about (1) annual campaigns, (2) grants, (3) special events, (4) major gift programs, (5) endowment campaigns, and (6) capital campaigns. Direct mail, advertising, public relations and the Internet all relate to annual campaigns. Those chapters probably should have been consolidated. Obtaining corporate donations and grants are close cousins. They probably should have been consolidated in a chapter entitled \\"grants.\\" I'm going to rate this book high besides its shortcomings because it is still a pretty good book. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Managing A Nonprofit: Write Winning Grant Proposals, Work With Boards, and Build a Successful Fundraising Program (Streetwise)","review":"I really found a lot of very good info that anyone considering starting a non profit org can use.There are great sections on the exact steps to start fundraising, meet tax requirements, building an effective Board (really important)how to approach sponsors, holding a special event and a lot more.It is a pretty easy read.

Here he and co-authors Lewis Feldstein and Don Cohen look at 12 examples of community.It's quite interesting to see how, for example, branch libraries became social hubs in Chicago. The vignette of CraigsList is dated only a few years later and, in any event, it is difficult to accept CraigsList as as true example of community. It may have been in its earliest days, but is certainly not now. The depiction of Portland may be a bit blindsided in that Portland's activists seem to be against anything and everything, more like Babbit's than enablers of any kind.On the whole, though, it's an interesting collection of community endeavors. Not truly a complement to \\"Bowling Alone\\", but rather a standalone effort.Jerry"},{"Title":"Better Together : Restoring the American Community","review":"I saw this book at Barnes and Noble. I only skimmed it but it does not seem as good- or as depressing- as Bowling Alone. I agree that it is a very relevant theme but I think the authors need to gather more real-world input and not just paint a rosy picture from just a couple of examples. I think that as a writer, you need to take on the hardest and most entrenched issues and then try to dig through them. When you've reached the bottom, then you start to come back up, gathering solutions to the issue and examples of what did and did not work. This book does not go deep enough and it just skips around among various topics and issues. One of the problems with sociological writing today is that it tends to really focus on the problems but not the solutions. So in that way, I feel that this book succeeds. But I guess it just seems hastily put together and in need of more research."},{"Title":"Better Together : Restoring the American Community","review":"I had hoped to really like this book, because the theme seemed so pertinent and promising. Instead, I was sadly disappointed. It was very much like watching Oprah. Lots of sunny stories about community turnaround, neatly packaged for consumption, with no individual relevance or useful guidelines for reproducing the effect elsewhere. This is not a book about getting to know your neighbors, or building bridges in your community. Whether this is a failing of the book, or just misleading marketing you can decide."},{"Title":"Better Together : Restoring the American Community","review":"Wonderful survey of various US groups that have fostered community over time, by the author of Bowling Alone. Groups range from a community dance project in New Hampshire, to student groups making changes in their Wisconsin town, to the city of Portland, a hotbed of community involvement. Some of the examples of community work better than others, with the New Hampshire dance project and the story of a Chicago branch library both being very moving on a human level. Other selections, such as an inter-faith group in Texas and the history of a union at Harvard are more academic and harder to get invested in. The ultimate message is that community can be built, but communication and some strong leaders need to be in place. One conclusion I would question is that civic community needs government involvement to work. The argument behind this conclusion is not spelled out and the book is full of examples where government was not involved, from Saddleback Church to Craigslist, both in California. We do see examples of government being part of the problem, not being response to student's desires in Wisconsin and limiting growth in Portland through green zone initiatives. Still, an interesting cross-section of community around us."},{"Title":"Better Together : Restoring the American Community","review":"Absolutely inspiring.

For not having many books for children on the subject, this book does fill a gap. But as a librarian, I wouldn't use this book in a storytime. The story alone is alright, but the voice of the dog is very juvenile-- more than necessary. It feels dumbed down for children. The rhyming scheme/rhythm is very inconsistent and a little distracting.The illustrations are corny and don't give any sense of urgency or weather. A story like this would be much better served by realistic interpretations. I understand communicating that the dogs want to run, but they are actually grinning in every single picture. I enjoy the formatting, with the gorgeous Frank Lloyd Wright-esque text boxes and the native flora and fauna on one page and the illustrations on the opposite.I'm glad the author is trying to write books about a subject she very clearly loves. She gives a brief intro to how the sled teams are still used and how they are raised. This book could benefit from a more non-fiction point of view and more resources listed for children interested in learning more.Also, to the reviewer who said it was a good book to get interested in the Iditarod, I have no idea how that could be. The Iditarod is not mentioned in the book, but rather how these sled teams are used to patrol for protection of wildlife."},{"Title":"Hallie's Hero","review":"Jack Dakota found out that he has a son from an eight year old liason.

About the last thing one would expect is to associate the lily-white state of Minnesota with black bseball, yet, in this intrigingly interesting book, Dr. Steve Hoffbeck shows how many other black baseball players suffered the same struggles as Jackie Robinson, their stories being told for the first time.Dr. Hoffbeck has assembled a team of 11 writers to tell the detailed story of black baseball players in Minnesota that begins in the late 19th century and ends with sad story of the fallen hero Kirby Puckett. This is not a book that revels in baseball statistics; rather, the writers focus on the players themselves: who they were, where they came from, the color barrier conflicts each had to face, and what happened to them after baseball. It is this personalized approach that grabs the mind of the reader, and makes this book so interesting.The book is divided into 24 concise chapters, each centered on a particular black baseball player or team. My favorite player chapters were as follows:1. Earl Batty and his attempt to bring racial equality to the southern \\"plantation\\" owner of the Minnesota Twins, Calvin Griffith.2. Satchel Paige's baseball barnstorming days in Minnesota. I am amazed with the pure pitching genius of 'Ol Satch, and how he was not allowed to compete against white major league baseball players until he was 42 years old in 1948. Even at that age (Paige being the oldest rookie to ever play major league baseball), Paige amazed the fans, his teammates, every batter he faced, and even the umpires with his amazing throwing skills. What a shame a man like Paige was denied his chance to excel at his first love while in his prime - just think of how the record books would look if Paige pitched 20-plus seasons in the major leagues!3. Toni Stone, the first black woman (or any woman of any color for that matter) to attempt to pitch at the major league level.4. The chapter on the tragic story of Kirby Puckett, the first black Minnesota baseball superstar, who had the fans of Minnesota in his back pocket, and then lost it all to allegations of spousal abuse and infidelity. Minnesota has never gotten over the fall of their hero Puckett and we lament to this day the sad ending to his stellar career.The above chapters are only my personal highlights of what has come together as an excellent book on black baseball. Other chapters deal with lesser known black players in Minnesota, yet, the themes of persistence through intense racial persecution and taunting, the shared black brotherhood of baseball, and the sacrifices these men went through to pursue their love of the game shine through.Hoffbeck and fellow writers have contributed a vital link to the previously untold \\"missing\\" history of black baseball.This book should be in the collection of anyone who loves the game of baseball, for it documents the early pioneers of black baseball, and shows the heavy financial and emotional price the players had to pay to seek their places in the game of baseball. Modern-day black baseball players owe a debt of gratitude to these early pioneers, for it was their superior abilities, pride, and persistence that finally brought down the long-standing nearly impregnable racial barrier of American baseball. Cudos to Hoffbeck and Company for telling their compelling stories.Jim Konedog Koenig"},{"Title":"Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota","review":"A great read for any Minnesota sports fan. Extremely interesting approach with a number of authors giving a lot of local information about small town teams and how black baseball players were accepted...or not accepted...in rural Minnesota. I found the articles dealing with the small towns much more interesting than the big city articles. I remember watching one of the games many years ago and found some new information that I did not know."},{"Title":"Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota","review":"With the recent untimely passing of baseball hero Kirby Puckett, it's particularily worth noting that SWINGING FOR THE FENCES: BLACK BASEBALL IN MINNESOTA includes an oustanding chapter on the life of Puckett.The chapter on Puckett's life was penned by sportswriter and author Jay Weiner, who was the Twins beat writer for the Minneapolis Star Tribune during the 1980s. Weiner does a brilliant job in telling the \\"rags-to-riches\\" story of the offspring of the Chicago housing projects who became the smiling face of the Minnesota Twins.Weiner reveals the essence of Kirby Puckett, warts and all, and gives the reader a deeper sense of the tragic aura of Puck's career, injury, blindness, groping for posterity, and his induction into baseball's Hall of Fame.Perspective is needed on Puckett and his place in the baseball record in Minnesota and author Weiner does this in SWINGING FOR THE FENCES: BLACK BASEBALL IN MINNESOTA. The book gives TWINS fans a new level of understanding of baseball in Minnesota, tying the past to the present, to see how it all fits together in a lively style, rich in storylines, filled with pathos of the intertwining of the themes of manhood, fatherhood, and brotherhood. A great read for fans of Puckett and of the Minnesota Twins."},{"Title":"Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota","review":"Twenty-three articles by a variety of authors, mostly college professors and journalists, cover the different facets of black baseball in Minnesota from its first days in the latter 1800s down to contemporary times. The general theme running through all of the diversified articles is the \\"America Dream\\" and the \\"American Tragedy\\" reflected in the histories of the teams and the careers and lives of individual players. The American Dream part of the theme deals with how playing baseball allowed players to strive for high personal achievement as well as enjoy various levels of economic security and social recognition. The American Tragedy part takes in not only the racism and discrimination players faced, but also personal troubles and disappointments of some of them. Satchel Paige, Jackie Robinson, and Willie Mays appear along with many relative unknowns. The exploits of teams named the Fergus Falls Musculars, the Quicksteps, and the Brown Stockings, among others, are related. The vibrant Minnesota black baseball scene going back well over a century is treated in a popular style profiling great and other notable players and following the courses, and occasional dramatic moments, of the teams."},{"Title":"Swinging for the Fences: Black Baseball in Minnesota","review":"\\"Swinging For The Fences,\\" is a fascinating journey through Minnesota african american baseball history from the late 19th century to the present day. The book focuses on themes such as race, manhood, brotherhood, and fatherhood, and traces the struggles and triumphs of several black ball players who lived and played in Minnesota.Through the stories of remarkable athletes such as Bud Fowler, Satchel Paige, Willie Mays, Dave Winfield, and Kirby Puckett, the authors trace the vivid, if not well known,saga of black baseball in the upper midwest , from the town team days right up to the arrival of the Twins and beyond.Unlike many baseball histories, \\"Swinging For The Fences,\\" doesn't overwhelm you with mind numbing facts and figures and a real love for the game shines through. The book also contains many never before published photos. Painstakingly researched and beautifully written, \\"Swinging For The Fences,\\" is as exhilarating and fulfilling as a ninth inning rally !-Todd Peterson, Member, The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR)"},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"There are few literary movements as appealing to me as surrealism. Kafka, of course, was quite the master, and others have tried (mostly unsuccessfully) to follow his example. Then along comes Murray Bail, with this linguistically dazzlingly novel, who, in his own way, goes Kafka one better. Where Kafka described the bizarre with a serene, well-modulated prose, Bail describes the bizarre in a strangely halting, off-kilter syntax that so effectively puts us in the same plane as the strangeness he describes that it begins to take on a logic of its own.Thus, when our group of 13 world travelers find themselves in New York, at a hotel that's in the process of being demolished, we barely blink at the description of the desk clerks wearing hard hats or the convention of rock climbers who are already making their way through the rubble. We don't blink, but we do smile.And what can one say about any novel that features Roy G. Biv, with his &quot;orange hair&quot; and &quot;blue nose&quot; (complementary colors!) as a character who works at a cartographers in London? Or is his establishment merely an repository of words, nonce and otherwise?Yet for all of the generous comedy that Bail provides, there is a creeping sense of darkness; not so much that nothing is what it seems (though it certainly is not!) but that the lives of the characters themselves, so &quot;usual,&quot; so &quot;settled,&quot; also seem so unbearably empty.Make no mistake about it, this is not a &quot;comic&quot; novel. It's dark, haunting and, more often than not, devastatingly insightful. Murray Bail has created a masterpiece of the surreal. Anyone who warms to the profound disturbances of George Tooker or the often suffocating loneliness of Edward Hopper (one really must rely on painters as one's closest point of reference) will respond to this book.And if it's any indication of my response, I've never reviewed a book for Amazon before. What a place to start!"},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"The typical, magical Murray Bail moment is this: a humorous, strange, near-slapstick incident is narrated in a contrastingly high scientific-philosophical language, and slyly worked into a powerful metaphor for something far more serious and intellectually engaging than you would ever have thought possible, let alone expected. He does it repeatedly in his short stories (see his marvellous collection, 'The Drover's Wife and Other Stories', the title one being a deserved OzLit classic), and this novel is chock full of them. They range from the surreal and savagely political - such as the Museum of Handicrafts, the 'pygmy collection', and the 'verification' of Lenin's corpse - right down to the simplest of incidents, like a tourist cart-wheeling down some steps, or a freak accident involving the American flag. As his thirteen ill-matched Australians tour through Africa, England, Ecuador, America and Russia, Bail treats the reader to a series of elaborately crafted metaphorical sequences illuminating his major theme, which seems to be 'museum culture' (for want of a better term), i.e. the contingency of reality in a postmodern world, and the difficulty post-colonial peoples such as Australians encounter in defining themselves and their nation within it. Time after time, Bail captures so beautifully the multivalence of the ordinary - that sense that the everyday is both absurd and profound, and in equal measure. The combination of high voice and low comedy I mentioned is perfect for this kind of story. It's a wonderfully destabilizing technique - the reader is never quite sure where Bail 'is coming from', as our American friends might say. It functions, too, as the approximate literary equivalent of that laconic deadpan irony we tend to associate with the typical Australian voice (quite wrongly associate, of course - which, for Bail, may well be part of the joke). I'd hesitate to say this is a novel only Australians could enjoy, because the appeal of Bail's gently surreal comedy is hopefully universal. But there are some moments, some characters, some finely observed turns of phrase, that only Australians will appreciate fully."},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"Homesickness is the second novel I've read by Bail. It reads well though not as well as 'Eucalyptus'. From my own limited experience in traveling, 'Homesickness' does an excellent job of capturing the stereotypical tourist comparing every country to their own, usually in a less than flattering manner, sending home postcards with generic statements, and trying to go native. The museums the characters of the novel visit are strange, bordering on plain weird. From the (literal) Institution of Marriage to a corrugated metal museum, Bail leads us through each one with subtle humor. His sketch of each destination is done well, especially New York City and Russia. While this is an interesting novel, though the average reader might get lost by references to various aspects of Australia culture, I liked his more recent novel, 'Eucalyptus'. I think readers who travel a lot will find much of this novel amusing and dead on. A few of the sentence structures are strange such as missing commas or the syntax in unusual order that I had to reread a second time to understand. Just before Bail dumps the Australian tourists on their last trip to Russia, he provides his own experiences in Russia, which seemed like he wanted to include this extra material for the heck of it."},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"A novel, and fresh approach to explaining the wants, wishes, desires, expectations and behaviour of fictional AUstralian tourists in various parts of the world. Its as much about travel, as the human condition. A wonderful book, and explains alot about the tourist mentality."},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"Years ago I happened to pick up a book entitled \`Eucalyptus' from a small used bookshop and I devoured it. Murray Bail, the books author, has such a poetic way with descriptive passages and certainly made for one of the more interesting and rewarding literary experiences of my life. It is not one of my favorite novels, but it opened my eyes in strange ways and held my attention in a manner I wasn't used to. It was unlike anything I had read in a long time and it truly caused me to seek out more of Bail's work.Sadly, I got preoccupied and \`Homesickness' sat on my shelf for over six years.While on vacation last month I decided to bring it along and dig in, and I wound up tearing through it rather swiftly. What I found was a somewhat disjointed yet thoroughly engaging story that sucked me in yet left me longing for something fuller, more complete.The basic story centers on thirteen Australian tourists on a trip around the world. The visit places like Africa and London and New York and all the while the experience bizarre sights and visit strange exhibits (not your normal touristy things) and discover things about themselves as a group and as individuals that leave them focused on a forward journey through life, not necessarily through the world alone. As the group becomes more comfortable with one another they begin to infiltrate each other's lives and the obviousness of their need to escape yet be comforted by the resemblance of home begins to bleed into their trip.But, all of this is purely speculative because Bail doesn't really develop much of anything. He has a bounty of great ideas and a prose that screams promise and yet there is nothing here. There is no weight to these events. Instead, we are presented with a skeletal story. Each new chapter takes us to a new place with a group of people we never get to know nor really care to know. It isn't that they are all unsavory or unlikable (which they are, but that isn't the problem) but that we don't really know enough about them for it to make a difference. There is flirting and hinted backstory and affairs and yet the characters all bleed together to create one lump of a mess and quite frankly, by the time I turned the last page I had no idea who I read about and why I read it.Still, Bail is an effective writer because his fluidity is nearly unmatched. His creativity is seen in every chapter, I just wish he had used his descriptive skill to etch out more memorable characters."},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"A friend gave me this book as a gift because she had found it to be \\"hilarious.\\"Huh?I have to admit that the only reason I finished this book was that I was trying desparately to find something, anything, funny in it. Unfortunately, the story was ponderous, depressing, and egregiously pretentious from beginning to end."},{"Title":"Homesickness","review":"It is on a very rare occasion that I fail to finish a book.I feel compelled to say that this was one of them. After 100 pages I decided I could take no more. This book started me off on the wrong foot. The introduction produced a large number of characters all at once which were impossible to assimilate. The author failed to capture an audience with such boring characters and much of the narration was in rambling form."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"I found this book to be nothing short of a godsend. With over 30 years of cycling experience, I felt comfortable and competent cycling in traffic, at least in most circumstances. But this book was recommended so many times, I decided to read it anyway. At first, it didn't seem like a big deal. It all made sense, and seemed to describe how I already rode, perhaps with a few subtle differences.But as I began to incorporate these subtle changes in my own riding the results were amazing. My relationship with car drivers completely changed. Instead of interacting with them once in a while -- only when necessary -- I became an integrated participant with the rest of traffic.It is impossible to explain in words how just subtle lane positioning changes, and a new attitude, can make such a radical difference in one's cycling experience in traffic. But consider what Forester conveys in this simple statement: \\"Between intersections, position yourself according to speed; at intersections, position yourself according to destination\\". You may think you do this already, but based on the fact that I almost never see any cyclists do this consistently, I can almost assure you that you don't. And I'm not talking about kids and \\"recreational cyclists\\". I'm talking about experienced commuters, and experienced club riders and racers. Only a very small percentages of cyclists actually behave like a (slow) vehicle driver consistently. Much of the time on the road is spent in space \\"left over\\" by motorists, riding too far to the right, not positioning at intersections according to destination (THINK about what that means), etc. etc.\\"Cyclists fare best when they act and are treated as drivers of vehicles\\" - John ForesterThis book is for you if any of the following is true:* You want to learn to LOVE to ride your bike in traffic, not just tolerate it.* You're tired of motorists passing you and then cutting you off when they turn in front of you, or motorists coming from the other direction cutting you off when they turn in front of you (believe it or not, if you read this book you will learn how to stop them from ever doing this to you again!).* You are comfortable riding in bike lanes passing stopped or slow car traffic on their right.* You think that you should assume that you're invisible to motorists, and ride accordingly.* You don't think you should position yourself away from the edge of the road, often in the path of motorists coming from behind, in order to be more visible and predictable.* You don't feel safe riding in traffic.* Your greatest fear is that you will be hit from the rear.* You don't know that almost all bike-car collisions are caused by, or could have been prevented, by the cyclist.* You feel safer riding on shoulders and in bike lanes than \\"out\\" in the regular traffic lanes.* You're rusty on what the laws are regarding cycling.* You believe the best thing that can be done for cycling is building more bike lanes and bike paths.* You've never taken any courses on cycling in traffic (like LAB's Road 1 course - see bikeleague.org).* You don't believe cyclists have the same rights on the road as do motor vehicle drivers.* You ride on the side of the road opposing traffic (like a pedestrian should walk).* You ride on sidewalks.* You value your life and want to ride your bike accordingly.This is not the perfect book. Forester does tend to ramble, and some of the advice I don't agree with (like you don't really need a rear light at night, just a rear red reflector and a good front light). Also, some of the material, like on equipment and racing, is dated. But the chapters on riding in traffic are timeless and priceless, and so TRANSFORMATIONAL that they alone make this a 5-star book."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"I used to think I knew how to bicycle. Right. After reading this book (over 8 years ago) my eyes were truly opened as to how a truly competent cyclist should operate. Even fifteen years of regular cycling for transportation and fun did not teach my half what a single reading of Effective Cycling did about using my bicycle effectively as part of traffic flow. This book cuts through the preconceptions and misconceptions about bicycle riding. After understanding and practicing the techniques Forester gives in the book, your experience of riding will be totally transformed in a way you cannot imagine. You will feel confident about handling just about any situation on a bike--rotaries, making left turns on multilane divided roads, passing through major intersections--not because you are being foolhardy but because for the first time you truly understand how to negotiate them properly and more safely than you ever did in the past, using the same traffic principles that govern the behavior of all other vehicles on the road. I can't think of many traffic situations I didn't feel confident riding in in the 8 years since I read and began applying Effective Cycling to my riding. I can't recommend this book highly enough."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"This book is unique in its focus on the technique of sharing the road with motor vehicles. His accounts of run-ins with various government bodies are also enlightening, even though I grew impatient around the third or fourth time he recounted his experiences modifying the Uniform Vehicle Code.His advice about equipment, diet, and the other mechanics of bicycling needs to be taken somewhat lightly. Even though this is a &quot;second edition&quot;, much of the material in the book is considerably older. On the other hand, the fundamentals of safety (visibility, lighting, traction, lane placement, risk factors) are invariant over time.Mr. Forester has a definite axe to grind, and this book does it quite effectively. He adds a definite splash of common sense to the fine technique of road riding: don't let other vehicles take your lane away from you, don't surprise them, safety always first, slower traffic keeps right. The safest way to bicycle on the road is not necessarily the one that educators, legislators, or law enforcement officers think it is.This book is a must-read for any cyclist who ever shares the road with a motor vehicle."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"I knew instinctively that the road belongs to me just as much as it does to any other vehicle operator. I knew the rules of the road apply to me as a bicyclist. John Forester showed me HOW these bits of knowledge apply in the real world. More importantly, he showed me how to apply them safely and (yes, I'll say it) effectively. Riding a bicycle in traffic is a matter of negotiation with all other users of the road. If a rider inspires confidence in those other users, s/he will be safe; if the rider is erratic or hugging the last inch of pavement along the shoulder, s/he will be treated as illegitimate. John reinforces my sense of a rider's right to be, even though he is thoroughly opinionated. He sometimes diverges to side topics to the point of silliness. But &quot;Effective Cycling,&quot; a book designed to be used as a text for safe cycling courses, is a complete treatise on normalizing the bicycle (and its operator) for the real world. If you ride in that world, or would like to, this book is worth your time and consideration."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"This is it -- the bible you need if you're going to be a cycle commuter, or just someone who rides more than 10 miles on a weekend.

Be a vehicular cyclist (ride on the road with cars without getting killed, honked off the road or intimidated.)2. Ride on &quot;longer&quot; trips -- more than the few miles you can do without any clue -- by eating right, drinking right, and pedalling right.3. Cycle commute, and enjoy doing so -- what you need and what you don't.4. Basic repair and maintenance.and, most importantly, how to &quot;grow&quot; as a cyclist. There are so many things that I know instinctively now (e.g., how to keep cadence high) that enable me to go further, easier, safer and faster that I wouldn't know where to begin.If you're the kind of cyclist who wants to use their cycle to live better, this is the book for you.

You'll learn about every aspect ofriding, from selecting equipment to touring to riding intraffic. Find out what kind of accidents really happento cyclists, so you can learn how to avoid that sort ofaccident, and stop worrying about accidents that almostnever happen. (Like being hit from behind.)Forester is one of the world's foremost experts in trafficcycling, and he designed the *Effective Cycling* programwhich is taught by the League of American Bicyclists. Asimilar program is the Can-Bike Skills program of theCanadian Cycling Association. Both courses teach trafficcycling skills and use *Effective Cycling* as the text.I consider the &quot;riding in traffic&quot; chapters to be mostimportant. You'll learn where to be on the road (which lane?how far from the curb?) and where to be within your lane (right?middle? left?) - all of which depends on what sort of roadyou're riding on. You'll learn how to change lanes properlyin any traffic condition, how to gain cooperation from motorists,how to prevent acccidents from happening to you, and how toavoid an accident that's coming your way by using emergencymaneuvers.If you are going to buy only one cycling book, *EffectiveCycling* should certainly be the one.

I have been cycle commuting for 24 years now and still need to pull my copy of Effective Cycling from the shelf. It is a tonic and elixer that will get you going on your bike. Anytime I get discouraged or get stuck on a fine traffic safety point (or any cycling matter) I get out my copy of Forester. John's book is the ultimate. I had his earlier homemade editions of this book from the start. Without them I would have floudered. This current edition is a joy to pick up, to hold, and to read. If you do not have this book, you have missed the boat! So what if John happens to irritate you at some point in his book, get over it! This is the book that will save your bacon!"},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"Effective Cycling contains a lot of very valuable information. Unfortunately, half of the book is mostly repetitive axe-grinding and random opinions. I would have given the book a higher rating if these necessary half were not thoroughly interwoven with the unnecessary half.It bothers me that Forester complains about others using unsubstantiated, anecdotal evidence, because he uses plenty himself. For one example, his brief discussion of recumbent bicycles is so absurd that it should have been left out. His double-standards regarding fact vs. opinion and logic vs. emotion greatly undermine his arguments.That said, a reader with a critical eye and a tolerance for hot air can separate the wheat from the chaff."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"Seven years ago, I decided to pull my bike out of the basement, tune it up and start riding to work. That has been one of the best decisions I have ever made for my health. I went looking for a good general book on cycling. Picking up Effective Cycling was one of the best reading decisions I have ever made. Forester is a strident advocate of equality for cyclists on the road. But he backs it up with statistics and logic. His arguments are centered around what makes cycling safest. In the last seven years, I have logged thousands of miles, most of it in rush hour traffic. In that time, in part thanks to this book, the closest I have come to an accident has been an encounter with an unseen pothole."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"John Forester not only defined and developed the system of scientifically-based instruction in traffic cycling; he compiled and analyzed the data to back up his recommendations. This book provides not only the instruction, but the background information, and so it is a valuable reference in advocacy. Many cyclists report that this book transforms their style of riding, just as a good course in water safety changes fear of the water into confident knowledge. That was this reviewer's experience.Forester's position is fundamentally libertarian. He asks for no special favors for cyclists, but rather, he argues for the right to the road, and against laws that infringe on it and endanger cyclists. Forester is usually correct about such issues, but some readers find the argumentative sections tiresome.On a few questions about cycling equipment, Forester's positions appear to be intended more to prevent legal trouble for cyclists than to recommend the most prudent course of action: for example, he does not recommend rear-view mirrors, and he considers a large rear reflector sufficient for night riding without an additional taillight.Readers who prize elegantly-turned prose will find Forester's writing a joy. Few authors use the English language with such care and precision, and particularly not in instructional material."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"This book has some of the best information out there about cycle commuting. If everyone used Forester's techniques and advice, I'm sure cycling accidents and fatalities would decrease. The fact that cyclists aren't respected is because we let ourselves be intimidated by not only other motorists, but our own misunderstanding of the law. There was a day when I once hoped for a utopia where cyclists were treated with respect-but this day may never come, and now we must assert our rights as best we can. Living in American can be trying for cyclists . . . Although Forester's advice on racing can generally be scanned through (if you are serious about it), his chapter on wheel building is amazingly thorough and has helped me build up dozens of wheels. It is the best out there for beginning to intermediate wheel builders-certainly better that Jobst Brandt's book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"I recently started commuting to work via bicycle. The only route I can take is quite busy, so I started out by riding on the sidewalks and nervously dodging all the cars turning right in front of me.

The 1975 mimeograph book, which was tweaked around and reissued several times, a 1984 MIT edition (\\"Big Blue\\") and a 1993 MIT Edition (\\"Fat Yellow\\"). How is this new version different?By the time \\"Fat Yellow\\" was published, it suffered from three problems: 1) its technology was out of date (for example, it hardly mentioned mountain bikes); 2) too much of the book was made up of screeds, old-time war stories, and personal axe-grinding; and 3) its riding advice was closed and totalistic--as Orwell once put it in another context \\"everything that's not required is prohibited.\\" All three have improved a little around the edges, almost always by cutting away, less often by adding, never by changing. The impression one gets is that they were grudging changes.The format of the book is smaller, so the text is shorter. Most of the reduction seems to have come from the mechanical section. The discussion of derailleurs, for example, never even mentions brake-lever shifters. So much of the technical discussion in Big Blue and Fat Yellow had become obsolete that it appears the solution chosen was just cut it out. Forester is famous for his complaint that when he sat down to write the 1975 edition he couldn't find an American book that properly discussed how to fix a flat in detail. Well, that's just about all that this new edition DOES discuss in detail. (And as to that complaint, well, see Jeff Mapes's book Pedaling Revolution.)As far as the screeds and other silliness, it is clear that an editor or editors have been at work. Some of the worst passages, such as \\"its a war, not a contract negotiation\\" are gone. But his personal take on a Roswell UFO, the so-called \\"cycling inferiority complex\\" is now actually given a purported cross reference to the DSM-V manual. (In fact, it and \\"wages of sin is death\\" logic upon which it is based were plagarized from comments made by Hon. Ernest Maples, M.P. in a paper \\"The Future of the Bicycle in a Modern Society\\" in the Royal Society for the Encouragement of Arts, Mfgrs. and Commerce Journal, Jan. 1968). The \\"Cycling with Love\\" chapter (aka \\"How to Use Your Bike to Pick up Chicks\\") section is still there. It still opens with Forester's assertion that his wife's disapproval of his cycling was largely responsible for trashing their marriage, even though I interviewed his son Geoffrey in 2010 for my biography of Forester, and Geoffrey told me that he never detected any hostility on behalf of his mother to either his or his father's cycling.Forester's rogue's gallery is getting pretty gray-haired: Bill Wilkinson is retired and Fred DeLong (along with Jim Konski and Hal Munn, one of the true inventors of vehicular cycling) is dead. However, Andy Clarke is still hammering away and John Pucher has dedicated his emeritus-status years to working on his pro-EuroStyle philosophy (he will have an edited book by MIT out this fall). It is interesting that there are no names added. This reinforces my suspicion that new edition is mostly \\"Fat Yellow\\" edited over by a group of \\"friends of John\\" who were primarily interested in smoothing over its roughest spots and excising its technically out-of-date material. In this they succeeded. However, little new has been added, and certainly nothing has been reconsidered, nothing reevaluated. It's still 1938 and George Herbert is due around the bend at any moment . . ."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"Cancel your subscription to _Bicycling_ magazine. Read this instead.

And I do enjoy this book and recommend it, and agree with most of the praise other reviewers here give it.But still, I find something naive in his trust in vehicular-style cycling. Maybe that comes from his background as a traffic engineer, where a certain number of accidents per vehicle-miles driven is acceptable, and considered evidence that rules are working. But the trouble is, for you or I as individual cyclists, there is no acceptable level of accidents. The only acceptable number is 0 per lifetime, if we're talking about our bicycle colliding with someone else's car. So I think we might have to sometimes ride in un-vehicular ways, to keep ourselves safe from the unattentive or malevolent driver. We might have to jump a curb, ride on a sidewalk, refrain from signaling right turns, e.g....as I said, I am no expert on cycling, but other authors who are cycling experts (Dave Glowacz inUrban Bikers' Tricks & Tips: Low-Tech & No-Tech Ways to Find, Ride, & Keep a Bicycleand Robert Hurst inThe Art of Cycling: A Guide to Bicycling in 21st-Century America) give respect to Forester's approach but then mix in some of their own hard-earned tips for when to go un-vehic. To become a better cyclist you might want to read all three of these books (along with Portia Masterson'sBicycling Bliss: Riding To Improve Your Wellness, which focuses on using your body correctly).I enjoy the opinion and politics Forester weaves through his book. But I am amused by his separation of pro-cyclists from anti-automobilists, whom he does not tolerate. Again, maybe that comes from being a traffic engineer, to whom cars are the environment as much as water is to a fish. But to me, part of the fun of being a cyclist is imagining, and talking about, and maybe helping create, a car-less world. If we can't hate cars, who can we hate? Well, Forester seems to save his invective for the pesky pedestrians, who behave unpredictably, not like vehicles, and can cause cyclists such problems when the cyclists venture off the orderly street and onto the pedestrian-laden sidewalk or multiuse path. Even more deadly, in Forester's book, are the dreaded dogs, who can kill you by running under your front wheel.Still, let me finish this review by praising Forester for reminding us that we do have the full right to the use of the roads -- and not just the side streets, but the main arterials if we wish to get to our destination quicker. As he points out, being bigger or faster does not grant you more rights, or else 16-wheelers and Porsches would take precedence over the other motor vehicles. That is an empowering concept for us two-wheelers. And there is much more to be gained by the careful study of this book, and by practicing many of its suggestions."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"This book was recommended by the cycling club I recently joined. Being fairly new to cycling as an adult, I found this book contains a great deal of practical information and tips for cycling skills suitable for beginners and more experienced cyclists. An example is the books instruction for riding on the road in traffic. The book has very good tips for how to deal with all kinds of traffic situations and stresses how much safer it is for a cyclist to ride on the road where motorists expect them to be rather than on sidewalks or multi-use paths that run along streets. It's not a book intended to be read cover to cover but used more as a reference book. The only negative thing I can say about the book is the authors focus on politics as it pertains to bicycle laws. This information is important for all cyclist to understand so it should be mentioned in the book but I felt that too much of the book dealt with the topic. All in all I'd definitely recommend this book to any one interested in improving their cycling skills"},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"After taking the League of American Bicyclists' road riding course and qualifying as a League Cycling Instructor, I finally decided to buy the book that started it all: *Effective Cycling* by John Forrester. Talk about putting the cart before the horse! I wish I had read this book BEFORE undergoing instruction by the League. It's not that the League's safety instruction differs that much from Forrester's ground-breaking book, on which it's based. Rather, it would be interesting to have read the \\"real story\\" about bicycle safety before embarking on League certification. Forrester writes in a highly-opinionated, emotionally-charged, curmudgeonly style which can be highly entertaining if taken with a grain of salt. Throughout the book, I found myself thinking, \\"Don't sugarcoat it, John; tell us what you REALLY think.\\" The man has an ax to grind, which is this: the bicycle-selling, highway-building, motorist-coddling establishment has conspired to make cyclists deathly afraid of riding in traffic. The cycling establishment (i.e., the current League) has gone astray by caving in to highway engineers who want to completely separate cyclists from motor traffic by forcing cyclists to ride on segregated, multi-use cycling paths, which are statistically the LEAST safe, MOST DANGEROUS place that cyclists can ride. The book goes on to teach proper riding techniques and traffic lane positioning skills, which, if adopted, will truly transform the way one rides a bicycle. The polemic nature of the book can be annoying; and a lot of the blow-by-blow narrative could have been edited out. Also, some of the recommended do-it-yourself safety modifications date the book to a time when bicycle lighting systems, for instance, were primitive and readers had to turn their own parts on a lathe. On the other hand, it's fun to read someone's strong opinions based on his thorough research and hard-won experience, especially when that someone is an iconoclast like Forrester. Forrester is to bike paths as Rivendell's Grant Petersen is to racing bicycles or Vanguard's John Bogle is to mutual funds. They all take a different approach to their subject that no one else follows at first. Later, their ideas start to catch on. If you're passionate about cycling, Forrester's book will make you think twice about widely-held assumptions while teaching you to be a safer cyclist."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"Forester's day has come and gone. This book is interesting to read from a historical perspective but has little practical value in the second decade of the 21st century.Newbies who need real world information about transportation cycling should start their quests elsewhere and save their money.Forester spends many pages stuck in boring old git mode. I am from the same generation as JF and even I find him often insufferable.His over the top, my way or the highway opinions are largely unhelpful to novice knowledge seekers, IMHO."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"Forester is an interesting character. He wrote two massive books on this subject and reused a majority of the material in each so if you have read one of them you end up re-reading it all over again when you read the second book (Bicycle Transportation). Parts of these books deal with and are colored by his personal problems fitting in the industry. Forester believes bicycles should be treated like cars and have the exact same rights (which to some extent they do by law), privileges, and restrictions as cars. He is also antigovernment regulations on safety items (reflectors, lights, etc) and blames the government's requirements for safety items, or more like \\"lack of\\", as the root of most cyclist related accidents. His premises basely that since the government says only reflectors are required (and poor versions besides) then most bicyclists are convinced that they do not need headlights, tailights, or better reflectors, and as such, ride without them, ending up in accidents that they wouldn't have had they had better safety items (reflectors, lights, etc).One of his points about bicycle mobility seems very straightforward - if bicyclists try to get treated differently than motorists they will, but only for the worse not better. A good example is bike lanes and paths. Where bicyclists fight for bike lanes and paths and get them it is usually at the loss of being able to freely travel on the roadways. Personally I am in complete agreement with him in this area. The problems with bike lanes and paths are many, but my main issue is that they quickly become multipurpose: pedestrian and rider. These multipurpose routes are just plain dangerous. Pedestrians have no concept of \\"right of way\\" or consideration for moving vehicles (bicycles) on these routes. If adult bicyclists learned to drive the \\"drive your bike like a car on the roadway\\" methodology Forester describes, all bicyclists would have a better safer environment because car drivers would get used to bicycles being on the roadways. The government also needs to require that motorists learn that bicycles have the same rights to use the roadway as cars.My personal belief is that if you are the type that would rather ride on a car free path, taking your time, riding slowly while smelling the flowers, so be it, enjoy yourself riding and watching out for pedestrians and dogs and other uncontrollable distractions, but, do so at your own loss and not at mine. Don't fight for your right while removing mine to freely ride my bicycle on the roadways, with the cars, at the pace, and speed I want to travel.I got the impression that Forester seems to think that other pro-bicycle writers and lobbyists are sellouts; especially ones who champion bike lanes on the roadways. These roadway bike lanes are another route that is extremely dangerous for bicyclists. They are usually along the side of a roadway forcing bicyclists to make all their left turns thru moving traffic, or they are behind the right side of the road parked cars making each and every intersection a danger zone.Forester sat on a few committees and was involved in some of the early states-created bicycle laws and programs, and as such is probably one of the first pro-bicycle people responsible for the government's review of bicycle usability in US cities.Most readers will find a great deal to learn reading his books, and probably just as much to criticize as well.If you are a firm believer that the only way to safely travel on a bicycle is to be on a separate route than cars travel on then Forester is not for you, but, you should try reading him because you will probably learn a thing a[or to that might possibly change your mind."},{"Title":"Effective cycling","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to learn more about cycling. When I read the almost militant stance on insisting the bicycle be a vehicle and share the road with cars and trucks that travel up to 3 times faster, I was a bit flabbergasted. It sounds like such a dangerous proposition. Then after thinking more about it I realized that there really is no other way. We need to get cars off the roads and we need to encourage better alternatives for commuting and transportation. All these cars will just have to bite the bullet and slow down. If you want to drive fast you can get on the expressway or go find a race track. The roads are for people trying to move from one place to another safely. Cars and trucks suck. Really badly too. So get off the road and onto a bike. Make America a better place for our children and grand children. Power to the petal.I learned a lot from this book. Most importantly, I learned 'Effective cycling'. Some of the book was a bit weird. The mechanical parts were strange and hard to follow and the whole section on food and water processing sort of make my eyes glaze over.

And I got there by observing car driver behavior and modifying my riding style to be safe. That said, what I learned from the school of hard knocks has been written into this book.

It's got a bit of everything in it, maintenance, lighting, clothing suggestions, riding technique and safety in traffic. I can't recommend this book enough. Even though I disagree with some stuff, it's all minor. I happen to like wool for riding out here in the Pacific NW, instead of the polyester stuff. I happen like using a reflective vest instead of an auto reflector for rear visibility, I happen to like Dinotte lights, fore and aft, but those are minor personal preferences. I don't always ride in the safest manor, ie, a long line of cars at a stop sign and you'll find me working my way up the right side, but slow enough to avoid a door prize.If you are a traffic planner, and are thinking that all you need to do is drop some sharrows of bicycles along the door zone to make a road safe, this book will explain how you just made life worse. Same for cycletracks without removing free right turns at intersections. The thing is you may disagree with his conclusions, but he has the data to back up his statements and conclusions. As far as I can tell the rest of the auto driving world is more interesting in what \\"feels right\\" from the perspective of a auto driver vs what actually works from the perspective of a bicycle rider.That said, the one thing that makes a road safe for both bicycles and pedestrians is slow driving cars.

These books expanded my mind to the unique narratives comics can bring.

In this book, her family moved to United States but Luba's disfigured husband is not allowed into the country because of his drug-dealing past. Luba goes on mission to bring her husband to the family, asserting to everyone that she will kill to protect her family. All the while, she is haunted by her own past and conflict between her love for her husband and her longing for his past beauty. Then, there are her glamorous half sisters, each with their own flaws, selfishness, regrets, desires, and love for their family. I especially loved Venus, Petra's little daughter. She is pretty, smokes and reads gay porn comics, and she knows about adult matters, but yet she is too innocent to really understand them. When Petra trashes a comic book store after being rejected by her lover, the store clerk (and object of Venus' puppy crush), Venus and her friends mistakenly believes that Petra did that to get even for Venus' heartbreak. The daughter believes her mother is a hero. Later in the book, after a stressful car ride to Venus' appointment, Petra watches Venus run, murmuring \\"You are too young to hate me for real, Venus.

The only bad thing about this book is that some parts are really confusing, but you can easily get back on track."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"&quot;The Other&quot; is the best horror story I have ever read. The atmosphere is chilling, austere, and creepy throughout. I read it while camping in Europe more than 20 years ago and got to the thrilling, surprise plot twist deep in the night. This twist produced an electric shudder in the gut. Written from the perspective of one of a set of young twin boys, the inner dialogue of this character feels genuine. The plot speeds you along on a can't-put-it-down read, despite much interior action."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This book is a mystery clear to the end. Suspense keeps the pages turning and shock grips you when you discover the secret that twins Holland and Niles share. You read the book taking a very key element of the book for granted, only to find at the end that you have been living inside the mind of one of the characters rather than in the real world. I can say no more without giving the book away, but it is a wonderful read. They don't make books like this anymore!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"When I saw the movie and realized that Thomas Tryon was the author, I read the book as soon as I could. It is a book that is hard to put down and harder to forget. I wish everyone could read this novel, they will not be disappointed. This is an excellent story and is second only to &quot;Harvest Home&quot; and &quot;Lady&quot; (also by Tryon). He is a gifted writer with an unigue style of writing that makes the reader identify emotionally with the characters. He is truly one of my favorite writers. Unfortunately he passed away while writing his last novel &quot;Night Magic&quot;, an extraordinary book as well, and soon to be a movie. I will truly miss this talented person."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Once upon a time there was a somewhat forgettable actor named Thomas Tryon who starred in a series of very forgettable movies (\\"The Cardinal\\" and a few others). Mr. Tryon wisely decided to forget about the forgettable and sat down and wrote a spooky little Gothic novel called \\"The Other\\". The result is an absolutely superb, un-put-downable, unforgettable horror story.\\"The Other\\" tells us the story of the Perry twins, Niles and Holland, 13 years old, identical twins born on either side of midnight, who have not only different birthdays, but, in a true stroke of fictional genius, different astrological signs. Looking so alike that no one can tell them apart, they are as different as day from night, one friendly and sunny and outgoing, and the other deep, dark and diabolically evil. Their father is dead, their mother imprisoned inside her own creeping madness, and their Russian-born grandmother, Ada, blessed or cursed with the Sight, has a game she likes to play, handed down through generations: put yourself inside something or someone else, and be that person. One of her grandsons learns this game all too well, and Ada, realizing what she has set in motion, is unable to stop the horror that is about to engulf the whole family.The story takes place mostly during a long, lazy Connecticut summer in the 1930's, and as the temperature cools down, the plot heats up. Two-thirds of the way through the book, Tryon divulges the twins' secret that will literally rock the reader in his tracks. You would think the rest of the book would be an anti-climax after this; fasten your seatbelts, because now you're in for a real ride. And hang on tight: Tryon piles one horror on top of another until you wonder if he has anything left in his bag of tricks, and then he pulls it out: a climax that will knock you over. And as if all this wasn't enough, the last page of the book will leave the reader wondering if Tryon was pulling the wool over everyone's eyes and have you guessing for days.Tryon may have been a mediocre actor, but he proved to be an excellent writer as well as a great storyteller. Plot, characters, and writing are just about perfect in this book. Like Stephen King in his earliest and best books, Tryon has the gift of understatement, and he knows how to let the horror build up ever so slowly and insidiously until the reader is totally wrapped up and can't escape. He also has a delightful touch with small but telling period descriptions that set the novel firmly in its time frame (do any older readers recall Mr. Coffee Nerves and Belle Sharmeers?). \\"The Other\\" has been out of print for some time now, but it's finally being re-printed and it's about time. I've treasured mine since the year it was published. It is, quite simply, one of the best suspense/horror stories ever written.Judy Lind"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Like many reviewers of this book, I also read it about 20 years ago, having already fallen in love with Thomas Tryon's writing in Harvest Home. From the first page of The Other, the haunting and insistent voice of the narrator grips you, and you are ineluctably drawn into his strange, isolated world. The story of the twins Niles and Holland, with its psychologically devastating twist in the tail, has haunted me ever since I first read it, and having lost my copy some time ago, I am desperate to find another so that I can read it over and over. A real classic of the genre."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago, while a high school student in Connecticut (Mr. Tryon's birthplace). I never saw the movie because I was afraid &quot;Hollywood&quot; would ruin a perfect story. I have never read a novel since that is as suspenseful or frightening. Please bring this masterpiece back so other generations may enjoy(?) it."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"The anxieties stoked by the rebellion of the baby boomers in the late Sixties (particularly after the Manson Family murders at the end of the decade) gave rise to all kinds of horror fictions and films about evil children in the early part of the next decade; this 1971 atmospheric novel by Thomas Tryon was one of the best, and most influential. You can trace many later developments in horror fiction--particularly Tryon's very flexible use of an informal and dreamlike first-person narrative--to this early book which was a huge bestseller in its day, and is still a marvel for how well it is told and for how efficiently its horrors come ticking along. It is now available in a beautiful re-issue edition from the Centipede Press.Tryon was an extremely handsome Hollywood leading man whose career largely began to bottom out at around the same time the late 60s and early 70s boom in horror was signaled by the Ira Levin novel ROSEMARY'S BABY and its subsequent film adaptation by Roman Polanski. Inspired by that film, Tryon tried his hand at writing a novel based on his childhood memories of rural Connecticut and came up with this finely constructed story of personality transference among a pair of twins living there during the Depression. (The idea of the evil doppelganger goes back to Poe and Dostoevski, of course, but seems quite relevant coming from a gay man who had been living in the public eye in the 60s as a movie star.) The 1973 Richard Mulligan film adaptation, for which Tryon himself wrote the screenplay, has perhaps become today more famous than the novel itself, but the novel is really better, as Ramsey Campbell points out in his brief introduction to this edition: the sense of the drowsy longeurs of summer are stretched out a bit more, and the crucial \\"game\\" that the twins play with their grandma and its connection to the major events of the novel are clarified. This is an excellent example of how finely and intelligently genre fiction can be crafted."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book over 20 years ago and it is a must &quot;re-read&quot; for me annually. Each new reading produces chills: of delight, at how Tryon weaves the story; of horror, as the mystery and tragedy unfolds. Read it closely, for clues to the mysterious horror are scattered throughout the book like the &quot;blue paper-rose petals&quot; which enshroud Niles' secret. Tough to put aside, perfect for those late nights when a summer breeze gives way to a rainstorm."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This book is a reread for me annually. And the first time I read it, I had to immediately read it again to see how Mr. Tryon did it. One of my all time favorite books; please try to get a copy any way you can. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"It's been many many years since I first read THE OTHER. Then saw the film. Was very impressed with both. Would really like to get my hands on a copy of the book in order to re-read it. Recommend to anyone who is interested in the dichotomy of evil."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I really liked this book. One thing I didn&#8217;t realize when I began reading it, is that it&#8217;s an older book. Originally coming out in 1971 it has a mass following. First several people I told I was reading it couldn&#8217;t stop raving about it. That was good to hear. I truly enjoyed how the author concentrated on both brothers and just didn&#8217;t tell us the gory details without how those surrounding the twins reacted and were affected by them.Seeing as how this book was originally written in the early 70&#8242;s, it was the start of authors writing about psychological issues in such a blunt narrative manner. Nowadays many authors take that route. I would suggest 90 percent of them go back and read this book to see how it&#8217;s down correctly.What makes this book so expertly written is his gift for understatement. Sure he can lay out every gory nasty detail for us to get our hands dirty. But he understands that&#8217;s no fun for us. He gives us the freedom of using our minds and work the scene out. We certainly aren&#8217;t passive readers here. This is a great read. If you haven&#8217;t picked it up, or hasn&#8217;t been handed down by friends or family, you must pick this up."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Thomas Tryon's film version (1972) is slightly different from the novel but just as compelling. Watch it for comparision. I had a chance to meet Chris and Marty Udvarnoky soon after filming wrapped up. I'm also a twin and the same age. Their father was my music teacher and introduced us! Sadly, Chris died in October 2010."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"[...]Thomas Tryon was first a move star...and a very talented and good-looking one at that. I remember him well. \\"The Other\\", in my opinion, is truly one of the best horror books ever written. It has been some years since I read it...but I've never forgotten Mr's Tryon's ability to truly capture your attention and keep you guessing what was really going on. His artistic ability as an author is not as well-known as should be. He passed away some time ago...Sadly...for who knows what other wonderful works we may have seen by this great writer and talented actor. If you haven't read this one, and you are a horror fan, you should read it. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I gave this book four stars, instead of five, only because it did progress slowly in parts. Overall it is a great story, spooky, and kept me guessing as to the ending!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I read this book years ago when it was newly published. I passed it around from friend to friend until my copy disappeared. I consider it the best psychological thriller of all. Thanks,Amazon"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"For a while now I've been searching for the horror novel that would scare me witless. This is one of the books that regularly shows up on various lists and discussions of the most frightening novels. It must be said that if you're a mother or grandmother of tween boy(s), then I can imagine some nightmares resulting from this book; however, for me, it just wasn't scary.That said, the book is quite well written, and if the few first-person introductory pages look like red flags for a down-homier-than-thou slog through a painful pastiche of dialect prose, trust that it isn't. The author's style is unusual, perhaps half of the dialogue isn't in quotation marks, which is something I have little tolerance for, yet the author pulls it off quite well. The style feels like a third-person narrative with unintended first-person musings woven through, quite subtly, which is probably exactly what the author was going for.Once the story got rolling, it becomes compelling and engrossing. \\"The Other\\" is a Very Good Novel. If I hadn't been hoping so strongly for goosebumps and being afraid to sleep with the light off, I would have given it five stars.One should note that the book should be approached with lowered expectations of the ferocity and breadth of the violence: Tryon makes no attempt to be graphic or shocking. This novel is more like true crime, where a single, bloodless death is a horrific tragedy. \\"The Other\\" feels real and prosaic; it's not fantastical horror; it's not a slasher novel."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"i read this book many yeawrs ago and decided to buy it again and read it.

This is the most realistic horror novel ever written (I have read it 5 times) and I absolutely love it. There are no devils, aliens, or monsters of any kind, just two psychologicaly messed up kids(which one is the evil one? or is it both?) who play an imagination game that goes horribly out of control, awesome twist ending, this book will keep you riveted for hours on end. Mr. Tryon creates characters that are so true to life you swear you met them before or they really existed at some time. This book is intelligent horror written by a late great author who doesn't suffer from verbal diarrhea like some of the popular present day writers. Harvest Home is another novel written in the early seventies that is just as creepy with a stunning ending, I loved it! If you enjoy The Other here are a few books you might want to look up : Harvest Home-Thomas Tryon, Conjure Wife-Fritz Leiber, The Nightwalker-Thomas Tessier, The Manitou-Graham Masterson, The Godsend-Bernard Taylor, After Sundown-Randall Boyll, The Homing-Jeffrey Campbell, For Fear of the Night-Charles L.

But their lives have been touched with tragedy: their father, killed in an accident; their mother, unable to recover from the shock. Grandmother Ada, Russian-born, has become the backbone of the family. And Grandmother Ada has a game for them to play together, a solace for them in a time of grief. But it is no ordinary game, this. It is one passed down through the blood from generation to generation. And it is through this game of the mind that Ada unwittingly unleashes a psychological horror that consumes everything it touches.THE OTHER is the first of the several novels Tryon wrote before his premature death and, although the novel HARVEST HOME is perhaps more widely remembered, to my mind it is his finest. The plot has been extremely influential, and some readers may recognize various turns from having encountered them at the less talented hands of later writers who shamelessly borrowed Tyron's ideas. But it hardly matters: the prose is absolutely flawless, dreamy, languid, and seductive even as it begins to unravel into a psychological void from which there is no return. It is a rare reader who will not unravel right along with it--and immediately re-read the novel to see how Tyron has so unerringly cast his spell. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Actor-turned novelist Thomas Tryon's first book is one of the best out there. The technique the book uses to creep up on you if very unique. This book is very old (and very out of print..i'd sell my soul before giving up my 1971 first edition with dj) so I hope you can find yourslef a copy, because this is a book that you simply HAVE to read, if you want a good horror story.And now the plot (don't worry, I'm not giving any spoilers):In 1935 12-year old twin boys (Niles and Holland) live on a New England farm. The twins are both very different. Niles is more outgoing and light-hearted, while Holland is shy and hides a lot. Their Russian grandmother Ada has taught them &quot;The Game,&quot; which allows you to be (or at least see from the POV) whatever or whoever you concentrate on. Their mother always stays inside, and their father's rcent death is probably the reason for it. It doesn't take long before a series of murders take place in the peacful town, and it becomes clear that Holland is connected to each of them...to say anything else about the novel would ruin the book. Just remember:Peregrine for Perry.Also, check out the movie: It's excellent."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I saw the movie over twenty years ago. WHile at garage sale, I picked up the book and was bowled over on its ability to scare and disturb me. Mr. Tryon wrote a masterpiece of psychological horror and a horrifying descriptive narrative on the true nature of evil. I am surprised that this work is out of print. With such junk today, works like this only look even better over time. One of the best suspense/horror stories I have read."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"My dad introduced me to the work of Thomas Tryon. A few months ago he found a handful of books up in the garage that he'd read when he was in high school, and some of Tryon's novels were among them. I cooked through Harvest Home and was very impressed with with his masterful descriptions and breathtaking plot twists/revelations. Then I read The Other... I was completely blown away. You can't miss this book. It's a masterpiece. It's not frightening in a slasher, better-look-over-your-shoulder-type way, but the concept will chill you, without a doubt. It's such a good story, and it's executed so well... It's the best book I've read in a very long time. I would recommend it to anyone who is the mood for a good, haunting, thought-provoking piece of literature. My hat is off to Thomas Tryon... I can't wait to get my hands on another one of his works."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"You absolutely must read this book. Your best bet is to obtain a copy through intra-library loan, being that it's out of print. There is not one thing wrong with this book. The narrative is pefectly written, and the story perfectly structured and developed. What kind of horror is this novel? Easy, the book is a spider: it subtly, slowly, and silently creeps upon you, first crawling on your shoulder, and then working it's way down your arm, and before you know it, it's there in your lap, and you shriek as you discover it...too late. I believe the two best horror novels of the 20th century were either The Other, or Blatty's The Exorcist. The Exorcist is more explicit, perverse, and gruesome; The Other is more more quite. It's just a matter of preference as to which you rank the best. Also, be sure to see the film, which was written by Thomas Tryon. The one problem with the film, though is a slow first twenty minutes, but stay with it. It's an injustice to the literary world that this book is out of print. Not only is it probaby the best horror novel ever written, but also one of the all-time best novels. A genuine masterpiece. You must find a copy of it! Period."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"I first read this book when I was in High School and was chilled to the bone! That was nearly 20 years ago and I've not read another like it since. Mr. Tryon pulls you into the twisted hearts and minds of what first appears to be a normal family with twin sons and a loving nanny. Not so! Once I started I couldn't put it down-which left me quite fatigued at school. I have been looking for another copy of the book since, with no luck. If you are fortunate enough to find one-hang on to it and hang on to your spine, what a tingling ride!"},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Thomas Tryon began his career as a novelist after having a fairly successful run as an actor in Hollywood.Tryon is a better author than actor. For that I am truly grateful!The Other (1971) is a gothic horror story that tells the story of twin boys, Niles and Holland Perry, who live on a farm in New England some time during the Depression.Niles and Holland are inseparable. Holland is particularly attached to his Russian-born grandmother who has been forced to helm their family in the aftermath of the twins' father's death and their mother's incapacitation due to shock over trauma she endured. The boys' grandmother is very loving and doting, but Niles isn't as loving as Holland. He likes to play pranks.Tryon broke new ground with The Other. Subsequent authors have come forward and regurgitated and reworked material that Tryon created. None of the others have managed to create the actual horror that Tryon managed.This novel was so wildly popular - an immediate best seller - that it spawned a film of the same name in 1972.It would be unfair and cheating to tell you any more about the plot of this fine book. Rest assured the time you spend reading this will not be time wasted."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Go to a used bookstore. Search the internet. Scour the newsgroups. And find this book. I have never read a novel before nor since that has the power to terrify the way the late Tryon does here. His mastery of sentence structure alone puts him above the vast majority of horror novelists. Simply a sensational piece of work -- and a travesty that it's out of print."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"Author Tom Tryon was a so-so pretty boy actor, mostly famous for his role as THE CARDINAL. He turned out to be a much more gifted horror novelist. THE OTHER is excellent.I read THE OTHER when it first came out in 1971. I was eleven. (I was a precocious reader.) I can't believe that THE OTHER, a very influential novel of its genre, is out of print.I write. I've still to write anything as good as THE OTHER. I enjoy well-written and intelligent horror tales to this day; they are few and far between, and THE OTHER is one of the best. A recent re-reading convinced me of that.A New England tale of twin brothers whose utterly different personalities move freely between their bodies, this novel builds its atmosphere slowly. Never lurid, it merely gives you the very, very uncomfortable feeling that you're being watched . . . by The Other mind inside your own skull.And it takes a while for that feeling to fade."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"What a classically creepy book! Reminiscent of the film, _The Bad Seed_, this story of twins, Niles and Holland, absolutely enraptured me. Despite being written in 1971, it felt modern and had such an ominous atmosphere! It wasn't terribly unpredictable, but more in the way that foreshadowing hints at events than the plot being worn or tired. And, obviously, the twins aspect was a nice twist on the \\"Bad Seed\\"-esque plot. My only real complaint came from the edition that I read - it was a first edition that had not been well cared for - it was very musty and just smelled terrible! Though I suppose that the olfactory horror rather added to the horror found within the pages themselves. I am very curious to see the film version. Honestly, I am surprised that this book isn't better known - the atmosphere, plot and characters all stand out so much from the modern psychological thrillers."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This is your psychological story set in a small New England town.

There have been many, many similar stories since, so I don't think it impacted me as strongly as it would have had I read it then. I kept thinking, they need to get some grief counselors and pscyhologists to help these people--which of course wasn't common in the '70s, and definitely not in the '30s when this story takes place. Still, speaking from 2001, that was my reaction. Everyone seemed so unconcerned about getting to the root of the problem at hand--and allowing a kid a fantasy which few parents would consider harmless in similar circumstances today.Also, the pacing seemed very slow to me--another indication of how popular fiction has changed over the years.King and Koontz scare me more these days, but it was a good read."},{"Title":"The Other","review":"This had such good reviews I had to buy it & read it...

I had a hard time getting into this book, mainly due to the pacing, imo. It just never sucked me in the way a good book usually does.However, Tryon's other novel Harvest Home was a more enjoyable horror novel, maybe give that one a try?

I just thought that was rather coincidental, especially one conversation where one of the people said, \\"I wonder if he's watching us right now.\\"Also, the language throughout the book was, \\"said I\\" and \\"said he\\" and \\"said she.\\" Maybe that's the way they talked back then, I don't know, but I've read other Max Brand books and never noticed it before.But having said that, it was a good story, well told, lots of detail, and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Marbleface","review":"Marbleface (or should I say \\"Pokerface\\"), is a an ex-prize fighter who becomes a fugitive after a failed robbery attempt lands him on the wrong side of the law.

I really enjoyed Marbleface's character and the way he handled all his problems with outward calm and a friendly manner. In particular, I liked the way he found good in just about everyone (including the weasely old colonel) and the Native American scout Butcher, who no one trusted.The narration of this book is top par, and if I have any complaint at all, this book was WAY too short. 5 stars for an excellent read."},{"Title":"Rhythm and Blues In New Orleans","review":"This book is the original and still definitive book on New Orleans rhythm &amp; blues, the music that was the true forerunner of what popularly became rock 'n' roll. As a boy in England, Broven was so thrilled by Little Richard's performance of the song &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot; in the movie DON'T KNOCK THE ROCK that he ran from the matinee showing at his local theatre to buy it before the record store closed. It was only years later that he discovered that Little Richard's hits, like those of his other favorite, Fats Domino (who dominated Louisiana music and rhythm &amp; blues in the 1950s and is appropriately pictured on the cover) were recorded by New Orleans studio musicians who created the backbone of rockin' rhythm &amp; blues. Other musicians featured here include Roy Brown, who popularized the word &quot;rock&quot; in rhythm &amp; blues long before Alan Freed in his 1947 classic &quot;Good Rockin' Tonight&quot; (which like Little Richard and other New Orleans records were significantly covered by Elvis Presley); Aaron Neville, Dave Bartholomew, Lloyd Price, Allen Toussaint and legendary drummer Earl Palmer, the last four of whom have recently been inducted into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame. Similarly to Charlie Gillett's groundbreaking classic THE SOUND OF THE CITY, Broven thoroughly covers the record companies who came to New Orleans to mine the city's musical gold, but he also takes an in-depth look into the musicians which made the city a musical force. RHYTHM &amp; BLUES IN NEW ORLEANS features interviews with many of them, including Mac &quot;Dr. John&quot; Rebennack, whose lengthy reminisces during an English tour inspired the book. It is a must for anyone interested in the history of rhythm &amp; blues, rock 'n' roll, black culture or New Orleans culture."},{"Title":"Rhythm and Blues In New Orleans","review":"I think I have read this book at least 5 times.

Further, the font does not stand out from the page enough and some poems can be difficult to read due to the illustration underneath. White there are a lot of different styles introduced in this book, all of them are formal and somewhat rigid. It could possibly give children the idea that poems have to follow one of these forms and take the fun out of the writing process.Why 3 stars?:Very nice mix of poems, but all are forced and follow typical patterns, which could take the fun out of poetry for many children.

Think germs cause disease? Think that evolution works through survival of the fittest? Think that people are constrained by their DNA? Richard Lewontin, the preeminent Harvard biologist, will cause you to think again.A written-down version of Lewontin's Massey Lectures, the book is eminently readable while carefully hewing to the scientific method. Anyone who loves science will love this book."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"I came across this little book while I was reading a bunch of books about &quot;evolutionary psychology.&quot; Lewontin makes short work of them! He shows so clearly how science is shaped by society, how what we look for affects what we find. He writes concisely and well -- no postmodern gobbledygook."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This book is a semi-postmodernist criticism of a) biological determinism, and b) the widespread belief that scientists are first and foremost seekers of \\"truth\\", rather than furtherers of their own careers. Lewontin takes the argument that there is only so far science can go in explaining humanity, and that one should keep in mind that all scientific claims are convoluted with the power structure from which they arise. I agree with these points, but there's nothing particularly special about them...no serious scientist today would ever suggest that one's personality (let alone all of society) is written in the genetic code, nor dispute that politics often/usually does interfere in the functioning of science as we wish it would be. Lewontin seems to paint scientists with a rather broad brush. Worse, he makes liberal use of the \\"naturalistic fallacy\\" (the idea that what is \\"natural\\" must be \\"good\\" and vice-versa) in much of his reasoning, as when he suggests that Darwinism implies that social inequities are good, necessary, and unavoidable. On top of all this, he fails to notice (or at least to mention) that the door swings both ways, that skepticism about the reach of science (as he seems to advocate) can be used to reinforce unsavory sociopolitical structures just as easily as can unquestioning belief in science. One need only look at Senator James Inhofe, the Discovery Institute, and various other right-wing American institutions to see how the belief that \\"there are just some questions science can't answer\\" can be used to justify all manner of ridiculous and/or dangerous behavior. Most of Lewontin's concerns have (since this book's 1991 publication) been addressed and, in my opinion, refuted by the recent writings of Richard Dawkins and Stephen Pinker. Frankly, I'm surprised this book has stayed in print this long."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"First of all, I have to note: Richard Lewontin has a remarkable propensity for republishing redundant material. Many of the essays in this book are similar - sometimes word-for-word equivalent - to essays published in other Lewontin books, which also tend to be way overpriced.This particular book is an argumentative mess. Lewontin attacks the theory of &quot;biological determinism&quot; (more appropriately called &quot;biological influentialism&quot; since few people think genes alone make the *entire* person) as a way of &quot;legitimating&quot; the modern capitalist status quo (that is, inequality). Where Lewontin is not misunderstanding the sociobiologists' positions, he is somewhat incoherently arguing against them. Indeed, he seems to advocate a sort of environmental determinism - or, at the very least, to utterly condemn suggestions of significant biological influence. His position is far more radical than reality warrants.Lewontin's ideas about &quot;legitimation&quot; fare no better. He complains that sociobiology legitimates inequality, without ever defining why he thinks inequality is so bad. If the readers learns - perhaps through Lewontin's other works - that Lewontin himself is a philosophical Marxist, then the picture snaps into focus. Lewontin's scientific and social conclusions &quot;legitimate&quot; Marxism just as well as, if not better than, sociobiology legitimates capitalism.Lewontin's somewhat screwy ideas about cause and effect deserve some mention too. He at one point describes the tubercle bacillus as a &quot;poor bacterium&quot; (an obvious case of rhetoric if ever there was one), and instead points toward *unregulated 19th-century capitalism* as a cause! (He later refutes his own conclusion by saying that TB was on the decline during the 19th century.) But the main point is that this view conflates cause and effect by saying that the cause of a cause is itself a cause of the effect under consideration. By this logic, we can blame our loss of our car keys on the Big Bang. There comes a point at which it makes sense to observe a causal chain (or net) without trying to come up with a direct link between the first and last elements therein.Lewontin also takes the obligatory stab at a straw-man view of reductionism, which he believes is applied to society in the following way: an aggressive society is made up of aggressive individuals, so Britain's involvement in WWII must have meant that the British people all felt aggressive. Obviously this is foolish, but I can't think of any self-respecting reductionist who would say such silly things. Dawkins has somewhere an example of this sort of silly reductionism: Bach was musical, so he must have been made of musical atoms!The only valuable part of this entire book is the part pointing out that organisms interact with and alter their environments, so humans have no one defined &quot;environment&quot; that radical greens can &quot;save&quot; through conservation efforts. This is a fact that gets lost all too often in environmentalist rhetoric, and it is useful to have it pointed out. I only wish it had been pointed out by someone who didn't also think Marxism was still a valid sociological theory."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"As philosophy of science this work is very fascinating. Unfortunately it is permeated with rather Marxist ideas which the author seems to cherish.

While this would be nice, unfortunatly that is just not the case. Scientists can take a drop of blood and determine if its owner is Asian, African-American, European, Jewish, etc. If there is no such thing as race, then how is this possible?This book was used in a biased anthropology class that I took for my BA. I only bought it because I was forced to."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"Author Lewontin, a Harvard geneticist, presents his case against biological determinism, and for a form of social constructionism. Don't stop reading this review if the first sentence caused your eyes to glaze over. You don't need to understand those terms. RCL is simply saying that our social environment is more important than our genetic structure.And, no, this book is not about Marxist ideas as one reviewer wrote. One is not a marxist because one supports environmental affects on society. He is not spouting Marxism when he suggests that society is responsible for many diseases, and not microbes. Tuberculosis had greatly declined by the early twentieth century, not because of vaccination, but because living conditions and nutrition had improved. The ultimate cause of some cancers is not so much the proximate cause of pollution, but the society that has decided that pollution in the air is acceptable in furthering our society.Our society is not based on the total genetic activity of its members. First of all there aren't enough genes to begin to determine the billions of circuits in the brain, many of which aren't constructed until after birth. We become individuals in a society. The two most common ways in which children are similar to their parents relate to religion and politics. Are we then to say that there is a Baptist gene, or a Republican gene?Lewontin believes that the genome project(s) will not fulfill the promises currently being made. His social constructionist beliefs (that science is culturally determined) must be given some credence when he states that no prominent geneticist of his acquaintance is free of a financial interest in these projects. We also cannot assume that mapping the genome of an individual will result in a set of genes that we can accept as a normal reference. You, the reader, and I may be very normal human beings, but our genes differ by about 3 million nucleotides.The author also states that organisms create their environment; they do not react passively to their surroundings. There is no such thing as a environmental balance he says. 99.99% of all beings that existed are now extinct. The environment has always been in a state of continual flux. He points out that many organisms have had a negative effect on the environment. The beaver, for example, is notorious for its destruction of its surroundings.A very thought provoking book. I read it through twice which was easy to do because of its 128 page length. You do not need to accept all of his ideas, but he sure stimulates your neurons to form some new connections."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This book is exactly what the title implies - a treatise on how many people in the scientific community (including physical and social science) and in the general public have come to regard biology, or more specifically DNA, as The Answer. Just as religion had The Answer in previous ages, so now, we &quot;know&quot; that all the answers lie in understanding our DNA. This has spread to all aspects of human society, from justification of our capitalist monetary system to modern medicine. To emphasise the point, a quote from the text: &quot;[An] editor of Science, what asked why the Human Genome Project funds should not be given instead to the homeless, answered, 'What these people don't realise is that the homeless are impaired.... Indeed, no group would benefit more from the application of human genetics.'&quot;This is a chilling statement, and we're fortunate to have books like these pointing out the ethical and scientific problems in such pronouncements. Prof. Lewontin debunks the myth that DNA is the be all and end all. In a wide ranging series of essays, he attacks the claims of the Human Genome Project scientists (I want to point out that he does not attack the science itself, which is fine, simply the rationale in doing it) and others who are trying to find a panacea in understanding genetics. He argues that while DNA is important, it does not define what it means to be human, any more than a pile of bricks defines a house, and it certainly can't be used to justify capitalism, fascism, or anarchical government systems, as claimed by some political philosophers. Or that people are homeless because they have defective DNA.There are two minor points that I must make objection to. The first is that he seems to imply that scientists (specifically, those working on the human genome) make wild claims as to how much their research will benefit mankind, and society is duped into believing them. While this is undoubtedly the case some of the time, in my experience, the media often exaggerate the claims of scientists to make a better story. &quot;This project will help us understand cancer better, and will lead to better treatments&quot; becomes &quot;Cause of cancer discovered!&quot; Lewontin tends to blame the scientist entirely for these grandiose claims. Secondly, I believe basic research is valuable, thus the Genome Project is important, something Lewontin doesn't seem to want to admit.Those two points aside, however, this is an interesting and important book, if a little one-sided. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"Despite some shortcomings, I was thoroughly impressed by this book that I read it two times in a row. I also chose to base a school project on it. I am quite convinced that \\"Biology as Ideology\\" might actually have been one of the most important books of the previous century (Yes, I mentioned this in my project). And although it is atypical of me to comment on other people's reviews, some things just warrant correction. Contrary to what one reviewer said, Lewontin never once suggests that \\"there is no such thing as race\\" in this book. And although Lewontin has a thing or to two to say about reductionism - - he does not completely resent it. He talks about an ideal view \\"that sees the entire world neither as an indissoluble whole, or as isolated bits and pieces\\". It's easy to miss this message because Lewontin does tend to have a propensity for veering off-topic once in a while. I also don't think that it's far-fetched at all to call Lewontin a Marxist. Although he only mentions Karl Marx once in this book, most of his views on society strongly cohere with Marx's.In our world today, any product of science is claimed and treated as a universal truth. Lewontin encourages the reader not to be mystified by science (don't just leave it to the experts!) And science has never been as \\"objective\\" and \\"nonpolitical\\" as it claims because it's a product of society. Scientists will view nature through lens molded by social experience.I thought it daring (and brave) that Lewontin - a luminary in the study of genetics today - should question Darwin's \\"natural selection\\", and see more sense in Lamarck's inheritance of acquired characteristics. This book is good because it makes you observe the other side of things. It makes you think.Perhaps the most excellent point made by Lewontin in his book is that of biological determinism as a way of social legitimization. Biological determinism has been used to explain and justify the inequalities within and between societies and to claim that those inequalities can never be changed. We are being taught that there is genetic differentiation between racial groups in characteristics such as behavior, temperament, and intelligence. We are also being taught that people's genes are connected to things like unemployment, eroticism, dominance, poverty, and homelessness. It really getting ridiculous! There is too much power being blunderingly put on the DNA molecule.I however, disagree with Lewontin that the genome project was a waste of time and billions. It has helped not only consolidate the theory of evolution...but it has also helped in areas like systematics, phylogeny, and taxonomy. Another shortcoming is that Lewontin's book is more than a decade old - many discoveries and advancements have occurred since then in molecular genetics."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"The chief thing that this book revealed is how deeply and dishonestly political much of the so-called present day research into such glamor- and profit-making areas as the genome project really is. The book is only a sketch because of the format : scripts for radio broadcasts, but Lewontin manages to provide for non-scentists like myself a series of wonderful insights into the way that social, cultural and much more important, political forces shape the conduct of that research. The science students at the college where I taught for 30 years know very little about all this, and yet it is crucial. The political values have become domesticate and are all but invisible. And if Lewontin is wrong it is imporetant for students to understand why. There is a distinction between honest science, to which neither the author nor I have any objection. What needs to be pointed out is all the self-serving humbug from the pharmaceutical companies (with the aid of government agencies) use to achieve their ends. Lewontin does that. The wonder is that he is so mild about it. It is one of the most disturbing symptoms of rampant capitalism and it needs to questioned at every turn. His account of the complexity of genome research and of the impossibility of finding THE genetic cause for such things as cancer and (lord help us!) &quot;aggresssion&quot; is very judiciously argued. A really splendid introduction to an important topic."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"Dick did it again. Richard &quot;Dick&quot; Lewontin, one of the most esteemed (or hated, depending on the viewpoint) geneticists of our era has written yet another controversial, highly readable, and thoroughly enjoyable, book. A booklet, to be sure, fruit of a series of radio broadcasts for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. It is an agile group of six chapters, spanning a mere 128 pages including a scanty bibliography. But you're in for an intense if short intellectual ride that you won't easily forget. Lewontin starts with a very wide brush, asking nothing less than the fundamental question: what is science? He begins with a theme dear to him and brought to the forefront of modern philosophy by the classical book of Thomas Kuhn about scientific revolutions: science is always a product of the society that generates it, and therefore that society needs to be understood and considered in order to comprehend both science's progress and mistakes. According to Lewontin, science has two functions: 1. It allows us to manipulate the world; 2. It provides an explanation for the world. Obviously, the two are related to some extent (you can hardly manipulate - at least safely and successfully - something which you don't understand, or not?). Nevertheless they are in principle, and often enough in practice, distinct. But not necessarily in the sense you might think. Lewontin makes the interesting and provocative argument that some major progress in applied science is made without the corresponding understanding of the underlying principles, in flagrant opposition to what most scientists (and your high school teacher) would tell you. For example, we obtained better and better varieties of crop plants literally centuries ahead of any scientific understanding of the principles of heredity and the birth of modern genetics. Nevertheless, modern applied genetics gets its legitimation from the impressive body of knowledge we have accumulated about the way cells, chromosomes, and DNA works. Lewontin's almost subversive conclusions stemming from this premise is that modern science has taken over the role that used to be the realm of institutionalized religion throughout antiquity and the middle ages. Scientists, like modern priests, endorse the status quo of modern society, being able to reassure the public that things are going well on the basis of the fact that science does have a tremendous explanatory power, very much like religion use to (in other words, we know what we're talking about...). And here is where the problem lies, according to Lewontin: see, you (science) can't be at the same time claiming to represent a universal truth that transcends human society and be a result of that very society. To put it into another fashion, you can't have the cake and eat it too! Now, before you start seeing every scientist as a member of a secret society of conspirators devoted to the ultimate control of the planet and unleash your James Bonds on every campus, beware. Lewontin clearly states that most, if not every, scientist, are not actually conscious of the role they have and the power they excercise, in the same way in which priests and cardinals defended the status quo during the Inquisition because they really believed they were the repository for the only universal truth, not because they conspired in the labyrinths of the Vatican... (this notwithstanding what some Americans might think of the Pope). What are the foundations of such a tremendously effective tool such as modern science? There are two that clearly stand out according to the author: reductionism and the clear distinction between cause and effect. Reductionism, which basically traces back to the writings of the 17th century French philosopher Rene\` Descartes, is the assumption that complex systems can be understood entirely in terms of their minutest components. As Lewontin puts it, societies are the result of individuals, not viceversa. Think about it, it requires a bit of intellectual effort to see the point that in fact the relationship between societies and individuals is a dialectical one, a perennial chicken and egg process. But when you do the gestaltic switch, it really grows on you... The clear relationship between cause and effect is epitomized by the classical assumption in evolutionary biology that organisms &quot;respond&quot; to the environment, as if they were not part and creator of their own environment. The environment is supposed to be the cause of evolution, and the change that occurs in populations and species is the effect of these pressures. But, as we know now, the environment itself can be greatly affected by organisms. And I'm not thinking of relatively recent phenomena such as human-induced global warming. If you're breathing oxygen today, this is entirely because some microscopic relative of modern algae &quot;invented&quot; photosynthesis a couple of billion years ago. The world didn't know free oxygen up to that point, but it just so happens that the precious substance is a &quot;waste&quot; byproduct of the reactions that make up the process of photosynthesis, the major way of making a living for most algae and plants. The alternative to this mechanistic worldview, of course, is known as holism. But this word has very negative connotations, which are intertwined with mysticism and irrational beliefs. And here is the challenge that Lewontin and some of his colleagues - chiefly Stephen Jay Gould, also at Harvard - have faced for most of their active lives as scientists. How to debunk reductionism without falling into a vague and fruitless alternative; how to retain the power of scientific inquiry while acknowledging its limits; how to maintain the public confidence of science's power while asking them to keep an eye on the assumptions that scientists make about the world. I'm afraid you'll have to read the book to know the rest; hopefully, the above ranting has at least tickled your intellect enough to do just that. And I can guarantee you that your view of the world would be changed forever... or maybe not."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"If you are looking for a clear and critical overview of modern genetics research, one which cuts through all the hype and misinformation, then read this book. Lewontin, a Harvard University geneticist and skeptic, has collated six of his radio lectures given to increase public understanding of what research programmes like the Human Genome Project really mean. The Genome Project is a vast undertaking which aims to map every single gene in the human body. Claims, even by the experts, about what this will mean for humanity have been superlative to say the least. Medicine will essentially cease to exist since it will be far better to fix the gene causing a disorder than to prescribe drugs for it. Currently incurable diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, Huntington's and almost any other you care to mention will become curable. Cosmetic gene-replacement therapy for poor eye sight, hearing loss, and baldness are possible, and even social problems such as violent crime, alcoholism, and anti-social behaviour can be treated just as soon as we localise the relevant genes - or so the story goes. Lewontin dispels two myths central to the Human Genome Project and the gene-replacement paradigm. First the relationship between genes and disease is just not that simple, and second, there is no evidence whatever that every human ill has a corresponding gene or set of genes anyway.The potential of the Human Genome Project to better our lives is substantial, but it is certainly no panacea. We must be aware of the risks and limitations as well as the benefits of any new technology, especially one which acts directly on the genes which make us all who we are."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This book will cause you to think in new ways, even if you don't agree with the author. Lewontin's main point is that despite the fact we think science is an objective discipline, its questions topics considered worth researching are in fact biased by the culture in which we live. It's an interesting concept to ponder for those interested in philosophy, science, or the philosophy of science."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This, intellectual tornado, with its incisive and biting logic and its eloquent, economic and clear style, rips through all the trees of the scientific forest -- especially those used as its primary unstated skeletal backbone: the structure of often vulgar, sometimes illogical, but always erroneous and well-hidden, built-in assumptions.Included in this list is the Holy Grail of them all: the reductionist hypothesis that only discrete atomic elements matter; the equally false idea (most popularly exposed by T.S. Khun) that science is somehow above politics and ideology; and the worse of the offenders: the false dichotomies between \\"cause and effect\\" and between \\"nature and nurture.\\"In this menu, in which the intellectual cup runneth over, the author does not just take a swipe at them all, but gores them by running a level four tornado right through their hearts. When he is finished not a tree in the false underbelly of science is left standing, not a false hidden assumption left without being up-rooted: all the hidden assumptions are exposed, and the emperor is found to have no clothes; humpty-dumpty is knocked cleanly off the wall.Since this CBC honor lecture, the \\"Ideology of Biology\\" will never again be the same because Dr. Lewontin has shook it at its very foundation and it has been found wanting: its soft, often intentional underbelly, finally has been exposed and left on the intellectual trash heap of history for future students and scholars to sort out and to assess the damage, and to try and put Humpty-dumpty together again.Whatever that assessment may be, the pseudo-science of genetic and biological determinism, whose poison continues to wreak havoc in American society, even six decades after Adolph Hitler, will never be the same again. Fifty stars"},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"Some interesting and original points are made but the factual and interpretational flaws many times outweigh the insights. Lewontin attributes an exaggerated ideological influence on the scientific community (possibly concluding from his own strong political nature). This review reads as a critique of the representative points:Lewontin writes, \\"What Darwin did was take early 19th century political economy and expand it to include all of natural economy\\" (p.10). However, while it is well known that Darwin was impressed by Malthus' reasoning on geometrical increase of populations, this does not imply he adopted or expanded on the social, ethical or executive conclusions of some form of capitalist economy. As Darwin wrote somewhere, \\"It is not the strongest nor even the most intelligent species that will survive, but those most responsive to change.\\" Perhaps Lewontin feels some resentment as he writes in the same paragraph: \\"Darwin... earned his living from investment in shares he followed daily...\\".When portraying the biological world view, Lewontin writes \\"Genes make individuals and individuals make society, and so genes make society. If one society is different from another, that is because the genes...\\"(p.14)This is evidently a caricature of the 'Dawkins' point of view. There clearly different forms of governance and economic systems that humans can create, which still conform to their basic natures, even if this nature is genetically influenced and shared.Lewontin writes \\"There is at present no convincing measure of the roles of genes in influencing human behavioral variation.\\"(p.33, where he also discusses IQ and twin studies) and \\"we know nothing about the heritability of human temperamental and intellectual traits.\\"(p.96). However, that seems to be an ill-informed reading of the evidence, even for the time the book was written, early 1990's.Lewontin writes, \\"Sociobiology is the latest and most mystified attempt to convince people that human life is pretty much what it has to be and perhaps even ought to be.\\"(p.89) It seems he has fallen here onto the 'naturalistic fallacy' and I don't think even E.O Wilson alluded to that in his writings.Lewontin continues, \\"Sociobiological theory claims that all human beings share genes for aggression, for xenophobia, for male dominance, and so on. But if we all share these genes, if evolution has made us all alike in this human nature, then in principle there would be no way to investigate the heritability of those traits... (but) if there is variation then on what basis... is (this) universal human nature.\\" But has Lewontin not contemplated the logical possibility that we share genes that differentially affect measures of tendencies for these traits, with small variation relative to their mean?The next point concerns one hot button: \\"It must be remembered that the nonreproductive homosexuals must help their brothers and sisters so well that those relatives have twice as many offspring as usual...\\"(p.103)But what about the other, more reasonable possibility, that a homosexuality related gene (if indeed exists) may confer some (health) benefit on its bearers in the feminine line, and thus statistically avoid extinction (like the sickle-cell advantage to malaria) ? It doesn't have to do with kin selection.And finally, \\"The most famous theory of evolution before Darwin was... Lamarck... Darwin completely rejected this world-view and replaced it with one in which organisms and environment were completely separated\\"(p.108) However, it is now known that Darwin himself subscribed to some Lamarckian processes."},{"Title":"Biology as Ideology: The Doctrine of DNA","review":"This was a great read about the utter (and often unfounded) confidence that modern society places on the institutions of &quot;biology&quot; and &quot;science.&quot; Since it's patched together from a lecture series and a book review, the text can be a little repetitive and disjointed from chapter to chapter.

I laughed out loud more than I expected. It reminded me of the old TV series: Mrs. Mueller's Ghost, where the ghost turned up to the annoyance of the main character at the most inopportune times. The relationship between the Emily and the ghost, the great divide of their time periods, and their cross purposes, allowed for some humorous moments. Ms. Stockenberg is adept at creating likeable characters, and I found myself looking forward to every chapter. I hope to enjoy more of her novels."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"Very easy yet captivating reading. I couldn't put it down. Perfect book for a weekend. I never really liked ghosts stories, now I can't wait to read another one."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"I am still reading this but I want to let everyone know what a great book this is! It is a romance and a ghost story--two of my favorite things--and laugh-out-loud funny in places. It is something a bit different as it crosses genres."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"This was a different type of book for me from this author. The heroine Emily is a reporter that in her quest to expose a US Senator as being \\"unstable\\", suddenly gets stuck with a ghost that follows her home. The story is entertaining, and has very good moments. I was kind of surprised about her relatively easy access to a US Senator- Lee. They develop a relationship that eventually leads into love. An interesting triangle between Emily, Lee and the ghost. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"This book was so bad. I started it months ago but couldn't get past the first 10 pages. I've not read any of the author's other work, but the writing in this is painful. I picked it up again last week, part of a goal to finish books I buy, but I just can't do it. I made it 3/4 of the way through (76% on my kindle) and couldn't take another page.This story is way too ambitious for a writer of Stockenberg's ability. A love triangle, a murder mystery, multiple key settings, a journalist's struggles, and supernatural stuff...she just couldn't put it together in a way that flowed. She didn't develop the romantic relationships; suddenly she's in love with someone, and he's in love with her, but I had no idea how it happened. This was especially the case with Fergus. Either develop a story and explain how the love happens, or introduce it as fated love. You have to do one of these things.There are a ton of points where the story could have started to wrap up but I would look at my page count and realize I was only half way in. It just dragged and dragged. I feel like the print version would be 500 pages. The \\"romantic\\" scenes are embarrassing and not sexy, the description is too cumbersome.Also, the formatting on the kindle version is flawed: I had to enlarge my text to a ridiculous amount just to be able to see the print, and parts of pages would disappear.I assume that if you want to read a love story about a ghost and a mystery than you are looking for a light read. This is not it. It is a waste of time and you'd be better off looking elsewhere."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"Just didn't care for this story.

As a result, she unwittingly taking home the ghost of a wrongly executed man named Fergus who demands that she use her powers of the press to prove his innocence and clear his name - a century after the fact! As Fergus hilariously becomes acquainted with modern life (especially television!) , he and Emily begin to develop deep feelings towards each other, seriously complicating her blossoming romantic relationship with the senator she set out to investigate! This book has it all - humor, romance, a great sense of local flavor (action takes place around Boston and in Martha's Vineyard), history, mystery, the paranormal and more. My only complaint? That Fergus is such an interesting and appealing character that he makes Emily's wealthy, handsome young senator look like a wimp in comparison, although that's where the sexual tension comes from. On the whole, an excellen read. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"Emily's Ghost","review":"This was my first Stockenberg and WOW!

I'd never read anything by this author before, so hadn't gone into it with any great expectations. I was pleasantly surprised that I didn't want to put it down once I got started. I chose the book because I wanted to see how this author handled the subject of ghostly love. I was impressed with her depiction of the ghost, Fergus, and how the protagonist, Emily, would deal with her developing feelings for him.I also quite enjoyed the developing love story between Emily and her human suitor, Lee. I thought she played the scenes well, used snappy dialoge, and made the characters believable and easy to relate to. It was a unique love triangle and I enjoyed every minute of it.

There are two sets of detailed instructions for each pricking, one with a simpler execution and one with a Milanese lace technique. I also saw some evidence of Withoff techniques being used. The instuctions are written out with a small annotated version of the pricking to note strategic points in the execution. It does not use the color coded graphs found in many continental books.The book is divided into 3 sections, the alphabet, variations on the alphabet prickings and techniques. The variations section does encourage the reader to think about designing lace.If there is a downside to this book, it is the small print and diagrams. The instructions for the letters are fairly continuous with photographs of the lace every few pages. While I have not worked from this book yet, I suspect that it would be fairly easy to get confused on which set of instructions are being used since there can be more than one on a page. A trip to the copy machine might help on this.I also feel that while the instructions are extensive, this might not be the best book for a beginner who has only worked with Torchon lace. Silk threads are recommended as well as several colors for each pricking. Unless the beginner is very determined, it could be a frustrating experience. A little experience with silk or colored thread will be an advantage.What I do like about the book is that the prickings are small and should not take long to make. I am looking forward to trying some of these for Milanese samples since they will go very fast."},{"Title":"Alphabet Inspirations in Colored Bobbin Lace","review":"I am very pleased with this book.

It does so in what I would call, pure history book style, or 'just the facts please'. I did find it to be VERY informative after reading for years on the US space program to hear how the soviet program was actually done was a real eye opener for sure and it will keep you going for that next page/chapter in that respect. What it was lacking though was the story side. I had expected more on the missions themselves, more on the events that had occurred during the missions, how they were solved, etc. 95% of the book covers the developement of the vehicles and the in-fighting of the soviet space program and it's personalities, not very much on the actual development and any issues that would arise during. It was the ICBM program that kept the soviet space program alive during these times and much of the book is devoted to this. I was expecting more a book on the soviet space program, it's missions, and the people involved including more on the cosmonauts and the race with the US.If you are looking for an easier, more back-story type read on the soviet space program, this is not for you. If you are heavily into the space program and it's total history, this will definitely fit the bill there."},{"Title":"Reckless: A Teenage Love Story (An Avon Flare Book)","review":"I read this book because it was a requirement in my college lit class.

Well worth the read."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"A powerful little book, The Purity Principle addresses the issue that seems to take so many Christian men out of the race - lust. Alcorn addresses the issue at its root - a battle for the mind. In fact, the purity principle itself is simply stated: Purity is always smart; impurity is always stupid!Alcorn makes the argument that if Christians thought differently, they would act differently - the problem is with our thinking - we haven't given our minds over to the Lordship of Christ because we want to maintain control of that area of our lives. But, Alcorn warns, we must be careful because the lure of sex is so powerful, not many can resist its tempting call on their own absent the power of God. Learning to control yourself is more an exercise of understand who really controls your decisions - and if you are a follower of Christ, then you need to learn that your body is not your own, that you've been bought with a price. The process of renewing our minds, then, is a daily practice for believers - to sanctify our minds, set it apart for the Lord's service, filled with God's Word - that is a mind that is armed and prepared for the attacks of this world!Alcorn also goes on to state that \\"it's always easier to avoid temptation than to resist it.\\" He gives several practical suggestions for avoiding those various temptations - including the Internet and TV. This chapter is interesting - while I agree in principle, one has to balance the concept that the battle truly is in the mind and that the believer needs to be able to remain in the world for the glory of God, but yet not be of the world taken captive by its vain philosophies. So, to those who say that you can't be on the Internet or watch TV, I may in fact disagree - within appropriate boundaries, of course.The Purity Principle is a good read, short and simple in its delivery, but still a very good read."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"This book will change your perspective of how you treat woman and vice versa.

It also brings out the victory we can have over lust that comes by Jesus Christ. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"Randy Alcorn has written a few great booklets that are around 100 pages long. The Purity Principle is one of them. The Purity Principle is quite simple: \\"Purity is always smart, impurity is always stupid\\". If we know what is best for us then we will passionately pursue purity. The first part of this book attempts to prove the purity principle. The second part of the book gets practical and puts into place wise strategies for pursuing purity.What I Liked:This book is well written, it is short, it is to the point, it is deeply biblical, and greatly convicting. Even if you think you are passionately pursuing purity this book will challenge you to go a step further. Alcorn speaks boldly and wisely throughout. The strategies in this book are not legalistic tips or merely unhelpful theories, they are real and they are practical. But there is only one caveat...What I Disliked:I wish Alcorn would have inserted a chapter about the resurrection power of Jesus in our lives. Because of what Christ has done we have the power within us to conquer this battle. I know that Alcorn would agree with that, I just wish he would have laid a foundation towards the beginning. He starts towards that when he says, \\"when my thirst for joy is satisfied by Christ, sin becomes unattractive\\". But, I wish he would have taken it a step further and dedicated a chapter to encouraging those that feel ridiculously defeated by this particular sin. Again, he says these things in a few places (see page 60)--I just think the reader would be better served having a deliberate chapter. Nonetheless...Should You Buy It?Absolutely. If you have a heartbeat, you are a guy, you are a girl, you know a guy, you know a girl, then you need to buy this book and read it. There is a helpful chapter for singles. There is a helpful chapter for parents."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"This is a great resource for victorious living!

I got copies for my family to help encourage them as they are getting ready to enter the \\"dating\\" stage of their lives to help them stay on course and help give them the tools to save themselves for marriage as God intended.

The other downside that I found is the author is at some points biased and radical in his thoughts.

It's quick and you can easily read it in an hour and a half, but it's amazing. Once I opened it up, I couldn't put it down again.Randy Alcorn starts out by talking about why sexual purity is important and why it matters to you and to me. He then explains Biblical principles for how to fight sexual temptation, including an excellent chapter about being radical in order to fight sexual sins. He concludes with practical guidelines about sexual temptation.As a believer who is daily struggling with sexual temptation, I really wish someone had told me about this book back when I was in high school or middle school because it would have saved me a ton of grief later on in life. This book should be required reading for every teenager and every young adult. It's freeing, and it's life-changing."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"This is a great little book on purity. I read it in an hour and couldn't put it down. \\"The Purity Principle\\" gets \\"in your face\\" on the issue of sexual purity, speaking directly, but not inappropriately about the slippery slope that is sexual sin and practical ways to combat it. The engaging message was so vivid and powerful that I immediately ordered two additional copies so that each of my sons could have their own.My one reservation about this book is that it does not give enough help and hope to the person who has already seriously fallen and needs help getting on the right track. I am concerned that such a person, rather than seeing the power of a gracious God to restore them, might feel that they are too far gone for a meaningful recovery after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"Most Christians would look at this book and think, \\"Hmm, I'm okay, why would I need a book like this?\\" If that's your attitude, then perhaps you should take a couple of hours and read this short, but powerful treatment of a critical Christian subject.Randy Alcorn doesn't just deliver a screaming screed, but a thorough examination of the reasons for purity and the keys for achieving it. Its not a call to prudishness or legalism. He's not laying out a new set of do's and don't.Instead, Alcorn takes Scripture and firmly weaves together a portrait of purity and why Christians must work so hard to maintain it in their lives.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to Christians of all ages, expecially those who are serious about getting all they can out of their years on this earth."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"What a great book! It is short and to the point about sexual sin. A quick read. It discusses it in a very honest but tasteful manner. It provides plenty of scripture. It convicts the reader regardless of how much sexual sin is in their life (mental or physical) and gives practicle and biblical strategies to either avoid it all together or to combat the sin that the reader might already be ensnared in. This book is good for men AND women, high school age and above! Great resource for pastors and youth pastors to have on hand. This book has given me a realistic perspective and has helped me to understand that where it all starts is with that first thought or that first glance...and that this is where we recognize it as sin and stop the process. Life changing!"},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"When it comes to Christian purity books, there seem to be two categories: The impure \\"purity\\" books, and the fluffy purity books.Since the first group believes \\"knowledge is power,\\" the aim is to inform the reader in great detail about every kind of impurity on the market. Rather than being equipped to deal with living in our sex-saturated culture, though, the reader only comes away with step-by-step instructions of what not to do. It's about as affective as an anti-drug campaign that teaches kids how to make homemade narcotics.On the other side of the purity books scale, the goal is to show how romantic purity can be, rather than how painful, devastating and destructive impurity always is. They promise their readers a \\"happily ever after\\" if they'll just follow God's plan for their love life and relationships. Purity then, sadly, becomes a means to an end - a happy marriage and romantic bliss - rather than the pursuit of God Himself ... a life of holiness.To my surprise and delight, Randy Alcon's book The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails falls into neither of these two common categories.The Purity Principle is a small book, but it packs a punch. Chock full of Bible verses, real-life examples, and sound biblical advice, it answers questions like, \\"What exactly is purity?\\" and \\"Why does it even matter?\\" This is a wonderful book for older teens and adults of any age, and any relational status, who would like to gain a better understanding of what biblical purity is, and why it's important.Much like the book of Proverbs, instead of giving you the lowdown on what not to do, or painting an overly romanticized, fluffy picture of purity, Randy Alcorn removes the glimmer of sexual immorality by sharing the real-life stories of men and women who fell into sin by slowly choosing to walk down the wrong road - one small, fatal step at a time.The Purity Principle shows how the fear of God and the consequences of disobeying His holy law should be what \\"drives the sense into us\\" rather than out. And how this fear of God should be what makes us alert, diligent, watchful and drastic when it comes to protecting our own purity and making sure we don't allow even a hint of sexual immorality into our own lives.Because The Purity Principle doesn't take a let-me-tell-you-what-not-to-do approach to purity, and it's biblically solid, it could be a helpful book for someone who's currently struggling with issues of morality, while still being an excellent choice for someone who wants to learn how to safeguard their life so they don't find themselves needing to do an about-face later.Recommended Age: 16+"},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"I do a LOT of reading, and this book is second only to the Bible in the way it deals clearly and succinctly with the subject of sexual purity. This title is a good one to keep handy, especially for men, in this day-and-age of slipping sexual morality. Alcorn addresses Biblical sexual conduct (and lack of it) in a frank yet tasteful manner. This book is an excellent investment towards the reader achieving and maintaining sexual purity. It's definitely a keeper!"},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"A 90 page book that pulls no punches. It asks the tough questions and asks us to look at our life and our sexual purity. From the male perspective no matter if you are young or old, single, dating, married, divorced or whatever. In a way it is a quick read but at least for me... made me think alot about the little things that I let slide or try to rationalize so in that I don't have to deal with those situations or issues.

The 1st time I read this book it had a dramactic effect on my life. I have probably read it about 10 times(that's one advantage of it being short!). The one thing I really liked about this book, compared to another book that I really like, is that it doesn't over think every temptation by saying we have to have the right motives in overcoming it. You just do whatever it takes to get away from the temptation, even if its not super spiritual (like run). I found the book very practical and also had a lot of common sense. Sexual sins must be avoided at all costs because they are so enslaving. It's one of the few sins that you can get a \\"high\\" from, just from the confines of your thoughts. Great book, and inspiring in the battle for purity."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"Randy Alcorn is a well-known Christian author and speaker. He has written over 30 books which include both fiction and non-fiction. He is the founder and director of Eternal Perspectives Ministries (EPM) through which he has ministered to people in many countries. Prior to founding EPM Alcorn was a pastor for 13 years in the state of Oregon.Much like the name of his ministry, in \\"The Purity Principle\\" (TPP), Alcorn seeks to address sexual purity from an eternal perspective. That is, from a biblical, godly perspective. Alcorn addresses this topic using stories of people who have struggled with sexual purity as well as those who have fallen into sexual deviancy. He addresses these stories of sexual sin and temptation with Scripture while sharing personal stories of his own struggles and temptation with sexual impurity.TPP does not side steps sexual purity issues, but addresses them head on. It is a book in which the author deals directly with sexual issues including pornography, masturbation, singleness and marital fidelity. While these issues are addressed scripturally, Alcorn's strength is in the practical advice he offers for dealing with sexual temptation in order to avoid sexual sin. Chapters 1 - 5 lay out the real life problems and effects of sexual sin and show the reader how to think about it from God's perspective. Chapter 5 transitions into practical strategies the reader can use to avoid sexual sin which is spelled out in the last half of the book in chapters 6 - 10 with chapter 11 offering a conclusion. Provided below is a chapter by chapter summary followed by brief concluding thoughts on the books strengths and weaknesses.Chapter one begins with a story of adultery and blame. In this chapter Alcorn takes the reader through various life stories showing how poor choices regarding sex have lead to serious life changing consequences. These life changing consequences involved people from church going families. The examples Alcorn gives show that no one, regardless of background, is above falling into sexual sin. This chapter clearly expresses the seriousness of sexual sin and that there are consequences even though God still offers forgiveness.In Chapter two, Alcorn writes about self-interest. He states that the people in the stories from chapter one thought they were acting out of \\"their own best self-interests\\" when following their lusts (15). Alcorn goes on to explain that such actions are actually against one's self-interest in light of being against God's commands and holiness. God desires purity not impurity and His standard is perfect. Throughout this chapter Alcorn expresses his views on obedience and disobedience toward God in the realm of purity. Obedience is measured \\"not by its virtue, but by its wisdom\\" (18). The bottom line is that choosing purity is wise while choosing impurity is foolish. Alcorn finishes the chapter with the idea that one is either punished or rewarded based on their pursuit of impurity or purity, respectively.The next chapter gives a biblical overview of sex. Sex was created by God as a good thing (26) yet when abused may be turn into a great evil (27). Alcorn explains the boundaries of sex as set by God and that God's will is for sexual purity.In Chapter four, Alcorn explains how Satan is out to get Christians and that Christians are at risk of his attacks. The author gives more examples of Christians who have fallen into temptation. He also shares personal stories of facing temptation. His point is that all are susceptible to sexual sin and that Christians do fall into it. He explains the importance of identifying Satan's lies because \\"temptations always look good\\" (37). Alcorn posits that Christians must find fulfillment in Christ rather than sexual temptations.Chapter five is a transition chapter. Alcorn shares another story about someone who has given into temptation and explains that lust comes from one's own heart. The author provides Scriptural evidence that the origin of lust is internal and not external as the \\"Pharisees emphasized\\" (42). Alcorn puts forward that a Christian must guard his or her thoughts to help fight sexual temptation. Christians \\"need to set mental boundaries\\" in order to protect purity (43). The author then begins to transition into offering practical daily steps Christians can use to protect themselves against sexual temptation. For example, he suggests making a \\"covenant with your eyes\\" (48).Chapter six offers more practical advice as its title, \\"Wise Strategies\\" suggests (50). Alcorn presents several strategies for dealing with sexual temptations. The \\"most basic strategy\\" is that one must run from temptation (52). Alcorn gives several Scripture quotes that deal with fleeing from temptation and even suggests anticipating it. A very important approach Alcorn gives is Scripture memorization and prayer. He encourages Christians to \\"never underestimate Christ\\" and to live in His victory over sin (60).Chapter seven opens with an illustration that ends up pointing to a popular box office hit which makes a powerful point of how prevalent and acceptable sex is in everyday life. This particular illustration should make any Christian question what they view on a daily basis. Alcorn sets the stage to explain how the enemy tries to \\"normalize evil\\" (61). In order to combat such normalized evil Alcorn charges that Christians need to take Jesus seriously and \\"think far more radically about sexual purity\\" (64). The rest of the chapter is spent giving practical suggestions with Scriptural backing of how to avoid sexual temptation from the TV to the computer.Chapter eight offers principles for singles to stay sexually pure. Alcorn does not seek to be legalistic in providing guidelines, but to be \\"biblical and wise\\" (72). He tackles the question of how far Christians should go sexually in a relationship and even explains that dating is not necessary for those who are single. Alcorn ends the chapter providing a helpful 14 point list of dating guidelines for singles.Chapter nine offers principles for parents and couples to stay sexually pure. Again, Alcorn offers practical advice with Scripture to ground his suggestions. He gives advice on how couples can \\"cultivate and guard\\" marriage through relationship evaluation, dating each other, being \\"fiercely loyal\\" and more (77-78). Alcorn also writes practically on the issues of attraction and honesty in a marriage. The chapter finishes with advice on raising pure children which is the shortest part of this chapter. He makes an important point that children will learn by the example of their parents' lives and habits including having one standard for children and another for themselves. He concludes with urging parents to be their children's \\"ultimate sex educators\\" (82).The topics in chapter ten are \\"confession, accountability, and counting the cost\\" (83). Alcorn brings the reader back to the consequences of sin, but explains that by God's grace one can move on past those sins. He encourages the reader that Christians cannot \\"win the battle\\" alone, but they need a \\"buddy system\\" (86). Alcorn shares helpful personal stories of accountability and suggests some accountability questions. He concludes the chapter offering his personal list of what committing adultery would cost him while encouraging the reader to make his or her own list.Chapter eleven is the concluding chapter in which Alcorn explains that sexual purity is a battle that Christians can win. This short chapter encourages the reader to seek a life of purity because it is a life that is pleasing to God. A life pleasing to God will allow one to experience God's \\"blessing and rewards\\" both presently and eternally (93).For a book that is just shy of 100 pages TPP offers quite a bit of practical advice on being aware of and avoiding sexual temptation. The book's strength lies within the practical applications it offers. What is disappointing about TPP is that it seems to assume the gospel. For example, the gospel is only mentioned once by name. Grace is mentioned several times, but Alcorn does not really explain what it means to do something \`by God's grace'. When writing about God rewarding those who make right choices towards purity, the rewards are never clearly defined. For those less mature it may be good to work through TPP with a mentor to prevent a slide toward moralism overshadowing the gospel. For the mature Christian who understands that the gospel is behind Alcorn's advice this book can be very helpful for fighting sexual sin. It is with this concern in mind that I recommend TPP for its practical applications of fighting sexual sin and seeking purity."},{"Title":"The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails (LifeChange Books)","review":"\\"A short book full of wise advice, straight to the point stating the obvious but often overlooked message that \`Purity is smart and Impurity is stupid' - can it get any simpler than that?\\"Published in 2003 by Multnomah, Randy Alcorn's The Purity Principle: God's Safeguards for Life's Dangerous Trails is as relative and pertinent today (maybe even more so) than when it was first published. The message in this book is timeless, obvious, and wise.I re-read this book as research for my current non-fiction book for women on the subject of purity and because Randy Alcorn tops the list of my favorite authors whether fiction or non-fiction. His words are sound truth and offer no fluff.His illustrations are, at times, heartbreaking. We've all heard the stories of how good men and women fall to such temptations. He offers these short stories to state the obvious response. We will rationalize our actions and then look to excuse all the warning signs until it is too late.Using these stories, Alcorn tracts back the origin of the issue - purity. First, one must admit that no one is above such temptations. We should expect temptation to come our way, consider our response in advance, and be ready with a godly response - not excuse it.He later drives home the point that there is no one else to blame when we find our witness destroyed, our marriages broken, and our relationships with friends and family forever changed.One of my favorite portions of this book was how God sees things. Alcorn states that God does not deal in right or wrong. God deals in wisdom and righteousness. A point to ponder as a culture can excuse or manipulate right and wrong but God's word cannot be morphed in such a way. An act is either wise or foolish and is never subject to man's judgement on the matter.A quick, relative read on the subject of purity. Don't let this books small size suggest it is not thorough. There is enough wise instruction in this little book if applied to your life, to save you many a heartache.This books should be in every Church library and perhaps used regularly in a Church discipleship curriculum. I recommend this book highly.Reviewed by: Keiki HendrixReviewed for: The Vessel Project"},{"Title":"Lateral Logic Mazes for the Serious Puzzler","review":"I have not tried all the mazes but I am already disappointed to discover many mistakes in this third printing: I have found problems with 11 mazes ranging from just annoying (e.g., drafting error--a background path bends at a foreground edge) to serious (a triangular maze section printed mirror-image reversed). Most of the mistakes involve the puzzles having solutions which are much easier than intended.One especially galling example asks for 2 paths that touch every node in a grid, 1 starting at one point, 1 starting at another. However, the two starting points are symetrically placed so of course once you find one, you've automatically found the other. There's even a solution which starts at one point and ends at the other so it is both solutions at once. Then the instructions say &quot;This is harder than it looks.&quot; If you had to find the answer given in the answer key, it would be--too bad you don't. One maze is two views of a folded piece of paper with the paths crossing over the fold. But a simple answer exists without crossing the fold (not given in the answers of course) making it about as hard as the ones on the back of a Pizza Hut placemat.The original mazes must have been designed in color then printed black and white because there are some serious contrast problems with some (e.g., black arrows on a black box). And many mazes have black or dark gray paths making recording a solution with pen or pencil impossible.For a book with so few pages, this number of errors is ridiculous. I feel sorry for any youngsters who receive this book and are turned off to logic puzzles forever."},{"Title":"Gaia Matrix: Arkhom & the Geometries of Destiny in the North American Landscape","review":"Ley lines, feng shui has its chi... but what about underlying relationship of earth to man?

Two books stand out as the best: John Dover Wilson's &quot;What Happens in Hamlet?&quot; and Caroline Spurgeon's &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery.&quot; If I could only keep two Shakespeare books in my library, I would choose these. Dr. Spurgeon spent ten years sifting through the entire Shakespeare canon and pulling out every metaphor and simile she could find. Then, she organized them into like groups. This offered her, and us through her writing, an insight into Shakespeare's creative genius. With evidence in hand, Dr. Spurgeon explored how Shakepeare's mind actually worked; she uncovered his patterns of creative thinking. His abundant use of garden and household images and his relatively few uses of classical or scholarly images show us a writer more in touch with the real everyday world. His childhood homelife, the images one tends to carry throughout one's life, become crystal clear when set side by side in this fashion. In Spurgeon's book, we clearly see that the works of Shakespeare had to have been written by Shakespeare, who was born in small town Stratford, and not the works of a university trained dramatist or a member of Queen Elizabeth's court. It is fascinating to see Shakespeare's images compared and contrasted to those of Marlowe, Dekker, and Johnson. Each writer thought and created images in a unique manner. Seeing and understanding the differences, as expertly explained by Dr. Spurgeon, gives one a deeper insight into and appreciation of one of the greatest minds of all time. If you love Shakespeare then do not miss reading this book."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"Caroline Spurgeon's &quot;Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us&quot; is one of the books you'll most definitely find on the Shakespeare students' bookshelf, and for good reason: nobody outlines the visual images, themes, and motifs in Shakespeare's plays as well as Spurgeon does.Furthermore, Spurgeon doesn't outline themes on a play-by-play basis; instead, she takes a particular image and tells us about ALL of the ways it appears in ANY of the plays. Example: she outlines dream imagery in Richard II, Winter's Tale, Henry VIII, and Romeo and Juliet. This may sound a little confusing, and indeed can be, but it allows a real glimpse into Shakespeare's mind, and allows the reader to see common threads in all of the plays.Also intriguing are the detailed charts in the back of the book that give a visual reference of how prevalent certain images are in Shakespeare's plays: for instance, one chart shows how prevalent sickness, disease, and medicine are in each of the plays.Spurgeon did an amazing amount of work in order to complete this book, and it shows--it's one of the most thorough references available, and it is invaluable to the Shakespeare student, teacher, or scholar. Spurgeon didn't cover EVERYTHING--who could?--and a true scholar might find himself noting what's absent at times. Also, the reading can be a bit boring at times, but it always picks back up quickly, and it really highlights the machinations of Shakespeare's mind. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"This is an innocent book, no scholarly posing (though she is, no doubt, a scholar)... It's a very readable book as well... In fact it's a devourable book... Plays are obviously short on description and description is the most edible part of imaginative writing, so to have all of Shakespeare's imagery for metaphor and symbol and so forth all together right in front of you is very attractive and appetite, if not lust, inducing... She also creatively categorizes everything and compares it all in different ways including comparisons with contemporaries like Marlowe and Jonson and Bacon... A very interesting and delightful Shakespeare (and language) book..."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"First the author shows that an author's choice of metaphor reflects his life experience. Then she masterfully and convincingly developes what shakespeare's imagery tells us about HIM. Perhaps the most penetrating analysis of this man of genius we will ever have. Charming and moving."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"This is to my mind, as another reviewer has said, one of the best books about the kind of man Shakespeare must have been. It's entirely grounded in the imagery and metaphor that pervades Shakespeare's works. For good reason it's been in print since 1935. Interestingly--to me at least who takes the authorship question seriously--though Spurgeon connected that kind of man with Shakespeare of Stratford, it applies with more evidence to Edward de Vere. My main reason for saying so has to do with Spurgeon's conclusion that the most central of all imagery in Shakespeare is that of the garden and gardener, (especially, though I don't think she says so, the carefully tended flower garden). So, not by coincidence I think, we find that when de Vere at age twelve was sent to London to live in the household of Lord Burghley (William Cecil) for the next nine years, he was entering an estate \\"the grounds of which must have covered many acres, and were more extensive than those of any of the other private homes in Westminster. John Gerard, well known as the author of Herbal, or General History of Plants (1597), was for twenty years Sir William Cecil's gardener; and Sir William himself evidently took a great pride in his garden ... Cecil imbued his sons and the royal wards under his charge with his own keenness in horticulture.\\" (Ward, The Seventeenth Earl of Oxford 1550-1604 from contemporary documents, 1928). You can follow this line of thinking further with materials on Hank Whittemore's Shakespeare blog.But however you may view the authorship dispute, Spurgeon's book is a treasure."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"Spurgeon has created an unusual work of literary criticism with charts showing the usage of various imagery in Shakespeare's plays. Fascinating."},{"Title":"Shakespeare's Imagery and What It Tells Us","review":"An interesting take on Shakespeare's imagery, although the writing itself can be dull and many of the examples used are cliched.

Well, being someone that is over weight and has a problem with determining what an actual serving is poses a HUGE problem.

While written as fiction, the novel is also a wonderful history lesson of the political structure and shenanigans employed by the political and financial mavens of that period. The characters and events of the late 19th century are brought to life through Dreiser's rich and descriptive prose. Relatively few authors are able to attain the degree of detail Dreiser devotes to his plot and characters, all the while employing word usage in such as a way as to create a virtual masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Titan (Meridian classics)","review":"This book is a must read for any investor. It makes clear that economic bubbles and financial crises have the same causes in all centuries: excessive debt, secured by speculative assets. Once the collateral falls in price, the lender requires to repay the debt or add more collateral. Since the borrower have used excessive leverage, he is unable to handle the debt and goes bankrupt, which leaves the lender with illiquid assets. Here are some examples:1871: Frank Cowperwood have used stocks of Philadelphia's railroads as a collateral to huge loans, and when the Great Chicago Fire sparked a financial panic, he could neither repay the debt nor add more collateral, thus became insolvent.1929: Widespread use of margin, of up to 90% was one of the reasons of the Great Depression. The investor could buy $100,000 worth of stock with $10,000 of own cash, borrowing the remaining $90,000 from the broker. The sharp drop of the stock price made the investors unable repay the debt, they became insolvent. The brokers were left with cheap stocks and became insolvent also.2007: The dot-com bubble of 2000 contributed to the housing bubble. Once stocks fell, real estate became the primary outlet for the speculative frenzy that the stock market had unleashed. The families were buying houses when they knew that they cannot afford the mortgage for a long time, they were buying only to sell it to later at higher price. The rise in home prices was very attractive for construction industry: the number of newly built houses have significantly increased. When the prices of the houses have fallen due to the balance between the supply and demand, the speculators who run out of cash to repay the mortgages could no longer sell the houses at a price they bought. This essentially led homeowners to foreclosures. The great amount of foreclosures have caused huge losses to the lenders, made them insolvent or put under Government's conservatorship, when the shareholder value was diluted if not wiped out.While the first book in the trilogy, \\"The Financier\\", is not a skilled picture of smallest traits of a human soul when it comes to love and feelings, this second book, \\"The Stoic\\", covers the human soul better, but not as good as in writings by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (take \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\"). When it comes to the financial aspects, they are very well covered. I recommend you to read the whole trilogy: \\"The Financier\\", \\"The Titan\\" and \\"The Stoic\\"."},{"Title":"The Titan (Meridian classics)","review":"The Titan is an excellent sequel that, unlike many sequels, does not require the reader to have read its prequel, The Financier. Frank Cowperwood is a still-waters-run-deep kind of central character. Our story begins with his release from prison for racketeering, his descent onto Chicago with new bride-to-be, Aileen, and a stoic determination brewing behind those blue-gray eyes that, \\"somebody is gonna pay for this.\\" That somebody is first the gas companies and then the newly emerging \\"Elevated\\" light rail lines of Chicago, which he proceeds to take over. Cowperwood is an immoral man. He cheats compulsively on his wife, pays off the city council and mayor to get franchise awards, and even contrives to bribe and blackmail the Illnois governor. This is not a character we are supposed to admire, in fact few of the characters we meet--Aileen, Mrs. Carter, Hosmer Hand, or Berenice Fleming--are heroic characters in the swashbuckling sense. But Dreiser warns us that human frailties are not without struggle, that lack of conscience does not always make it easy to inflict one's will and evil-doing on others, and that, most of all, in high society, money has its limits (at least in 1914). Be prepared to have a dictionary handy when reading Titan, many words that have long fallen out of favor are used extensively, including, \\"peregrination,\\" \\"trig,\\" \\"fag,\\" \\"ermine,\\" \\"bacchanal\\" and \\"phatasmagoria.\\" Titan is a terrific read that draws on the history of Chicago as a burgeoning megalopolis."},{"Title":"The Titan (Meridian classics)","review":"Theodore Drieser's _The Titan_ (1914), book two in the author's trilogy of the uber-American businessman, describes the \\"come back\\" of the unscrupulous yet charming financier Frank Algernon Cowperwood. _The Financier_ (1911), the first book in the series, ends with Frank Cowperwood being convicted of financial conspiracy and bribery of public officials in Philadelphia. _The Titan_ picks up with the second phase of Cowperwood's financial life. Having completed his prison sentence, Cowperwood, now in his early thirties, walks into the daylight from the Eastern District Penitentiary walls in Philadelphia with the realization that he is no longer a young man and that he must begin his life anew.The early chapters chronicle Cowperwood's journey to Chicago and his efforts to establish a new life in a society with Aileen Butler, his mistress who becomes his second wife after he secures a divorce. With a longing to \\"test whether the world would trample him under foot or not,\\" Cowperwood undertakes a long, complicated journey to emerge on top, not only of the financial world of Chicago in the 1880s but of the United States as a whole. Constitutionally, Cowperwood is, in a large measure, fit for the challenge.First, we see Cowperwood's acumen in financial matters as he acquires a small Chicago gas company, which over time challenges for a controlling interest in public gas in Chicago. He then purchases a streetcar line in north Chicago, threatening the entrenched business oligarchs of Chicago. Suborning public officials and always finding the right people to undertake his schemes--throughout much of the book Cowperwood uses proxies to advance his business aims and remains behind the scenes--he becomes a scandalously powerful mogul. At the same time, his private affairs descend into chaos. Numerous reckless extra-marital affairs undermine his business partnerships with Chicago's elite, making former friends into deadly adversaries. The intrigues and deceptions of a Cowperwood's public and private lives are put under the microscope in hundreds of detailed pages.Early in the novel Cowperwood seduces Rita Sohlberg, a woman married to a failed violinist, and from this relationship a pattern emerges. In urging his suit, Cowperwood argues, \\"Life is between individuals, Rita. You and I have very much in common. Don't you see that?\\" He adds, \\"There is so much that would complete your perfectness.\\" The first of many affairs, Cowperwood's relationship with Rita is supported by a view of the world where the individual's needs reign supreme. The public and private identities of Cowperwood merge within this credo: one's obligation is to satisfying oneself alone.Throughout the novel, Drieser himself, like many of the secondary characters in _The Titan_ is seduced by Cowperwood's persona and prone to forgive his faults. In the final paragraphs, the narrator attempts to explain the meaning of Cowperwood's life and his magnetism as a fulfillment of a certain personality type: \\"Each according to his temperament,\\" concludes the novel.Cowperwood shares traits with larger-than-life living figures in the business world like Donald Trump, who capture the public imagination. Frank Cowperwood is the predescessor of a number of fictional businessmen, including Charles Foster Kane (from Orson Wells' _Citizen Kane_) or Gordon Gecko (from _Wall Street_). Cowperwood embodies the mystique of the robber barrens and tycoons of the late nineteenth- and early twentieth-centuries who amassed huge fortunes, and who were both loved and hated by the public for their magnificent spoils and audacious ill-gotten gains."},{"Title":"The Titan (Meridian classics)","review":"Theodore Dreiser clearly was a great writer at the beginning of the 20th Century. He, along with few others, dared challenge conventional writing styles and TD did it quite boldly. Critics have long argued about the merits of his writings - it is for the reader to decide. He is certainly heavy and dense but he had arguments he wanted to make and, rest assured, he made them with a sledgehammer.The Titan has the same central theme as The Financier with our Mr. Cowperwood out to conquer the world of business and of women of society. The destruction brought to all is readily apparent but the realism brough to the reader, along with a wonderfully unique style of writing is worth the efforts of his works.I rated this one star lower than The Financier but think whichever is read first is going to be the one the reader prefers. Perhaps his themes wear on one and the second time around (with a third waiting to be read, The Genius)his premise and social and economic criticisms become a bit redundant. That said, if you like one, you are going to like the other. Also, it is great to see nascent protestations of a growing industrial economy and the obvious implications in today's corporate world."},{"Title":"Cooking with Texas Highways","review":"I just bought this.

And nice reading on some of our local favorite producers- for example of goat cheese.I have grown completely sick of 'chef' cookbooks. Not only are we supposed to cook like a trained professional would in a resturaunt these days, we are supposed to cook for celebrities- or so it would seem from the endless celebrity chef cookbooks out there. This is a 'real' cookbook. For real people- and it is authentic. The cookbook I read just before this one, while really very good, had loads of bell peppers in the fajitas! I mean- yikes! This book is brave enought to list the famous (and much loved) but really tacky (and chefs would cringe) Texas classics- such as Rotel Cheese Dip and Frito Pie. There are of course much more sophisticated recipes, but all look wonderful.Lastly, any book with such a drop-dead beautiful photo of bluebonnets gets my vote.

In this book we follow a man and his wife from New York's high life to the backwoods African bush. We discover what a buffalo really looks like, and how you feel when he looks at you! We discover fear, anxiety, restlessness, pride, truimph, and in the end respect and joy. A very highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"Robert Ruark's chronicle of his African safari in the 1950s. This is good reading for both outdoor buffs and readers of a more literary type. Ruark avoids the pitfall of turning his book into an extended article for &quot;Field and Stream.&quot; Aside from the details of the big-game hunt, he sprinkles his narrative with recollections of his WWII combat experience, musings on the literary world of New York, books, movies about Africa, and life in America. The focal point of the book is the daily experience of fighting the African environment in the pursuit of the elusive prey. The descriptions of the wildlife are thrilling as the hunting party tracks across the primeval plains. Ruark gives full attention to the discomforts of safari life and the doubtful sanity of those who submit themselves to this type of &quot;recreation.&quot; The killing is graphically described and not for the squeamish. Animal rights activists should steer clear of this book.Ruark has great fun describing himself as an Ernest Hemingway &quot;wannabe.&quot; Comparisons to Hemingway's &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot; are inevitable. Ruark is more self-deprecating than Ernest Hemingway, and can see the outrageous humor of it all. The white hunter guide, Harry Selby, falls short of the Allan Quartermain ideal. Selby is afraid of snakes and scorpions, and manages to get the safari lost at least once. Just as Hemingway, Ruark takes his wife, Jenny, along on safari. She handles the discomforts very well, and doesn't wimp out.This book won't be studied a 100 years from now in American Lit. classes, but it's diverting reading. It recalls the macho standards of a different era. Ruark's reputation has faded since his heyday in the '50s and early '60s. For those who remember, this book is an interesting footnote to his literary career. ;-)"},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"\\"Horn Of The Hunter\\" is one of the best stories about African hunting and wildlife that has ever been penned. (My Opinion) Robert Ruark may have written between the two era's of Hemingway and Capstick, but when it comes to writing about Africa he took a backseat to neither of them and if you have read my other reviews you know that I have nothing but praise for them both.Ruark takes us on safari with him and his wife Virginia. The copyright is 1952 and though I couldn't find a definite time for the safari it was during the post WW II era. It is reasonable to assume that it would have been a short time prior to the copyright. He describes in great detail the African wilderness and wildlife along with the discomforts of insect bites and muddy river bottoms. Traveling through the Tanganyika wilderness in a Land Rover called Jessica with a professional hunter named Harry Selby, Ruark takes us with him on a grand adventure.Unlike many prominent writers Ruark not only tells of his successes, but his failures as well. Throughout the text Selby compares Ruark's marksmanship with a lady client named Harriet Maytag and Ruark's responses to his comments add depth and humor to the text. There are some spectacular long range shots taken, but there are also some clean misses at both long and short range. He admits his fear of Cape Buffalo and tells us of his love for wing shooting. He talks of Selby who is as sqeamish with snakes as a teenage girl, but is the living portrait of abosolute courage when following up wounded and dangerous animals.Ruark's delightful humor is on nearly every page as he describes various bits of unorthodox lore. Such as painting a juvinile baboon with flourescent paint to frighten off the band or Selby's advice to him to survive a buffalo stampede by shooting one of them and climbing on top of it to avoid being trampled.When I finished reading this story I was as sad to see it end as Ruark was to leave Africa.All in all this is a readers delight and will be a treasured gem in any hunters library."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"This book is the rousing and interesting story of writer Robert Ruark's two month Safari into the wilds of Africa. This was done in the 1950's and he was accompanied by his wife who also hunted by his side. Gritty and often frightening descriptions of the chase and the kill are acompanied by astute observations on the Africa of that time. He had strong opinions of many of the African tribes. Some he praised highly and others he condemned and he explains why. If you are wrapped in the fog of political correctness don't bother to read this. If you want an unvarnished, honest, very interesting tale, by all means, buy this outstanding book."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"I had heard alot about this book for years and finally got around to reading it. If you enjoy high quality adventure and hunting writing, it truly does not come better than this.Ruark takes the reader along on his (and his wife's) first African safari and makes us feel the sights, sounds, smells, adventure, boredoom, fatigue, terror etc. that he experiences as if we were there. His writing is at times witty and always interesting. A fascinating portrait of an era long gone. A great read."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"Ruarke is rightfully called the master of outdoor writing. This is a fabulously written story of his first safari in Kenya and Tanganyika (now Tanzania). It is a must read for anyone who enjoys outdoor literature, hunting stories, or Africa."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"After reading several reviews on this famous book and much wait when I finally got this book, truly I was a little bit disappointed during reading. I had in my mind something superior than Hemingway and Capstick's works. Before this I read his later book 'Use Enough Gun' which I think is better than this one. However, when I finished, it was added in my list of to-be-re-read books. These are the books which leave an impression on you, which take you in the atmosphere of theirs and you remember the good taste of the book as of very fine things in the life.Now I would say that Hemingway is a kind of more powerful and more hunter on this safari stuff, in the &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;. His white hunter Philip Percival is not as much narrated as Herry Selby of Ruark's. Interstingly Selby is one of the pupil of Percival as Ruark is inspired by Hemingway.I think that the Ruark has the edge of being more comic and funny. His humouress narration of his own acts and that of his companions are different then many hero-type hunters-authors, who always succeed in every crisis. His desire to shoot a Greater Kudu trophy and story of fair chase and the end of chase....is a classic picture of true hunting attitude. He was not a rifle shooter before this safari as opposed to Hemingway who was a serious hunter. One of the finest parts in this book is the episode of sand grouse shooting and Ruark's pride on his expertise in bird shooting over his white hunter Selby, who used to surprise Ruark in rifle shooting.Collectively a very fine book on the African safari hunting in the golden era of long safaris."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"If you've ever dreamed of going on a safari in Africa, but don't have the money or the gumption, this is about as close as you'll come to the real thing. I've read a few books about safaris, hunting in Africa, etc. (like Peter Capstick), but this is what I always imagined it would really be like. If you've stumbled upon this book (and review) by accident and don't know who Robert Ruark was, you're in for a treat. Ruark was a journalist, author, and big game hunter who wrote from the late 40s until his death in the mid 60s. He was hugely popular during his lifetime, but now has been almost totally forgotten. I stumbled upon one of his books a few years ago (the collection of short stories by McIntosh), and since then I've snarf every Ruark book I could find. This book contains Ruark's own tale of his first safari in Africa in the early 1950s and is an incredibly entertaining and detailed account of safaris. Early on Ruark is keenly concerned about \`living up' to the expectations of his PH (Harry Selby) and the retinue of African gun bearers, cooks, skinners, and camp followers. He doesn't want to show any weakness, fear, or inability to hit the target with his gun. As the safari progress and Ruark proves himself a worthy hunting companion, the tale turns into a shared adventure with his PH and other hunting comrades as they stalk a variety of game throughtout East Africa. It is clear from Ruark's writing that a safari (at least in the 50s) was a physically and emotionally grueling experience. The heat in the day, the cold in the night, the swamps, the river crossings, the bugs, the snakes, the waiting, the hours of stalking over rough terrain, the long rides in the Land Rover all for a few minutes of excitement (and occasionally sheer terror). The style of this book is very conversational, Ruark discusses the regular comings and goings of the safari, but he talks about a wide range of other topics including his experiences in WWII in the merchant marine, Hollywood safari movies, the habits of various game animals in Africa, a bit about the diverse natives, and a host of other topics. It really is as if you are sitting with Ruark at the end of a hard day hunting enjoying a cocktail around the campfire. If you've read Ruark before, this isn't his best, but still a terrific read, and worth spending a few extra bucks for the hardback. For anyone interested in safari hunting or safari literature, this is a must own/must read."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"Ruark was known as &quot;the poor man's Ernest Hemingway&quot;. In &quot;Horn of the Hunter&quot;, his prose and eloquent introspection out does Hemingway's &quot;Green Hills of Africa&quot;."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"After reading Old Man and the Boy, and The Old Man's Boy Grows Older, both of which are some of the greatest outdoor literature ever printed, I must say that Horn of the Hunter made me stop and really think about Ruark as I first started on the book. This is my first read of his outside of the Old Man and Boy series, so I really don't know what I was expecting, but this was not it. After settling into the story and getting over the fact that this is who the author is....which is far from a wet behind the ears youngster learning back woods knowledge in South Carolina, I found that the story became better and better with every chapter, and I soon found myself completly absorbed in the story line. This is a book that Ruark wrote for himself, but I dare say that all enjoy outdoor pursuits will greatly apprechiate it as well. It is an honest look into the earlier Safaris, which I dare say is long gone and no longer avaliable in todays world. Great read, but be prepared for something a bit different if your looking for another colorful Old Man story."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"I started the book with having read the Old Man and the Boy first, so I was primed and ready for some good reading. I was not disappointed, Robert C. Ruark is a Masterful Wordsmith. I savored each word as a \\"Right before You Go to Sleep\\" read, the book was the High Point of the Day on a number of days, it always provided an exit into sleep after what lately have become stressful days. This should be required reading for anyone who hunts, it provides a distinct familiarity for anyone who has hunted. I felt that, I know that, I was Touched."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"This was the only book by this author that I had not read. Seized by the desire to complete my Ruark experience I found this copy on Amazon and buried myself in it for the next three days after its arrival. I was not disappointed. The style of writing may be overly dramatic to some and Ruark was not politically correct in his opinions by today's standards but if you want to know about Africa and hunting and have a little philosophy in the mix this is an excellent book to start with. I would have definitely liked to have met this man as his work was inspiring to me as a teenager."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"This is the first book I have read by Robert Raurk and it will not be the last.

Horn of the Hunter is no different..although it takes you to a whole new world - an African Safari many years ago. Bottom line- Ruark is a great writer, and he does an excellent job describing his many adventures hunting in Africa during this safari. His writing reminds me a lot of Teddy Roosevelt's hunting books - which are also excellent. In several sections of the book, Ruark does a masterful job trying to figure out why he enjoys hunting, and what makes an African safari so special. The sketches and photos included in the book, also helped paint a complete picture of this adventure - to include how his spouse dealt with living in the bush for so long.My only complaint with the book is that it gets a little long winded at times when describing all the details about specific hunts - makes you think the safari lasted a lot longer than it actually did.If you enjoy hunting books, or other works by Robert Ruark, then you will really enjoy Horn of the Hunter - well worth reading."},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"I have just ordered a copy of Robert Ruark's popular book.

I had also read another excellent book by Robert Ruark, entitled: SOMETHING OF VALUE.This is an excellent book on the Mau Mau tribal uprising in East Africa during the British colonial era. Then I also read another good book called UHURU, meaning indepedence in the African language.About this HORN OF THE HUNTER, going after big game in Africa is a thing of the past now and gone too are the days of the so-called White Hunters...after ivory and rhino horns mainly.

Now part of his prep he is reading about the great safaries of the past,Ruark Hemingway Roosevelt Botington etc. We really enjoyed this book as he wrote about all aspects of the trip with very little editing. I t was about bravery in foreign country but also about his humility at the very differnt struggles of the people and thier cultures.

He describes himself as a 'second rate' Hemingway. I don't agree. I think Ruark was, in fact, the real deal. I have my questions about Hemingway.Ruark is never politically correct whether he is talking about war, politics or hunting. He tells it like he sees it and does it and, having been there myself, many times, it has the feel of reality. Even in Ruark's time he recognized that hunting, in many American circles, was becoming 'de classe' and regarded as passe by the elitist Left in America. As such, Ruark reckoned, perhaps correctly, that big game hunting was on its last legs.He couldn't have known of the great resurgence of hunting since his death. As it turns out, hunting is not only satisfying and profitable but--partially because it is profitable to nations that might otherwise be disinterested in their own wildlife--it has promoted the conservation of wild places and wild animals all over the earth. At the same time, Ruark could not have predicted the power of the the idiotic 'animal rights' movement, although he would have scarcely been surprised. Ruark recognized that the more urban societies became, the more isolated from nature--and reality--the same societies would necessarily be.I also enjoyed the part in Ruark's book in which he is nearly killed by a zebra. Predictably, Ruark sees the humor and irony in the event.Ron Braithwaite, author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Horn of the Hunter: The Story of an African Safari","review":"Well I love old african stories.

I would say that the one problem, if there were to be a problem, would be Berger's emotional investment. Some of the essays get lost in admiration - causing the reader to question why the essay was written in the first place - But overall, this is a riveting collection, and a must for anyone interested in contemporary art and its societal role."},{"Title":"Shape of a Pocket","review":"This is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read.

Berger's prose is pure and airy, and only occasionally he trespasses into the contrived and nearly bombastic. That's irritating but understandable as Berger is constantly trying to get to the deeper layers of what it means to make sense of the world through the 'act' of painting. I suppose Berger, on reading these lines, would remark that conceptualising 'to paint' as an 'act' is completely besides the point. Indeed, what he tries to get across is the 'receiving' nature of being-in-the-world as a painter. Being a real artist is a balancing act: it's a state of dynamic equilibrium between 'self' and 'world', between banality and madness. I believe Berger; his writing breathes integrity and wisdom. He has seen things that many mortals only have faint intimations of. That being said I am less sure about the appropriateness of his insights spilling over into the political realm. The complexity of globalisation is, perhaps, of a different nature than the complexity of a brush stroke. I think it shows, in Berger's language: suddenly the delicacy - holographic in its suggestion of colour, depth and texture - evaporates and we are left with the dull taste of cliche and ideology."},{"Title":"Shape of a Pocket","review":"This book is prose, poetry and the most personal, intelegent and non linear art writing I have read so far- I also recommend John Berger's Sense of Sight."},{"Title":"Shape of a Pocket","review":"John Berger small pocket of resistance against the inhumanity of the new world economic order(whatever that is)is a beautiful book of great essays on Rembrant, Palaeolithic cave painters, Leon Kossoff, Michelangelo, Brancusi, Giogio Morandi, Frida Kahlo and a whole lot more.Very well done and I enjoyed very much."},{"Title":"Shape of a Pocket","review":"I have read all his books and keep wishing for more...."},{"Title":"Shape of a Pocket","review":"I ordered this book for an essay writing class, and I was worried it wasn't going to come in time but it did, in fact before I expected it to.

It's so rational to explain to them the horrible mistakes Joseph Smith made in his self-righteous attempt to write a religious book. The book is great in being able to show the desperate used car salesman their attempts for conversion is wasted on intelligent skeptics. They have become so desperate for growth because of the high inactive rates that they have to send missionaries out and this book helps to keep people from falling into the maze of Mormonism. Most of the missionaries have been so blinded on the history of the Mormon church that they don't know it is impossible for it to be the true church. The slitting of throats, special underwear and polygamy are concepts they won't even acknowledge because of the lies of Mormon prophets.

I would agree, from a comparison of this title with Martin's KINGDOM OF THE CULTS. Both are suprisingly lacking of scholarship, though this is far worse. Martin is today a joke among LDS scholars at BYU (esp. FARMS), and this book would fare much better. It is an egregious title, quite simply.I come onto the Protestant Evangelist VS. Latter-day Saint debate with little bias, for I am wouldn't call myself either at the present time. For the Protestants (in their unusual epistemology) start witht he position to prove Mormonism wrong and &quot;help&quot; them, before analysing the LDS church on a factual level, this book will be a blessing. The problem? I feel that though this book has the ring of truth it is in turn specious.When I purchased and glazed through this book, I came to the rather obvious inference that this book was whipped together rather quickly. In earlier times my friends and I used to humorously joke that we whipped homework together &quot;on the bus on the way to school,&quot; I would say Morey did just that (in a symbolic manor) -- this book doesn't have the thorough scholarship that is needed to tackle the 'big leagues' of LDS scholarship and apologetics in FARMS, FAIR, even SHIELDS. The essay by two extremely bright indivuals titled &quot;Mormon Scholarship and Evangelical Neglect&quot; which is a detailed analysis of the current lack of ANY scholarship to respond to LDS is a valid cause for concern which this book does not fill.The book is divided into two sections. Part 1 is a &quot;how to use this book&quot; which gives a brief discription of the LDS church from an Evangelical perspective, and then continues to give nine &quot;documented&quot; false prophecies. A found a number of statements in Part 1 to be unusual and noteworthy. First, he states that Mormons are &quot;disciples of Joseph Smith&quot; (pg. 12). In all my studies of LDS doctrine, history, and culture, I have yet to read a LDS refer to him/herself as a &quot;disciple of Joseph Smith.&quot; (Though they do refer to themselves as disciples of Jesus quite often).Morey then continues (ibid.) to give tell us &quot;A Christian needs to understand what a 'cult' is.&quot; His definition is what I refer to as the &quot;Protestant&quot; one, as there is no set in stone definition of cult and a Mormon could easily turn around and make a definition that makes Protestants to be &quot;cultists&quot; and in a &quot;cult&quot; while LDS are excluded from this definition. Mormonism has many similarities to the early church: is the early church a cult? Morey basically argues that any church that doesn't view the Bible as #1 authority, 100% is a cult, yet the early church didn't even have a Bible -- not some three hundred years after Christ where the century long debate concerning book authority was finally clamped down upon. I have a hard time believing the canon is the work of God or closed.Morey then continues and tells us that a Christian &quot;must understand that Mormonism is a cult.&quot; Circular reasoning--yes. He then states that Mormonism is &quot;built entirely upon Joseph Smith&quot; -- this statement is ENTIRELY not true. Mormonism is based upon the standard works (KJV, BOM, D&amp;C, PGP), past and present general authorities. It would be like me turning back at Morey and saying that &quot;Protestantism is built entirely upon Paul of Tarsus.&quot;Morey's first false prophecy (hereby FP) is concerning Jesus' return and Joseph Smith's teachings concerning it. The 1891 issue is clearly a conditional prophecy (hmmm...similar to Jonah's escapades), while other's concern Jesus coming &quot;soon&quot; and &quot;not many days hence&quot;, etc. etc. We must recall that the NT speaks of Jesus coming back &quot;soon&quot; and even before everyone from that generation dies. While scholars such as Witherington and Sproul have done detailed examinations of eschatology, Morey's comparisons are hypocritical.FP#2 concerns the 12 tribes of Israel. I admit to having never studied that and its relation to Mormonism, so I would examine his criticisms in that area. Next though, is his &quot;moon man&quot; FP criticism. Morey's analysis is horrible. His only first person (or Hyrum, Joseph Smith's brother) quotations come from a source dated around 40 years after Joseph Smith's death.Morey's arguments about the LDS trip to Salem are not given a time-limit and can yet occur. For the others I have yet to discuss, I again admit to ignorance concerning them. Though all of the alleged false prophecies of Joseph Smith seem to me to have about all the substance of most of the alleged contradictions of the Bible and false prophecies of the Bible.Morey concludes by writing &quot;what should evey Mormon know&quot; (pg. 117) where he quotes some biblical passages. I found his statement that we cannot be saved by baptism to be odd. It seems many Protestants believe in &quot;decisionism&quot; -- that one must make the sinners prayer (or similar) and/or they are saved at a specific moment which is much similar to the LDS view of baptism. It's not a work, it is what initiates grace though (as clearly something has to, and Protestants typically believe it is the sinner's prayer).Oddly, Morey writes there is a &quot;heaven to gain and a hell to shun&quot; as one of his finishing statements. LDS accept this and argue (to some extent successfully) that the Bible could and possibly does refer to three levels of heaven upon which we will reside. He concludes by writing that Jesus is the only name we can come to to be saved (and that Joseph Smith can't save us). Who said Mormons believed that Joseph Smith cleansed their sin? Any Mormons perhaps (this excludes some alleged statements in JoD by Brigham Young which we are at best unable to be sure were an accurate recording).I found this book to be bad, and another needless book among the 2000 other &quot;anti-Mormon&quot; books that have been (or still are) in publication. Sadly, I can recommend no good scholarly criticisms of Mormonism: there are none that i know of. I recommend a good, thorough analysis of Mormon doctrine, church, culture, history and then come to a full conclusion. Not some cheap shots from the hip from (Bob Morey), a man who is not an expert in the field."},{"Title":"How to Answer a Mormon","review":"Let me add a piece of advice to the ideas proposed in this book. When you hear the words, &quot;Would you like to know more?&quot; just say &quot;No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, &quot;I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!&quot; I replied, &quot;Probably better.&quot; and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs.

He explains in the first chapter, \\"Part 2 of this book contains the documentation for some of the false prophecies of Joseph Smith. Although there are over sixty obviously false prophecies made by Joseph Smith, the ones which are included in Part 2 are the most useful.\\"Here are some quotations from the book:\\"The only issue which the Mormons are not well-prepared to discuss, with any measure of knowledge, is the issue of Joseph Smith's claim to be a true prophet of God. Although these missionaries have memorized their 'missionary handbook' and have practiced their presentation and arguments, they are not ready to deal with this issue because is it not dealt with in their manual.\\" (Pg. 14)\\"(Joseph Smith's) claims are so astounding that there are only three logical positions one can take concerning the prophetic claims of Joseph Smith. First, we can believe that Smith was whom he claimed to be---God's latter-day prophet... Second, we can believe that Smith was a fraud and that he knowingly sought to deceive people in order to obtain their possessions and control their lives. If Smith was a fraud and a liar, then he should be exposed... Third, we can believe that Smith was insane and that he had delusions of grandeur in which he thought he was a 'prophet of God.' In this light, he would be an object of pity...\\" (Pg. 24)\\"We have examined the historical and factual evidence which documents eight false prophecies of Joseph Smith. According to Deuteronomy 18:20-22, just one false prophecy is sufficient to identify a false prophet... these eight prophecies are sufficient to demonstrate beyond all reasonable doubt that Joseph Smith was NOT a prophet of God.\\" (Pg. 116)"},{"Title":"How to Answer a Mormon","review":"Which Is the &quot;Christian&quot; Doctrine?Suppose for a moment that the Latter-day Saints were to take seriously the demand that they conform in every particular to &quot;Christian&quot; doctrine, and that they then made the attempt to do so. Having complied with such a demand, would the Latter-day Saints find themselves in total agreement with Protestants or with Catholics? Would they believe in apostolic succession or in the priesthood of all believers? Would they recognize an archbishop, a patriarch, a pope, a monarch, or no one at all as the head of Christ's church on earth? Would they be saved by grace alone, or would they find the sacraments of the church necessary for salvation? Would they believe in free will or in predestination? Would they practice water baptism? If so, would it be by immersion, sprinkling, or some other method? Would they believe in a substitutionary, representative, or exemplary atonement? Would they or would they not believe in &quot;original sin&quot;? And on and on.It is unreasonable for other Christians to demand that Latter-day Saints conform to a single standard of &quot;Christian&quot; doctrine when they do not agree among themselves upon exactly what that standard is. To do so is to establish a double standard; doctrinal diversity is tolerated in some churches, but not in others. The often-heard claim that all true Christians share a common core of necessary Christian doctrine rests on the dubious proposition that all present differences between Christian denominations are over purely secondary or even trivial matters-matters not central to Christian faith. This view is very difficult to defend in the light of Christian history, and might be easier to accept if Protestants and Catholics- or Protestants and Protestants, for that mat-ter-had not once burned each other at the stake as non-Christian heretics over these same &quot;trivial&quot; differences."},{"Title":"How to Answer a Mormon","review":"Actually, Taco Bell DOES sell ChocoTacos - I just had one myself!

It was nothing short of revolutionary when Christ introduced the principle of &quot;turning the other cheek&quot;(a foundational and non-denominational Christian concept). Many cursed Him, calling him the devil and accused Him of things that simply, were not true. Most of the &quot;chosen&quot; Jews never even took the time to listen to Jesus nor decide for themselves of his divinity. How ludicrous! Even as he suffered on the cross, soldiers mocked and tempted him by saying, &quot;If thou be the Son of God, save thyself.&quot; Jesus was not tempted by this test of pride. He did not have to &quot;prove&quot; who he was. He knew the truth about his divinity and that was sufficient. How interesting that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints does not entertain responses to anti-mormon sentiment, nor have they ever published one document critisizing the belief of another faith.

It allows us to decide for ourselves what it true and what isn't.Conclusion: Mr. Robert Morey would have made a wonderful Pharisee.

I LOVED Harriet the Spy, both as a child, as an adult. When I bought Harriet the Spy for my dauughter, I saw this book, and bought it, too, sight unseen. I have just read it, and am quite surprised that the topics discussed in this book could have been published in 1965, when society was more conservative today. I did not like the chapter on Janie having her period. Not that I object to the subject being discussed--I just didn't like the presentation of it in this book. I think what I found disturbing about this book are the particular identity issues it brings up. Maybe it touched too closely on some things I found disturbing as a child. I was shocked with the actions and behavior of some of the adult characters in the book--I didn't like it at all. However, I will concede that by the end of the book, the behavior of the characters I didn't like was completely discredited, and Beth Ellen REALLY ends up growing as a person in this book--that's what this book is all about. I was VERY surprised how the mystery of the notes ended--I didn't expect it, and that was excellent. I think Louise Fitzhugh tied up all the ends very well, and makes some excellent moral points for kids to think about. Another issue in this book is the extreme rudeness of Harriet's behavior--her behavior in the first book didn't bother me at all--but in this book it did. At least her extreme rudeness is pointed out to kids for them to think about (I'm not talking about her spying on people--I'm talking about the way she SPEAKS to people, and the way she treats her FRIENDS). Even though the book disturbed me, I felt it WAS well-written, and had some important points to make. I would recommend it, but would suggest parents read it, too, and discuss it with their children."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"I am a creative writing major in college and I reread Louise Fitzhugh's Harriet The Spy, Sport and especially The Long Secret over and over again. Her writing is unflinching, honest, observant and doesn't make young adults &quot;childlike&quot;. Her characters are so very real, they express the good, the bad, and the funny of being human."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"The Long Secret By Louise Fitzhugh contains many surprising twists and turns. It takes place in the small town of Water Mill during the summer and is about a 12- year- old spy named Harriet and her best friend, Beth Ellen, who are trying to figure out who is leaving mysterious notes everywhere.The story begins when Harriet and Beth Ellen are at the local supermarket buying some cookies. After they pay the clerk for the cookies, she reaches into the cash register's drawer to give them change, but instead of pulling out money, she pulls out a note. Written awkwardly on the scrap of paper with a red crayon are the words \`Jesus Hates You'. This is only the start of a whole barrage of letters that turn up, each with an appropriate saying on them that matches the life of the person who receives them. Although the letters did match the person receiving them, I found some of the religious messages to be offensive and strong. When Harriet finally gets one, she decides that it is time to take action, and she drags Beth Ellen, and Jamie, another friend of hers, into the middle of the situation.Since most of the notes have religious sayings on them, Harriet comes to the conclusion that a religious fanatic is leaving them all over town, and her first suspect is a country girl, Jessie Mae, who is obsessed with the Bible. In case her first suspicion isn't right, she even has a back-up suspect - The Preacher. The Preacher is a tall, African American man who Harriet thinks could easily be slipping the notes into cash registers or dresser drawers because of his innocent appearance and his humble kindness to all. Even though her assumptions about the note writer may be right, I don't think that Harriet should be quick to jump to conclusions and suspect people of doing something just because they like to do an activity or have a certain style.However, solving a mystery isn't easy, and by the middle of the story Harriet has only a few clues to help her determine the culprit. The plot thickens when Beth Ellen's parents, Zeeney and Wallace, come back from Paris and want to take her with them when they return. In this situation, I was surprised how their coming made Beth Ellen stronger, and I liked the fact that she handled the situation well, even when Zeeney got a little out of control.As Harriet and her friends uncover more pieces to the puzzle, they also uncover themselves and reveal characteristics that they have never shown before. Will they be able to solve the mystery, or will they be stumped and forced to break up their investigation? Check out The Long Secret to find out the exciting details and the enticing ending!I enjoyed this book because it had suspense and action, and I recommend that you read it if you like mysteries and want to know about Harriet's later adventures.Mary Kate LA-6"},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"If you loved HTS, you'll definitely love this book. Beth-Ellen was the last person I expected the brash, outspoken Harriet to form a friendship with. The descriptions of BE's jet-setting, superficial socialite of a mother and her fussy boyfriend are a scream! And the sign-writing culprit was the last person I suspected."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"My father gave me this book to read when he was our church librarian. My name is Beth Ellen so he thought it would be fun for me to read about another girl with my name. I was so hooked on this book that I read it over and over again. That was about twenty-five years ago. I have told my daughter about it but didn't think I would ever be able to find it again. Thanks Amazon! I can't wait for her to experience the same joy and excitement that I did when reading this book!"},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"I enjoyed every bit of Harriet the Spy as a girl, and, while it made me anxious to read (because you knew she was going to get caught!), re-read it many times.But The Long Secret is the book I continue to re-read as a grown woman. It shares the same strengths of great character portraits, plotting, and sense of place that \\"Harriet\\" had, but this sequel has a more languid, mysterious, quirky feel, and dares to leave things hanging. Set on the shores of the wealthy New Yorkers' summer beach playgrounds (and back in the days before they were discreetly luxurious, before they became overrun with bourgeois ridiculousness), it is the perfect book to read in the waning weeks of summer.Or to re-read."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"The Long Secret is the sequel to Harriet The Spy. Published in 1965, it is primarily the story of Beth Ellen Hansen, Harriet's schoolmate and summertime best friend in Water Mill, on Long Island. The setting is rather exclusive: all the characters seem to be highly affluent (even Mama Jenkins drives a Maserati), living in a summer resort with a country club, large beach houses, and multitudes of servants. But the story is universal and even more applicable now than forty five years ago.Beth Ellen's parents are divorced. Her father never appears, and her mother is a flighty Society lady who is constantly traveling and partying. Beth Ellen lives with her grandmother and leads a quiet, not very happy life with no aims or ambitions until one day when her mother shows up and starts taking her in hand. Beth Ellen, who is already starting to rebel as she begins to mature physically and emotionally, learns to stand up for herself and acquires new direction and focus.Harriet M. Welsch is primarily an observer in this book, but she still keeps a notebook and continues to make some astute and often funny comments on the foibles of the adult world. Janie Gibbs also returns, plus there are several new characters, primarily the Jenkins family, eccentric Southerners who provide some comic relief.The themes of friendship and growing maturity are well conceived and described here, as are some fine reflections on religious belief, and the lampooning of High Society is absolutely hilarious. It will appeal to children who are starting to recognize that the world they are growing into is less orderly than they might have once believed. Adults who read it again after many years will remember why they loved it as children and also recognize deeper insights they may not have fully understood before."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"I liked this book; it had many interesting and complex parts. First, one of my opinions- I think that Harriet talks very rudely to her friends and to others. She really needs to tone down her emotions and act more like the sensible and polite girl that I know she can be.Ok... now for the actual summary part of my review...The book mostly focuses on Beth Ellen, Harriet's \\"summer\\" best friend when Sport and Jamie aren't around. Through out the story, Beth Ellen and Harriet make new friends (like Jessie Mae, a poor country girl), and Beth Ellen's long-lost mother comes back from Paris with her new husband, Wallace. By the end of the tale, together, Beth Ellen and Harriet have solved a huge mystery and become closer than they were before.

I wish Louise Fitzhugh would have written more. Louise Fitzhugh is a great author, and her books will always be classics in my library."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"This was my favorite Young Adult novel. I had a very battered, much-loved copy which I read over and over throughout junior high. Contrary to the synopsis above, this book was not really about Harriet (although she is present). The main character is her friend Beth Ellen who is very shy, wants to be an artist, and must deal with the arrival of her flighty, glamorous(?) mother whom she has never known. A wonderful story for anyone who has known shyness"},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"\\"Harriet the Spy\\" is undoubtedly one of the best children books ever...the sequel \\"\\"Sport\\" however was a disappointment and did not match HTS fine standards. I therefore hesitated before starting to read \\"the Long Secret\\", but this time I was not sorry (the right reading order should have been HTS, The Long Secret and then Sport).The long secret holds the same kind of eccentric, incredible characters as HTS. Especially lovable are Bible loving Jessie Mae, her fat brother Norman and their incredible Mama Jenkins (including their outstanding way of speech - supposedly Mississippi style). The Long Secret also gives us a special look on Harriet as she looks \\"from the side\\". Once you see Harriet through Beth Ellen eyes, you also see all her flaws, although she remains one of a kind ...; This \\"round look\\", the ability to portray a character as a real human person with qualities and flaws is one of the writer's remarkable abilities.The heroine of this book is Beth Ellen, a shy timid person who does not talk or act a lot and is usually a very passive friend to Harriet. Beth Ellen undergoes an inner growth through this book and Harriet too learns to regard her friend in a different light.Not all of my questions were answered at the end of The Long Secret and the ending seems a little too simplistic to accept, but all in all a fun read."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"Just as some children go to bed with a teddy bear, many times I have gone to bed hugging my old worn copy of The Long Secret. I thought the story was wonderful when I read it as a child and I still think it is wonderful when I read it as an adult. I loved the individuality that showed in all the characters. Most of all, I wanted more than anything to spend a summer at Harriet's beach house. I'm still trying to find out if a place called Water Mill actually exists. So many times, I've pictured myself riding my bike on the country roads described in this book and I've thought of sneaky visits to The Shark's Tooth Inn. This book will always be one of my fondest childhood memories."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"Harriet the Spy is growing up, still trying to observe people and connect the dots. She's usually in such a hurry that she misses information that's right in front of her. At her family's summer place in Long Island, she spends time with Beth Ellen. Beth Ellen's reintroduction to her mother is a central part of the story, as is one of the most frank and funny discussion about periods. Another wry, honest episode in the life of HTS."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"My 10 year old son has enjoyed all the books in the Harriet the Spy series."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"I bought this and another Harriet the Spy books for my grandaughter.She has told me that she likes them very much. She is 10 years old and loves mystery stories. These books were recommended by a friend."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"this is a sequel to the acclaimed \\"harriet the spy\\" with the eternal characters of harriet m. welsch and co. though a bit dated (it was banned for some time because of some mentions of having periods and showing certain adults in an unkind light) it is still hard hitting, cynical, and forever immortalized. harriet's friend beth ellen is the main heroine, although harriet has a meaningful talk about religion (?!.) basically biblical notes are being given to people around town that really hit home, and when harriet finds out who it is, she is amazed. the book shows beth ellen's journey from \\"mouse\\" to an independant girl. it also showcases harriet from a side point of view (being both incredibly rude and lovable at the same time) and a new character, Jessie Mae Jenkins. The entire family is from missisippi and jessie mae has some relevations about her brand of religion from her mentor, the preacher. the book is cynical in some ways about grownups (like beth ellen's mother) but that's the whole point."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"There's no question that this is a \\"sequel\\" to Harriet the Spy, but a fan of the first book shouldn't go in expecting more of the same. The heart of this book is not Harriet but Beth Ellen, and her shyer, more introspective nature give The Long Secret a completely different vibe. The result is a touching, beautifully observed book about one of the most challenging times of life: the point where you're just emerging from childhood and start seeing adults -- and yourself -- more clearly. It's a very funny book and a compelling mystery, but it's not just fun and games. I found the emotional currents of this book quite intense as a child, but I wouldn't trade it for anything."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"I remember finding The Long Secret much more content-rich than HTS, and reading it a few times. I felt like Fitzhugh wasn't talking down to me as a young reader. She wasn't afraid to introduce disagreeable (Zeeny) and strange characters and situations, she wasn't afraid to show Harriet's less agreeable traits, and she wasn't afraid to showcase a character who's staunchly introverted. The mix held my attention for much longer than the (I found) forgettable HTS, whose nursemaid's name irked me (how do we pronounce \\"Ole\\"? Is it a first name? What kind? Scandanavian? I couldn't get past this).And hooray for the publishers for not succumbing to the irritating practice of republishing young adult classics with photos on the cover, as opposed to the original drawings. Don't tell me how Davey / Deenie / Katherine looks!"},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"Yes, I too had a spy notebook in grade school and junior high. I was a huge fan of Harriet the Spy, and still am -- it encouraged me to be a writer in my adult life. I remember discovering this sequel quite by accident, and being utterly taken by it. It's funny, smart, and mysterious. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"First off: \\"The Long Secret\\" is no \\"Harriet the Spy.\\"Don't get me wrong. It's a good book. Louise Fitzhugh is a pretty amazing writer and there is no doubt she did some interesting things with the form. She does children like nobody else. You have to read her books to understand that.No. The thing is. \\"The Long Secret\\" is a little like that period just prior to adolescence. You're not a kid and you're not a teenager. You're lodged, briefly, in a place that no-one has found a name for yet. It's neither a good place or a bad place, either. It's just a sort of neither-one-thing-or-another place. \\"The Long Secret\\" is a book that cannot make up its mind quite what it wants to be.\\"The Long Secret\\" is, to all intents and purposes, a sequel to \\"Harriet the Spy\\" (and as such a book I put off reading for YEARS because, let's face it, what can live up to \\"Harriet the Spy\\"? - it's like making a sequel to \\"Casablanca\\" or something).Harriet is spending the summer at the beach with her best friend Beth Ellen. Somebody is leaving mysterious notes around - notes that act like mean fortune cookies telling people what they are really like, notes that appear to be paraphrasing the Bible (the mean fortune cookie almanac). Harriet, as you would expect, is on the case.Or she would be, if that was the story that \\"The Long Secret\\" wanted to tell. As often as not, we find ourselves watching Harriet ride home from Beth Ellen's front porch. Beth Ellen lives with her rich grandma. Her mother lives in Europe and can't be fussed raising a child. Tagging along with Harriet on the beach-version of her spy route, Beth Ellen looks in through the windows of a bar and watches a piano player called Bunny. She also finds herself caught up with a religious family, in particular a little girl called Jessie Mae (who Beth Ellen maybe likes more than Harriet for a little while, maybe, maybe, she's not sure). \\"The Long Secret\\" is Beth Ellen's book. The association with Harriet M Welsh does her a disservice because you long to compare this book with Harriet's book and the two are just fundamentally different fish.Mix the return of Beth Ellen's mother from Europe, Harriet's ruminations on God and faith, a kid called Norman who can't park cars and an old guy called The Preacher who lives in a shack in the woods and you start to feel like: enough already.There are lots of good things here. The problem is that all of the good things feel like they have emerged from three other slightly more sensible books."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"This book, and its &quot; companion&quot; book, Harriet the Spy, are probably my favorite books in the world. Ever since I first read them, I have gone around my town,spying on people and taking notes(top-secret ones,of course). Everyone,child or adult, should read this book,on my opinion."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"How can anyone not LOVE this book? I can't imagine growing up without having read it, and still, like so many other fans, reread it and reread it faithfully. I've never loved a character more than Harriet. And how can you not love Zeeney and Wallace? hup. This is a terrifically funny and warm book about friendship, acceptance, and growing up. Excellently written and true to life."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"Don't get me wrong, \\"Harriet the Spy,\\" was one of my all time favorite books (and movies), growing up. I'm almost 26 now and had always wanted to read \\"The Long Secret,\\" So after re-reading Harriet, I went to the bookstore and ordered myself a copy. Well, at first it wasn't so bad, but there really wasn't any real point to the story. Harriet hadn't matured much at all, and to make matters worse, really offensive and hostile notes were left all over the place. I am also a Christian and find it offensive that the phrase \\"Jesus Hates You,\\" should be allowed to be published in a Children's book. This is especially true in this day and age, when almost any threat has the potential to turn violent.Skip this one."},{"Title":"The Long Secret","review":"just didn't like this book. it seem to be crude and it's really a book for girls only."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding simply holds up as an excellent, if not classic, author no matter what subject he researched and pursued. I couldn't put this novel down. Golding takes his readers on a journey into a world seen through the eyes, visions, and emerging language expressions of primitive man. His sensitively drawn characters, whose language is limited, form \`pictures' in their minds and use this mental illumination to guide them to food, to their seasonal homes and to acquaint them to possible dangers. The descriptions are marvelous: cold, wet, hungry, dependence on a sense of smell (you find yourself sniffing a lot), stones for weapons, hyenas signaling a kill for the band of our earliest ancestors to steal, recipes cooked in a style that remind one of haggis (no refrigerator raiding is elicited in this read by the way) and a lush plant entwined forest of the early spring replete with mystical ice women to be worshipped.Within the pages, the author's imagination, ideas, and symbols are used at their best removing the reader from the world of 2001 into a consideration of the earth and stars alone, untouched by any sort of technology. Essentially it is Lok and his small Neanderthal band that are faced with other humans, unlike themselves, for the first time. The 'other' (homo-sapiens) is armed with bows and arrows, sharpened tools made from bone and an ability to cross rivers and lakes by rowing logs. Golding possibly was inspired by the scientific find of a primitive people who could cross the water discovered sometime in the early 1950's. In any event this is a story that readers will find to be absorbing and has the potential to provide an insight into a daily life of a society devoted to survival with only the earth as a guide to how. Wiliam Golding tells a stirring, astonishing story with a writer's technical virtuosity applied as only he can do."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I haven't been so emotionally involved in a book since...well, for a long time.This novel is about a family group of Neanderthals who travel to their cave for the warmer part of the year and meet there a group of modern men. The resulting events are as intense and terrifying for the reader as they are for the Neanderthals. Because Golding shows everything from their point of view, we are often left as puzzled and uncomprehending as they. The descriptions of objects the we know about -- bows and arrows, boats, alcohol -- are written as the Neanderthals saw them. The actions of the modern humans -- their rituals and hierarchy -- Golding makes successfully foreign -- but when we sit and think about what we've read, we realize, wait, I *know* this, this is what humans do.The characterization is achieved deftly and sensitively, Lok and Fa are compelling as is their fate. Prehistory was very likely *not* like this -- but the themes stand, and this book is powerful.I do not think Golding is doing a disservice to our species, because this is how we are. He is telling a damn good, if tragic, story. I will re-read this book over and over again, I know. Golding is truly great, and this book is greater, in my opinion, than the oft-assigned &quot;Lord of the Flies.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This amazingly inventive piece of fiction takes on some of the same themes the author dealt with in Lord of the Flies, but in a surprising way. In this novel, the protagonists are the last of the Neandrathals who are in deadly conflict with emergent Homo Sapiens for their survival. Golding imagines these people as being essentially pre-verbal and it is a testiment to his skill as a writer that he can create effective characters without the tool of dialogue. Because of this convention, and the need to keep the story from the Neandrathal's (not quite human) point of view, it takes some time for the reader to achieve an understanding of what is happening and why. It becomes, nevertheless, a very moving story and one of the more inventive tales in serious modern literature.As a companion piece from the current Homo Sapien point of view, one might want to read Beards novel about a hypothetical new jump in evolution, Darwin's Radio."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This book is complex but worth the effort if you have an IQ of more than room-temperature.The comment by a previous reviewer is worth taking up:&quot;And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.&quot; Well, I'd agree, strongly. But it's not as simple as that: the Homo Sapiens Sapiens in The Inheritors are not shown as deliberately and strategically wiping out the last Homo Sapiens Neanderthalus. Rather, they are terrified of them. They think they are defending themselves against horrifying demons - why do they submit to the discipline of the whip to drag the canoe up the portage? Plainly they are half out of their minds with terror, which the Neanderthals cannot comprehend. Further, the Neanderthals, though gentle and innocent, are plainly inadequate. The process of their replacement by the Homo Sapiens Sapiens, or Cro-Magnards, is cruel but it is not morbid. The Neanderthals, it is clearly demonstrated, are at a dead-end (they are only a vestige of a tribe at the beginning of the story). The survival of the Neanderthal infant means some of their gentleness and innocence may survive into the new world. It is actually a relief to get into the Cro-Magnards' minds in the final chapter after the limitation of having to see everything from a Neanderthal point of view. The Cro-Magnards are at one point called &quot;the people of the fall&quot; - in religious terms they are the people of the &quot;Fall&quot; indeed - Postlapsarian Man. Unlike the Neanderthals, they do have knowledge of good and evil, and we see at the end even the rudiments of conscience - which is not to say the end of the Neanderthals is not utterly tragic.Like all Golding's earlier works, this is the exploration of difficult moral dilemnas. There are lessons there but they are not easy."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding's better-known \\"Lord of the Flies\\" examines humanity at its most primitive, and creates a painful but inarguable image. He does that again in \\"The Inheritors,\\" but this time from an outsider's view of humankind. He takes the unique perspective of Lok, a Neandertal, in the brief period when our two species coexisted.The greatest achievement of this book may be in Golding's creation of a whole mentality that is intelligent and articulate, far from the human norm but still comprehensible. His Neandertals are visual people, who think in images. They reason by matching the here-and-now to visual memories. To understand someone means 'to see their picture.' (I've known visual artists who almost seem to work this way.) Their animistic world is a place where fire may wake up, and where a log decides how to place itself in the river. Despite the harshness of their world, they are gentle, affectionate, and hopeful. \\"People understand each other,\\" says one, early on.Although heartfelt by its speaker, the book treats that statement with cynicism and disdain. Homo sapiens arrive, clever, complex, and surrounded by mysterious made objects. Saying much more would say too much - but H. sapiens is a very poor neighbor.Although I like this book, it could have been proportioned differently. I would have looked for more of the interaction with H. sapiens, and described Lok's people more succinctly. I'm not the Nobel winner, though, and Golding is. It's a meaningful, if discouraging look at what being human is all about, from the viewpoint of someone who doesn't.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The basic requirement of reading is to remember and connect. I would ask those who have a distaste for such activity to refrain from criticing a book for its ambition and complication. To write successfuly through the eyes of a species whose experience of the world is different from ours is a difficult feat and one which remarkably, Golding has managed to pull off with both relative spareness and grace. Golding's &quot;ancestor bashing&quot; is, in truth, nothing more than a reminder and exploration of a given truth- the &quot;darkness&quot; in the heart of man and a human history full of violence and savagery. Moreover Golding's exploration is complicated- no simple black and white message is being propagated. The carving that one of the Homo Sapiens Sapiens works on at the end of the novel symbolises a future where the surviving Neaderthal will interbreed with the new race of Homo Sapiens. The idea is that modern man is comprised of both the innocent and caring nature that characterises the Neaderthals and the immorality of the more &quot;advanced&quot; species. Darkness visible by its very nature shows both light and darkness."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors takes you back to a time when the gentle Neanderthals became faced with the emergance of Homo-Sapiens, a collision which could only favour the Darwinian imperative of the survival of the fittest.The story unfolds in such a way as to make you identify with our Neanderthal cousins, who, skilled in their own environment but lacking in technology, must face the sheer ignorance of a more technologically advanced &quot;master-race&quot; which sees them as nothing more than strange and dangerous animals.The poignancy of this unequal contest is conveyed in a way which none the less makes Homo-Sapiens bad by accident rather than design. A lesson to all in these days of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; and fear of those from other cultures. A haunting morality tale which has you praying for &quot;the other side&quot; to win."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I read this book about six years ago and I still frequently think about it. The book is brilliant and as savage and ruthless, in its own way, as Shakespeare's Lear. I actually read the book in the first place because I had gotten interested in real Neanderthals: what did they look like, what were they like, where and how did they live, why did they die? etc. I soon discovered that these questions were largely unanswerable; frustrated, I remembered that Golding had written a \\"Neanderthal novel,\\" and, science failing, I turned to art and read it.One of the chief virtues of the book is its invention of \\"Neanderthal consciousness,\\" a rather uncanny and striking sensibility which is definitely superior to animals, and definitely inferior to humans. We are drawn into the intimate--outer and inner--details of their world, and in the end of course they die. Humans populate the book as well, but in a far different way. I cannot say too much more without giving away a critical feature of the book's structure, except to say that the reader has no idea how good the book is until he/she finishes it. You must read it all, and then you will know.Why do the human beings behave the way they do in the book? It is not really possible to answer this question. The eye cannot see itself, and we who are human cannot see....this."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors is a fascinating fable of the time in history (not so long ago - only five hundred generations or so before you, valued reader), when Neanderthals co-existed with homosapiens. Golding brings all his imaginative powers to bear to imagine himself in the Neanderthal consciousness. Simple named characters such as Lok and Mal and Fa witness strange things happening in their limited world - such as the disappearance of their precious log bridge across the river. Horrific things start happening, which shake their world view, their limited conceptions of events as 'pictures' rather than a human consciousness, comunicated in linguistic form. This is the era of the end of their people.Golding draws the human conquerors as advanced only in the sense that they have mobilised natural resources to more sophisticated ends - such as hollowing out trees to make boats, and developing more sophisticated tools than the rudimentary Neanderthal implements. Morally, they are far more savage than the primitives they displace - a cruel, selfish species who will kill those alien to themselves, capture their young and become inheritors of the earth. The Neanderthals are an endearing, enclosed people with tender rituals of caring for each other and burying their dead. Their knowledge of things is fatally limited, and they struggle to express their horror of what is happening to them as they cannot muster up the language. They rely on their simple religion, Oa, the earth goddess who is a far more gentle and tender influence than the harsh pragmatic religion of the homosapiens with their savage stag mutilating rituals.By the end, the last Neanderthal is hunched in a ball, gibbering with grief and bewilderment as he has witnessed the end of his people. The humans, meanwhile, sail aimlessly in their log boats on the river, struggling themselves to make sense of their aims and purpose in a world without structure or meaning.Thirty thousand years later, are things any different?"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I read THE INHERITORS back in the early 60's when I was a home mother with six kids.

I have been asked to nominate a book of the 60's to Pinellas County, Fl. libraries for discussion and have chosen THE INHERITORS.

When this reviewer was a sophomore English student, I can assure him that I failed to enjoy this book. My teacher thought this book was one of the all-time literary greats. I just thought it was boring.And now I have an even bigger reason to dislike this book. I happen to hate reading screeds that trash the author's own ancestors. I'm sure homo sapiens were not perfect, but please show me a race or culture of people who are.My plea to high school English teachers everywhere: If you must require your students to read Golding, have them read LORD OF THE FLIES. It's marginally better than THE INHERITORS and, if I remember correctly, does not include ancestor bashing."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Unfortunately, I have been forced to read this novel for my English class. It is extremely difficult due to the fact that the main characters haven't mastered a little thing we like to call language yet. Because Golding refuses to help the reader along with proper narration, the outcome is nothing short of a migrane. Just wanted to give all of you presently sane people out there a little warning before throwing all of that sanity away attempting to decipher meaning in this book."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"\\"...It seemed to end a little abruptly; I felt like I was just beginning to get to know the humans, and would have liked to know more about them, if not in further chapters, then perhaps in a sequel. Most people are probably only familiar with an earlier novel of Golding's, Lord of the Flies, since it seems to be a required reading staple in high schools across the country. I really enjoyed reading that one when I took senior English, and I'm not sure now why it took me so long to read something else of his. I definitely recommend this for something a little out of the ordinary on your reading list, especially since this is Golding's favorite of all his own work.\\"For full review, please visit me at Here Be Bookwyrms on Blogger!herebebookwyrms dot blogspot dot com"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I wouldn't have read the book if i didnt need it for a university class. However I did enjoy it. Won't read it again but it was good for a quick read."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Make this a 2.5 star review because I\`ll give Golding the benefit of the doubt that his writing is way over my head. No reason to mark his novel down just because my poor Cro-Magnon pea brain couldn't follow it. However, I expected better execution in the writing from a Nobel Prize winner.The story line and point of view are good. If this isn't a parable about the effect that human contact has with any other species, environment, or place, I don't know what is. Golding gets points for making me ashamed of my own species as he describes what happens when the peaceful Neanderthal world collides with Homo sapiens in very dramatic and unpleasant ways.Perhaps that is his point; the Neanderthals were pushed out of existence because they were not as intellectually developed as their Homo sapiens \`Inheritors'.I caught on early that the Neanderthals' \`pictures' were personal ideas and memories, and the \`shared pictures' are ideas and memories transmitted telepathically. However, Golding tries to describe these pictures in a contrivance of words instead of pictures, and decides to constrain the description of the pictures to the individual's limited perception. That was a noble goal, and done well. However, when he cannot succeed via that route in describing events, he inserts an expository third-person (writer)point of view. That completely confused my pea brain about what was happening. Some scenes are terribly confusing because of this.I likened my experience of reading \`The Inheritors' to that of Anthony Burgess' \`A Clockwork Orange', which IMHO was a more successful writing experiment. Burgess at least provided us with a glossary to define the futurespeak of his Droog culture. Golding could have invented a word-picture map.I cannot believe that schools are recommending this as a reading assignment. But then in my day they were forcing the dreadful \`Catcher in the Rye' on us."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"As a fan of Lord of the Flies and someone very interested in the subject matter of this novel - the interface between anatomically modern humans and Neanderthals - I was really looking forward to reading this book. Sadly, it failed to deliver either in terms of the story and writing quality I expect of Golding or as an interesting exploration of its topic.Golding's portrayal of the Neanderthals - the main characters of the book through whose eyes we experience its events - suffers from outdated notions of these intelligent and resourceful hominins as bestial if likable buffoons. One wonders how these dunderheads survived the harshest imaginable conditions for hundreds of thousands of years.Apart from that, I think Golding had the right idea, imagining a group of anatomically modern humans appearing as newcomers and coming into conflict with the indigenous Neanderthals. It's fertile ground for drama and Golding does not fail completely to exploit it. But as another reviewer commented, I think his ambition exceeded his grasp, and whether it's because he chose to imagine his main character as a Palaeolithic \\"Rain Man\\" or because his literary powers weren't chugging on all cylinders, Golding did not attain the clarity, coherence, or emotional impact I expected of him. Unlike fine wine, this book has not aged well."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"One might think that Aesop could have covered such an elementary principle with a more direct and poignant simplicity and essentialy kept it more moving. Perhaps I am just too much a fan of the haiku and other displays of Eastern efficiency and Golding's overdone style is simply not my interest, but there is only a certain degree one can take the &quot;we are simple people so we must burden a perceptive reader with our intellectual baggage&quot; novelty just so far before it becomes a chore to read.One more thing, on the back of my book there is a quotation from the New York Times Book Review which reinforces my disdain for their apparent practice of reading a summary of any classic author before proceeding to pelt him with praise. &quot;His prose is forceful and compact. He tells a rousing good story.&quot; The story is laborious, the prose is detailed and soft, not forceful, and I can not imagine anyone in their right mind declaring his prose &quot;compact&quot;. It's laughable.I suppose I should read &quot;The Lord of the Flies&quot; before my opinion of Golding falls too far.The only reason I didn't give it 1 star is because I've read some truly horrific books."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"At a first glance the book just seems to tell a story that kind of makes little sense at points but is very baisic all in all. This first notion isn't true at all. When you read it over carefully and study it you start to get a sense of that great complexity of the book. If you have to read this book for a class make sure you read it a couple of times it really isn't what it seems."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding's \\"The Inheritors\\" was originally published in 1955, and was his first book after \\"Lord of the Flies\\" made his name. Unfortunately, while his first novel was intriguing, well-written and suspenseful, \\"The Inheritors\\" is one of the most bizarre and confused novels of its time.There's no real story here. Neanderthal man encounters cro-magnon, and is killed off. While it sounds like an exciting premise, this book actually consists of little more than endless, repetitious, vague landscapes, repeated over and over and over again. These landscapes, which describe each and every leaf, rock, patch of dirt or sparkle of light on the water of a flowing river, take up literally sixty percent of this brief but agonizingly slow moving novel's pages. Along with the landscapes, we are told in painfully tedious detail of each character's physical movements as he or she walks among the minutely described leaves, rocks and patches of dirt, while looking at the sparkle of the light on the river. These details take up most of the rest of the book. There is very little here that actually constitutes narrative; instead, there is only description and accumulation of sentences.The two main characters, Fa and Lok, are quite different. While Fa is a smart and resourceful Neanderthal, Lok, who stands at the center of the descriptions, is extraordinarily dense and slow-witted, even for a caveman. Within a few pages, this reader found Lok annoying and exasperating. Why Golding chose to make him the center of the book is a mystery.One last point. This novel seems to have been edited severely (and not particularly carefully) from a longer manuscript, since many pages and the entire second-to-last chapter don't flow together in a coherent fashion. This only adds to the book's inertia and mystification. It's amazing that this was ever published in any form.I really wanted to like \\"The Inheritors.\\" Unfortunately, I had to force myself to finish it and ended up loathing it as much as any book I've ever read."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"William Golding likes to kill you with detail in this book and he comes pretty close! There is one part about a fox and you wish that you would just die. The characters are confusing and the book is just bad!"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I'm reading this reviews and I'm just apalled. So it's boring isn't it? What did you expect for Christsakes, fireworks? It's just a bloody book and it's full of letters. In a way it's not finished until you read it. And it's up to you to bring it to life in your own brain. Have you got one? Stick to Swcharzenager."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"This book frustrated me to no end. While I can respect the endeavor to write a book from the perspective of prehistoric man, it just didn't follow through. While Golding's theme of dichotomous man was intriguing, switching from character to character, not clarifying who was who, and the generally unengaging characters made this a very average reading experience for me."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The story of the gentle, mostly vegetarian Neanderthal tribe that is all but obliterated in a meeting with wandering Homo sapiens. Told almost entirely from the viewpoint of Lok, a slightly dim Neanderthal \\"with many words and no pictures,\\" it's an interesting story and a sad one. But the power of the tale is softened considerably by Golding's laborious, descriptive prose. At times I found it very hard to understand what was going on, as the Homo sapiens' activities - drinking wine, portaging boats, arguing - were described in Lok's limited terms at length, with little clarity. Discounting those passages, the novel was a good one, capped off quite amazingly with passages in two more narrative voices. First we see Lok as a hairy \\"creature,\\" an \\"it,\\" and then finally we hear the story from the view of one of the humans, who, it turns out, are as scared and confused as the Neanderthals, whom they consider fierce devils. A skillful comment on how far humans have come from a natural state of innocence, acceptance and wonder."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Golding takes us back to one of the earliest clashes between Homo sapiens and another culture, that of Homo neanderthalensis. In doing so, Golding seems to be pointing out that humanity's distrust of, and often violent response to, alien beings and ideas goes back a long, long time. The Neanderthals are the protagonists for most of this story and we see virtually all the action through their minds. They have a different way of thinking about the world in which they live and in communicating about it. They are the innocents who have the misfortune to encounter an encampment of Cro Magnon men. At the very end, Golding switches the point of view to the Cro Magnons and provides us with a different take on events.As a teacher, I've found this to be a terrific novel for teaching about the clash of cultures, fearing what we don't understand, different ways of seeing, thinking about and imagining the world in which we live. Students never fail to enjoy it."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"The Inheritors tells the story of a small group of Neanderthals, primarily focusing on Lok and Fa, as they encounter strange \\"new people\\" who walk upright, have little body hair, shoot pointed twigs through the air, and ride across the water on hollow logs. The Neanderthal tribe includes a young girl and a baby (\\"the new one\\") who end up with the new people. Lok and Fa must face their fears of the new people as they try to bring the girl and baby home.The word that kept coming to mind as I read and thought about this book was \\"clever.\\" Writing about life from the Neanderthal perspective poses a challenge, and Golding used some clever devices to describe the limitations of primitive beings. Golding's Neanderthals communicate by gesture and empathy as much as by language. Their names are simple compared to the polysyllabic names of the humans. The Neanderthals live very much in the here and now; they aren't good at planning; when they talk about doing something new they say they have a \\"picture\\" of it, as if they are having a vision. They search for food only when they feel hunger; if they're sated they don't bother to store food for the future. They prefer not to eat meat but they will if one animal has been killed by another; they don't want the \\"blame\\" of causing an animal's death. They have a touching burial ritual but they don't appear to contemplate the possibility of an afterlife.A startling event occurs toward the end of the novel that makes the whole thing rather depressing, particularly for those who (perhaps unrealistically) expect humans to behave more civilly than Neanderthals. Golding may be saying that the simple decency of primitive life was supplanted by early humans who (like those who followed them) lacked respect for other forms of life, killed ruthlessly, and used their wits to advance at the expense of others. If Golding is saying that these are human traits, the product of an evolutionary imperative, I don't know that the point is particularly profound (although it might have seemed so in 1955 when the book was first published). Still, the story illustrates that lesson in an entertaining way. The last chapter shifts to the point of view of the humans: again, a clever way to distinguish between the dying past and the evolving present, and a device that adds insight by demonstrating that the human's view of the Neanderthal may not have been much different than the Neanderthal's view of the human.According to the cover blurb, some critics think The Inheritors is Golding's best work (and Golding apparently thought so himself). I preferLord of the Flies, but The Inheritors is worth reading. I would give it 4 1/2 stars is Amazon made that option available."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Lord of the Flies is of course among the toughest acts to follow, and though this second William Golding novel does not match its immortal greatness, it is excellent in itself and would be many writers' best. Fans of Lord will most likely enjoy it, as the misanthropic viewpoint is carried over, and several themes are similar. However, in the first sign of the great diversity that would characterize Golding's fiction, The Inheritors is very different in setting, characters, dialogue, and nearly everything else.Where Lord made waves by using supposedly innocent children to illustrate evil, this focuses on an even more primitive group - the last surviving Neanderthals. Golding's skill truly comes into play here; he uses a limited narrative perspective, an extremely simple style, and broken dialogue to portray the Neanderthals' world. This is of course almost entirely speculative, but there is great verisimilitude; we see how Neanderthals' lives may have been in every aspect from speech to relationships to social functions. Golding pulls a brilliant trick by throwing us into the story with no introduction, leading many to assume primitive humans are featured. However, it eventually becomes clear that they are a prior step on evolution's ladder, which may first lead to strange surprise. Soon, though, we come to identify with them because of thoughts and feelings that, though far from civilized, are very much human; in particular, the depiction of love is one of literature's least conventional yet one of its most moving.The novel would be interesting for this alone, but it goes further by bringing in early modern humans and vividly dramatizing the ensuing conflict. As one might expect from an author with Golding's pessimistic reputation, the results are dark. Humans recklessly destroy the Neanderthals without realizing their significance or the magnitude of what they have done. They indeed fear the Neanderthals with superstition and ignorant assumptions that they are ostensibly too advanced to make. Along with lack of empathy, these factors get to the heart of Golding's bleak view of humanity, which is put forth less powerfully but more subtly than in Lord. Those stirred by the latter will find themselves agreeing again with Golding's tragic vision, while those who did not take to it for various reasons may be newly convinced.The unique style makes for difficult reading, especially early on, but I strongly encourage anyone having difficulty to persevere. As nearly always in such cases, it soon becomes nearly second nature, and the book is certainly great enough to be worth it. Highly emotional yet extremely thought-provoking, this is one of the rare works that can make one think as easily as it can make one cry. This combination is the key to Golding's greatness, and The Inheritors is a preeminent example."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Since reading \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" I've stumbled over other Golding titles in hopes I would find the same brevity, clarity, and thought-provoking concepts. \\"The Spire\\" came close, but lacked the imaginative setting. \\"Pincher Martin\\" had the setting, but became so myopic as to be disorienting, eventually losing its footing.Along comes \\"The Inheritors.\\" Reviews here gave mixed signals: \\"A mess.\\" \\"A work of genius.\\" \\"Bored to tears.\\"As with Golding's bestselling masterpiece, \\"The Inheritors\\" pulls us quickly into the story of an isolated people. This time, instead of marooned school children, we discover Neanderthal types who are utterly believable and likeable. This alone shows Golding's genius. He makes us care about these characters and see them as people we can relate to, and yet he gives little by means of communication or description. They act like humans with true personalities. Soon, though, the group is threatened by another group of pale-skinned Others. These intruders seem equally bent on survival, but by more violent means if necessary.In many ways, this is an elongated short story. It could've been told in less pages, albeit with less ambience. While I admired the setting and characterization, I despaired for more plot, more action, more...something. In so many ways, this was a masterful book. In the end, however, it seemed to be a work of muddled beauty. It lacked impact. For those who love Golding's style, as I do, you will surely appreciate this book. For others, it may be a slight disappointment."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I too, am appalled by the number of ignorant, uninformed Amazon reviews of \\"The Inheritors\\" by William Golding. It must be his greatness that has created such a polarizing reaction. It's difficult for me to be objective, however, because I am in awe of this book, Golding's craft, and his work in general (I have also read \\"Lord of the Flies\\" and \\"Darkness Visible\\"). However incomprehensible or confusing one finds this text to be, the writing itself is transcendent. And if this book is difficult, then Western culture is definitely in a serious decline. All right, the Neanderthals had some trouble articulating. But please, this is a work of fiction. I am impressed by what must have been prodigious research on Golding's part to gain insight into the world of the Neanderthals, about whose specific reality modern man can only speculate. Whatever the Neanderthals lacked in intellectual capability, they more than made up for in their ability to use their senses, especially that of smell. As well as their possible telekinetic activity, which would have been unencumbered by more advanced intellectual processes. Golding's Neanderthals have an intuitive grasp of their world that is lacking in the modern human; on the other hand, the Neanderthals also live more wholly at the mercy of \\"Oa\\" (Mother Earth). The innocence of the Neanderthals is endearing, the \\"new people\\" Homo sapiens are dangerous and menacing. I felt compassion for the Neanderthals, and contempt for \\"the new people\\". The emotion that binds both species together is fear; -IE- Homo sapiens refer to the Neanderthals as \\"devils\\"; Fa tells Lok that \\"the new people are frightened of the air\\".The prose within \\"The Inheritors\\" is highly poetic; Golding paints an intricate portrait of a primeval landscape, such as our planet will probably never experience again; this description in itself adds to the atmosphere of suspense the author creates in this novel. It is not just that landscape in itself that is impressionable, but also how it is perceived by the Neanderthals and their \\"mind-dream-pictures\\"; -IE- the heightened colors seen by Lok during his hangover from the honey-drink. Golding shrouds his worlds in mystery to create a background of heightened effect, which becomes an integral part of the story; Richard Wagner used a similar technique by employing the orchestra as an additional \\"voice\\" in \\"Der Ring des Nibelungen\\". One of the major themes of this book focuses on the evolution of innocence into corruption; a problem, as other Amazon reviewers have noted, that still exists in humans today. This novel also points out the Machiavellian nature of mankind as whole, specifically in how that behaviour was starting to evolve in Golding's portrait of Homo sapiens. I actually found this work to be more engaging than the more commercially accessible LOTF (and certainly more so than the experimental-yet-inconsistent \\"Darkness Visible\\"). Golding is a recent discovery of mine, and I am looking forward to reading more of his work.Stephen C.

There is far more to them and far more interesting and exciting things about them that simply were missing in his story. Not a bad read, but did not come up to my expectations!"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"In reading some of these other reviews, I've discovered that a lot of people found this book worthwhile. I wouldn't say I didn't, but I found it very difficult to read. I held out to the bitter end because I sensed that there was something great here, but I must confess that I was very lost for pages at a time at certain points.As most of the other reviewers have mentioned, I was drawn to Golding's other books (this and The Spire) by my experience with The Lord of the Flies. I recognize that this book may be no less of a masterpiece, but it's unfortunate that it is so inaccessible. I believe that worthwhile things are worth the expenditure of time and effort but, unfortunately, the nature of the modern world is that we don't have unlimited resources to spend on every literary work we come across. So, for good or for bad, the more accessible ones usually win out.I do think I'll hold on to the book and give it a try again sometime down the road, but I have to say it wasn't one of my more memorable reading experiences (as Lord of the Flies definitely was many years ago when I was a youth).I'm reading The Spire now, and much of what I have said about The Inheritors above goes for that book, as well. I'm not through with Golding, though. I intend to seek out yet others of his novels to see what else he had to say."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Had I known how difficult THE INHERITORS was going into it, I probably wouldn't have read it. Please understand that when I say \\"difficult\\", I don't mean \\"mildly challenging\\", I mean \\"one of the four or five hardest novels I've read in my entire life\\"; if you can picture a version of Faulkner'sThe Sound and the Fury: The Corrected Textin which Benjy, instead of merely being the point of view character for the first quarter of the book, serves the same function for 90% of it, you'll have some idea of what I'm talking about.William Golding was a writer of enormous imagination and subtlety; he requires readers of this novel to empathize with the protagonist, Lok, in a fashion and to a degree that, as far as I'm aware, is unprecedented in fiction. He also never lets the narrative slip into the kind of facile misanthropy that I suspect a lesser writer would. Having said that, it would be disingenuos of me to suggest that I enjoyed this more than I would have if a skilled writer of popular fiction had handled the same subject. THE INHERITORS was, in sum, a fascinating story that for me was largely drained of pleasure by the effort required to figure out what the hell was going on. I wouldn't recommend this novel to anyone who isn't prepared to tackle a very challenging piece of work."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"Really enjoyed this book. Another cautionary tale of the great capacity of Homo Sapiens to destroy, plunder, and feel guilty about it all at the same time.The writing, as is typical with Golding, is sculptured and evocative."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I looked at this book from the perspective of its title. There is a question of the fate of the Neanderthals, and this book gives one possible, and credible answer. The Neanderthals and the Cro-Magnon were very, very different, according to Golding.The Neanderthals were simple, crude, and gentle, but with an understanding of their own mortality, and employing rituals for important occasions. They may have gone around unclothed, and with minimal tools, sometimes walking on all fours, but they were not \\"animals\\" in the common meaning of that term.The Cro-Magnon people had already been building boats, had used the bow-and-arrow as a formidable weapon, developed a more complex social structure, knew how to ferment honey into liquor, and had an understanding of protection against the elements. These two peoples never seemed to develop a common view of each other, with the Neanderthal having more curiosity than fear, and more fear than curiosity from the Cro-Magnon. In all, a credible look at ancient peoples."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"When asked to read this book my first reaction was, it looks so old, it can't be good. As i started to read it i found it different from all other books that i had read. The book is slow at the start but it does become more interesting as the author discribes the way the world is seen by Neanderthal man; 'pictures' are memories and they believe logs are alive and have a mind of their own. William Golding's view point on their world is really an eye opener and this is a book that should be read by all. Inspiring!"},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"I found this to be a very disjointed, and often confusing, description of the clash between two human groups. Golding missed a good opportunity to create a compelling case that the Neanderthals could not compete with the new, more advanced, humans."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"To approach this story as any other is to board a train going the wrong direction. Before reading the first page you have to understand that this tale begins before human intelligence, and that every thought, every sight, sound, smell, taste, and feeling is a simple interpretation by a lower order of being. Just as many have spoken of much of what is written in the Bible as things interpretted by those less technologically advanced as ourselves, Golding endeavors to strip away a million years of evolution and learning and to think like a neanderthal. To enjoy the book the reader must do the same.This is the tale of the extinction of a species and their lack of understanding of what is happening. In that the book is very contemporary. The neanderthals attempt to understand; to put what they see into ideas they can understand, just as we do the same today. Golding bears that philosophical point like a club. However, reading the thoughts of a primitive beast, as interpretted by Golding, isn't so easy as one would think and the story tends to be as hard to follow as a mountain trail. In the end though, I think it's a story worth reading."},{"Title":"The Inheritors","review":"A friend recommended this to me because I'm doing a thesis in philosophy of language and she felt I'd be interested in a book written from a Neanderthal point of view. She believed The Inheritors argued the Neanderthals were unable to compete against Cro Magnon men because their language didn't have words for cause-and-effect concepts, only static images. \\"Now there's a man holding a stick in his hand. Now there's a stick coming through the air at me. Now my arm hurts and is bleeding.\\" Cro Magnon man, by contrast, would describe the same incident as \\"A man attacked me with a spear\\". This is an exciting and ingenious idea.Unfortunately I found this book too slow, immensely difficult to follow at times and I thoroughly disliked the main character, the cowardly, boastful and ineffectual Lok. Had the brave and much smarter Fa been the main character I suspect I would've stuck with it. As it was I gave up halfway through and skipped to the last 2 chapters. I would've liked to see more from the point of view of the Cro Magnons.I get the impression that most of the 4 and 5 star reviews are from people who approve of the misanthropic viewpoint. \\"Yes! humans ARE vicious, fearful, evil, always destroying the gentle and innocent\\".

This is a must have for people of all ages."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of The Imagination Of Periphery Stowe: A Future Fairy Tale","review":"This entire book is set in lands we will never see, with contraptions we will never use, yet I can visualize them. I can believe in them. It is almost as if Wagner has tapped into another dimension and is just telling it as he sees it.This is a must read."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of The Imagination Of Periphery Stowe: A Future Fairy Tale","review":"I recommend this to everyone of all ages and reading levels. I fell in love with this book after the first page. I was amazed with Wagner's writing style. His poetic descriptions make the characters and the world he writes them into come alive.

This is a \\"bizarre\\" book, yes, but not one that drowns itself in its own weirdness but instead acts like a ship on the sea of fiction possibilities, and therefore offers readers the chance traverse such waters in style. It's as breezy as it is daunting, and in any event a book hard to regret spending time with. Highly recommended for those who enjoy Terry Gilliam films, Seuss and Gorey-esque themes, and a wholly fable sense of logic."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of The Imagination Of Periphery Stowe: A Future Fairy Tale","review":"This is one of those books that has the amazing ability to pull you into a masterfully crafted, beautifully vivid world and takes you on one of the craziest adventures ever put to paper.There is a delight in this story that just isn't found in many works.

I was jubilant. His moment to shine has arrived, and his true place in the world is realized. Anyone can learn how to monkey with a computer, but it takes true genius like his to put pen to paper and end up with a masterpiece.Periphery Stowe is a challenge to all authors: Don't pander to your audience, but instead teach them. Don't give them what they expect. Instead, give them what they need.In the end, the world is just as large as the imagination of a little boy."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of The Imagination Of Periphery Stowe: A Future Fairy Tale","review":"You want a book where words flow around your head and bring visual pictures, you want a book with a twist of philosophy, fantasy and things you haven't thought of before- this is the book. Stretch your mind with this book. It will get you thinking and thinking of things you that may not have even entered your mind== although they were things tucked in your soul. You won't find a book out there that is like this one.

But no one can ask him because he's fallen fast asleep. And suddenly, the world isn't working the same as it was before.The prose boarders on the poetic. The artwork is beautiful. And the story contains elements of mythology, and psychology as well as Wagner's own, personal cosmology mixed with his quirky sense of humor.If you liked Madeline L'Engle's &quot;A Wrinkle in Time&quot; and &quot;A Wind in the Door&quot; as an adult, or &quot;Sophie's World&quot; by Jostein Gaarder, then I think you'll like this too."},{"Title":"The Adventures Of The Imagination Of Periphery Stowe: A Future Fairy Tale","review":"Characters brimming with personality, and locations beyond imagination, it's hard not to get lost in the imagination of Periphery Stowe right along with Riggs.Though at times showing evidence of being a first novel, it hardly detracts from the beatiful prose and obvious skill the author has for writing.spread it around to your neighbors, your kids, your neighbors kids, all will enjoy.I'm just wondering what tricks Wagner has up his sleeve for his next book.."},{"Title":"The Days of Summer","review":"Kindergartener Jo-Jo and Fourth-Grader Nora are shocked the last week of summer when their parents tell them that Grandma and Grandpa are getting a divorce.

Its a pity that it is out of print; I am glad that I was able to get a copy. The book begins with a primer on the human skeleton - the names and placements of the major bones, the differences between male and female anatomy (rib cage, pelvis, skull, hands) and between athletes and the elderly (in terms of bone density.) A brief introduction is also given about how to calculate height based on bone length.WIth this primer, 15 different scenarios are presented, detailing where a sketelon was found, its position, and some details about the bones themselves. Armed with this information, you are expected to summarize your findings regarding gener, age, height and time of death, and write a possible scenario of the cause of death. Answers are provided at the end of the book.Its pretty neat, actually, and would be a marvelous tool for a middle-school science classroom (Taris is a science teacher himself). I will certainly share it with my daughter."},{"Title":"The Green Poodles","review":"Allan was the only one of the Grees who really wanted Cousin Fern to come from England to live with them at Pond Farm in East Texas. But as Aunt Lena said, &quot;A Green is a Green, and Greens stick together.&quot; So Fern came. And with her came Juliet, a Champion silver poodle.Pond Farm was never the same after that. Surprising things began to happen almost at once. A mysterious prowler, some unusual visitors, seven soot colored puppies, an unfortunate illness, the loss of half a valuable painting, a venture into business - all these brought new problems to the Greens.But in training their dogs, Allan, Fern, Charley and Ann learn more than they taught, about discipline and fun. And after a few big surprises at the New Orleans Dog Show, the children and Aunt Lena found the answers to all their problems. The answers, of course, were supplied by the poodles - Juliet, Ravel, Lady, Ringo, Jujitsu, and the puppies - The Green Poodles who frolic through the pages.The models for the Green Poodles lived at Poodhall Kennels in Nacogdoches, Texas. Here Charlotte Baker learned firsthand about puppy care, grooming show dogs, showing Champions and Obedience Training. Here also she met Ravel, a shy, kennelbred puppy. He needed the attention of one trainer, so he came to the author's home as a visitor; but as his Obedience Training proceeded, he soon took over both her home and her book. Watching from her desk top, he created a major role for himself. At the end of his course, Ravel achieved a permanent home, a place in literature, and his C.D. (Companion Dog). Miss Baker, on her part, finished the Green Poodles. You will meet Ravel and many of his Poodhall friends in the text and lively illustrations.In private life, Miss Baker is Mrs. Roger Montgomery. She and her husband lived in East Texas, with Ravel and two cats."},{"Title":"The Green Poodles","review":"I read this book when I was in Jr. High (over 30 yrs ago) and has always loved it.

Instead of \\"Lord Jesus Christ, son of the living God, have mercy on me a sinner\\", Sister reveals that Jesus has told her to constantly repeat the phrase \\"Jesus, Mary, I love you. Save souls.\\" While on the surface the prayer is very simple, it is difficult in practice because of the requirements of purity of mind, intense desire, and continuous repetition. Sister says that Jesus finds the prayer most pleasing, of great benefit to all souls, living and deceased, and with the help of grace, can be done by anyone. This is a method of prayer for the \\"littlest ones\\" of all ages."},{"Title":"Messages from the People of the Planet Clarion: The True Experiences of Truman Bethurum","review":"This appears to be an unedited reprint of Bethurum's last published book, THE PEOPLE OF THE PLANET CLARION, which first appeared in 1970 shortly after his death. Bethurum was the second of the 1950s \\"contactees,\\" curious characters who claimed to have met and talked with completely-human-appearing space aliens from other planets in our solar system. The first and best-known contactee was George Adamski, whom Bethurum seems to have been on fairly friendly terms with.The first 44 pages are mainly an autobiography of Bethurum, and evoke a fairly interesting time in the early 20th Century history of a rural part of California. The text sounds as if it had been dictated by Bethurum to a tape recorder; alas, no one seems to have cared enough to ask him to elaborate in the many places where he lapses into unintelligibility. The next few chapters sort of orbit around the events of Bethurum's first book, ABOARD A FLYING SAUCER (1954), getting eventually to a space alien \\"commandment\\" of December 1955 for Bethrum to found a religious commune, the \\"Sanctuary of Thought.\\"The rest of the 139 pages are a random grab-bag of newspaper clippings plus a FAQ section about the planet Clarion and its people. I found it amusing that although \\"Tru\\" claimed to have chatted with the lovely Captain Aura Rhanes of Clarion nearly a dozen times, for substantial parts of an hour each time, the \\"information\\" about Clarion consists of a few isolated and generally incomprehensible sentences, already contained in ABOARD A FLYING SAUCER, repeated over and over. One gets the impression \\"Tru\\" and Aura spent most of their time together breathing heavily instead of conversing.The 1950s contactees have generally been dismissed by those in the field of \\"ufoology\\" as harmless and often charming charlatans. Others have depicted them as evil tools of the CIA, who deliberately set out to convince the public of the inherent absurdity of any attempt to \\"study\\" flying saucers. It's only necessary to read the books of the contactees to see that essentially all of them were in fact motivated by deeply-held religious convictions (and most already led, or came ot lead, a religious cult), and that they were trying in their own way to bring simplistic, fundamentalist religious concepts into some kind of harmony with the science fiction/space travel ferment of the early 1950s."},{"Title":"Messages from the People of the Planet Clarion: The True Experiences of Truman Bethurum","review":"I believe this book is true but it did not all happen as Aura wanted.

Ovason presents convincing evidence that Masonic symbolism is hard-wired into the layout of our nation's capital.To do so, he reviews the beginnings of the city: Washington's selection of this site for the new nation's capital, the design competitions, the building projects. Having lived in DC at one time, this alone made the book worthwhile. Ovason then overlays the city with all the astrological symbolism that can be found around the district. Some of it is in the open and is plain for all to see. Other things are hidden. Better yet, alignments between zodiacal symbols have meanings and the author careful spells it all out.I won't give away the complete story, but Ovason has discovered something in the layout of Constitution Avenue, Pennsylvania Avenue and the Old Post Office that locks heaven and earth together and gives literally concrete meaning to celestial symbology. Washington is the New Rome, and our Founding Fathers carefully imprinted their hopes for the future in the very streets of the city.You'll never look at Washington, DC the same way ever again."},{"Title":"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","review":"George Washington layed the Cornerstone of The White House in &quot;Full Masonic Regalia&quot; and I have found various illustrations of our Founding Father, in his Regalia, surrounded with Masonic Symbolism, but this book contains more, including the story! I have known that America was founded upon Masonic Principles for a very long time, but this is the first book I have seen, in the public domain, that tells much of story. Also, there are many Illustrations, Full Color Photos and informative Masonic revelations in this book that I have not seen, before. I cannot claim that the Astrological information was new to me...but, I have been studying Astrology and reading Masonic texts for ten years. Anyone with a smidgeon of interest in Masonry knows that America was founded upon these Principles and the ideas of Great Men, such as John Locke..... However, most people do not realize that America is Founded upon Masonry, to the extent that it pervades the Architecture--not-only of Washington, D.C.--of our Nation. Public buildings all-over Louisville, KY and the surrounding area (including small towns in Indiana) are adorned with Masonic Symbolism. Masonic Symbolism is built into the Stonework of most of the Courthouses and other public buildings, including churches. A small town, in Indiana, even has Masonic Templar Symbolism built into the stained-glass windows. For an interesting journey, take a Carriage ride around Louisville, KY (and check-out the Symbolism on the &quot;2nd street bridge,&quot; then cross-over to Jeffersonville, IN and take a good look at the old Masonic Lodge!). It's not just D.C. Folks...it's the whole country. However, this fine book explores the wonders of our Nation's Capitol and gives us beautiful pictures of our &quot;hidden&quot; history. Nearly every Mason will want this book, because it has a photo of Albert Pike's Grave Site and lots of Masonic Symbolism, plus one beautiful, full-color Masonic Jewel !Also, High-Degree Masons are building a &quot;Masonic Museum&quot; to showcase their contribution to History and Society, which will prove this book is a wonderful addition to your collection.

Those who have looked at a map of DC spot immediately the symmetry that structures the City. This book is a well-researched argument that behind the city structure lies a Masonically-inspired tribute to Virgo. I enjoyed parts of the book, but found that it presumed familiarity and/or sympathy with astrology and could have used a more thorough editing process (I found the book jumped around a lot and I had trouble following some of the themes.

After a good start with the early history of the planning of the capital by George Washington and L'Enfant, including freemasonic influences in the foundation stone ceremony and the cornerstone ceremony, the author zeroes in on what is to be the main thrust of the book, his analysis of the astrological signage scattered around the capital area and what that might mean. Perhaps George Washington, L'Enfant and the early capital architects were into astrology, I don't know. Perhaps the sign Virgo has some supernatural significance for the well being of the capital and the country, I don't know. I do know this, one needs to believe in astrology for this book to have credibility for them.

The previous reviewer complained that it was \\"undocumented\\" but why does the author need to document a road, a building, or a statue if it exists in plain sight and is common knowledge? This proves that the author's thesis touches a raw nerve to those who are comfortable only with conventional understandings of history that sugar coat the past and pull the wool over our eyes. Clearly, there was a powerful cult behind the formation of the United States. They were not devout Christians, but were committed only to the esoteric ideals of their own secret society. Ideals that apparently originate in ancient Egypt, not Jerusalem. The author, however, coming from a Christian background and perspective dances around this truth. He prefers to view them as Christians who were simply outside the mainstream. Their obssession with \\"Virgo\\" proves this, because as everyone knows Virgo represents the Virgin Mary, right? Wrong.The author fails to grasp this nettle and meanders into a neverland that maintains Washington's \\"Christianity,\\" so we'll have to wait a while longer for the real story."},{"Title":"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","review":"This is a great source for a lot of information I've read in bits and pieces in other books.

The more knowledge of astronomy and astrological lore one has, the easier the book will be. For readers willing to study, it is ever intriguing, Ovason details, and provides important documentation for his argument which is, in essence, that the development of the design and erection of structures in Washington, D.C. was and is according to an astronomically oriented plan, and has been in the hands of Masons through most of its history. The author assures readers that he is not a Mason. I lived in DC for a decade and have confirmed the correctness of his architectural and compositional observations; his interpretation of course, is open to debate. In other words, the facts on the ground and in the sky, and even in the archives all check out -- it's his interpretation of them I have reservations about. For instance, it should be no surprise that astronomy and even astrology were important to agrarian societies, but it's quite a leap to say that they (i.e., Freemasons) therefore were secretly adoring Isis!!By the way, you can bet your bottom Continental Dollar that Dan Brown (or his wife -- the \\"researcher\\"!) ransacked this book as he wrote The Solomon Key."},{"Title":"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","review":"I just discovered the key to selling a new book, put the word Secret in the title.

The book moves slowly, the author did his research and I have no quibble with that - I know this topic; however, the significance of why the Freemasons chose to do things that have been done, in the manner that they did is just not revealed, I was really disappointed because there is some terrific information out there and I am well versed in this topic based on my own research. I am wondering if this is because he wasn't allowed to \\"get to the point\\", no pun intended. I think the true reason he left out answers to why (Astrology is important but he didn't say why among other points never addressed is because Mason's aren't allowed to share the key precepts of their faith or beliefs to the uninitiated - that leaves out all females and many men.There are many good books out there to understand the significance of Masonry -you won't find them by doing an internet search using the word - avoid the publications that will come up will give you books written by Masons (who often don't share that information, up front) these books reveal much of the same stuff rehashed, instead try books by William Schnoebelen, John Ankerberg, David Weldon, Tom C.

Wouldn't you design a simple grid pattern for a city instead of the bizarre pattern found there?David Ovason attempt to give meaning to this street pattern and for some of the architecture found in the city. His analysis is brilliant but I find myself wandering in the sometimes meandering pattern of his investigation, just like the layout of the city. It would probably help for the reader to have a background in astrology/astronomy to give greater meaning to this analysis, for I often found myself scratching my head.It was interesting to learn that Pierre L'Enfant, the French Freemason given credit for the design of the city, was later sacked from the construction team for criticism of some of the builders for messing up his design. He would later go broke, wander around the city, and pester congress for a greater share of payments that he thought were his for the design of the city.

I bought this book many years ago and recently got around to finishing it. David Ovason is a well-educated man and has written a very thought provoking book.He sets out to prove that Washington, D.C., was designed and built largely by Masonic architects. And this is true. But he gives many facts and footnotes to support this.It is a well-known fact that Benjamin Franklin was a Mason along with architect James Hoban (who designed the White House), Presidents Garfield and Polk and Statue of Liberty sculptor Frederic Bartholdi.And although textbooks teach that the federal city was the brainchild of French engineer Pierre-Charles L'Enfant, Ovason argues that Washington, Jefferson, U.S. Surveyor General Andrew Ellicott and others modified L'Enfant's original blueprint. I think the author makes a great case, but I got lost several times because I could not keep up with it all. Many facts here!Masonic symbolism appears in the marble, plaster, concrete, glass and paint facades of the Federal Reserve, the Library of Congress and other landmarks. This book, the result of a decade of thought and research, establishes the plausibility of Ovason's theory. I appreciated the time that went into it.This work looks at the Capitol, the Washington Monument, city planning, and the numerous zodiacs located throughout the city.

He teaches astrology in Britain and most recently has published The Secret Symbols of the Dollar Bill. Although not a practicing historian, Ovason has written a valuable, however unconventional, thematic history of Washington, D.C.'s architecture, from the time of its founding. in the context of the meaning and significance of the Masonic vision influencing its direction. Ovason persuasively demonstrates that Washington, D.C. is a city inspired by the mythologies and imagery of the constellations and their stars, and in particular, Virgo and the star Spica. It becomes evident in the number of consecrating ceremonies conducted by the Masons with a sensitivity to timing and location. In numerous zodiacs, in marble, plaster, concrete, glass and paint facades of the Federal Reserve, the Library of Congress and other landmarks, Ovason uncovers the evidences that they appear to be designed to emphasize the role of Virgo, which as zodiacal sign, he declares, rules over this federal city. The Virgoan symbolism is not restricted to the details of statuary and architecture; it is evident as well in the city's original plan. The Virgoan symbolism of the stars is evident in the L'Enfant triangle, with the White House, the Capitol Building, and the Washington Monument as its corners, as earthly replication of the stellar triangle framing the constellation of Virgo, the stars being Arcturus, Regulus and Spica, respectively. Ovason doesn't doubt that the designers of Washington, D. C. intended to draw a connection between this segment of the skies and the underlying federal city. From here on, in the remaining six paragraphs, a major implication of Ovason's Virgo thesis is explored, to further substantiate Ovason's findings on the role of Virgo in the 'chosen' symbolism for the formative architectural events of Washington, D.C.'s history.The author's thesis, Washington, D.C.'s symbolic design orientation to Virgo, takes the analysis through a brief but effective discussion of the history of the events leading up to the nation's birth in July 1776. Ovason relates the timing of this July event to the fixed star Sirius, the dog star, and its place in the Eqyptian calendar and in the myth of Virgo-Isis, the Egyptian Virgin Queen, and her guardian dog, Anubis, the dog of the dog star. In doing so he explodes one longstanding American myth, the one that has America born on the 4th of July. Uncontroversially, observe that most mundane astrologers have long accustomed themselves to an uncritical acceptance of the popular and traditional vision of the U.S.A. born when American Independence is commonly thought to have been declared, at the moment of the alleged July 4th signing of the historic State paper dated July 4, 1776, of edition #2 or possibly both editions #1 and #2: [edition #1] \\"A DECLARATION of the Representatives of the United States of America in General Congress assembled,\\" [edition #2] \\"The unanimous Declaration of the thirteen united States of America.\\" The author re-visits the question of identifying the nation's birth, working outside the box in dealing with the events of the Declaration, in order to address the question of which event should be acknowledged as the basis of the true horoscope of the U.S.A. After an illuminating and critical discussion of the work of British astrologer Ebenezer Sibly, Ovason goes on to explain why he has opted for July 2, 1776 as the true event date of the American nation's birth, when Congress first declared sovereign Independence for what had been the United Colonies of North America. Remarkable that July 2 was the very day when the Sun made its annual conjunction with the star Sirius, the dog star, as it did throughout that era.What makes Ovason's choice of this little recognized date all the more remarkable in its significance, is that it accords with the settled findings of the scholarly historical profession, 'settled' because of the undisputed-by-historians consensus on this historic question, a consensus now at least 100 years old, and which findings indeed confirm that by an actuating resolution of Congress sovereign Independence was declared on July 2, 1776, when it was so voted \\"Resolved\\" ('Resolved' = 'legislative signature'). This historic resolution, as the renouncement ('renunciation') of allegiance to the Kingdom of Great Britain, was affirmatively voted, on July 2, 1776, and so then was Independence declared. Three days later the accomplished fact was first made public by the broadside announcement ('annunciation') of the declared resolution of July 2, as documented in the famous State paper, dated July 4. [Or, equivalently, in the words of historian Carl Becker, \\"On July 4 Congress once more declared what it had already declared on July 2.\\"]Apparently, very few astrologers have made themselves aware of this historic/historical fact, as first reported in July 1776, accurately, in two Philadelphia newspapers, wherein the archive record shows, in \\"The Pennsylvania Evening Post, July 2, 1776:\\" that on \\"This day [July 2] the Continental Congress declared the United Colonies Free and Independent States;\\" and, the day after, in \\"The Pennsylvania Gazette, July 3, 1776:\\" that just \\"Yesterday [July 2] the Continental Congress declared the United Colonies Free and Independent States.\\" As to the how and why of this official confusion of July 4th for July 2nd, historian David Freeman Hawke captured the moment by explaining how the the Declaration was finished in printed form: \\"The official printer [John Dunlap] placed July 4 at the top of his copy of the broadside of A DECLARATION ['The Declaration of Independence'] and thus accidentally that day came to be celebrated with the pomp and ceremony John Adams expected to be given over to July 2, the day Congress declared independence.\\" [P.S., Mercury was then retrograding, June 28 to July 21, 1776.]Now, as much as Ovason's book should be admired, the author comes up short to point out why the story he tells so well is, in the main, not about the zodiacal sign of Cancer, but the sign and constellation of Virgo. What has Ovason overlooked in answering one of his major questions ? \\"Why would the Americans of the late 18th century wish to associate this celestial Virgin with their new federal city.?\\" (p.160) Let me point out that the answer, in short, is that the celestial Virgin, as the sign of Virgo, symbolizes the chosen aspirations of America's governors, just as the Virgin's celestial guardian dog, Anubis, as the dog star Sirius in the sign of Cancer, symbolizes the aspirations of America's governed. Understandably, the aspirations of a mistress and her dog may not always converge. Concretely, the federal city is fundamentally the \\"seat of government,\\" and the nation has been not simply represented there, but increasingly, governed by the State, as well. Furthermore, the author appears not to have grasped that there is not just one, but a number of significant Virgoan event dates, before the time of the founding of the federal city, which events augured the federal city's predominant zodiacal symbolism for Virgo. Of course, the story of the July 2, 1776 birth of the U.S.A., which is America as civic nation, the 'nation', necessarily must precede as background the story of the more relevant start of it all, the birth of the nation's State as established by Congress. The State, the United States, was formally adopted on September 9, 1776 [and by which date 11 of the 13 States had necessarily ratified (i.e., 'legalized') the July 2 resolution of Independence, as embedded in the final paragraph of the July 4 'Declaration of Independence']. This nation-State conducted itself as Congress, with a pre-constitutional remit to govern defense and diplomacy on behalf of the U.S.A., through and beyond the following year when constitutional government was at last established under the authority of the Confederation. So, in not addressing the events giving rise to the nation State [see the list in the last paragraph, here below] it becomes understandable that Ovason devotes only a relatively few pages to the U.S.A., the civic nation, as such, before returning to the discussion of Washington, D.C. After all, the more comprehensive story of the occult architectural orientation that served Washington, D.C.'s founding and formative years should entail a recounting of the symbolic history of the results of the birth of the U.S.A. AND it's State, to be understood as the nation-State, namely, the \\"United States\\" (the \\"U.S.\\"). [In point of emphasis, the \\"United States,\\" as the name of America's nation-State, must be understood to be categorically other than the \\"United States of America\\" which is America as the civic nation]. In short, the Nation is not the nation-State. And all the more as this real conceptual and legal distinction of U.S.A. vs. U.S. was precisely understood in Congress during the time of these formative events, as representing the difference between the Nation (born under Cancer), and the nation-State (born under Virgo).As Ovason observes (p.142): \\"This chart dominated by Virgo (for the First Continental Congress), points to the first concerted attempt to turn a group of individualistic colonies into a federation. Would this help explain why the city which was built to serve this new federation, and which was first called \\"the federal city,\\" should also be ruled by Virgo.? The designers of the city have always emphasized Virgo in its zodiacal architecture, and we must presume that this concern with the sign has some origins in the chart relating to the cosmic conditions which tied the states together in federal union.\\" (p.148) So now, in the revised light of David Ovason's findings, one can appreciate the eventual ratified births of three American Unions through five historic documents: [1] in 1775, The Grand American Continental Association. [2 (a), (b), (c)]: in 1776, the Declaration of Independence; in 1781, the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union; and, in 1787, the Northwest Ordinance. [3] in 1788, The Constitution of the United States (for the United States of America). Here below, just consider the following thirteen [13] American timeline events, over an elapsed time of 153 years, from 1643 to 1796: One event occurred in late August; the other 12 in the second or third weeks of a given September; each of the 13 under the Sun in the sign of Virgo. A timeline tracing the historical realities not of nationhood, as such being the NATION, but the nation's STATE. All this strongly suggests deliberate Masonic planning underlying the eventual establishment of the \\"United States,\\" the so-named nation-State, and its constitutional governments. The choices of timing of these events were repeatedly, over the period in question, of the 'Sun in the sign of Virgo'. From here on, these 13 events are summarized, as #s [01] thru [13]:[01] SEPTEMBER 7, 1643 (September 17, Gregorian calendar): On this day in Boston, Massachusetts was convened the first meeting of the members of the New England Confederation; a \\"firm and perpetual league of friendship and unity for offense and defense, . . and for their mutual safety and welfare.\\" This was the only inter-colonial union in British North America prior to 1775; this union lasted from 1643 until 1685;[02] SEPTEMBER 17, 1774: The first official act of the First Continental Congress, the Suffolk Resolves in defense of colonial rights, was passed on this day. This \\"Grand American Continental Congress\\" was convened in Philadelphia from September the 5th, in order to chart a unified course of defensive action in pursuit of a redress of constitutional grievances against Crown ministries and Parliament. [And so it should be noted here, Ovason does point out the significance of this First Continental Congress for his Virgo thesis;[03] AUGUST 23, 1775: On this day North Carolina became the 13th colony to ratify the Articles of \\"The Grand American Continental Association.\\" This event marked the ratified birth of America's first of three formally adopted (duly constituted) Unions; this first, born of commitment to an American-wide trade boycott under the terms of these Articles, henceforth in force throughout the United Colonies of North America. And, too, this ratified birth of America's first Union marked the very same day that a Royal Proclamation of King George III declared Great Britain's American colonies in a general state of treasonous rebellion. 86 years later, Lincoln famously and truthfully declaimed, in his first Presidential Inaugural Address, that: \\"The Union was formed, in fact, by the Articles of Association;\\"[04] SEPTEMBER 13, 1775: The United Colonies had become on May 26, 1775 the official name of the Second Continental Congress, when it assumed the exercise of certain executive capacities sponsored by the member colonies of \\"The Grand American Continental Association,\\" as the Association in turn became the United Colonies of North America. On this day the United Colonies were first convened by its full membership, as \\"The Thirteen\\" United Colonies;[05] SEPTEMBER 9, 1776: It was duly resolved in Congress that from this day forward, resolutions and ordinances of governance passed by the (however pre-constitutional) General Congress of the representatives of the United States of America, were designated henceforth as officially those of the, quote \\"United States\\" unquote. As background, by this date a 'provisional' draft of the Articles of Confederation had been agreed and was under further review in Congress, and Congress's Declaration of Independence had been ratified by 9 of the eventual 13 States to do so.[06] SEPTEMBER 16, 1782: The Great \\"seal of the United States,\\" as official coat of arms of America's nation-State, on this day was first impressed on a State document by General Washington. This seal was first adopted in Congress at noontime, on June 20, 1782, when the sign of Virgo was on the rising, under the Sun in the sign of Gemini. [Appropriately dated, the Great Seal has a Gemini persona, represented by two faces: an Obverse & a Reverse];[07] SEPTEMBER 3, 1783: On this day in France two 'definitive' treaties were duly signed: the Treaties of Paris (morning signing ceremony) and Versailles (afternoon signing ceremony), which interrelated treaties, in the main, concluded the terms of peace between the 13 sovereignties of the U.S.A. and Kingdom of Great Britain;[08] SEPTEMBER 17, 1787: On this day, exactly 13 years after the adoption of the Suffolk Resolves, the U.S. Convention in Philadelphia agreed to the proposed \\"Constitution 'for' the United States of America,\\" devised in order to re-frame the federal government of the \\"United States,\\" already, years previously, 'constitutionalized' under the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union for the United States of America;[09] SEPTEMBER 13, 1788: On this day the Federal government was born, exactly 13 years after the advent of the Thirteen United Colonies in Congress, as it was resolved by the \\"United States in Congress\\" that the establishment of the re-framed federal government had commenced, pursuant to the ratified Constitution 'for' the United States of America. This resolve fulfilled the official determination of July 2, 1788, that the re-framed Constitution had been ratified by the required nine states, and an appointed committee was to make preparations to establish the new federal government. [This September 1788 event, six months before the March 1789 start of the proceedings of the Congress in the re-framed federal government.];[10] SEPTEMBER 16, 1789: On this day, exactly 7 years after the Great Seal's first use, the Constitution-originated federal government formally ratified its responsibility for the Confederation-originated Great Seal, and for which the U.S. Congress enacted the following legislation: quote \\"That the seal heretofore used in the United States in Congress assembled, shall be, and is hereby declared to be, the seal of the United States\\" unquote;[11] SEPTEMBER 9, 1791: On this day the nation's capital was officially named: What initially had been designated \\"the federal city\\" in \\"the federal territory\\" was henceforth named the \\"City of Washington,\\" in the \\"Territory [years later, the District] of Columbia.\\" The Territory, now District, of Columbia is encompassed by the juridiction of the quote \\"United States\\" unquote. This enclave of the U.S. federal government is situated on lands ceded to the \\"United States\\" by the border states of Maryland and Virginia;[12] SEPTEMBER 18, 1793: For the start of the construction phase of the Capitol Building, the home of the U.S. Congress, Masonic organizations in the D.C. area, with President Washington participating, on this day commemorated the moment by conducting a Foundation Stone ceremony [a Masonic event often described, but erroneously so, as a Cornerstone ceremony. See Ovason's illuminating discussion of the distinction between foundation and corner stones, on pp. 77-81.] And, last but not least:[13] SEPTEMBER 17, 1796: On this day, exactly 22 years after the September 17 adoption of the Suffolk Resolves, and exactly 9 years after the September 17 creation of the U. S. Constitution, President George Washington's \\"Farewell Address\\" to the American people was published."},{"Title":"The Secret Architecture of Our Nation's Capital: The Masons and the Building of Washington, D.C.","review":"This book was okay and had most of the basic information.

However I think that an older audience might like this book because, they may be able to relate to the hard times Patty had. Also they may remember how people judged other people by the color of their skin. This book had some very diverse issues. The title of this book makes it sound like a real page turner but, it wasn't. The book took a very long time to set the mood at the beginning of the book. Although some parts were exciting, others weren't . For each exciting page there were twenty dull ones. The story was very hard to concentrate on. During most of the book nothing happened so that gave my mind a lot of time to wander so, once something exciting happened I was lost. One of the surprises in the story were that the reporter that Patty met was still friends with her after she found out what Patty had done. The reporter sent Patty her own subscription to the news paper when she was at the reformatory."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This was one of the few books that drove me to sleep some times and bearly awake at others, You either LOVE it or HATE it and frankly it is only good to drive Owls to sleep at night. It is not JUST a yawner but it was so sereal it didn't seem like historical fiction at all it remains a tail of a un mentaly balanced father with a screwy daughter that needs a labotomy. In short this book could of used more refining because it is way off!PS:GET TO THE POINT!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"As a true WWII buff, I've always been caught up in the 1940's. &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot; captures the essence of wartime America with brutal reality. Bette Greene shows her readers that underneath the united front of Victory Gardens and war bonds, there were often smaller wars being fought. This is not a sugar-coated, feel-good book. My heart ached for Patty and Anton...the ending left me desperately wishing that I'd misread the novel somehow. I highly recommend this book to anyone who appreciates REAL love stories."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"If you too deeply analyze the war aspects, the \\"bad choices\\" of the girl, or the one sidedness in this book then you miss the entire meaning of the book, one of someone being loved by the first time in her life, this book is a heart warming story of love and the extents you go to for love, so read this book, and don't criticize it for its flaws because it is a spectacular book ."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Oh my goodness, this was possibly my favorite book in middle school! My mother gave me HER copy that she read as a teenager, so it was very special to me. I know I read it at least three times.I am currently a freshman in college and have read many love stories since Summer of My German Soldier, but this book still stands out in my memory. The power of the forbidden love, the danger of a German soldier in the WWII American homefront climate, the intensity of the moral choice Patty has to make in hiding Anton...it all makes their time in the tree house more gripping...and the ending...so heartbreaking!The only issue I remember having was the story feeling a little slow at first and then picking up in the middle. I think this was to the advantage of the plot though, which revolves around an intriguing idea, but one that teeters slightly towards the improbable; it is not hard to believe though once the story begins, as it is populated by the voices of such honest characters that the very dramatic scenario becomes wholly true and heartbreaking (I was faintly reminded of this distinct element of the storytelling from Summer of My German Soldier when I read Twilight...very faintly though:).I never read the second book, but I might someday, if I need what I expect is a very good read to relieve a sudden attack of nostalgia :) And I will surely pass my copy along to my daughter one day :)"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Open Road Media has re-released multiple Bette Greene novels in the ebook format, and Summer of My German Soldier was one of them. The book was released in 1973 and has been a staple in many required reading curricula for middle and high schools. While I was not forced to read this in middle school, it was one of the recommended books to read, which I did.Summer of My German Soldier is about Patty Bergen, a young Jewish girl from Jenkinsville, Arkansas, and Anton Reiker, a German prisoner of war, and the relationship that they forge.The thing to consider about Summer of My German Soldier is that prior to the ebook release, the book has been considered a work of fiction. There had been a lot of speculation that Ms Greene had written this novel based on her own life, and there had been a lot of denial on her end.... until recently. At the beginning of the book, she has an affidavit declaring that the book is autobiographical.Now, having said that, a new light has been cast on the story, making it entirely different from what I read almost twenty years ago. The realities and cruelties that Patty endured are incredibly palpable. The corporal punishment she goes through is difficult to read. Her voice is so real that it made my heart ache.I had a little bit of a problem with reading Patty's character because she was so starved for attention and would fabricate little white lies. However, since she is twelve and the Esau of she and her sister, it is understandable. While her time with Anton is brief, it had haunted her for the rest of the life. Because of him, she learns self-worth.It's amazing how Summer of My German Soldier, which is set during the Second World War, is applicable to modern times. I can understand why it is required reading for some schools. There are a lot of themes and lessons to be learned from this story, some of which have made a lasting impression on me. Because of the subject matter and the violence towards Patty, I was only able to give it three stars."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"My 15-year-old daughter was required to read this book for English/Lit class. I read it too, and found it to be historically informative and an excellent example of imaginative, descriptive writing.The story is a real page-turner,never boring,full of suspense and surprises.The author is very insightful, giving readers pause for thought on important social issues.While the story introduces young readers to different ways of examining a situation,and the author's writing style is witty and unique,the reading is not difficult--it is compelling.I wish all teens had the priviledge of being required to read this book!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I picked up this book because I remember seeing the movie with Kristy McNichol when I was young, and thought it terribly romantic. Either my memory of the movie is rose-colored, or they changed the story a lot - because this book what not at all what I expected.In 1943, twelve year old Patty Bergen is having the most boring summer of her life in Jenkinsville, Arkansas when the news arrives that they are getting some German prisoners of war. Although Patty's family is Jewish, the girl knows little of what this means besides being excluded from things like the Baptist Bible Camp. Patty is starved for the love and attention of her abusive parents, and her only friend is the Bergen family's housemaid/nanny Ruth. After speaking with a German POW once, Patty becomes absorbed in a puppy love fantasy about him, and helps him hide after he escapes from the camp - bringing disaster for herself and all she cares about.I can't imagine this as a popular children's book in our current politically correct society because of the scenes of violent child abuse and the class and race strife. But it doesn't have the chops to stand alone as an adult book, either, likeTo Kill a Mockingbird. FYI - German POWs and Japanese American internment camps both really existed in the Arkansas Delta during WWII. For me - it was very interesting to read as an Arkansan, (I\`ll get flamed for this, assuming anyone actually reads what I write) because beneath the surface, the prejudices are very much the same today in small towns."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This story was about two people who are stuck between love and war.

The two main themes discussed in this book that seizes the attention of the reader are parental relations with their children, and race issues. At the surface this book is very simple to read and understand, but how profoundly it is analyzed depends on the reader&#65533;s maturity and capacity to understand different issues of life. Patty Bergen a 12 year old girl maintains an apathetic relation with her parents, who seem to neglect their daughter and set issues concerning her on the sidelines, at the end of their preoccupation. By reading this book one can be very thankful about his/her own family. Parents in the life of a young person are a very important factor. I believe that parents are the guides of the journey of their kids in the world during childhood, teenage life, and a little less during adulthood life, when one is more capable of assuming himself. Personally my parents are the keys to the door of my happiness in my teen life. It is very important that parents make sacrifices in order to procure healthy and happy lives for their children.The idea of a loving family is something that Patty is not familiar with, due to lack of love. Patty is neglected by her family and her father is a very strict person. He even goes as far as beating her because she does something that doesn&#65533;t please him. I believe that child abuse is one of the biggest crimes that one can commit. Beating does not result in anything positive. It only leaves negative prints in a child&#65533;s memory. This lack of love and lack of attention on the parents part, led Patty later on to make decisions that cause her problems.Race issue is another major theme discussed in this book. Since Patty is a Jewish girl, she is warned not to approach the German soldiers that have been sent to prison camps in her town, Jekingsville. However, after she meets one of the soldiers, Anton Reiker, she helps him hide once he escapes form the prison camp. This event can be analyzed two different ways. First it could be said that Patty does all of this to try to get the attention of her parents. She puts herself into so much trouble by helping the prisoner that on one side it seems she could have done this partly to get her parents to pay attention to what she is doing. On the other hand, the more obvious reason she does this is for love, care and attention. Since, Patty receives barely any love from her parents she has to compensate for this lack of love by seeking care from another individual. Anton comes at the correct moment and finally she finds a person who is able to appreciate her for what she is, with her qualities and her bad sides. The main reason she helps him, is because she finds in Anton care and kindness, and somebody to talk too; factors that her parents were never able to give her. I recommend this love story to all fans of romantic books."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I recently read Summer of My German Soldier By: Bette Greene for my Literature for Young Adults course at BSU. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel, especially the World War II POW camp setting. The majority of books that I've read involving prison camps are about Allied prisoners and the Holocaust. The POW camp in the novel was located in the small town of Jenkinsville, Arkansas. The prisoners were German Nazi soldiers. One of the main characters in the novel is a soldier named Anton Reiker, who escapes from an American prison camp. Anton is aided in his escape by an unlikely amazing 12-year-old Jewish girl named Patty Bergen. Patty's life is quite complicated in itself. Her parents are abusive and neglecting. Her only haven is with her younger sister Sharon, Anton, and Ruth her family's housekeeper whom treat her as an equal. Patty met Anton while working in her family's general store. Anton is much older than Patty but treats her as an equal, unlike others in her community. The friendship of Anton and Patty blossoms throughout the novel. I really enjoyed the novel. However, the cover of the novel threw me off because it portrayed a romance novel type picture. I think male readers are going to be less likely to read the novel because of the cover, which is upsetting, because the novel really didn't have an excess of romance especially considering Patty and Anton's ages were so far apart. I would definitely recommend Summer of My German Soldier to both males and female readers!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Summer of my german soldier is a really heart-moving,tear dropping romance,action and drama story.About a 12 year old girl named Patty bergan who lives in arkansas jenkinsville during WWII when she sees a camping house come into her town with other Nazis.Along the way she meets Anton, a lonely prisoned German P.o.w!! but mainly, this book has taught me alot about how you treat other people and that you shouldnt abuse them because everyone needs to be loved and cared for like they wanted for.Patty feels left-out and concerned because of rejection and lack of love from her mother or father and she thinks Ruth, her house keeper was the only one who's really concerned about you.The movie was really great too i give 2 thumbs up and 5 stars,anyways the story kind of changed me in a way i'll never forget and it was really emotional how she would risk her life for a real true friend who cares about her and treats her like she's no different than anyone else.So i recommend this book to anyone who feels left-out or needs friendship or romance,action,drama,or anything they want to make them happy again."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Great book. My 13 year old son also enjoyed reading it. I would recommend for any age group."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. I like books that are set in war times; it helps me understand better how the people felt and how they dealt with the war, since I could not experience it myself. In this book, you could get both sides of the feelings, one being Patty; an American Jewish girl and the other Anton being a German Prisoner of war. I think that it was amazing how an Jew and a German could unite and make such a strong bond, with the heat of World War 2 going on. I did not particularly enjoy the ending of the book. It sort of left you hanging about the becoming of Patty after she got sent to a reform school. Although this book was a bit depressing I would recommend it. It is a war romance that I believe is quite accurate to the feelings of people then, although it is a fiction book."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"\\"The Summer of My German Soldier\\" is an ideal book to teach to a High School English class. It brings you to an inside look of what it is like to be an outcast to society, family, and peers. Patty is a character who is abused by her parents but wants love and to be able to love. She looks at all people just the same - hoping the readers of this book would be able to do so also. In the time of war, our country was extremely hateful to the Germans, whether they be soldiers or citizens. Patty took to liking one of the German soldiers that was brought to US soil as a prisoner. He escapes the prison camp, and patty helps because she has fallen in love with this man, Anton. They have a connection, because both of them know what it is like to be an outcast. The book is full of ideas that today's society is still trying to break from - being that we should not judge people by what they are rather to judge than by who they are. The book also teaches us about what love is. It shows us how it feels when there is no one to love you and shows us how it truely feels when there is love in the air. All in all, good book to teach to high school students!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This is one of those books that everyone needs to read! I first started reading this book because we had to read a book for my English class, and after struggling through Great Expectations, this looked like an easy read. It was SO much more. From reading the summary of the book, even I admit, it doesn't sound interesting, but it does not do the book justice. At first I thought that Patty was really too young at 12 to feel such strong feelings for a man so much older, but this fact actually makes the book all the more special. Patty's struggle, and her courageousness throughout the story is amazing, and Anton's devotion and caring for her is truly heart-warming. Please, if you read this review, read, or better yet, buy, Summer of My German Soldier, because you'll want to treasure it forever. This is now one of my favorite books, and I encourage you to read it, too!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"...

My favorite character is Patty because she could relate to me a little because when Anton died she cried and when my great grandma died I cried.

I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone under sixth grade. Anton reminded me of my cousin Gert (he's German too, and matches her description exactly), so I could definitely relate to his character.

It's about a Jewish American girl, Patty, who befriends a German soldier, Anton. First the German POWs ( Prisoners Of War) arrive, then the Germans are brought to her father's store, and then Patty sees Anton running away and has him hide in her hideout. Two things that don't help Patty with her problems are that her dad is an explosive man and her mom is her \\"hit and run\\" critic.I didn't fully like the story because it was written from a girl's perspective. For example, when Patty thinks about something Anton did she seems to think of it in a romantic way. \\"He was looking at me like he saw me - like he liked what he saw.\\" It also bothered me that her father was a man who would beat Patty for the slightest infraction, real or imagined.Despite this, I did appreciate the descriptions the author used. She made me 'see' the events unfold in my mind. The author also described the characters so well that I could like and hate them.I gave this book two stars.

It has several conflicts in it , but I am only going to talk about two. The first conflict is that a brave and bold girl named Patty is devastated because nobody likes her except her housecleaner Ruth. For example, her mother always nags her about how she looks or how she needs to look. Her father always says she is the mistake in the family and that his life would be much better if she wasn't born. The other conflict I am going to talk about is her love life. I bet you wonder why that would be a conflict ,but what you need to know is that this was back in WWII and Germans were a problem. There is this German that was brought to America from Germany as a prisoner, and as soon as Patty has a wonderful and intelligent conversation with him, she thinks she is in love with him.

Bette Greene's writing style is very similar to Harper Lee's (of To Kill a Mockingbird) which I had just re-read for the umpteenth time. I couldn't put it down. It was done in 2 days and like all great books, I was sorry when it was over. I can't wait to hand this one off to my niece.

Shunned by her cruel father and cold mother, twelve-year-old Patty daydreams of what it would be like to be loved by someone.It just so happens that Patty's small town of Jenkinsville becomes the site of a POW camp for German soldiers. One day, the prisoners are led into her father's department store by soldiers to buy hats. Patty, who is working there at the time, has her first encounter with Frederick Anton Reiker, who from the first meeting strikes her as being different.In a remarkable twist of fate, Anton escapes from the prison and has to hide at Patty's house in their \\"abandoned\\" attic. There, the friendship only grows stronger-in Anton, Patty finds acceptance and love-all the things she has missed from her family. But inevitably, the time comes for her family to find out about the secret she has been hiding...Bette Greene has done a wonderful job of making this a passionate and thoughtful book. Her portrayl of Anton shows us the other side of Germans during World War 2-is it possible that some really were just decent people unfortunately pulled into the cruelty of Hitler's Germany? We contemplate with Patty the risk she takes-is it worth it to undoubtedly \\"lose\\" her family and whatever friends she still has for a lonely German soldier? And maybe, we wonder with Patty, are some things more important than patriotism?The only flaw in this book was the relationship between Patty and Anton. It seemed to me like it was a little too \\"romantic\\" for a relationship between a 12-year old and a 22-year old. I think the story would have been more realistic Patty was a bit older and/or Anton was younger. Thankfully, Bette Greene still created a wonderful story of frienship despite this flaw, and it is still a book DEFINITELY worth reading."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book was about a girl who had a great summer.

This girl's town is bringing Nazi soldiers to a prison camp. This girl meets one of the Nazis and falls in love with him, realizing he wasn't a real Nazi but a kind man drafted into the war.

I must admit that the ending was a bit disapointing, but then, it leaves the way for the sequel, which I want to read. I reccomend this book to people over the age of 14(don't ask me y). Overall, as I said before, its pretty good."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book would be good for poeple thatloves to learn and read about things that had happened a long time ago. Kids should be aware of what had happened. THey shold be aware that such horrible thing is happening everywhere and it could happen again. This is a book about a girl about 12 years of age and was forced to move. As she lived on with the life that she feared... she had fallen in love with a boy named Anton... He was considered a NAzi but not taken as one. Patty thought of him as a boy that is the same and that is in love with her. That is all that she can see in him. a lonely boy that needs to be loved my others. But who to think it was his enemy? well he sure didn't. this is a book that needs to be understood by people with a heart and that are willing to be taught of he hardship that had happened."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Wow. What a great book! Im not too much of a reader, but I had to read this book for a book report. And i loved it. Ok, you're thinking, WWII, hmmm, boringggg. You couldn't be more wrong. This story of 12 year old Patty Bergen is so moving and touching, I couldnt put it down. She bravely aided and helped Anton, the escaped German Soldier. They fall in love and it is beautiful from then on. This is a great read."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I had to read &quot;Summer of my German Soldier&quot; for my English class during the summer and write a paper on it. I wasn't thrilled with the idea of having to spend my summer vacation reading a novel, but I read it. I loved it. Bette Greene is an extremely talented writer, and the story is very touching. It tells the story of a 12-year-old girl named Patty Bergen whose decision to shelter a German prisoner goes against the will of her father and almost everyone else in her town. The fact that Patty is so physically and emotionally abused by her bitter father is disturbing, but the love that Patty receives from her housekeeper Ruth and the German prisoner whom she shelters gives the novel a touch of hope. I won't give any more of the novel away, all I'll say is that this is an enjoyable story, well-written and poignant. Recommended reading for anyone, teenager or older."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I think this was a pretty good book. I liked all of the characters, Sharon, Ruth, Anton and Patty. The only charcters that I truly did not like were Patty's mom and dad. I was very sympathetic toward the fact that Patty was abused. I could never have taken that. Even though after everything Patty has been through, her father's beatings, getting arrested, going to jail and have Ruth and Anton taken away from her she has managed to pull through and stay stronger than ever. I admire her for always trying to work everything out day by day. When things don't go your way you have to work it out or you will never be happy with your life or yourself."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"okay my teacher just asked me to read this as a novel study project and after i finished it i was really crying it was a totally good bookk with a twist on it!! i thought Patty and Anton would live happily ever after!!! but i guess i was wrong!! it's a really great book try to read it you might just love it as much as i loved it!!!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":".... Here, in the next few short words, I'd like to share with you my thoughts and feelings about this book. At the beginning, the book is somewhat boring, as it talks excessively about the feelings of the characters and describing them in many ways. At the beginning you will also experience peculiar, odd language and things of that nature. However as you read on, you will begin to adopt and obtain the jist of the book, its meaning etc. You will see that thte story perfectly corresponds with its title and even, the illustration on its cover.The story is one that is back at the time of WWII, hence its storyline, where Hitler was in power, and takes place in Jenkinsville, Arkansas, and the main characters being Patricia Bergen, Ruth, Anton Reiker (Escaped Soldier)the father and mother."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book is very sad, but still excellent. The main character is twelve-year-old Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl growing up during World War II. She lives in a small Arkansas town, where her parents own a department store. The federal government has chosen her town as the location for a camp for Nazi prisoners of war. Although most Jewish Americans despise the Germans for what they have done to Jews in Europe, Patty regards the prisoners of war with more curiosity than hatred.The Nazi soldiers are used to pick cotton in the fields of the rural South, and they are brought to Patty's father's store to pick out hats to protect their faces from the hot sun. Only one of them can speak English, and so he interprets for the entire group. The interpreter's name is Frederick Anton Reiker, known to his friends as Anton. Patty is present when the soldiers arrive at the store, and she waits on Anton, who wants to buy a pencil sharpener. They become friends in this short length of time.Patty has many problems with her family. Her parents never show her any love or kindness. Her mother, who is very beautiful, is always finding faults with Patty's appearance, and her father outright hates her. She has to endure beatings and whippings from him several times. Patty has very few friends, and her closest friend is Ruth, an African-American woman hired to be the housekeeper and cook for the Bergens. Patty also loves her sister Sharon, even though Sharon receives a lot of love and attention from the girls' parents, and of course there is Anton. She isn't good friends with the other girls in their town because of the ever-present barrier of religion.Anton manages to escape from the prisoners' camp and makes his way to Patty's home. She shelters him in a forgotten suite of rooms above the family's detached garage, and brings him food and clothing daily. During this time period, their friendship deepens. Anton witnesses one of the beatings that Patty's father was giving her, and tried to rush to her aid. When Patty is talking to him after this episode, she realizes that she has never loved her parents, particularly her father, and that they are cruel to her. However, her time with Anton can't last. He feels that he is threatening Patty's safety by staying with her, and so he leaves.Over the next few months, Patty has to deal with many crushing losses, especially one concerning Anton. She draws strength from a ring he gave her before parting, which was his most treasured possession. She also learns to accept that her parents cannot and will never love her, but she realizes that it isn't because of her faults that her parents hate her--it is because of their pettiness and narrow-mindedness.I recommend this book to anyone. It's really sad and will probably make you cry at some points, but the story is absorbing and very believable."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I just read &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;, by Bette Greene. I thought that this was a really terrific book. It is the story of Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl in the South during WWII, who makes friends with a Nazi soldier. She makes friends with him because she her parents are mean to her and she wants companionship and love. This was a wonderful book with characters so real that I could feel what they were feeling and think what they were thinking. After reading &quot;Summer of My German Soldier&quot;, I had tons of questions about the book and about the author. I wanted to know if any of it was based on a true story. I also wondered if Bette Greene's life influenced her to write the book in any way. So I did some research on the internet, and I found out that there's a webpage about the author and the book! It's at bettegreene.com and it has tons of useful and interesting information. Plus, you can email Bette Greene about her books! I recommend that you read this book and look at the website to get answers to the questions I know you'll have."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Summer Of My German Soldier is an interesting book, I actually watched the movie first and than read the book. This is about Patty a 13 year old Jewish girl growing up in a small southern town during World War II and in this little rural town there is a prisioner of war camp for German POWs and Patty comes from a rotten dysfunctional home in which her cruel father is an abusive drunk who for some reason hates her and is always beating her up and her mother is an uncaring wimp who also hates her but for some reason Patty's parent's love and adore her little sister Sharon and the only love Patty gets is from the family's black housekeeper and than Patty meets an escaped German POW who it turns out was forced into the German Army and hated Hitler and she strikes up a friendship with him and he is kind to her. This is a sad but good book though I have heard that it and the movie are considered to be controversial. The book was turned into a made for TV movie in 1978 and the cast for the movie includes Kristy McNichol as Patty, Bruce Davidson as Anton the escaped POW, Ester Rolle as Ruth the housekeeper, Michael Constantine as Patty's father, Barbara Barrie as Patty's mother and Robin Lively as Patty's little sister Sharon. The movie is available on video and Amazon is offering it though I think it's out of print so you would have to look for used tapes."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book made me cry and cry when I was a kid, maybe 10 or 11 years old. For years, whenever anyone has asked \\"What's the saddest book you've ever-\\" I've said \\"Summer of My German Soldier\\" before they can even finish the question. My point is that, when I recently picked it up to see how it holds up all these years later, I was predisposed to be moved. That said: I began the book the other day, and didn't stop until I'd reached the end. And I cried and cried and cried. And cried. Let me state for the record that I don't cry easily at books. But this one is devastating. It wasn't like there was one climactic moment that let me get it all out in a cathartic rush; no, it is just quietly brutal from start to finish, in this mounting way, as it unfurls the bleak story of a talkative, unloved girl in a cruel, unloving world. It's the kind of world in which the little flashes of kindness and love actually hurt more than they offer relief. I hadn't remembered it like that. But I guess that's an appropriate way to narrate life in a small town in 1940s Arkansas.Anyway, this book has definitely ensconced itself in my list of lifetime tearjerkers, along with \\"The Body\\" episode of Buffy, and Disney's The Fox and the Hound."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"In my opinion the is a heart-wrenching, though provoking book for mature readers. Usally I don't read dramas but when i picked it up I couldn't put it down. The main character Patty Bergan really becomes a part of you. This book focuses on love and hate set in World War II in a swall town in Arkansas. Patty has just turned twelve. She is a young Jewish girl who is nelected by her parents and alone until she meet an excaped, German prisoner of war from a compound near by named Anton. Even though this is set during wartime America this book remindes us who read that there is good amoung evil, and that even in the darkness, there is light. For a lot of people this book can be somewhat painful because of the victimization of children-- wheater the brutality is physical or emotional. Anton excapes from the local prison and Patty, knowing the rick, helps him to hide. She lived with perpetual fear of maternal rejection and redicule-of her vicious, child-beating fatherand of coming in a poor second place to her pretty, petted sister. She also knew the rick of her norrow-minded Arkansas town opposing her humanitarian treatment of an excaped German prisoner of war. Patty learns to look at Anton, not as Nazi, but as a frightened young man. Patty knows that if anyone were to find out her life would be over, but cannot overcome the power of love. With Anton, Patty finds the love she has longed for and the appreciation her parents never gave her. Such a friendship can be dangerous. In Green's scenario of paranoia and government promoted prejudice, there is no room for compassion or the budding of a romance. Even pure friendship is tained by vicious minds. The ending was sudden and shattering. I would recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I first read this book several years ago and have finally decided to buy it.The story is that of a 12 yr old Jewish girl who does not fit in with her family or the town they live in. She is emotionally and physically abused by her parents and finds love only from their housekeeper and her younger sister until she finds and helps a German soldier escape from a POW camp. The bond between the young soldier and the lonely girl is powerful and transcends the usual teenage \\"love story\\" concept.I highly recommend this book but do advise that there are some emotionally disturbing sections."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I read this book for a project in my 8th grade English class, and finished it a few days ago. I really enjoyed the book, but was not thrilled with the closure to the story. Summer of My German Soldier is a sad story of love, friendship, kindness, and hardship. The story has well developed characters, which include Ruth, Patty, and Anton. It also has an entertaining plot.Patty takes many risks to protect Anton, a German Soldier, and learns to follow her heart. Anton cares deeply for Patty, and is willing to risk his life to protect her. After Anton escapes from the POW camp,he crosses paths with Patty, who keeps him in her garage. When Anton leaves, Patty is torn between staying with her uncaring family and starting a new life with Anton. Anton convinces Patty to stay with her family. Patty deals with several family problems throughout the story, and does not feel accepted. Patty can only rely on Ruth, their colored woman, for support. Ruth loves Patty, although she has made many mistakes. After being tried for hiding Anton, Patty is sent to a reform school and is visited only by Ruth. Ruth tells Patty that she misses her, and knows things will be better when she returns home. Ruth also tells Patty that all the awful things her parents had said about her were not true. Patty then regains her self-confidence, and is ready to rebuild her life when she leaves the reform school.This story gave me a vivid picture of what life was like during WWII, and touched my heart."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"The most exiting event in the history of Jenkinsville occurred that summer day when a Prisoner of War camp was set up just outside the city. The Nazi's that had been depicted as evil people that would kill someone as soon as they looked at them turned out to be young, kind-faced men with blond hair. Patty Bergen was Jewish and her father owned a department sore on the main street of the town. One day she was in the store when the prisoners with money in hand came to buy hats for work in the field. Patty went to help one of the prisoners whose name was Frederick Anton Reiker and discovered that instead of wanting to buy a hat with his money he wanted to buy a pen with fake diamonds on it. Not long after their first meeting, Anton escaped from the prison camp and fled but before he caught the back of a departing train, Patty saw him and invited him to stay in the room over the garage until the war was over. But, one day Anton saw Patty being beaten and he ran out to stop the attack, but Ruth, the housekeeper saw him rush out from the garage. Even though Ruth would not tell a soul about it Anton decided it was too much of a risk on Patty's part and he left that same night. After Anton had been gone for months a man named Mr. Pierce asked Patty a fair amount of questions and after hearing that Anton had died she let everything out. After that she had to go and live with her grandmother for a while until the time of the trial. The judge sentenced her to no less than four months in a reformatory for girls and there she stayed for the time. I enjoyed this book because of how the story of how it was depicted.I thought this novel was quite engaging because of how Patty changed over time. At the beginning of the story Patty is reckless and had low self-esteem. Her sister was always getting compliments on how pretty she looked, and Patty was always being told that she should try to look and act more like her sister. After Patty started hiding Anton she took baths and started to care more about how she looked. Also Patty started getting beaten by her father often and she sometimes thought that she was always wrong. Then after Anton died and she was sent off to the reformatory school she developed a new perspective on life and people. After Ruth went to see her she discovered that she was not wrong, but did things for the right reason in a way that other people could not see.The way that Anton acted throughout the entire story was completely unexpected for what most people associated with Nazis. Anton, unlike most of his colleagues spoke virtually flawless English and was a very polite young man. Even after he found out that Patty was a Jew he continued to treat her with respect and he cared for her deeply. Also, Anton did not join the Nazis because he wanted to he joined it to escape punishment and imprisonment by his own country.I also enjoyed this book because it showed the level of tolerance between the Caucasian Americans and the people that surrounded them. Ruth was the African American housekeeper for the Bergens and if any food was missing Patty's mother always assumed that it was Ruth without using any logical reasoning to see if one of her own children had eaten the food. Even though the German prisoners were not mean or unruly they were usually treated fairly but once they were out of earshot news about them spread quickly. One of the things that the townspeople said about the prisoners was that they were being treated too kindly and that they should have cruel punishments.Through reading this book I gained an appreciation for Patty because of how she gained confidence though the story. The imagery of this wonderful novel created an amazing story with brilliant characters. This book was also wonderful because of how Anton was shown in the story. The novel was especially good because of how racial and cultural differences play into each other.R. Roston"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"During World War II, a group of German soldiers are transferred to Jenkinsville, Arkansas, where a 12-year-old Jewish girl, Patricia Ann (\\"Patty\\") Bergen, lives with her younger sister Sharon, abusive parents, and her only loyal friend, Ruth Hughes, the family's black housekeeper. Patty meets her first German while helping out in her family's general store. The POWs are brought into the store for hats, and Patty dutifully--and out of curiousity--approaches the only dark-haired, English-speaking soldier in the group: Frederick Anton Reiker. He is much older than Patty (22-years-old), but he treats her like an equal. From that first meeting, Patty's opinions of Germans greatly changes, and she can't help but be captivated by him.So, when she sees him running near her house, having just escaped the prison camp, Patty insists that he stay in her family's deserted garage for as long as he needs to, which is only for a few days. I had expected Patty and Anton's relationship to last a little longer (and I'm certain Patty wished the same thing), but it only takes up about one-third of the book. The remaining two-thirds is Patty's account of her torturous life, of being beaten and then ignored by her hot-tempered father, criticized constantly by her beautiful mother, and other everyday miseries involving her narrow-minded neighbors.This book is quite depressing but realistic. I often wondered how--and if--Patty would ever survive her life, but I suppose that is the point of this story: to find hope despite the obstacles. Patty discovered that by befriending Anton, and he had enough of an impact on her to last the rest of her life.My sister recommended this book to me years ago, and I finally got around to reading it just recently. I'm not sure why I didn't start it sooner, because it was very good. I would certainly recommend it to others (age 12 and up). The only complaint I have about the book (which is quite petty, really) is the book cover. Anton's description in the book doesn't match his appearance on the front cover. He supposedly has black hair, not dirty blonde hair. Maybe it was to exaggerate the blonde-hair-blue-eyed German stereotype. Who knows.Anyway, following the book, in 1978, a TV movie was made of Summer of My German Soldier (which I haven't seen, so I can'tcomment on it) and a sequel was written, called Morning Is a Long Time Coming (which I haven't read yet either, but intend to)."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"The historical fiction novel, Summer of My German Soldier, written by Bette Greene, describes the cultural aspects of daily life during World War II. This novel published by The Penguin Group in 1973 was a finalist in the National Book Award and won an ALA Notable Book award. This book takes place in Jenkinsville, Arkansas during World War II. Throughout this novel times are tense for the protagonist Patty Bergen, because she risks losing family, friends, and her freedom, for whom she dearly loves, Anton Reiker. Summer of My German Soldier is a very descriptive and educating historical fiction novel, which sets this book apart from others in many different ways, including its setting, content, and themes. This novel did not include information about the war as most World War II books do, that making this novel more unique. Many believe that the theme \\"longing for love\\" really stands out in this novel. Throughout this novel Patty is longing for her parents to find appreciation in Patty and to love her as others do. This is one of very few books in which exemplify such love in a World War II set book. Also, Bette Greene makes this novel so interesting by creating a character, such as Patty who is so lively and modern. Many readers of Summer of My German Soldier believe that the major purpose of this book is to see each other as real people with wonderful qualities, and to love each other for what they are and not for what people label them as. The appropriate reader for this novel would be 12 and up and people who love a mix of historical fiction and romance.Summer of My German Soldier is organized in an orderly manner, conflicting with great drama and a thrilling plot. The illustrator Robert Hunt did a great job on the front cover of this novel. The image shows Anton holding Patty gently on a cloudy summer afternoon. Anton Reiker, the Nazi prisoner of war shows signs of awareness and how much he cares about Patty, while Patty shows trust in Anton, her lover. The layout of this novel is so well thought out, including the photos, the table of contents, and the text.Bette Greene definitely achieved her purpose in writing this young adult novel, for this book taught many readers a life lesson, which is to realize that we can't classify people as good or bad because of their nationality, race, or religion. Summer of My German Soldier captures important aspects of the 1940's such as the horrors of World War II. Summer of My German Soldier is a fascinating young adult piece of literature. Those who enjoy reading historical fiction novels and those who enjoy romantic novels will absolutely adore this book. Though, if you are the fantasy type of reader, I do not recommend this book to you. It enhances your historical knowledge, while at the same time, you sit back and enjoy a teenage \\"love story\\"."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Summer of my German soldier, by Bette Greene, is a very well written book!

That is, until Patty meets a German soldier hiding from the authorities in her small town. His name is Anton Reiker and he is not a Nazi. Patty hides him above the garage.

The author gives her wonderfully lucid and intelligent thoughts, observations and dialogue, which sound out of place coming from a twelve-year-old. Fifteen or sixteen would have been much better.Also, Patty's Jewishness in a small southern town is not explained or examined to any extent.Other than those two small details, the book is entertaining, thought provoking, happy, very sad, realistic and believable. Today's young adults will still identify with the ups and downs of the universal adolescent. Summer of My German Soldier is sure to keep young adult readers involved to the very end.Melissa Gilbert plays a more convincing, older Patty in a made-for-television adaptation of the novel.

The point is, this a magnificent novel that, amid such devastating themes as love, devotion and hatred, keeps its balance. And touches you deeper down inside precisely because there is such a quietness in its message. It's like a calm, soothing voice saying: love is all. And someday the world may come to see that, even if it's just for five minutes."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This is a great novel that I enjoyed very much.

When it was assigned in English 8 I thought, Oh great I finally have to read it. As soon as I started this book I thought that it really didn't meet expectations. I read a lot of books and Patty Bergen seemed to be a very weak character. In class disscussions we decided she was a love-sick young girl and shouldn't have been fooling around with an older guy. This is just my opinion and sorry to anyone who really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This Novel, Summer of My German Soldier, is an interesting book. It is about a girl named Patty Bergen, her small home in Arkansas becomes a site of a camp keeping German prisoners during World War II , even though she is Jewish she begins to vision, a nazi, Anton not as a Nazi but as a true friend. Anton escapes from the camp site and Patty takes responsibility for him, feeding him, clothing him, and even sheltering him. Only one person knows this so far and that person is the house keeper, Ruth. She keeps him in a shelter on top of the garage, one time even Anton once risks his life to save Patty from her father. This book is a treasure to keep and once you start reading it you will not put it down. I also encourage you to buy this book, and also I'm looking for the sequel to this book."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Reading the back cover, I had high hopes of this novel. However, what could have been a thoughtful, ironic, heartwarming story quickly became plotless and one-dimensional. Do Patty's parents really possess no good qualities whatsoever? Is Anton really the saint he seems? This novel makes no attempt to answer any of these questions, and that's what makes it so painful to read. Patty, who is clearly intended to be the endearing heroine, comes off as a know-it-all with a total disregard for rules and boundaries. Also, doesn't a seemingly romantic relationship between a 12-year-old and a 19-year-old feel questionable at the very least? Add this to the fact that there is absolutely no conclusion, and we have a recipe for one terrible novel. I could go on for ages, but here's the bottom line: do not waste your time with Summer of My German Soldier."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I have never read a book that was so boring. The book talked about a jewish girl helping out a nazi. Nothing happens inthe begining and the climax is the girl housing the nati. WOW,NOT! Weas a class read this book as a class and i asked everyone what they thought of the book. They all agreed with me!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I detested this book. I felt the actual story never quite matched up with its admittedly interesting premise. The character of Patty Bergen seemed feeble and weakly developed, and I never understood the inexplicable hatred the entire world, excluding Anton and Ruth, seemed to have for this girl.The whole \\"love story\\" plot was laughably unrealistic, due mainly to the age difference. The most frustrating thing about this book is that it could have been so much better. The whole irony of a Nazi and a Jew falling in love during World War II has so many options for a good plotline, but instead the story seemed to spend a good majority of the book wallowing in self-pity."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book was a little bizarre. Not much fact was included, and it seems like we don't know much about Patty. Also, I didn't really like her. Her romance with Anton was pretty weird and kind of inappropriate. At least Anton seemed to regard her as a friend, until the very end. However, a few themes in the book were brutally realistic, like racism and corporal punishment. It was a sad book, and an OK read."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"- A little spoiler alert from my 12 year old son -A very sad book, but a good story. Summer of my German Soldier tells the story of Patty, a Jewish girl who befriends Anton, a Nazi refugee, who is nice to her in ways friends, family, not even she could not have done. Like every story, it ends up being a love story. In the start, Patty did not know that he has escaped just to see her. She has to learn how to open up her heart, stand up for him against her parents, friends, and sacrifice every thing because of her beliefs.It is a very good story of friends, love and losing them all because of the person you love. But what I don't like is that, if you know he is a bad person because of his background, choose another one. It would not be all this dramatic of a story if it happened that way. The book is alright, but i would not recommend it unless if you like a dramatic, love story plot."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I had heard many good things about this book. While it was an interesting idea for a book, I found that I just couldn't connect with any of the characters or even the storyline for that matter.Patty is a twelve year old girl who lives with her parents and sister and is cared for by a nice woman named Ruth. A little bit on the wild side, Patty is definitely not her parent's favored child. In fact, it seems like they'd like her to just disappear. She tries to be helpful and kind and make them like her, but she always seems to fail.When a POW camp is established right outside her town, she gets a chance to meet some of the prisoners when they come to her father's store for hats. One in particular is kind to her and speaks to her as if she matters. His name is Anton and he is more of a scholar than soldier. Patty finds a chance to becomes friends with him when he escapes from the camp and takes to hiding in her garage at home. She brings him food and shares stories with him. Gradually she comes to appreciate him even despite their differences because he is kind to her and actually seems to care about her. However, they both know it can't last and that he needs to move on before he's caught. Its a danger to both him and Patty to be staying there.The characters in this, with the exception of Ruth, were just terrible. Patty, to me, was a brat and while I still thought her parent's were louses, I couldn't even like her. Her parents, as said before, were terrible people with no redeeming qualities. Anton was only in the book for a little bit and never really gets fleshed out as a character. The only one I liked was Ruth. She was kind with a few flaws and just seemed to be a real person. The rest were just awful with no sense of good in them. It just wasn't very realistic. Another thing I found a bit hard to understand about the characters was the affection Anton felt for Patty even before she helped him. As a twenty something year old man it just seemed odd that he would find this connection with a twelve year old Jewish girl with no other reason than that she sold him some items at the store and was polite to him.The writing was easy to read since it was a juvenile book. Since its an older book there are racial slurs in it and that could have the potential to offend some people. Most of the book is dialogue so there is not a great amount of description on the setting of the book and the characters were only minimally described. I did like the dialogue in this book; Greene does a wonderful job of expressing the characters feelings about the war and about their family life through their words.I just couldn't bring myself to like this book. I wanted to but there was nothing to draw me into the story and care about the characters. Its probably a good book to introduce war themes to children but otherwise I'm not sure what its uses are. It doesn't help my opinion that the book seemed unfinished at the end as well. I kept waiting for some explanations on why people felt the way they did about Patty and what would happen to her after she left the school. It felt incomplete.Fascinating idea for a plot but only carried out fairly well instead of the excellent book it could have been. It wasn't all terrible, as I said before I liked some of the conversations that took place in the book. It just wasn't what I expected the novel to be when I had heard about it from others.Summer of My German SoldierCopyright 1973230 pages"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I first read this book in high school and wanted to reread it through the eyes of a grown up who studied World War II. It correctly describes the American south during the war and America's overall sentiment against the Nazi war machine. Although some of the material is somewhat boring and may be considered unnecessary, the overall theme is well addressed. Due to its age, the story may be antiquated for today's youth, but it is still a useful tool for English and History teachers to use for illustration."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This is a beautiful story, told from the perspective of twelve-year old Patty, who is ready to see more than her parents can show her of love, and yes, at her age, of romance. Patty is loveably brave with her tooth-and-nail grit, but Greene never loses sight of the vulnerability of being twelve-years old. There is one awkwardly written scene, in which Anton is a bit too self-congratulatory for really having risked nothing, but overall, this book shows a different kind of Nazi soldier than the stock characters, and it shows heart."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Not only was this book poorly written and boring, it teaches children bad moral values.

I read this in two days because I couldn't stand to put it down - I wanted to know what happened to Patty and Anton.

Any one who fought with the german army were nazis. and thats all. six million jews died because of people like anton reiker. anton may not have been evil but he fought along with nazis. and its alot like hanging with the wrong crowd. if u hang with drug dealing gang members u gotta pay also. for all of you people who think this book is a classic, maybe u should go see saving private ryan or schindlers list. maybe that will change your mind about this book."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Picture a Jewish girl about the age of 13 living in the World War II Era and is in LOVE with a German Nazi! Patty lives in a small town in Alabama. The town is quiet and mainly Jewish. When a Prisoner of War camp is established, the whole town sort of goes coo-coo! When one of them escapes Patty hides him and secretly falls in love with him. But when the FBI comes into play, she doesn't know what to do. Will she be put in jail if they find out she is hiding him? This book is a good book for people who can stick with books.Summer of my German Soldier by Bette Greene is suspenseful. One example from the book is when Patty's father is angry with her and starts to beat her. This was suspenseful because he could, if was angry enough, beat her to death. Another example is when Anton escapes and she hides him, but can't remember hiding him. This is suspenseful because she tries to take food to him but is stopped by her father. Another suspenseful part is when the FBI agents come and question her about the disappearance of the POW escapee, Anton. Because she is hiding him, you don't know what she'll say and thus it is suspenseful.This book, also, has romance. This romance is not what you would usually think of, but just a secret love for each other and nothing more. A part in the book that is romantic is when Patty's father starts to beat her and Anton comes out of hiding, but decides for his and her sake not to interfere. This is romantic because it is the first sign that Anton really cares about Patty's safety. Another romantic scene is when Anton decides to run away to New York. Patty secretly climbs out of her window to say good-bye. He gives her his family ring and they both realize they truly love each other. This is romantic because on this moonlit night they both tell each other how much they love one another. The last example is when Patty finds out Anton was found and killed. This is romantic and sad because she was truly in love with Anton and gets very emotional.This book starts out boring but gets more interesting as the book progresses. It is a book you just can't put down. An example of when you can't put the book down is when Patty is getting beaten by her dad and Rose, their maid, sees Anton. You won't be able put the book down because you don't know if Rose will tell on Patty or not. Another example is when the FBI comes to town and you don't know if they will find Anton or not. The last example is when the FBI comes back to town and questions Patty for a second time. You begin to think they have suspicions about her.Summer of my German Soldier has romance and suspense. This book is great for people who can stick with a book. You just can't put this book down.H.Wissmann"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"but the vile language makes the story tainted. I don't think it should be read by children because the abuse situations and the language. The reason I say this is that it is on every recommended book list for WWII for children!

I was disturbed by the two sentence synopsis on the list and decided to purchase and read it myself to find out if the school to which I pay a princely sum every year, was indeed recommending a book with such a poor moral foundation. What I found out was that not only was the two-sentence synoposis accurate, the book was worse than described. (To get a plot summary look at some of the other reviews--I won't waste space with that here.)Nowhere in this book is there an acknowledgment that POWs--regardless of what their personal political stands may be--belong in POW camps until the end of hostilities. The heroine of this story is in fact championed for protecting an escaping POW. There had been no build up suggesting that conditions at the camp were subhuman, etc. No, he just didn't want to be there. He wasn't a Nazi, he was misunderstood, a product of his historical circumstance, etc.Our heroine's eventual punishment is presented as the result of an unfortunate legally-required minimum, not as an appropriate punishment for her actions. She is now the victim of a legal system that can't acknowledge her personal circumstances--her evil father and mother who through their lack of love drove her to want to help the German soldier.The fact is, our heroine's \\"protection\\" of the soldier is an indirect cause of his eventual death, something which never even seems to occur to the heroine--or to anyone else for that matter. It is odd that after portraying the soldier as having such great personal potential and goodness that he should be protected from internment at a POW camp, the author does nothing to suggest at his death that his life had any value beyond his relationship with our heroine. Even there his memory serves as nothing more than a foundation for her daydreams. And her daydreaming is not about his life cut short, it's about her playing the role of sympathetic visitor to his grieving mother in Germany!Not only does this story present extremely poor choices by a 12-year-old as praiseworthy, it never questions a relationship between a 12-year-old girl and a 19-year-old man, and it romanticizes death--a very unfortunate theme among much of what passes for award-worthy modern children's literature.Finally, all of the characters are completely one-dimensional. The heroine's parents are evil without explanation, the German soldier is a perfect gentleman, the townspeople are hysterical bigots, the heroine's black maid is wise and the only source of love for the heroine.With all the great literature out there, why do we have our children read this junk? What our children read is important and it is very disturbing that it appears from the other reviews that a great many schools seem to be using this book as part of a literature or history program. It is poor on all levels, poorly written, poor character and plot development, and poor moral lessons."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"As the book progresses, the storyline builds until, at the end, it goes straight down.

The place in which it is located is important because it was in this time that World War II was being held in.This book is mostly about a Jewish girl named Patty Bergen short for Patricia who meets a man named Frederick Anton Reiker. This man is a German soldier who is being kept prisoner. Patty doesn't think of herself much until the day he changes her life upside down. Accompanying them in this miraculous book is her little sister named, Sharon who usually takes up everybodys attention and her nanny or servant named, Ruth. Ruth is like a mom and a dad for Patty. Pattys parents are also some of the characters in this book. They don't think of her much of her much better yet they don't think of her at all. Think they are going to change then start reading think they aren't do the same.In my opinion, this is a good book it is sort of like a soap opera. So the people who just love to read or see soap operas should really try to read this book. I truly enjoyed reading this book because in some parts it had sort of like a romantic mood and then again it had a battle mood. (This book reminded me of a heart with a stake going through it.

Two very loose ends.But then I came here to see what others thought and kept coming across the word &quot;romantic.&quot; Excuse me? A girl who isn't yet in 7th grade and a young man who would be about to start his junior year in college?Though the covers of the various editions always seem to be trying to make her look older and him younger, the fact that anyone could see their relationship as &quot;romantic&quot; is majorly creepy.Given the difference in their ages, I found Patty's obsession with Anton vaguely disturbing (despite the fact--yeah, yeah, I got it--that she had no love at home). The only way I could mentally tolerate Anton's continuing relationship with her was to tell myself that he recognized her feelings and that he was desperate enough to escape that he was using her--understandable, not romantic."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I was prompted to read this book through having seen the movie (and choked back the tears) many years ago. I'm not terribly sure that I agree with the reading age though; this strikes me as being more suitable for teenagers than nine year olds.The subject matter is tragic and treated with a simplicity that is damning. Patty Bergen, a Jewish girl, befriends a German prisoner of war, seeing beyond the \\"Nazi\\" hatred of her peers to the person inside. She is eventually backed up by her parents' African-American housekeeper, the only other true-hearted soul in this entire story. Anton, the German soldier, is a self-proclaimed coward, but he discovers his own inner courage when it comes to the crunch.Through these three main characters, so different in their attitudes from the narrow-mindedness and sheer cruelty of the others, we learn that it's possible to go beyond the outer looks of a person and that what is inside truly counts. Patty's daydreams are poignant and sad, highlighting the difference between what she needs and what her reality actually is.The self-righteous townspeople are racists and have committed more than one atrocity in their time. And the innocence of the main character, who notices but does not quite understand, is beautifully portrayed. We get the impression that she is on the verge of losing that innocence, her belief that all people are essentially good, and the feeling of that is so sad.In a way this story is a fable - a bitter one, for sure. But I found that the story was compelling and moving, and above all thought-provoking. If nothing else, it teaches us that not all is what it seems. I still wish that it had had a happy ending."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This was a truly painful book for me--I might have abandonned the effort if my reading group had not chosen it. Neither Jewish nor Germanic, I am simply uncomfortable reading about the victimization of children--whether the brutality is physical or emotional. In this case 12-year-old Patty Bergen endured both in the home where she was supposed to be safe and valued.It definitely would have been my loss had I not continued, but it was not a book to &quot;enjoy&quot;. I felt the tension rising with grim persistence, as I realized that she lived in perpetual fear: of maternal rejection and ridicule; of her vicious, child-beater father; of coming in a poor second place to her pretty, petted little sister. Worst of all she knew that the entire, narrow-minded Arkansas town would oppose her humanitarian treatment of an eascaped German (but not Nazi) POW. The story reminds us that World War II came disagreeably close to home--not with bullets, air raids and invasion, but in a more subtle manner--by attacking the mind as well. In Greene's scenario of mass paranoia and government-promoted prejudice, there is no room for human compassion, international understanding or the budding of romance. Even pure friendship is tainted by vicious minds. But Patty is a real heroine, willing to endure social stigma and punishment to remain true to her heart. The ending was sudden and shattering. A heart-wrenching, thought-provoking book for mature readers."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"My daughter is now too older and far too accomplished a reader in her own right to need or want me to read to her, but I wish I had known of this when we were still reading together. I read this for a couple of reasons. As a native of Little Rock I wanted to read what is perhaps the most celebrated juvenile novel to have come out of my home state. Second, I have seen it highly praised and wanted to see if the praise was justified.The praise was indeed justified. The novel is about a 12-year-old Jewish girl living in a small fictional town in northeastern Arkansas named Jenkinsville. As far as I can guess it is somewhere between Forrest City and Memphis. Wynne is mentioned as a nearby town. Looking at a map I would guess Jenkinsville is approximately where Parkin, Arkansas is. The protagonist of the novel is Patty Bergen, who is as isolated as a child can be. Her mother is unrelentingly critical of her while her father is both dismissive and physically abusive. At the time of the action of the novel she is virtually friendless as well, with most of her friends off at Baptist summer camp in the Ozarks (as any Arkansas Baptist would know, Siloam Springs). And as a member of the only Jewish family in town, she feels religious alienation as well. In the course of the novel only a few people seem friendly toward her at all. Her grandparents in Memphis give her a kind of love that her parents deny her. The black family maid and cook acts as a sort of real parent that her parents seem incapable of being. A Memphis newspaper reporter accords a level of respect to her that few others seem capable of. And, surprisingly, the town sheriff seems truly compassionate. But most of all a young twenty-year-old German prisoner of war helps her more than anyone else believe that she is \\"a person of worth.\\" The book is filled with ironies as the two people who help her most with her sense of self-esteem are a black maid and a German prisoner, just as it is ironic that his is most aided by that same black maid and a young Jewish girl.This is a deeply affecting, moving novel. Patty is a deeply flawed, yet wonderfully realistic character. She has a habit of telling petty lies that partly serve to garner her respect that others deny her and partly to force others to pay attention to her. The scene in which she is forced to go for a horrible perm on a blisteringly hot day is a chillingly vivid and realistic portrait of what would seem like hell to a small girl.As others have noted, this is on many levels a sad book. But it is also, I think, an optimistic one. One can't help but believe that Anton, Patty's German soldier, was right: Patty is a person of worth. It is difficult to believe that she didn't turn out well after the events of the novel and that what made this possible for her was what others helped her realize about herself. In the short run, one imagines things got worse for her. As Ruth, the black maid, told her, her parents were \\"irregular\\" or \\"seconds,\\" meaning that just as some pieces of clothing were sold cheaply because they didn't measure up, so Patty's parents never had and never would measure up. One can sense that Patty's home life remained bleak and unhappy, but that she still was going to turn out all right. She was, she had learned, a person of worth.I recommend this to adults as well as younger readers, but I especially recommended parents reading it to their children. It isn't just a great read, it raises a host of difficult and fascinating questions.Note: I was right! I just read an article about Bette Greene and learned that she was raised in Parkin, Arkansas. I think it is safe to assume that Parkin is the real Jenkinsville."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Summer of My German Soldier is about a young adolescent 12 year-old-girl named Patty who is Jewish. She falls in love with a Nazi soldier when she is at her father's shop. He asks her what kind of pencil sharpener he should buy. He falls in love with her. Her grandmother then takes her out on a fancy train ride, and buys her new clothes. Patty loves this outing because her parents do not really understand her at back at home. Anton then escaped from the prison after her train ride with her grandmother. She feeds him, in her garage, and takes care of him, only until she has to eventually tell Ruth. He then leaves her. She often sees him walking, and calls out, but he does not hear her. One day when he actually heard her, she went inside the house and stole tons of food all for him. Later that day, her father comes home and notices a ring on her finger. She said that it was from a nice man who wanted food, so she gave it to him. Since she was so nice he gave her the ring, when it was really from Anton. Her father, as usual, got really upset at this, and suspected that he did something to her. She swore nothing happened, but with his stubborn mind, whacked her across the forehead. Ruth pampered and watched over her. Since Ruth was talking Patty's side, Patty's dad fired Ruth. It was the first time that she had ever been fired. Near the end of the book Patty hears that Anton gets killed, and is devastated. The overall book was enjoyable, but some did not really make sense. For example, even though we knew that the father of Patti was moody, it really did not make sense for him to beat her at the times that he did. When he was in the garage, and his temper rising, he slapped her across the face asking her where she got the ring. Secondly, I thought that some parts were rather slow, and did not need to be there. I would rate this book four stars out of five because I enjoyed the story, but some parts of the book did not need to be there, and some parts were slow."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"A thought of a boring war story comes to mind when looking at the cover and title of Summer of My German Soldier.

During the Holocaust that would've never been thought of. Patricia Bergen, who goes by Patty, goes through basically her whole life being criticized by her parents.

When a German Soldier comes to her father's store, a friendly, yet upmost important relationship comes between them. She does everything in her power to keep them together.

Her mother only loves her youngest daughter and her father could care less wether she was around or not. When Patty's small hometown in Arkansas is chosen to become a site for a camp housing German prisioners during World War II, Patty finds a friend who will love her for who she is. Even though she is Jewish, Patty discovers that the German soldier, Anton, is not a mean,hateful person, but is a lonely prisioner, much like herself. When Anton runs away, Patty can't think of anything else to do than to help Anton get to freedom. She brings him food, clothes, and shelters him in her old garage. Even though it is against the law and patty may lose all her friends, she has to help the only person who has ever really apprecaited her for who she is. After Anton leaves by hopping on a train, Patty's life pretty much returns to nermal. Until, the detective Patty has come to hate gets Patty to confess her crime by telling her of Anton's death. Patty is sentenced to six months in a reform school for girls, but she is certain she did the right thing and will travel to Germany to find Anton's family some day."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"When I picked up this book, I thought it would help clear up rascist thoughts about Germans in the form of a story about deep friendship. As it turned out, I was more impressed with the synopsis on the back of the book than with the book itself. This book is about a girl named Patty who decides to hide an escaped German soldier in her garage. She barely knows them; barely gets to know him, and is devastated when he runs away and gets killed. If Patty hadn't blabbed a story about how he gave a ring to her to a friend (by the way, I found it stupid and unrealistic that he gave his family keepsake to a stranger) then he probably wouldn't have been tracked down and shot. And spoiled little self-centered Patty never even figured that out.At the beginning of the book, Patty was an appeally character, because she was just a little girl trying to figure out what she wanted to do with her life. There was even a bit of well-developed character that the auther could have done something with, and I have to say I felt some compassion for her, especially when she was beaten and misunderstood by her parents. Throughout the book, however, Patty went from amusing but naive to a little aggravating to rip-your-hair-out-annoying. At the end, I was extremely sick of her, and didn't like her at all.I guess the thing I disliked most about this book is that none of the characters had any understanding of the world, how it works, why people do things, or of love, compassion, or hate. There wasn't a single character who I could relate to; even the characters who were supposed to be friendly seemed cold and distant. Ruth was my favorite character. She was the only character who had any wisdom (or any common sense, for that matter), but I regret to say that at the end of the book, I grew to hate her because she told Patty that her parents would never love her. I think this is one of the worst possible things anyone can tell a child, whether it's true or not. And in this case, I believe it wasn't true (but you'll have to read the book yourself to decide). I kept waiting for some gesture of kindness, or even recognition to come from Patty's parents, but it never did.I recommend that you save your time, and not read this book. There are many books about World War II and the Holocaust that are much better."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I love this book for many reasons. First, because it is so politically incorrect, in its depiction of the unlikely alliance between a misfit Jewish girl and a rather naive German prisoner of war in the small minded setting of WWII era American rural south.This book was published in 1973, and written by a Jewish woman who was the same age as the protogonist, Patty Bergen, during WW II and who likewise grew up in a rural Arkansas town. My guess is that it wouldn't even be published today -- the very idea of giving a German the benefit of the doubt is now taboo, in the aftermath of Daniel Goldhagen and his book, Hitler's Willing Executioners, in which he has supposedly proved, once and for all, that all Germans are evil, and equally responsible for the Holocost.Yes, it is shocking that Patty felt so abused by her Jewish parents that she sided with a German. Unfortunately, that's how people sometimes behave in real life. That's why this book transcends the genre of young adult novels -- all the major characters are deeply flawed, from Patty, who should know better than to committ treason, to Anton, who should have sat tight, seeing as he was being treated just fine by the Yanks, to her self-centered and I'm afraid all too typical parents. We see that being a member of a beleagured minority group (Jews) doesn't make Patty's parents saints. They are as class conscious as any of their redneck neighbors.This book, if published today, would probably be attacked for being antisemitic, simply because some of the Jewish characters aren't perfect. (Her grandparents, by the way, provide a contrast of warmth and fairness.)This book provides no panaceas at the end, when the heroine is still far from in the clear. It is a morally challenging book that surprised me at every turn with its realism and fearlessness.In a way I have more respect for it than I do for To Kill A Mockingbird, which other reviewers here compared it to. That book itself has become a predictable cliche, much imitated, of moral right and wrong -- of course white people are always wrong, and black prisoners innocent victims. Greene's book, on the other hand complicates the simplistic liberal equation.A breath of fresh air in an era of PC censorship."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This is a story of Patty Bergen, a trouble making, homely thirteen-year-old growing up on the American World War Two homefront. Patty's parents are verbally abusive, and her father is known to beat her on occasion. When a German POW escapes from the local prison camp, she allows him sanctuary in hidden rooms in her home. This German soldier proves to be her first love and one of the only people who truly loves her back.I, personally, would not recommend this book for pleasure reading. The novel had well-developed characters, and that was mostly what the author concentrated on. It seemed Bette Greene wanted to just develop a character, and not a story. When something tragic happens to Patty, I'm so busy learning everything about her that I did not shed a tear. Summer of My German Soldier seems to be an analysis of the adolescent human mind, not a novel I could fall in love with."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This is my favorite book of all time.

This book was very hard to understand, especially in the scenes where her father beats her. The plot was adequate, but ther seemed to be little chapters that contributed to the plot of this book. The climax was not all that exciting for me, especially since my brother and sister have talked about it and read it. The descriptions of characters were little, partly because of the book's first person narroration. There are also some discrepancies in this book that left me asking too many questions at the end of the story. I enjoy books that leave me asking little or no questions at the end. It was also historical fiction, which is a popular genre to teach. I don't care for it"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"The book \\" Summer of My German Solider\\" is a great book. I am 10 years old and had to read this book for an english project. I feel this is a good book to read because it shows how teenagers deal or overcome with the problems they face in life. Most think because it is about WWII that it would be relly borrrringg!!! but it isn't.Then again some people don't like love stories either. I think this book is a great book to read because it is funny, mysterious, exciting, and there are a few facts in it.The story is about a girl named Patricia ( Patty) who is 12 years old.Her family is really mean to her and they don't show any appreciation. Then one day while she is working in a family store she helps a boy or a POW/ Nazi then they start to talk. They get into a conversation and patty doesn't think he is bad, he can speek great english.

All of the typical war viewpoints of hatred and distrust were turned on their heads. In the end, I think I loved Anton as much as Patty did.

The character really come to life. They theme of book are good. It my favorite kinda historical fiction, as i call, a political love story. It interesting and i couldn't put it down.

Ruth also gives back the ring that Anton gave her, which she thought was gone foever.This was a very sad book. It shocked me how terrible everyone treated Patty, she was just twelve years old. It really shows us true love. Love between a young Jewish woman and a German man. Also, it show us love between Patty and Ruth to only other person to believe in Patty. It also show us the hard times that Patty had to face growing up.Patty is such a strong girl. She had lived through such heartache when she was so young. When reading this, it got me thinking if this book was based on a true story and if the author based it on her own experiences.The one thing that I didn't like about the book was the cover. I think that it doesn't represent the book well at all. I would have never picked up this book by just looking at the cover. It also probably wouldn't attract boy readers either because the cover makes it look like just a mushy love story. But in reality this book is about alot more than just love.Overall GOOD BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"If you like books about World War II, I think you will like this book. It is a very well written book.When Patty finds out that Anton is a German Soldier, everything goes upside down. She is really scared of hiding him, but she knows he is different from all the other soldiers because he is nice. When Anton dies she has one big problem. Since Anton was a German Soldier the FBI came and took her to a reformatory school for girls.I rated Summer of My German Soldier three stars. The reason why I rated this book three stars is because, part of the book I liked and part of it didn't. I don't really like reading historical actions. The part I did like was when Ruth, the maid, would stand up for Patty. I liked how she saw Ruth one last time. The parts I didn't like was when Patty would get beaten on by her parents, and how when she did something she didn't mean to do she got hurt so bad it was like I felt the pain too. That's why I rated Summer of My German Soldier three stars."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This story takes place during World War II and is set in a small town named Jenkinsville. The story is about a prison camp for German POW's, and how a German POW escapes, and all the problems he runs into. The main characters are Patty, the daughter, who is always getting into trouble. Mr. and Mrs. Bergen, Patty's parents, run a local store. Ruth, the Bergen's maid and house cleaner, listens to and hears all the problems in the Bergen's household. Anton is the German prisoner of war who becomes Patty's friend. Most of the story was about Anton breaking out of prison camp and Patty hiding him. Throughout the entire book my favorite character is Anton because he is smart and witty and always knows what is going on.I was unable to relate to any of the characters directly in this story because I am not like any of them but at times I have felt that same way they do and have had similar relationships with people. I've often felt like helping some one in need. I've also felt like purposely disobeying my parents. So even though I did not feel that I could relate to any characters I was able to relate to how they felt. In the story Ruth and Patty where really close and shared a lot of feelings I'm the same way with my parents. So even though it is not exactly the same it is close.This book is moderately enjoyable but not the best I've ever read. My favorite part of the book was when Patty is lies to the FBI about Anton because I find it funny that such a young girl is able to lie to such a high authority figure. My least favorite was the beginning because there was no action at all. If I could change any part of this book it would be to make the prison escape more interesting.The book was OK over all, but I would not recommend it to any of my friends or any one I know. The only type of person that I think would like this book is a history nut. Over all I only give this book a 5 out of 10 stars because I did not find the book particually exciting."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I read Summer of My German Soldier recently. I enjoyed this book, but I also believe that it could possibly have been better. It is about Jewish girl, Patti, living in Arkansas during World War Two. A prison camp for Germans is opened near her town, and one day in her father's store she meets one named Anton. She instantly befriends him, and when he escapes the camp she shelters him in the garage. Eventually, after he leaves, he gets killed. I strongly feel that the idea of this story was very genius, but the book could have been better. A Jewish girl falling in love with a German soldier could have so many possibilities, but the story lacks any action or suspense. There were so many boring parts during that book it made me sick. Many parts were Patti just thinking about her love for Anton. Even Patti said at one point that she was bored. The story also didn't develop the characters very well. When Anton died, because of bad character development, it didn't have as much emotion as it could have. The part about her transitioning to jail was confusing as well. I do believe that these parts could have been much better in the story, and it could have also been made a splendid book. With better character development and a more clear and exciting plotline, this book definitely had potential, but failed."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Do you like to read about WWII?

Patty will always remember him, because he loved her in a way her parents never will.I gave this book one star. I did not like this story, because it was hard for me to read and understand.

All she wants is love, and she finds it with a German prisoner, Anton, who was brought to US soil to be held.Germans were not liked by US citzens. It didn't matter if the Germans were soldiers or citizens themselves. The hatred was the same for both. Patty, outcasted by her family, took a liking to Anton.

The story is about a girl named Patty who feels that her parents are mean and cruel to her because they don't appreciate anything she does for them. The only person who she can find acceptance in is her housekeeper, Ruth. Patty's small town in Jekingsville, becomes the site of a POW camp for German soldiers, and one day the soldiers are allowed to visit her father's department store to purchase some hats. Patty, who was working that day, met one of the German soldiers named Anton Reiker. Soon after, Anton escaped from the prison camp and hid out at Patty's house in her abandoned attic. Later her family found out what Patty has been up to.If one of the characters were to run into trouble it would be Patty. In the book Patty makes wrong choices that get her in alot of trouble. Knowing that she is Jewish she's not allowed to talk to any of the German soldiers that come to her hometown. She disobeys and does it anyway. she helps the German soldier that escaped from the prison camp. Later in the story the FBI catches up to what Patty has been up to. Her hometown then turns against her and calls her a trader and sees her as a bad person.My favorite character in the story is Patty Bergen. But, if I were in her place I don't think I would have done the same thing she did by helping the German prisoner who escaped the campsite. For example, it's like me hiding out Bin Laddin in my attic. I could never turn my back on my country and help him. Patty is a twelve-year old brave girl who takes the risk of hiding out a German prisoner. Her parents always brush her off to the side. Patty feels left out in her family kind of like an outcast. I can kind of understand were Patty is coming from for her to help that German soldier. Since her mother or father doesn't pay any attention to her she feels like she needs someone to talk to or any one that has interest in her and would care about her. She obviously doesn't care who it is because she starts talking to a German prisoner and he's in his twenty's. The thing that I like about her is that she's a good-hearted person.If I were to relate to any of the characters, I think it would be Patty. I had an experience kind of similar to what Patty went through. My parents always told my sisters and me we weren't allowed to have a boyfriend until we were eighteen-years old. I was the one who disobeyed my parents. When I was about thirteen-years old I had a boyfriend anyway. I would lie to my parents about where I was going or whom I was going with. After a while I felt guilty, and I felt like I had to confess. I waited to long to tell them and they ended up finding out. After that it took me a while to earn my trust back from them. So I think it's best for parents to be open with their children. Don't tell your kids you can't do this, you can't go there, or you can't hang out with a certain person because they don't like them. Later in life their parents will realize they should not tell their kids \\"no\\" just for the heck of it or just to be strict. I could see who was a bad person to hang out with, or a bad place to go.I enjoyed reading this book, but it took me a couple of chapters to get into it. I had a favorite part and a least favorite part. My favorite part was when Patty met the German soldier at her father's department store and supplied him with a place to stay, clothes, and food. My least favorite part of the story was when Patty's father beat her because he didn't like her friend Freddy. I don't think children should get beaten by their parents, especially a young twelve-year old. I could see if it was a little kid getting disciplined, but spanked on the hand.I think I would recommend this book for someone else to read. It's a good book. The kind of person I recommend to read this book is a girl or boy who enjoys reading romantic stories."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Summer of My German Soldier is an average book. It is kind of romantic so I didn't like it that much. But that's just me. When my reading teacher first introduced this book, I thought it would be the best war book I had ever read. (This is because I am a huge war buff.) Before I even started reading, I was imagining an action-filled, danger at ever turn, war book. I was soooooo wrong! After reading the first few pages, I immediately became bored. I just hope that the sequel, Morning is a Long Time Comming, is better."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Hello everyone!I am an eighth grader currently in middle school. For the last 9 weeks of school in Literature class, we are required to read a classic book. I was waffling between two books to read, neither which had my full attention, when my teacher brought up this book. I looked at the cover, picturing characters I could later identify as Anton, Patty, and Ruth, and it looked interesting enough, so I picked it.Wow, am I glad I did!This book is a great look at life in a small town where a POW camp was established during World War II, and how the residents react. We are studying WWII in Social Studies, so I found this a great companion to read.Patty is a wonderful character; I felt like she was someone I could meet at my own school as a friend. Anton seemed like a friendly person that I would see around town. The characters were down to earth and relatable, not like stereotypes that you can find easily in some books, at all.The problem in this book is: Anton escapes from the camp, and Patty sees him trying to catch a train. She hides him in a room over her family's garage, and he lives there for several days. However, he has to leave. Later when everyone finds out that Patty hid a \\"Nazi\\" in her home, everyone turns their backs on her, calling her bad names and spitting on her every time they see her.Bette Greene did an extraordinary job when she wrote this book.I have now read this book five times. Five!!! The other night when I was at a bookstore, I finally bought my own copy, and ordered the sequel from an online store the same night. I cannot wait until it arrives!Now, for an eighth grader to recommend this book, don't you think it would have had to have been pretty dang good? :)"},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"This book is narrated in a 12 year old girls perspective. It is a good book and easy reading. The important part of this book is the lesson of even when the world doesn't see it, seeing you're own beauty, you're own goodness. Twelve year old patty Bergen is a Jew living in her hometown of Jenkinsville, Arkansas during World War 2 amongst prominently Caucasian people. Patty is a curious girl who looks up vocabulary words. She has the aptitude to advance in the world but she doesn't recognize this in herself. She doesn't recognize anything good about herself. She thinks her nose is too long and her figure is nothing but straight lines and not womanly, all in all ugly. Her mother reinforces this belief in her by costantly making disapproving remarks about her appearance, and not ever showing her affection. Her mother is a very beautiful lady with black hair and dark eyes. Patty feels she is a shame and a burden to her mother, being born so homely. Her father is a very sad abusive man, she doesn't recieve love from him. He beats her regularly, for any little thing that ignites his terrible temper. Ruth, the hired colored servant is her only friend.Patty's hometown becomes the site of a German prisoner camp. Patty meets some of these prisoners when they are brought to her fathers store to buy hats to shield them from the sun, because they had been passing out picking cotton. She speaks to one prisoner in particular, 22 year old Anton Reiker who knows perfect English and acts as an interprter for the other prisoners. She finds he is a good person who isn't in favor of what Hitler is doing but had to comply in order to live. This man escapes from the camp and she shelters him. During the time she shelters him they become good friends. Patty is looking for love, friendship, acceptance, and she finds this in him. Anton appriciates her for being kind to him, he recognizes that she is intelligent and pretty, and feels appriciated finally.I didn't like the way Patty thought in this story. Her thinking was confined to only an insecure twelve year olds. This is somewhat a good book for someone who wants to analize the mind of a child like Patty, for instance if you're interested in becoming a child psychologist. I liked the fact that it encompassed a good message on appriciating yourself even though no one else does."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"Patty is a twelve year old American jewish girl.

Greene's story of impossible love, between a Jewish girl in the American South and a Nazi prisoner-of-war, endures because of its timeless theme.Patty's touching story crosses all barriers. Although this story was intended for middle-grade readers, it is equally appealing to teens and adults.

Strong characters and a poignant story."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I listened to this book (audio tape) from Recorded Books, Inc. and it was exceptionally well read. I enjoyed the follow-up, Morning Is A Long Time Coming as well. Bette Green is a writer's writer (I'm a fiction writer, too). Her work spans all ages. In fact, I consider it unfortunate that, simply because her protagonist is a teenager, her books have been placed strictly in the young adult category. It takes wisdom of life and knowledge of psychology to recognize that this is the story of an abused person. Her life's choices and experiences often pertain to the severe abuse she suffered as a child, from physically and mentally cruel parents. I know, because her parents might as well have been mine, although my physically cruel parent was my mother, whereas Patty's was her father, a raging, Hitler-like tyrant. One wonders how this wonderful young person even survived, for her father was about as monstrous a parent as I've ever encountered in literature - or real life. In some ways, however, her mother was worse - mocking, humiliating, goading, tormenting her daughter. That was my fate, too, and it leads to many tragic symptoms, not the least of which are constant, tortuous self-doubt and the conflictingtraits of people-pleasing/provocative \\"truth\\"-telling. I adored Patty, however, and loved her quest for love and self-acceptance. That, too, mirrored my own. Brilliant writing for all ages... I just wish there was another sequel that tells us what happens to Patty when/if she returns to the States. Does she marry Roger, the French photographer? Does she finally, truly confront her rotten parents with what they have done to her/what they are? Does she get a big inheritance from her grandparents so she can become the writer/journalist we believe she can be? And I can't help wondering why she didn't tell Anton's father and sister that she had seen him? She says that she didn't want to bring them any further stress, but wouldn't that have made them feel good, to know that, before his death, someone had truly loved and cared for him? Oh, well. I will just have to imagine these things, and isn't that what's so marvelous about great literature? It causes you to use your imagination! Thanks, Bette Green, for a thought-provoking, empathic read."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"The mark of a good novel, to me, is when the author develops the characters so completely and skillfully that I feel as if I know each one personally. The characters must come to life as each one exhibits attributes that I see in people I know. Bette Greene's character development in this novel is excellent. Patty is not simply a twelve year old Jewish girl who is fascinated with a German soldier and breaks the law to keep him safe; rather, she is a child who is hurting so deeply from the rejection she encounters in her life that she will go to great lengths to feel loved. When her father isn't abusing her, he is belittling her or acting in a condescending way toward her. These passages are very disturbing because I feel as if I am there with her. While her mother isn't physically abusive, her verbal attacks are just as devastating. In the eyes of her parents, Patty does nothing worthwhile. I especially relate to Patty when she constantly compares herself to her younger sister, Sharon. Sharon seems to be the trophy child of the family-a beautiful, agreeable child whom her parents can be proud of. Haven't we all compared ourselves to someone and come up short? I have struggled with similar feelings in my own family, and this was a startling reflection of my own life. I feel that Patty and I would have been friends. Greene's character development is superb because, even though this novel is written from the viewpoint of a twelve year old, I still found myself identifying with the characters as a twenty-two year old college student.On the other hand, I was rather disappointed that I didn't learn more about the time period throughout the course of this book. Since this novel falls under the historical category of young adult literature, I had expected to come to a greater understanding of life in the United States during war time, particularly during World War II. Instead, I feel that, for the most part, the setting was not as integral to the plot as it should have been. While I know the focus of the story is on the story of Patty harboring a German soldier, I had hoped to become more educated about this time in history. Sadly, I don't feel as if I know the time period any better that I did to begin with.However, I feel that Greene succeeds in revealing the universality of human emotions. It doesn't matter that Patty is a young Jewish girl and Anton a German soldier. They both are, in their own way, endeavoring to escape imprisonment. As Anton escapes from prison and then attempts to remain physically unrestricted, Patty experiences an emotional escape as she opens herself up to feel loved. This book is a journey in discovering oneself."},{"Title":"Summer of My German Soldier","review":"I read this book in school in the 10th grade.

The first edition of the book (by Feroze Sons Publishers, Lahore, Pakistan) was released in the 1970s around the same time as \\"The Hundred: A Ranking of the Most Influental Persons in History\\" by Michael H. Hart. This version is an unofficial publication by the Library of Islam, which is based in the US.To this day, \\"Hundred Great Muslims\\" remains the only book of its kind. It offers \\"fact files\\" for 100 of the most influental people of high achievement that were either born Muslim or converted to Islam during their lifetime. I often consult this book when I can't remember the particulars of an influental muslim personality's life. However, I am no longer quite as enamoured with this book as I was when I was a child. Unlike some of K. J. Ahmad's other books, this book does not present its material in a strict scholarly fashion. For example, a key event in the some of the individual's life is recounted with a narrative that is biased toward the muslim perspective. The book works best as a point of initiation (and inspiration) to muslim history for muslim children and teens.Among the muslim community we have a tendency to argue about who was a more pious muslim and deserved to be in this list [see first reviewer's comments]...or the corollory, who among the 100 was not a pious muslim and, therefore, did not belong in the list. The point to note here is that the citeria of \\"Great\\" is not piety, rather achievement and influence (especially on future generations of muslims)."},{"Title":"Hundred Great Muslims","review":"Firstly, I must commend the author on attempting to tackle such a noble task.On to the criticism - the book is good as a *list* (see below) of famous muslims, not great muslims. It should have been titled 100 famous muslims. Whereas the selection of who is great is bound to be controversial (and there are many in the book who were undoubtedly great), the selection in this book clearly has a significant number who are not great as muslims, although they may well have been famous, even popular.The author would have done better to accept that some famous muslims were not so great, as muslims, instead of struggling to portray them in a favorable light.Another criticism I have is that many of the brief biographies of the chosen hundred are very shallow - hence the emphasis above on &quot;list&quot;.Buy the book and read it, but beware attempts by the author to co-opt famous people as great muslims, when in fact some were strongly opposed to Islam (Nasser, for example) and some were more interested in the worldly."},{"Title":"Hundred Great Muslims","review":"The book is divided into twelve categories. Starting with prophet Muhammad (SAW) to Scholars, Thinkers, Reformers, Statesmen, Scientists, Generals i.e. Rumi, Al-Biruni, Iqbal, Jinnah and Muhammad bin Qasim.The book gives us a brief account of the lives of these great personalities and how they reached out and transformed the lives of millions around them and their contributions in the fields of science, medicine, politics, literature - that helped shaping the modern world. It is a good book for a quick reference and for the younger generation, that is looking for some direction and role models."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"\`Little America' has three main story lines, each of which is engrossing and provides a lot of fodder for discussions. In other words, it's a great choice for a book club.First is the 'Who's your daddy?' line, set in the present, in which Terry Hooper, the adult son of a former CIA operative, tries to find out what kind of person his father was. Was he a good guy or a bad guy? At first glance this appears to be the main story in the book but I think it serves more as a catalyst to keep the story going.The second story line is the most fascinating and has the potential to generate a good deal of debate. Set in 1958, it revolves around the friendship that develops between the CIA operative and the young king of Kurash, the subject of his mission. Is it real or just part of his assignment? If it's real, which will win out, friendship or 'duty'? What impact will it have on the characters involved?The third story line in \`Little America' became frighteningly relevant after what occurred when I was about halfway through it (Sept. 11). It looks at American foreign policy through the eyes of Allen and John Foster Dulles. It expresses almost as aptly as 'The Ugly American' how totally clueless we can be when it comes to seeing the world through the eyes of others. Bromell, in a novel based in the 1950s, provides insight into how we might best respond in the current crisis."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"The mysteries at the heart of Little America will keep readers turning pages, but the melancholy soul of its narrator is what endures. By researching the fall and disappearance of a desert kingdom, Terry hopes to penetrate the iron curtain that separated him from the father he saw but never knew. In the process, he tries to claim some integrity for himself in a world of failed gestures, conflicted loyalties, and ambiguous circumstances. Henry Bromell has a wonderful feeling for the self-hatred that accompanies \\"the nostalgia of defeat.\\" Arabs and Americans alike are portrayed with complexity and sympathy; nobody escapes scot-free. The plot is beautifully constructed but even more impressive is the grace with which Henry shifts from past to present narratives. There are several outstanding moments when the narrator's acuity of perception and depth of feeling mesh perfectly, as when Terry describes a girl playing tennis or when he is overwhelmed by forgiveness and love. The politics of the book are particularly timely - the shadows of Palestine and Iraq never entirely fade from the shifting sands of his narrative. The particularly heinous behavior of the Dulles brothers remind us forcefully of the arrogance that has so often accompanied American power. In the end, Terry's father relies more on patience, trust, and even love than he does on poisoned handkerchiefs and coded messages. Would that there were more like him! This is that rare book that satisfies on many fronts - political, literary, and emotional. Read it."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"Californian Henry Bromell uses international intrigue and a vexing family mystery as linchpins in his cleverly plotted novel, &quot;Little America.&quot; One might expect a slightly quirky take from the writer/producer/director of the popular offbeat TV series &quot;Northern Exposure.&quot; We're not disappointed.What matters history, personal or global? Readers may decide for themselves as they follow the path of history teacher Terry Hooper while he pries into past lives and navigates the globe in an attempt to discover the truth about his father, Mack. Terry is interested in &quot;what happens inside history, what history hides, what gets left out and what is forgotten.&quot;The elder Hooper, a C.I.A station chief in a Middle Eastern country during the 1950s, was charged with the most diplomatic of tasks - ingratiating himself with the King of Kurash, a cold, inaccessible desert monarch. The King was killed at the age of 23.Years later, when Terry reads a newspaper article stating that a C.I.A. official carried cash to the young King and a book stating that the King was assassinated by U.S. agents, Terry wonders about his father's involvement, if any, in these crimes. Thus, begins a quest that reveals the past and probes the present.Once again, Henry Bromell proves his mettle as a stellar producer of first-rate entertainment."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"In this day and age, it's fairly easy to find books that, instead of actually researching the subject at hand, make do with an extremely superficial view of the proceedings. The image of Arabs especially is frequently subject to gross generalizations if not downright lies, rooted in research that a first-grader would be ashamed of. Little America, I'm pleased to say, is not one of those books.As a Palestinian who grew up in Jordan, hearing, seeing, reading about the Jordan in the 50's, this book seemed to recreate the feelings that such information evoked in me: A sense of faux-nostalgia for a time I had never actually lived. Why? Because the story of Kurash and its king is essentially a retelling of the stories of King Hussein as well as King Feisal, and the histories of Jordan and Iraq under the Hashemite families and the conflicts they faced. The book perfectly captures the many challenges that faced the monarchy back in the 50's when it had to deal with the influx of Palestinian refugees from the 1948 \\"nakbah\\", not to mention the Ba'ath movements, the Islamic Brotherhood, and of course Jamal Abd Al-Nasser, the strongest force in the Arab world at the time.The fact that this book was written by an American is, for me, still hard to believe, as even the names of the Arabic characters actually make a distinction between different ARabic nationalities, as opposed to just using the word \\"Abu\\".Aside from that, the story is expertly told in a non-conventional and extremely interesting fashion. This is no thriller, as one other reviewer said, but it still is one of the most fascinating, interesting, and, to sound cliched, important books of our generation. Bravo Mr. Bromell."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"\\"Little America,\\" an intriguing novel by Henry Bromell, is a book worth reading. An eclectic variety of the aspects of society and life are present in the storyline. From family and friendship to politics and government, this book nicely combines all of these elements in an intricately woven plot.The leading character of the story is a history teacher named Terry Hooper. He lived an interesting life as a child since his father was a CIA station chief in the fictional country of Kurah, supposedly located in the Middle East. Upon reading a report on the assassination of the Kurah King by an American agent, Terry is interested in his father's involvement in this matter.Hooper starts his investigative work with some questions for his father in regards to the work he performed as a CIA agent in Kurah. Piece by piece, he develops a blurry picture, but before he can fully decipher the story, he runs into a dead end- his father's lips are sealed in accordance with the oath he took as a CIA agent. Thereafter, different workers in the station, each with a unique voice, tell the remaining segments of the story. Despite many twists, turns and the alteration between current time and retrospect (as the characters tell what they know of Kurah), the story is nowhere from misleading. Transitions between speakers, though sometimes lengthy, are smooth and the overall theme and setting of the Middle East is never lost.One of the distinguishing characteristics of this book is its standpoint on the life and family of a CIA agent. Most movies and novels stereotype CIA agents by making them mysterious, serious, and multi-faceted in terms of personality. Often, the child would report his father sneaking off during the night, not to return for days, with only \\"business\\" as a response to inquiries regarding what the odd excursion was for.This was a book that I enjoyed reading and one that kept me hooked with its suspense. It gave me a new image of the Middle East, one quite different from what is commonly depicted by the media. I would recommend this book to anyone who wouldn't mind a little history."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"At the beginning of the summer, I received a letter from my AP English teacher, asking me to choose a book to read from a list of about ten. I spent about two hours at the bookstore, going through each of the various choices, making different piles depending on how much I was intrigued by a particular book. Somehow, &quot;Little America&quot; was the only book that wound up in my &quot;Definitely Read This&quot; pile. Just from reading the description on the book jacket, I was loving it! I started reading the first chapter in the middle of the store, and I couldn't put it down. I always know...if a book hooks me this quickly, I'm sold.Reading Henry Bromwell's dazzling new suspense novel proved a rare treat indeed. The story was fast paced and exciting, immediately throwing me into an exciting new world of politics, intrigue, and exotic adventures. Perfect summer escapist reading, and I loved every minute of it!Little America tells the story of Terry Hooper's search for the truth about his father, a man he loved deeply, but who had a secret, dark past, that's been locked away for years by the C.I.A. The book travels between two worlds, contemporary Boston and the Middle East of the past. It is a dense story, but as Terry ferrets out the truth about his father and other Americans who once worked in the Middle East, in the country of Kurash, deep, dark secrets emerge, and the reader is taken back to another time all together, a time when the world was different, and different rules applied. A time when Americans genuinely wanted to save the world, and would go to any lengths to do so.Written in a wonderful style, Bromwell's a talented enough writer to seamlessly make his narrative flow backwards and forwards in time, so the reader sees how the past and the present are inherently related to one another. The author's writing is so realistic, he's so comfortable in this world, that it's hard not to think Bromwell actually moonlights in the world of espionage and foreign politics. The exciting settings of Little America came alive for me, and Bromwell's television experience is apparent because he is able to paint vivid pictures with his words. I actually felt like I'd traveled to the small country of Kurash, experiencing all the strange details of that land. I was mesmerized by Terry's relenteless search for the truth, even if the truth would ultimately hurt him. Ultimately this multigenerational saga proved touching, informational and enlightening. It made me think about what foreign politics was like just a generation ago.I don't often find a book that just &quot;clicks&quot;, especially in this genre, and Little America did. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anybody who enjoys haivng a beautiful picture painted in their mind. Though in order to truly enjoy the book, one must look closer, at the individual brush strokes of the painting, to piece together the moving mystery."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"Little America is perhaps better read as a meditation on history and its nature than as a suspense novel and, therefore, belongs at least as much to the tradition of Graham Swift's Waterland as it does to that of Graham Greene's The Quiet American. It is a well-written, sometimes moving work, evocative of nostalgia for the 'simplicity' of the Cold War era while at the same time deeply suspicious of this same nostalgia. I enjoyed the book and would recommend it to others."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"LITTLE AMERICA is a first-rate psycho-moral drama in the tradition of Conrad, Graham Greene and John Le Carre. High praise, yes...but for me this book is up there with the best of them. Fine writing, great characterizations, terrific sense of place, along with an ingenious structure and a strong narrative engine. Bromell promises much and delivers even more. This is &quot;a thinking man's&quot; spy story. What more could a thinking reader want?"},{"Title":"Little America","review":"This book was an interesting reading for me. It was one of the best school readings I have been assigned. It was a up front look at a man looking to uncover his fathers past. His style of writing was upfront and direct. We did not feel compelled to censor his minds work of placing swear words in the text where needed, or being vague about intimate love sessions that had taken place. I most enjoyed the idea of the go-cart club. The inventiveness of having this club to lure in the king is one of the most original ideas that I have read in a long while. The book also has a sense of being a bit personal. I do not know Henry Bromell, only that he is good friends with ny english teacher, but from reading this book I have a sense that I know a little about him. That is why I believe people write books, is to allow the readers to have a brief glimpse inside the authors mind and life. He has, in my opinion, succeeded in doing so with Little America."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"LA is a well imagined, well written, and entirely 'convincing' fictional microcosm of America's involvement in Middle Eastern politics in the Cold War period. It is a hugely intelligent and engrossing spy novel."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"Little America starts from an interesting concept, the son of a CIA officer wants to understand what he saw growing up. And is written in an unusual style - mixing past and present even within sentences. These two together are both the strength and the weakness of the novel.In having it told by the son as he investigates the life of the father of 50 years earlier, the story often loses the immediacy of a thriller. It ends up being more of a mystery of the son uncovering the past than a spy novel. But there isn't really much mystery to solve, and consequently, the final revelations, though surprising, fall somewhat flat.Nevertheless, it is well written and seemingly well researched and offers important insights to the world of Middle East politics. Overall, it succeeds as a literary novel about a son trying to understand his father, even if it isn't quite the thriller that seems to be promised."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"I, like the Palestinian-Jordanian reviewer below, am familiar with Jordan's history and have lived in Amman so I loved this book. From the sounds of the other reviews though you don't need to have this familiarity with the area or the history to appreciate this book. Bromwell understands Arab history and sentiment so well. He blends real history and cultural information with a very exciting plot. And he is so good that what he describes could well have happened.

And makes one wonder about the REAL World of our SPOOKS!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Little America","review":"A big disappointment. The author's idea of recreating a vanished era is to say, over and over and over again, that some characters had a martini and smoked Marlboros. This consistently falls flat and doesn't work. Nor do the periodic song lyrics he sprinkles throughout do anything for the atmosphere.The typos and sloppy editing don't help either; on page 153 we are treated to Lyford &quot;Keys&quot;, &quot;Glouchester&quot; and the CIA's top lawyer being referred to as it &quot;general consul,&quot; an error that appears here and elsewhere. More serious errors crop up too; Allen Dulles was never referred to as the Great White Case Officer; that was Ted Shackley. The imagined conversations of real historical figures never quite take wing. There are much more serious flaws too. This book raises some interesting and important political issues but never resolves them. The author needs to learn that coming to a conclusion is what literature is all about -- the failure to do so here is a giant cop-out which leads us exactly nowhere by the end of the book. Anybody can write ambiguous and inconclusive endings; good authors take sides and resolve the conflicts they create. I won't ruin the ending but must say it is disappointing in the extreme. On the other hand, if you enjoy America-bashing and the moral equivalence theory (the US and USSR were equally at fault in the Cold War) you will like this sentimental and overwrought version of it. Good points: The author has a nice way with dialogue and there are some excellent descriptive passages about the mythical country of Kurash. He also handles the alternation between past and present events very well; time jumps back and forth but is skillfully handled so the reader is never confused. I'll buy his next book in the hope that he will improve; the basic skills are there but are not realized in this one."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"I've seen this book referred to twice as a &quot;thriller.&quot; In what sense I would like to ask. Yes, the writing is elegant in spots, and, yes, a bit &quot;quirky.&quot; But thriller? I think that would be a stretch."},{"Title":"Little America","review":"How ironic that Henry Bromell chooses to call his fictional nation Kurash, which is actually a form of martial wrestling. Bromell seems to wrestle throughout his novel with what he wants to say and where he wants to go with it.Bromell's main character is Terry Hooper, a boy who grows up the son of a cold-war CIA agent in the aforementioned fictional country. Terry, now an adult historian, tries to find the truth about his father's secret activities and simultaneously gain an understanding of who he is himself. That is where the author's wrestling begins.There is a healthy amount of intrigue in the top-secret circumstances under which his father operated. The plot is sharp with a pleasant array of surprise twists and turns. But, the author chooses to clutter this plotline with the struggles of Terry to become comfortable with his own identity and the ethical questions surrounding his search for U.S. government secrets. At times, it is difficult to ascertain whether the novel is supposed to be a novel of intrigue and suspense or whether it is supposed to be a story of family relationships and the human dilemma.Bromell's apparent wrestling with direction is compounded by his frequent shifting of point of view. Terry's first person narrative jumps to his second person observations, to third person, and to other characters' second person views without warning. Setting, time frame and storyline change just as frequently. This creates confusion and frustration for the reader.When Bromell follows a plotline and moves his story in one direction, however, it is intricate, clever and well-written. It is his hopefully unintentional lack of focus that weighs down what should be a great read."},{"Title":"A Practical Introduction to Econometric Methods:: Classical and Modern","review":"As a post graduate student facing an econometrics course for the first time I found this book to be invaluable. I found the delivery of material particularly in the \`modern' topics to be much more accessible than in either Gujarati or Enders. Some knowledge of statistics and some elements of mathematics are required, but as I quickly learned, any text on econometrics at this level requires these skills. Some authors try to overcome this hurdle by including reviews of statistics and matrix algebra either in an appendix or in an introductory chapter. Watson &amp; Teelucksingh do not do this. They present any required techniques in the body of the text . While for me in a few instances the necessary skills required reference to introductory statistics texts, I found this to be more convenient than the summaries that are found in the appendices or introductions of other econometrics texts. After all, such summaries are typically attempts to fit elegant theoretical constructs into a few bullet points. My recommendation to the post-grad student to whom econometrics is new is to use this text and where necessary support it with whatever statistics text you were comfortable with at undergrad level."},{"Title":"A Practical Introduction to Econometric Methods:: Classical and Modern","review":"the book is simple and makes the tough parts of econometrics understandable.however some core background topics are lacking... statistical depth for persons without a solid background in statistics. such is found in other texts(see jonston, gujurati, koutsoyannis, intrilligator).furthermore the book assumes prior knowledge of matrices,hence those without a solid background herein,at left at a loss."},{"Title":"Fire on the beaches","review":"I first read this many years ago.

Along with Jack Spicer and Robin Blaser, Robert Duncan revolutionized American poetry during the Berkeley renaissance; their triumvirate of influence, more so than any combination of Beat writers, defined homosexual poetics in the twentieth century. The addition of Kenneth Rexroth and Weldon Kees to the list of great Californian poets of that period makes a good case for it being the most underrated generation of American poets.

After being picked up from school, Tomas' older sister has to leave him to go to work and his mother is not home yet. Tomas' mother is late, he does not know where she is or when she will come home. His sister leaves him alone and he feels scared but copes well on his own until his teacher unexpectedly shows up. Tomas invites her in and offers her a lollipop because his mother always offers guests a refreshment. Soon his mother comes home and offers the teacher some tea, but Tomas suggests that this is his party and offers his mother a lollipop too.The story shows a child's natural fear of being alone but also his resourcefulness in coping and ultimately his hospitality in sharing his lollipops. The illustrations are charming. The book was published in 1967. Although the words do not mention race, the pictures depict an African American family and a white teacher. What is nice is that the story shows the African American child's generosity in offering his teacher one of his lollipop's and the teacher's caring concern for the child."},{"Title":"The lollipop party;","review":"I had no idea we had this book, I found it in my basement :)Tomas is usually watched by his sister after school until is mother gets home, but one day his mother is late and late, so his sister leaves him alone so she can get to her job.

This is possible, however, with the names Tomas and Ana I suspect they may be Hispanic instead. No matter, it's not a crucial plot point."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"The first three acts of William Congreve's play, The Way of the World (1700), involve little action. The scenes focus on introducing and contrasting characters, highlighting witty dialogue, and slowly revealing details of prior events through casual references. Polite, formalized language disguises selfish motives, rivalries, deceit, and deviousness.Selfish motives, deciet, and other negative attributes may not seem a proper basis for comedy, and yet The Way of the World warrants four stars. For comparison purposes I strongly recommend reading two other Restoration period comedies: Wycherley's The Country Wife (1675) and Etherege's The Man of Mode (1676). All three plays share a cynical view of the sanctity of marriage and portray a self-centered London society obsessed with extramarital affairs.The action (certain steps to overcome obstacles to a marriage) in The Way of the World does not occur until the later acts. The marriage between Mirabell and Millamant proceeds only after both are assured that their financial situation will not be jeopardized. Love is secondary. Similarly, the unpleasant situation of Mrs. Fainall - a marriage without any pretence of love - remains unchanged.While humor may be somewhat sparse in the earlier acts, the tempo clearly picks up in acts four and five. The plot becomes extremely fluid when Mirabell's inventive fraud unravels, and his rival, Mr. Fainall, gains the upper hand. However, the last act offers a delightful twist that puts things right. (Puts things right might be an overstatement given that the play's key characters are somewhat lacking in scruples.)Although The Way of the World is only occasionally staged today, this play is often assigned reading. My favorite edition is Barron's Educational Series (1958) as it provides plentiful stage directions. In particular, indications of expression - essentially guidance to actors on the proper delivery of the dialogue - are inserted as the dialogue switches from one character to another. Examples include: \\"somewhat sourly recollecting the rebuff of the previous evening\\", \\"using frankness as a bait to draw equal frankness from her companion\\", and \\"too preoccupied to pay serious attention\\". The Barron's edition also has a lengthy introduction by Vincent Hopper and Gerald Lahey, a 5-page note on staging by George Hersey, and illustrations by Fritz Kredel.A Crofts Classic edition (published 1951, reprinted 1985) provides a useful section titled The Argument of the Play, in which the editor, Henry T. E. Perry, summarizes events that occurred prior to the beginning of the play. (Remember that the dialogue in the early acts slowly - and often obliquely - reveals details of prior events through casual references.) Perry also discusses how William Congreve adroitly used dialogue to reveal much about the personalities of his characters.The Way of the World can also be found in the Norton Critical Edition (1973) titled Restoration and Eighteenth-Century Comedy. The extensive appendix includes an 80-page section titled Criticism From Lamb to the Present; two articles directly address Congreve's play: The Way of the World by Norman Holland and Form and Wit in The Way of the World by Martin Price."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"I had to write a review after reading the two preceeding mine!This is perhaps the most brilliant of the late Restoration comedies. For all of those unfamiliar with Restoration drama, it is a rich, witty genre which has been too often neglected in American educational institutions, relegated to the &quot;secondary canon&quot; of English lit. The Way of the World is ridiculously sublime, incorporating the tropes of the genre, but exceeding its predecessors."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"\\"The Way of the World\\" is a true masterpiece of wit and social commentary. It anticipates later works by such masters of dialogue as Oscar Wilde. I read this play in a course on restoration and 18th century drama that I took in graduate school and it was by far among my favorite plays that semester. Those who complain that it is too complex (and then contradict themselves by calling it a mere soap opera) clearly do not appreciate the subtlety and multiple layers of Congreve's genius. While yes, some characters are one dimensional, the main characters are multi-layered and complex. Case in point - Mirabel, the male protagonist, clearly loves Millamant but has mercenary ambitions as well. He also has an implied rakish past, which led to the extremely unhappy marriage of Mr. and Mrs. Fainall (though he endeavors to come to Mrs. Fainall's aid during the course of the play). Certainly many of the characters are stereotypes, but that in itself is interesting and highly comical. The dialogue is absolutely brilliant, among the best I've seen. I highly recommend giving this play the time and attention it deserves - \\"The Way of the World\\" is highly rewarding entertainment."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"Witty and poignant, The Way of the World is a bit of a heavy read, unless you happen to be schooled in 18th Century colloquialisms. The theme is timeless, and with the right contemporary author, could be adapted for modern audiences. A thrashing commentary on social graces in the face of debauchery and betrayal, the hero and heroine, in true comic fashion, finally win out."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"This is a very difficult, yet witty play. For those not familiar with English Restoration comedy of manners, it may seem VERY long. However, the play does have its moments of brilliant repartee, such as the &quot;contract scene&quot; in Act 4 between Millamant and Mirabell. It is probably William Congreve's finest work, but is only a must-read for theatre historians and lovers of 18th century British literature."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"William Congreve's &quot;The Way of the World&quot; is a Restoration period comedy of manners which features scheming stock characters and pokes fun at the upper class of the time. The plot is propelled by a series of silly missunderstadings(ala Three's Company) and there is an almost incestous exchange of lovers very reminiscent of any modern day soap opera. The major difficulty of reading this play is that vital information about the character's pasts is being revealed as the present action is being carried out, leaving the reader unclear about who did what with whom and when.This was by far the most confusing play I have ever read, yet I found much of the dialogue very witty and amusing, particularly the scene in which Millament and Mirabell negotiate the particulars of their marriage contract. While I found the characters rather shallow and hard to relate to, I often found myself chuckling at their masterful wordplay and appreciated the fact that they were so aware of and comfortable with their own self-absorption. I feel &quot;The Way of the World&quot; paints an interesting picture of the mores and ideals(if one can call them ideals!) of the upper class of 1700 and for me, this made the chore of reading it worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"The English theatre of 1700 was not noticeably like western theatre of today. Simply stated, the audience was half the show.Aristocrats and nobility dressed to ridiculous heights of fashion, arrived late with as much disruptive fanfair as possible, spent a great deal of time talking to each other, and thought nothing of nipping out for a half-hour or so during the play. The middle and lower class spectators paid as much attention, if not more, to these goings on--and if by some chance you became bored by both play and audience you could always visit one of the attractive young women who sold refreshments and often themselves as well.These circumstances gave a very distinct shape to plays of the period. They tended to very long, running three and four hours, with the plot itself not becoming apparent until well into the play, all of the major characters discussed in virtually every scene, and each essential plot repeated over and over again. You could arrive half an hour or an hour late; you could miss an entire scene through conversation with your neighbor; you could step out for a drink and come back again--and even so you could still follow the play.Read today, the vast majority of Restoration drama seem horrendously drawn out, and they are now seldom read or performed. Restoration comedy, however, is a different matter: a master could turn the repetitive structure into a dazzling display of wit, style, and high art. When it comes to Restoration comedy, and in spite of the fact that his output was actually quite small, William Congreve (1670-1729) was a master's master indeed. First staged in 1700, THE WAY OF THE WORLD sparkles like a collection of rare jewels. Congreve had reason to exert himself to the full extent of his talents on this occasion: the play was written for celebrated actress Anne Bracegirdle, who was said to be his lover.The play is convoluted in terms of characters and subplots, but at core it is remarkably direct. Mirabelle has a somewhat questionable past that includes numerous romantic conquests; he has, however, decided to marry the beautiful and wealthy Millimant. Unfortunately, the match is greatly opposed by Lady Wishfort, whose refusal to give consent will have the effect of depriving Millimant of her fortune. The action of the play arises from Mirabelle's efforts to trap Lady Wishfort into giving consent, thereby securing Millimant's inheritance.The play is particularly interesting because the characters behave according to a highly polished code of elegant manners and express a preoccupation with love--but are actually motivated by money to an amazingly crass degree. A romantically inclined beauty might speak of her great emotion, but she is careful to keep a hand on her pocketbook and her eye on the bottom line just the same. The result is akin to a frilligree heart unexpectedly carved into a block of ice; the form is beautiful but the content too cold to embrace. There is no doubt that Mirabelle and Millimant love each other, but there is no doubt that neither will marry the other without a lot of cash thrown in for good measure.More than one critic has regarded THE WAY OF THE WORLD as a satire on the superficial values of Restoration aristocracy. More than one has also preferred Congreve's earlier LOVE FOR LOVE, which is considerably warmer in tone. Clearly, there is an iciness about THE WAY OF THE WORLD that some find distinctly off-putting! But as Congreve himself might have said, money makes the world go round--and love is included in the spin. Whatever the case, THE WAY OF THE WORLD is a wickedly funny, subtly nasty, and unexpectedly enchanting play, among the best of the best.

Well this Kindle edition is so abridged, I found I didn't read half of the play. Don't waste your dollar. Find another version of this play."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"Most great literary narratives, whether fiction or drama, boast simple plots and complex characters. This play turns that approach on its head. Here, we have a hopelessly and needlessly convoluted plot with the most superficial characters imaginable. Great drama? There is no drama. Great comedy? It's not funny. In short, it's garbage. Perhaps this kind writing was impressive in its day, but those days have long long passed us by. Why can't readers just admit that some so-called classics don't deserve the name? In reading the positive comments here, one can't help suspecting that the reviewers have been cowed by the play's reputation. It's a very rare reader who would find Way of the World anything but tedious, confusing, frustrating, unfunny, and overrated. People, let go of your pretensions and just say it! Sheesh...!"},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"Yikes! Let's see here...Mirabell is in love with Milamant, who is the niece of Lady Wishfort, who hates Mirabell because he pretended to be in love with her. Her daughter is Mrs. Fainall, who had an affair with Mirabell that resulted in her marrying Fainall (she thought she was pregnant) who she doesn't love and who is having an affair with Marwood, who is secretly in love with Mirabell and would do anything to keep him from marrying Millamant, who, by the way, loves him and hates him at the same time.And that's all before the play even starts. This play, often heralded as &quot;the best of the Restoration plays&quot; (ironic, since it was a commercial failure for Congreve) is witty, complex, and very hard to keep up with. The plot revolves around who will get Lady Wishfort's inheritance and how, and some of the things they try are quite ridiculous. It has funny moments -- mostly provided by Mirabell's wit and the tomfoolery of Witwoud and Petulant, the comic relief. But it ends up just being pretty long and convoluted.Go read Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The Way of the World. Edited by Kathleen M. Lynch.","review":"Knowing I would be forced to study this work for my A Level in English Lit, I was sure I would enjoy it due to the comedy and satire involved. I was wrong. As the first reviewer claimed, The Way of the World is just like a soap opera! I appreciate the intention of Congreve was to satirise the follies of the upper classes at the time but this does not make the play any less tedious. The plot is unnecessarily complex and rather difficult to follow at times. It all boils down to romance and infidelity in the end, as one might expect. Granted, it is fairly well written, but if there's a stupid plot and irritating, useless characters, no amount of creative flair in writing can compensate. As well as that, the language, while not difficult, is different from that of modernity so makes it awkward. OK, we expect this from an 18th century piece of literature, but it still causes problems for a modern audience/reader. The worst thing was being told by the teacher when we were meant to laugh - that obviously kills any comedy value in the play. Exam boards should add some more modern plays to their syllabus! Not to mention ones with meaningful, interesting plots and characters. This is not worth the paper it's written on, in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Time: Hurricane Katrina: The Storm That Changed America","review":"While i agree with other reviewers that this book didn't present all the cities/towns that were affected, hurricane katrina was just so massive that i don't think any one book would be able to do it justice. Having said that, this book does attempt to give an overview of the destruction that occured in MS/LA..particularly new orleans.As a new orleans resident myself, i missed most of the early coverage due to power outages that occured as far away as baton rouge and jackson, MS. Having this book is a good reminder of what the nation saw and what the gulf coast lived through.The introduction was written by new orleans native wynton marsalis then goes to moving pictures of the disaster presented in a time line fashion--from when the storm first came ashore on aug 29 until weeks into the tragedy.It also offers graphical maps of the levee breaks, flood zones of new orleans showing almost the entire city underwater, and even myths that occured during this hectic time.It devouts a small section to gulf coast MS which was horribly affected as well and a small section on the rescuers, volunteers and aftermath of the storm and the future of the gulf coast. The last pages were about hurricane rita and its affects on the region.This is a great book for a concise overview of this nationwide disaster. 5% of the proceeds go to red-cross relief efforts which i think should be higher. All in all, a worthwhile purchase...many of the pictures will be scenes that bring a tear to your eye and stay with you."},{"Title":"Time: Hurricane Katrina: The Storm That Changed America","review":"The photos and accounts delivered in this Time representation of Hurricane Katrina are invaluable. Bodies floating by houses, people trapped in their attics, the anger and frustration at the Superdome, the hope and good faith of the people searching for survivors. All of this is captured by great photojournalists and poignant captions. While some reviewers feel this book focuses on only two cities' ordeals with hurricane aftermath, I think the book captures what was happening in the worst cases. Having been published about a month after the occurance, you can leave the job of chronicling the entire event to a sociologist or someone more apt to turn a profit rather than raise money for the Red Cross. This book was published so quickly that I found many typos, (\\"Sept. 29th\\" instead of \\"Aug. 29th\\" was printed way too many times, and \\"kids\\" instead of \\"kinds\\", things that spell check wouldn't catch, but an editor should have).

For anyone's information, New Orleans was on the West, or weak, side of Katrina. New Orleans was flooded because: 1) elevation there is about 7 feet BELOW sea level and 2)their levy system has NEVER been built to withstand cat 3 or greater storms. EVERY drop of rain that falls in New Orleans has to be pumped out, one way or the other. If the citizens of New Orleans had put more money into improving their levy system instead of the SuperDome, they might very well be living in dry and undamaged homes today instead of morning their dead and trying to put their city back together. New Orleans will be rebuilt someday and I hope and pray that they have learned and benefited from this disaster and won't make the same mistakes again.

It's an imagined look-back at our history and a charming portrait of small town life.The year is 1909 and the President, William Howard Taft, is coming to town. Now, he's not only our country's leader but he's a jolly man who appreciates a good meal (from his rotund appearance many of them).The President's train IS greeted by the Fireman's Band playing \\"Hail To The Chief\\" and a loud round of cheers when Taft himself emerges. But, before the President can dedicate the town's new flagpole his attention is caught by an aroma that he can't resist. When he asks what it might be a young boy suggests it might be \\"Tony's Italian Villa,\\" where they make wonderful spaghetti. The boy leads Taft to Tony's and then on a gustatorial tour of his city.Still, the President was smelling something else delicious. Guess what it was?With sprightly full color illustrations and a fun text \\"The President and Mom's Apple Pie\\" deserves some cheers of its own.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","review":"We picked this book out at the library and it quickly became my son's favorite book.The story tells the tale of a visit by President William Howard Taft to a small town in 1909 to dedicate the town's new flagpole. Once the portly president catches whiff of a \\"beguiling\\" scent, he forgets about his presidential duties and leads the townpeople in search of the tantalizing aroma until he discovers its source.The story is light and fun and easy to read. The illustrations couldn't be better. They are vibrant and full of life.My kids, ages 2 1/2, 5 1/2 and 9 all love the book. They laugh at the story and constantly find new amusement with the pictures. Even those of us who are a little bit older can find enjoyment in the book. It evokes a wonderful sense of nostalgia for \\"the good old days\\". We've read the book each night for a week. I usually get sick of reading the same stories over and over ... not this one."},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","review":"I have to admit - I was not expecting much of this book when my youngest son snatched it from a shelf at the library. I thought it would be like so many of the books we take out based on an appealing cover alone - nice to look at, but with an uninteresting story. Boy was I wrong!My kids found this book to be exciting and very funny. They loved the idea that the President of the United States would be led around town by a little boy their age, and completely identified with the little boy's character. They enjoyed thinking about the meals President Taft ate around town, and wondered whether the steamed veggies at the Chinese restaurant were really yummy, or if Taft was just being polite.It really is a shame that, as I write this review, the book is out of print - it really deserves to be much more popular. My advice to anyone reading this review - snatch up one of those bargain remainder copies. You won't be sorry!"},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","review":"This is a sweet book about a president we don't think of much anymore.

My kids are always fascinated by presidents and this is a friendly introduction to President Taft."},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","review":"&quot;I remember that day in 1909 as if it were yesterday. President Taft was coming to our town to dedicate the new flagpole! No one had talked about anything else for weeks...&quot; So begins our young narrator's story. The entire small town had come down to the train station to greet the president. Flags were flying, the Firemen's Band was playing and the crowd, all decked out in red, white, and blue was cheering. Taft, all 300 pounds of him, squeezed through the train door and hopped nimbly off the train. But before he could even shake the mayor's hand, or walk to the town's new flagpole, he stopped and sniffed the air. &quot;What is that wonderful aroma?&quot; inquired the President. He had a dreamy look on his face.&quot; Leading the way, President Taft, with our young narrator's help, and all the townspeople trailing behind, begins a true gourmand's, taste-testing tour of all the eating establishments in town, to find the source of that mouth-watering smell..... Using Taft's enormous size and large appetite as the basis for his story, Michael Garland spins a silly and hilarious tall tale. The entertaining text begs to be read aloud, and is only outdone by his bold, bright, and busy computer generated artwork, filled with lots of humor and eye-catching, period detail. Perfect for kids 4-8, The President And Mom's Apple Pie is an engaging, funny, manic romp through yesteryear, and a marvelous, illustrative feast for the eyes."},{"Title":"The President and Mom's Apple Pie","review":"The book was in good condition, however, they should have stated that it had been owned by a library.

Quick delivery timeI am fully satisfied."},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","review":"I was disappointed by this book. It took a lot of time to explain the basics of the spec but did not provide any additional design help or expanded technical info. I have had mixed results with other books for other buses in this series and this one is no better. If you carefully read the spec you will get about 97% of what is in this book. In several places the book simply uses parts of from the spec. directly. I wish the book took the time to create better figures and tables than what is in the spec. The spec is very poor on figures and tables and to use any portion of them is just a short cut in writing the book. I really wanted a book that either did not require reading the spec or a book that redid all of the poorly drawn or written parts of the spec. Also the spec is not very well organized, the book did a little bit better than the spec. in that category, but not as much as it should have. Again, it seems like a lot of short cuts were taken and no effort was made to really provide more detailed or organized information than the minimum. Perhaps that was the purpose of the book, but that is not what is needed. I just do not understand all of the positive reviews, unless the reviewers did not carefully read the spec. and did not know better. I just did not want to pay for shortcuts in the writing."},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","review":"There are two problems with this book. First, it uses figures from the specification. The PCI Express specification is very poor when it comes to figures, tables and charts. I had hoped that this book was going to have some decent figures, tables and charts, and provide more design help than the specification. Instead it simply rewords the specification. The second problem is that it is out of date. There has been numerous engineering change orders generated by the PCI special interest group [sig] against rev. 1.0a. The PCI sig has just come out with revision 1.1. This book covers neither. I have ordered a different book that someone told me about. I have been told this other book has addressed the above two problems, I hope so."},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","review":"In my opinion it is simply a re-write of the specification with no additional insight into the design of PCI Express hardware or software. In fact it follows the specification in the lack of design useful flow charts for hardware and the lack of detailed hardware figures. It provides little design information over what you can read in the specification and many of the figures are just those of the specification or look alike. The link states are done in the same manner as the specification with only minor additional information and there is no architectures of different ways the components can be built. It takes a lot of pages to explain some fairly simply concepts and wastes about 100 pages on third party information and restating waveform information from the specification. It has no glossary of terms and only a five page index."},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","review":"The index on this thing is worthless... The whole point of having a reference book, in my opinion, is to have quick, easy access to information when I need it.

Each time I try to get something out of this book, I get more and more frustrated.On one hand, there's the PCI-E spec, which is horribly written and incomplete, but completely searchable due to its being available in PDF form; on the other hand, you have this better-written but almost completely unsearchable book.

I have a complete set starting with their first release of ISA System Architecture back in the 80's.What makes this new book beneficial is that it really helps design engineers like myself to better understand a specification that's really not written with \\"design\\" in mind. Not to bash the PCI-SIG, but it's not in their charter to step engineers through design, rather they inform us about what these new interconnects entail and their strengths over previous architectures. MindShare takes over in this missing \\"education\\" area with their broad ranging books and classes.PCI Express System Architecture starts with a comprehensive overview of previous architectures, like PCI, 66Mhz/64bit PCI, PCI-X, DDR/QDR PCI-X. For a design engineer who's used to understanding old school North/South bridge chipsets, they now get a proper and clear introduction to Root Complexes, Switches, and newer I/O hubs.Other strengths of this book include an excellent section on the explanation of PCI Express's new QoS as well as both traffic and virtual classes.Physical layer is also explained well, broken into a logical chapter and electrical chapter. Complete transmitter and receiver characteristics are explained well. These are vital numbers to know for any PHY level designer.Link Training, Hot Plug, and Power Management chapters have been written in great detail and are clear and easy to understand.For those engineers who are designing add-in cards, this book also covers all the important connector pin-outs and signals, all the way up to x16 lane widths.My only wish is a more comprehensive section on Spread Spectrum Clocking, but you can't ask for everything....Good Job MindShare!"},{"Title":"PCI Express System Architecture","review":"I've done PCI designs in the past but this was my first PCIe design.

An avid reader of modern science fiction, I dare to name one book that compares. The early hot sellers, Orson Scott Card's ENDER'S SHADOW and Harry Turtledove's COLONIZATION AFTERSHOCKS, fall short of the classic standards that were set by Sagan and Verne. THE [SPACE] BETWEEN raises the bar for all new authors and redefines reader's expectations. Ronald Damien Malfi is the brightest new star in the science fiction galaxy."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I must confess that I grew up down the street from the author, so I don't know how objective I can be. But I must say that I honestly couldn't put this book down once I had started reading. Ron Malfi has the unique ability to keep a story moving quickly while not giving away the secrets he needs to keep the reader guessing. One reviewer noted that Malfi is like Stephen King and Hemingway; I completely agree. But unlike both of those writers, Malfi doesn't take pages and pages to &quot;set the scene.&quot; Each page is the scene. I wanted to read every word, not so I would be prepared for the action to come - but for it's own entertainment value. Much like John Steinbeck, Malfi has a way of working every detail into the story - every tiny grain of information seems essential to the reader. I can't wait for his next book!"},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"A nice first effort by Ronald Damien Malfi. I make it a point to read debut novels from up and coming writers, and this one is definitely my pick for January. Nice, well-rounded story with wonderfully believable characters and deep emotion. The relationship between the two main characters, Vander and Alana, was very nicely executed, and I loved the non-linear telling of the tale. Surprisingly, this is a love story! A friend of mine refused to read the book at first because she is not a fan of science fiction and horror, but after I urged her, she read the book and loved it.I was surprised at how young the author is to have written such a knowledgeable book. If he is that young, we can surely expect to see great things from Ronald Damien Malfi in the future. Consider me a fan!"},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I thought this was a pretty good first novel. What originally interested me in it was all the talk I heard about the book's genre. People said it was horror, science fiction, adventure, literary fiction, etc. After what I heard, I was interested enough to read the book myself, and I'm glad that I did. Although I still don't know what to categorize it as. Maybe just mainstream fiction, or like a suspense thriller.Vander Case is the main character, and he is a depressed physics professor who is still mourning the death of his girlfriend from long ago. Without giving too much away, he is kidnapped by the Navy and taken out into the Atlantic oceans where they find a giant space porthole beneath the water. From there, the story unravells in a past-paced present time aboard the naval ship, while we see intermittent flashbacks to Vander's past and the events that brought him to where he is today.I enjoyed this book very much and I think Ronald Damien Malfi is a great new voice in dark literary fiction (or what ever you want to call it!) Calling it science fiction is a bit misleading I think, but I still very much recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend after he simply raved about it, and knowing that I will read practically anything (and am impressed by very little), he was curious to see what I would think of the book. Well I have to say I really loved it. It was written in a very unique style, not too 'modern commercial fiction' but not to 'literary fiction.' Mr. Malfi has a style like a mixture between Stephen King and Ernest Hemingway, and I would certainly recommend this book be read by anyone looking for a brilliant new voice."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I thought this book was just OK, not bad but not terrific. I guess I'd read another one by this author."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I had to read this book for a book club and was worried because I thought it was a science fiction book and I do not do science fiction. Maybe my predisposition to not liking the book freed me to really enjoy it--and enjoy it I did. It is really a book about relationships with a sci-fi-like plot twist. It is also a suspense novel and a love story. All of this wrapped up neatly in quick read book. I am very impressed with this young author and will keep my eyes out for more from him. I highly recommend making the minimal time and cost investment to read this fascinating story."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"First of all, I really enjoyed this book and I think Ronald Damien Malfi is a superb writer. It was original, fastpaced, and thought-provoking. For those of you who have already read it, I do have one question: what exactly is &quot;the poe&quot;? The cult leader apparently chose a name for himself and that name is the poe, but it is not capitalized throughout the text (this isn't a typo, it is done purposely every time the name appears) and the author never goes into where that name came from or what its meaning is. I thought it might have something to do with Alana Barset, because the poe and Alana seem to have some sort of unconscious or other-worldly attachment, (the poe's tattoo is the same design that Alana draws in the dirt when explaining &quot;the space between&quot; to Vander! I didn't realize this until I went back a read it) Anyway, it's not a big deal and it takes nothing away from the book itself, and I would definitely reccomend this book for a good couple of nights read."},{"Title":"The Space Between","review":"I have one major complaint: this book is NOT science fiction! I've noticed some people comparing it to classic sci-fi stories, which is unfair to classic sci-fi writers AND this writer! fans of sci-fi understand that there are certain elements present in a science fiction novel, which this book did not have, this was softcore sci-fi to say the LEAST. So if you're looking for a HARD sci-fi read, this is NOT the book for you.With that out of the way, I can now look at the book subjectly. Please don't get me wrong, I thought this was a decent book, although not the type of stuff I'm used to reading. It had some suspense, some elements of the supernatural, and some scientific aspects like a combo of stephen king, michael crichton, and john grisham all rolled into one. There was also some sense of &quot;classical&quot; literature writing style, that made it interesting to read and made the author's voice fairly original.It is about a scientist named Van who helps the navy (or tries to help the navy) close up some sort of porthole that has opened in the ocean. Meanwhile, there's this cult about the navy ship that tries to prevent the porthole from being closed. That's where the real action comes into play.

The five uses of footnotes the author itemizes can really be applied to any aspect of historical writing. One, it allows other people to test the conclusions. Two, the discriminting reader is shown where to find greater verificaion. Three, a challengeable statement can be traced to its point of origin. Four, quotation accuracy is assured. Five, researchers who wish to explore related topics have bibliographical leads in the documentation.A writer of history is professionally obligated to re-create the atmosphere of the era Gottschalk says. And he adds that that skill can be learned. Readers are encouraged to see history from the human viewpoint, not just as a collection of facts and dates. He talks about a good historian as one who can put himself in the place of individuals of other times.Two terms of his profession are defined for the readers. Historical method is the process of critically examining and analyzing the records of the past.

Lawrence clearly has his own agenda and his own predjudices, but this is a highly readable account of a fascinating period in human history, one which is so visible to us in the Pacific, but may have been rehearsed in various guises at many periods in history.

This has horrified not only our allies around the globe but also the majority of the people--at least the few who realize that torture is now a sanctioned practice of U.S. military and intelligence agents. Ninety Senators passed the McCain Amendment that would reinforce the Army Fiedl Manual rules against torture and our adherence to the Geneva Conventions, but Cheney's influence is currently helping to quietly kill the amendment in committee.Your government is now pro-torture. And yet it claims that we are \\"better\\" than our enemies. To protect ourselves from these savages, our government has embraced savage practices.To get the pro-torture side of the argument, read this book, by the legal force within the Bush Administration that has made the U.S. a nation that tortures its enemies in order to extract (generally unreliable) intelligence.

Sadly, this does not mean that he has any common sense, any historical context, any strategic vision, nor any relevance to the future. Indeed, and I rarely write negative reviews (5 out of 1015+), this book is most useful for understanding the ignorance and arrogance of Presidential sycophants who place loyalty to a single man and office and party (or rather, ideological branch of the party) above their loyalty to the Constitution, the Republic, or the public interests they are supposed to be defending.The book is best summarized by a quote from a White House staffer who is reported to have said, in talking to an expert on foreign affairs, \\"You must be one of those reality-based people. We are an empire, we make our own reality.\\"The problem with this arrogant and ignorant statement, which is manifested throughout this interesting book, is that a reality based on ideological fantasy and the security of hiding behind the Secret Service completely begs off on confronting the harsh realities of a world in which 5 billion pissed off poor people are inevitably going to sponsor 1 million armed terrorists who know how to create Improvised Explosive Devises (IED) and know how to deliver the \\"death of a thousand cuts\\" to US infrastructure (water and fuel pipelines, energy generators, shipping port cranes, key communications switching stations, key banks, etc.The \\"sucking chest wound\\" in this book is that it does not recognize the role played by the (once) wise men of Congress, in two houses--one, the Senate, designed for long-term deliberation, the other, the House, designed for mid-term respect for the \\"wisdom of the crowds,\\" both of which were created by the Founders to temper Presidential hubris, Presidential ambition, and Presidential mendacity.The fact that our Congress today is grotesquely corrupt and dysfunctional does not in any way render the above point moot. As we saw in the rush to war on Iraq, which has now put us in a six-front-war that will last 100 years, the Executive is all too fragile and malleable and prone to short-term error with long-term consequences.The author makes a case for Presidential power in this book that is isolated from historical, ideo-cultural, socio-economic, techno-demographic, and natural-geographic context. This is not a debate about how to get from here to 2008 \\"efficiently,\\" but rather a debate about how to survive and prosper as a Nation over the next 200 to 500 years.Were the author more intellectually-honest and reality-aware, he would understand that the future of American cannot be secured by a few guns against 5 billion at the \\"Bottom of the Pyramid,\\" and he would understand that the end of cheap oil, the end of free water, the rise of pandemic disease, the looming catastrophes of poverty and environmental degradation are all context within which long-term strategies are essential, in which we must help create indigenous wealth that is scalable and self-generating.Bottom line: this book represents the kind of narrow, ignorant, sycophantic view of the Presidency that has come to characterize the Cheney-Addington-Gonzalez view of Bush as a puppet and the people as stupid. If this book were to become \\"reality,\\" not only would Congress and the people forfeit all their powers (of the purse, of the power to declare war, of the power to hold elections, of the power to live under the rule of law), but in becoming \\"reality,\\" this book's premises would destroy the Republic.Read this to understand the internal threat to our Republic. Well-intentioned individuals who have no clue how to serve the people, and are intent on serving their narrow constituency of a single President whose wealthy pals want to loot the Commonwealth with as few restrictions as possible until the party is over and they can move to Switzerland and leave us to deal with their multiple deficits.I have three sons. This book has persuaded me that they must each receive a liberal arts education before going on to specialize in a craft, for in this book, I see all that is evil about narrowly-educated individuals who mean well but know little of the real world.See also:Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American PresidencyAmerican Fascists: The Christian Right and the War On AmericaRunning on Empty: How the Democratic and Republican Parties Are Bankrupting Our Future and What Americans Can Do About ItThe Broken Branch: How Congress Is Failing America and How to Get It Back on Track (Institutions of American Democracy)Breach of Trust: How Washington Turns Outsiders Into InsidersCrossing the Rubicon: The Decline of the American Empire at the End of the Age of OilThe Road to 9/11: Wealth, Empire, and the Future of AmericaWars of Blood and Faith: The Conflicts That Will Shape the 21st CenturyResource Wars: The New Landscape of Global Conflict With a New Introduction by the AuthorThe Search for Security: A U.S. Grand Strategy for the Twenty-First Century"},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Ever since 9/11, the Bush Administration has been harshly criticized for its War on Terrorism. Many of its critics have taken the position that its wars in Afghanistan and Iraq are unconstitutional. The War on Terrorism combined with the Bush Administration's decisions regarding both the ABM Treaty and the Kyoto accords have provoked strong allegations that the Constitution's framework for foreign policy has been dismantled.The author of The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11, John Yoo, is a former lawyer in the Bush Justice Department. He argues that the Bush Administration's foreign policy has solid precedent in the actions of previous administrations.Yoo points out that from the Undeclared Naval War With France in 1798 through Bill Clinton's war in Kosovo in 1999, American presidents have often prosecuted armed conflicts without formal declarations of war. He argues that the Constitution grants different powers over foreign policy to Congress, the courts and the presidency, requiring these institutions to negotiate what the country's foreign policy is. Yoo's argument is based on the original intent of the Founding Fathers supplemented with constitutional law and history.For instance, Yoo argues that just because a war is undeclared does not mean that it is unconstitutional. He points out that Congress's power of the purse gives it an effective veto power over executive decisions to go to war. He also points out that the 1973 War Powers Resolution has been systematically violated and has been treated as being de facto unconstituitional almost since the day that it was passed. He also argues that Congressional resolutions for war are legally unnecessary and serve only a political purpose in demonstrating unity in foreign policy and war.Yoo makes a number of arguments that are bound to provoke controversy. For instance, he argues that the Constitution allows the government to violate international law whenever it wants to. Yoo also holds the position that captured terrorists are not covered under the Geneva Convention since they are not combatants belonging to another country and by didnt of being terrorists did not obey the laws of war.The Powers of War and Peace : The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11 by John Yoo is an excellent work that is sure to ignite controversy and nationwide discussion/debate over these important subjects."},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Law prof David Cole eviscerated this book in the NY Review of Books, 11/17/05 issue. Yoo's twisted \\"originalist\\" arguments for a super-executive in wartime are in direct contrast to the Founders' desire to prevent just such usurpation. They'd just escaped George III; they didn't want to repeat the experience.Cole goes on to point out that \\"arguments against [Yoo's] theory are academic. Modern practice is closer to Yoo's view than to the framers' vision.\\" Congress has increasingly abdicated its powers to the presidency.So if you want to read a defense of the \\"imperial presidency\\" by someone who's demonstrated, in the Torture Memos, that he has no respect for America's ideals, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Mr Yoo moves on from his earlier arguments that torture falls at a point slightly short of physical death, organ failure or loss of limb. Mr Yoo makes some interesting if devastating points with his new theories. The President's war powers, he argues, allow him to do, basically, whatever he wants. The President may, if he chooses, crush the genitals of children, maim, torture or kill civilians. In this respect one might remember that Bush ordered an air strike on the house occupied by the infant grandchildren of Saddam Hussein AFTER the end of the Iraq war and even though the house was surrounded by US troops. The President is limited, according to Mr Yoo, only by how he CHOOSES to interpret International Treaties and as he has the power to repudiate such treaties or ignore them entirely (as in the International Human Rights for the Child Treaty, the Geneva Convention or the Treaty of Vienna,) then, this means that presidential power is absolute EVEN if despotic criminal or tyrannical. Mr Yoo appears now to say that the President and his henchmen, cronies and agencies MAY indeed use indiscriminant torture. Mr Yoo however does not adequately explain how the President can thus overturn congressional treaty ratification. As what constitutes a 'time of war' is also up to the President and does not rely on any 'legal' declaration of war (which is a matter of international law to which the US is thus not subject,) then the US may have, effectively, a Despot Emperor for President. Does the 'War on Drugs' thus give the President the same wartime powers as he asserts for his 'War on Terror' - an undeclared war on no particular nation state? Is the US thus always in a state of war? This is interesting, not just semantically, as the District and Supreme Courts appear to agree with Mr Yoo's interpretation, blocking cases connected with this on grounds of national security whilst Congress does not appear to care. Perhaps Clinton should have used Mr Yoo's arguments in the Monical Lewinsky scandal and impeachment hearings. War powers might have thus allowed him to do whatever he wanted with his cigar and to lie about it in the national interest. The problem with Mr Yoo's argument is that Checks and Balances thus no longer appear to exist. Interestingly if one applies Mr Yoo's arguments to their logical end he becomes an eloquent advocate for terrorism or for the Holocaust where the ends justify the use of any means, however horrible. Of course, either this is pretty much nonsense and makes toilet paper of the Declaration of Independence, Magna Carta, democracy and human rights OR the truth is more terrifying and the US is now a Stalinist or Nazi state. I suspect Mr Yoo could be subject to arrest as a war criminal should he ever leave the United States and visit a civilised country???"},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Professor John Yoo, an accomplished constitutional scholar, has written a outstanding volume exploring the U.S. Constitution's allocation of powers in matters of war and international affairs. This overview of our Constitution's framework for understanding the roles and relations of the three branches of government in based upon clear reasoning and close attention to history and practice.Yoo deftly analyzes the respective roles of the Executive and Legislative branches in making and declaring war, arguing that the Constitution provides for a great deal of flexibility and latitude in dealings with foreign nations. He aptly deals with the debate over whether international treaties are generally self-executing or require implementing legislation, making a persuasive argument for the latter position as most consistent with the text and structure of the Constitution. Yoo also provides a sensible and coherent constitutional approach to understanding and distinguishing between treaties and congressional-executive agreements. These topics and others are treated in a careful and methodical manner, as Yoo generally argues from the viewpoint that the Constitution should be read in light of the original understanding of its ratifiers. He (wisely) advocates a conceptual framework for understanding our Constitution's approach to foreign affairs that is relevant and resembles actual historical and contemporary practice. (This is something that many scholars and theorists fail to do.)Throughout the book, Yoo demonstrates a mastery of both the constitutional case law in this interesting area and the legal scholarship that precedes his own work.The book is written in a clear and lucid manner, providing repetition on important points while avoiding any sense of repetitiveness. It is accessible to both those who are familiar with constitutional history and constitutional law concerning the separation of powers as well as those with some historical and legal background in those areas.This review can only scratch the surface in terms of the content of this work. Yoo's book is a first-rate intellectual achievement. And it will likely become a standard, authoritative reference for citizens and scholars (and especially originalists) in the years to come."},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"The 2 biggest mistakes made by government in my lifetime are Congress giving away war powers in 1965 and 2002.

Twice I have seen Congress abdicate this important power with disasterous results. This is just one of many examples why Yoo has no clue."},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Professor Yoo makes many seemingly compelling arguments in favor of his contention that the President has virtually unfettered authority sanctioned by our constitution, but, as reasonable as his arguments may seem, what I find to be the underlying flaw is that he's arguing that unrestrained authority of the chief executive is somehow consistent with the principles of constitutional democracy and the rule of law upon which our system of government is based.Frankly, this is a completly cognitively dissonant position; advocating an authoritarian right in the name of democracy just doesn't meet the test of reason. It's functionally identical to the argument that \\"We have to destroy the village to save it\\" made popular during the Vietnam War.Benjamin Franklin famously said; \\"Those who would give up essential Liberty to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety\\". Clearly the good professor doesn't seem to grasp this essential concept as elucidated by one of our most respected and revered Founders."},{"Title":"The Powers of War and Peace: The Constitution and Foreign Affairs after 9/11","review":"Lawyer John Yoo worked with the Bush administration in the wake of 9/11 to provide legal justification for a variety of illegal and unconstitutional tactics to be used by the administration to fight terrorism. For example, Yoo claimed presidents have unilateral authority to initiate wars without Congressional approval. Clearly this violates the Constitution. This power was explicity given to Congress. And this book tries to justify a variety of acts of tyranny, large and small, by a president beset with a problem he couldn't cope with.9/11 overwhelmed the Bush administration. But I do not fault President Bush too much -- realize that such an attack would overwhelm ANY president of either party. Generally, serious terrorism can easily knock over any democratically elected government like a tsunami, and the United States is no exception. Democracies under attack by serious terrorist conspiracies typically revert to an authoritarian structure to fight the attack, and government usually wins its war, but during these times citizens suffer. This happened in the Philippines under Marcos and in Chile under Pinochet. That the Bush administration resorted to extra-legal tactics to try to protect people is understandable but problematic because it undermines freedom and the rule of law. But I think partisans on the left are as clueless as those on the right about what to do.How can we cope with mysterious thugs hiding in caves seeking weapons of mass destruction? For me, that's the underlying problem. Solve terrorism; and you'll solve the problem of illegal activity by government and make everybody safer. And this requires a non-partisan overhaul of the Constitution.Thomas W.

North lived alongside blacks and other minorities and learned firsthand about anti-semitism and racism. He and his mother saved enough money to send him to college, after which he became a writer. After several years as a local journalist North came into contact with people from the Labor Defense Organization, and the Unemployed Councils and was impressed by the people he met, many of whome were Communists. North thought the Communists were doing the most to improve the lot of the workers and the unemployed so he joined them and wrote and edited the left wing magazines the Labor Defender and the New Masses.North worked with some of the best writers of his era, such as Hemingway, Dos Passos, Theodore Dreiser, John Spivak and Malcolm Cowley. North was personally praised for his and the New Masses work by his idol jornalist and muckraker Lincoln Steffens. He wrote articles exposing the discrimination against Blacks then endemic in the United States, especially the South and efforts by Communists and other leftists to change things. During World War II he linked racial prejudice against Blacks to Hitlers ideology of \\"Aryan\\" supremacy.North was most famous for his articles on the Spanish Civil War, which urged an end to the embargo on arms to the Spanish Republic and warned that the threat of Fascism in Spain and elsewhere in Europe threatened the peace of the world and needed to be nipped in the bud in order to preven a second world war. When the U.S. entered World War II, North wrote articles exposing domestic fascists and those in big business who were slowing down the war effort in order to make greater profits. He also promoted world labor unity and attended the conference in London in 1945 which established the World Federation of Trade Unions.Joseph North had a great deal of optimism about Humanity and the future. North visited Dachau and saw how many of the inmates survived their under most trying circumstances by helping each other and that most had not become informers or lost their humanity. North mentions a number of now obscure writers that seem worth looking up, such as Paul de Kruif, Martin Anderson-Nexo, and Vincent Sheean."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Who would've thought that so many murders could occur in theatres? But then again, it's all a case of life imitating art, and no one does this better than Ngaio Marsh. It's not surprising when you realize that she was a stage director/producer in New Zealand. _Night at the Vulcan_ beautifully captures the atmosphere unique to the theatre, while laying out a very clever case of murder made to look like suicide. This is all told through the eyes of Martyn Tarne, a young lady newly arrived to the London theatre scene, making it all the more interesting. The only reason that I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, was that the identity of the murderer became a little too obvious, in my opinion, but all in all, a fantastic read."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Night at the Vulcan has everything; sympathetic (and endearing) characters, lots of Shakespearean quotes, realistic dialogue, two very different (but equally satisfying) love stories, gorgeous prose...all of the things I read Ngaio for. The character of Martyn Tarne is one I wish Ngaio had re-used in a later book (like she did with some characters from &quot;Death of a Peer&quot; and &quot;Killer Dolphin.&quot;).Ngaio Marsh is my favorite author, and Night at the Vulcan is my favorite Ngaio Marsh. 'Nuff said."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Like many struggling young actresses before her, Martyn Tarne has a private fantasy of stepping in for a leading lady taken ill. In true Ngaio Marsh style, Martyn's dream is made a reality, in a twisted way; having just missed an audition at the Vulcan, Martyn wangles a job involved with another show set to open in a few days - as the leading lady's dresser, since Helena Hamilton's regular dresser just went into hospital. Martyn, a New Zealander who was robbed upon arriving in England, is alone and broke, and thankful to get *any* job until she can get on her feet - even at the Vulcan, where her mother's immensely famous cousin Adam Poole is both leading man and director.The small cast and other Vulcan personnel involved in the production feature quite a few mirror images and parallels in their situations and their relationships with each other. In several scenes, actual reflecting surfaces underline this - shop windows as Martyn trudges to a late audition, a picture under glass of one character that reflects another, and so on.Martyn doesn't want to establish herself on the London stage solely on the strength of her relationship with Poole - but she's ideally suited for a supporting role in the play requiring a woman who strongly resembles the lead. By contrast, Gay Gainsford, cast for the part on her uncle's insistence, requires heavy makeup and acting skills outside her scope, and is as prone to hysterical outbursts about her loathing for the play even as Martyn tries to fade into the woodwork and hang onto her job. Both women's relationships with older men in the company result in protective and sometimes over-protective reactions as clashes occur in the high-pressure atmosphere of the last few rehearsals and opening night.As for the men associated with the Vulcan, Clark Bennington, Gay's uncle, is a once-fine actor now in a supporting role as an alcoholic both on stage and in life. On a particularly galling note, he seems to be playing second fiddle to Adam Poole in his marriage as well as his career - Helena Hamilton, the leading lady, has a career that eclipses Bennington's and tends to inspire devotion in most men, though she seems to collect only the young and artistic variety. Most of the other men on the scene apparently don't qualify, being either too old (her devoted admirer Jacques, the director's assistant; Gay's admirer Darcey, supporting player; the crabby playwright Dr. Rutherford) or ambiguous. All the men except Jacques and Poole do their bit to make the situation worse - even the playwright, whose \\"helpful\\" feedback is loaded with unprofessional attacks on the junior members of the cast, driving them almost to the point of breakdown when he isn't tactfully headed off.The story plays out in a very compressed space and timeframe, set almost entirely within the walls of the Vulcan and mostly upon the opening night of THUS TO REVISIT, whose first performance ends with the discovery of the body of a member of the company; the investigation is wrapped up before daybreak.I recommend James Saxon's unabridged recording of the text; Marsh's stories tend to function very well when performed, and this is no exception.Drive in totals:- Two deaths (poison); a third from a previous incident in the same theatre is referred to. (The Vulcan is not the same theatre as the Dolphin, which appears in other stories).- One sexual assault (off camera, referred to indirectly).- One openly homophobic character; it's made clear that that's only one of many unpleasant aspects of his rude, bullying personality.- A character from A SURFEIT OF LAMPREYS turns up as a young constable.- This story isn't about Alleyn, really; he serves to bring the truth of events and various motivations of the real main characters to light. Alleyn's personal life and family aren't a factor."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"There's never a dull moment at The Vulcan Theatre--especially when a starving actress named Martyn Tarne walks into the job of dresser for the show's leading lady. What with a gifted but nasty author, an alcoholic actor, a hysterical bit player, and a host of other neurotics, opening night is more unnerving than usual. In fact, it's pure murder, and Inspector Alleyn is soon on the scene.Ngaio Marsh is one of the great mystery novelists of the 20th Century, and she is particularly known for her skill at creating believable characters in memorable settings. But she is also uniquely gifted at portraying the complex world of the theatre, a task she takes on in several novels but never better than here. Marsh captures the contrast between the out-front-glamor and the backstage hysteria with the knowledge of an insider (she was, in fact, a theatrical director herself), and in VULCAN she offers a remarkably accurate, powerful vision.Although it is occasionally beset by some of Marsh's less admirable tendencies, NIGHT AT THE VULCAN is easily among the best of the best, a novel that will not only fascinate you with it's look behind the grand curtain, but keep you guessing in terms of plot as well. Recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Not the same standard as some of her other novels but worth the read. Seemed like the reason thrown in as an unrelated fact to everything else."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Martyn Tarn has travelled to England to try and get work as an actress. The Vulcan is the last theatre she tries when she has practically run out of money and still has no work. She arrives just at the right time and is offered a job of dresser to the leading lady, Helena Hamilton.It's not quite what she was hoping for but she accepts in desperation. It soon becomes clear that are many tensions between the players and the outspoken author of the play. When one of the actors is found dead in what appears to be suicide no one is surprised as he was an alcoholic and unhappy in his marriage to Helena Hamilton.Enter Roderick Alleyn who is not convinced by the appearance of suicide. This is a tense and well written mystery with some very convincing characters and relationships. I enjoyed the theatrical background and thought it was well done and the murder and the reasons for it were convincing. I thought I'd worked out who the murderer was but couldn't work out the motive behind it. Of course it is obvious once you know.If you like your crime novels in the classic mould - more mystery than crime - then Ngaio Marsh's Roderick Alleyn novels are well worth reading."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Of course, Dame Ngaio is British only by dint of her birth within the Empire and her adoption by the homeland. I have nothing to add to previous reviews except a note of appreciation from one who has been reading and re-reading her since Colour Scheme during WW11, which was the choice of some book club of which I was a member then. From the very beginning to the very end of her writing career she maintained a standard in her detective stories of which only the best of those who write in series can achieve. Some books are better than others, parts of most run a little dry, but overall there is satisfaction for the reader. While having series characters helps enormously by creating an anchor for the book, if the character is as well-rounded as Alleyn or Poirot and Miss Marple, there is still that need to give him (or her) something interesting to do, something interesting to be part of, and not let any part of ones own boredom at times reflect to the reader. A series writer must be professional, that is, responsive to the need to produce books whether or not he or she is prepared to write, no waiting upon inspiration or for the need for self expression, writing must be taken as a job.Having heard all of her books via audio book, in addition to having read them, but being now dependent much more on my ears than my eyes, I find her to have been quite fortunate in the readers for the unabridged versions. This reader is nothing less than first rate in every aspect of every character. For fans and for newcomers this should prove an interesting as well as entertaining visit to the back stage of a theater much like those the author has spent so much time in. The young actress, with whose self-conscious monologue begins as she searches for work in London, is an admirable character for whose problems it is easy to become concerned. The other backstage and on-stage characters are neatly characterized as well.If this will be your first Ngaio Marsh, I envy you the many more that you likely will want to read for the first time."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"This is another of Marsh's mysteries set in a theater--and with a New Zealander to boot. You can also get it in a set of 3 theater mysteries: 1969's Curtain Calls: Three Great Mysteries with 1935's \\"Enter a Murderer\\" & 1966's \\"Killer Dolphin.\\" This novel was published in 1951. Most of the book is devoted to the theater, a play, its actors, & characters--lots of context. The actual crime & its solution takes up less than 1/2. To tell you the truth, I liked the 1st part better--I think Marsh could have written this as a non-mystery very well. It was written in her best literary style--which is very, very good indeed. I'd give the 1st part 5 stars, but the mystery itself is a little bit disappointing--not up to the terrific characterizations and languaging of the work. She does give you sufficient clues to figure it out--and I did. My favorite quotes: \\"There was something cosy about Fox when he took notes. Alleyn remembered absently that his wife had once observed that Mr. Fox was a cross between a bear and a baby and exhibited the most pleasing traits of both creatures\\" and \\"We are creatures of convention and like our tragedies to take recognizable form.\\" I enjoyed reading it a lot."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"This is my first Ngaio Marsh novel. It is in many respects similar to an Agatha Christie in that the suspects are interviewed one at a time and then gathered for the final denoument. I guessed wrongly whodunnit, but the murderer and motive make sense when revealed. However, the murder doesn't take place until well into the book, and I got caught up with Martyn's story. The suspense for me was whether she would get the role and attain her dream of stardom. Ms. Marsh must have known a lot about the theater since there is a lot of detail about sets and actors. For a contemporary \\"closed set\\" murder mystery also based in England, I would recommendChristmas is Murder: A Rex Graves Mysteryby C.S. Challinor."},{"Title":"Night at the Vulcan","review":"Narrator is perfect for this type of book, love Ngaio Marsh's style anyway, but the voice on this book is perfect."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Advanced growers will find info in here that they are not familiar with.

It has info on the 24/0 and 16/8 photoperiods and the right formulas for nutrient calculations. These calculations are very important info. C6 Indoor Environmental Control. Odor control and C02 control with calculations. C7 Pre-flowering and Flowering. The info here could be the value of the book. You can get far and get this wrong but you will win on your first round if you do it this way. C8: Advanced Indoor Soil-based grow methods. Mother plant selections, SOG, ScrOG and closet growing.

The BIBLE [as it is known] is the most detailed of the pot books with well recorded stuff like detailed diagrams complete with full-color photography plus illustrations make the Bible a highly accessible introduction to Marijuana growing.There are many design concepts, chapters cover how to set up home grows inside, to how to use the elements outdoors, ScrOG grows with pleasing aesthetics and big results. Even though it is also a handyman's how-to book and delves extensively into the mechanics of how to construct and install an indoor garden, the best stuff is in teaching how to sprout seeds, water, feed, flower, and protect your crop; it focuses on learning.

To resummarize, this book is not only completely full of accurate growing information, but it shares this in an easy-to-understand fashion. It's oriented based on the life cycle of the plant, so you can read as you go--it is essentially a marijuana cultivating manual. It also includes info on how to harvest and cure your buds, plus it gives great info on the different aspects of cultivation.

Finally a book that not only tells gardeners how to avoid wasting your time chasing bugs but also how to end up with a fine canopy of thick buds.Many books addressing insect and disease control problems with cannabis (and it is a big problem) would have you thinking that gardening is chemical warfare! With other books I had an arsenal of chems on my shelf to kill specific creatures. I didn't know that some of this stuff should not be used on edible plants. Cannabis is an edible!What these books failed to say is that once you chem control your garden you need to chem control it for good. My gardening was obsessed with it. This book taught me how to maintain a bug-free garden and free of fungi. It just changed my garden and solved a problem pathogen that I could never get rid off before. Every gardener wants his or her garden to be perfect. However, at times we get carried away, overdoing it and forgetting that chem sanitized buds are not the kind of buds you want to use. I really like the way this book even uses friendly insects to control bad pests. It brings us back to reality and reminds us to enjoy nature, not fight it with chems all the time. That control section meant a lot to me.This is definitely one of the best gardening books I have read in a long time. You need to have the information at your disposal and this book has it."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This new book came out over 2 years ago. It has the best flowering methods to date including 24/0, 16/8, 12/12 and includes plant maturity coverage that will produce the best yields. If you want the biggest buds you can get then read this and put it into practice. Genetics are very important. Never let anyone try to teach you otherwise. Woody Allen can not become Hercules. Starting with the offspring of Hercules and not Woody Allen, combined with optimal growing conditions produces big potent bags of high grade sticky resinous dried flowers. This book will show you how to get Hercules genetics the easy way. There is simply nothing else out there that combines all types of growing, indoors and out, with genetics, soil or hydroponics, and feeding schedules like the Grow Bible. You can repeat the book cover images as others are doing today (see Cannabis Breeder's Bible for new results). This book has a proven history with many growers. The results work and they works very well. Get it right the first time or don't do it at all."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I've been writing about cannabis for years now and thought I should find out what's going on with cultivation. I do not have a green thumb and I've never really grown anything more complicated than a tomato. What I like about this book is the realistic appraisal of all the challenges related to cultivation. The details about coaxing the plant into existence are splendid. So many growing guides, websites, and magazine articles imply that the process is relatively effortless. It is not. Even when cannabis is re-legalized, I can see that this task is beyond me.I was particularly struck by all the outrageous hassles that have nothing to do with the plant and everything to do with prohibition. Big sections on security, sea of green growing to keep the number of plants to a minimum, carbon filters for preventing the detection of odors...It's insane. I love that growers have shown such ingenuity and skill, but can't help wondering what they could have done to improve the plant itself if they hadn't spent all this time and energy on secrecy.Users should read this book simply to further their appreciation of the plant and the cultivators. The book should also get them motivated to work for the repeal of prohibition because each section makes it obvious that cannabis could be better and cheaper if these horticulturists could devote their time to more important matters than avoiding detection.Non-users should at least thumb through this book. If they can understand that cultivators are willing to endure the ridiculous irritations that prohibition creates, they will know that any attempt to legislate this plant out of existence is doomed to failure."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"You reap what you sow. TCGB is the most comprehensive marijuana book I have read. I own a lot of picture books dedicated to the herb but when it comes to text based information that I need then this book is where I go. That is not to say that it is not complemented with pictures and color sections and illustrations. They are exactly where I hope they would be but I don't want reams of pages showing my internet photographs of bud plants when I want steadfast accurate information instead. Like I said, I have a whole pile of picture books if I want that. Here you come away having learned something new every time. I would recommend that you have this in your collection no matter what. It is just so important to have the kind of information that you won't get elsewhere. It has stuff on flowering that makes it an essential read. The dedication to genetics is absolutely a must. Sow bad genetics and you are wasting your time. Greg Green's extensive knowledge on breeding makes all the difference. If you don't get what is being taught about breeding then you are just wasting time and money. You need to understand that breeds are what make the buds able to go into overdrive with the big harvests, dense buds, ultra potent and tasty. It then tells you how to grow the various breeds so that you can reap the harvest that you see in all the pictures! Believe me when I say that there is a big difference between slobbering over pictures and slobbering over your own garden that looks like what you see in those pictures. This is about achieving goals and getting results. The Cannabis Grow Bible is the way to get there."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"...click on the buy button and wait.

If you are a beginner grower looking for a concrete guide with steadfast accurate information then this is for you. If you are an amateur grower looking to improve your technique then you will certainly find that here too. Professional growers can bury their heads in the advance systems and breeding chapters.Marijuana cultivation books are always lacking in presentation or contain useless information. This information packed guide is authoritative from page to page. The author does not ramble but sticks to the topic at hand. Its growing all the way. Good.Matters of marijuana cultivation that sometimes cause confusion with most growers are addressed and covered immediately in the beginning of the book. GOOD. You are actually given viable sources for viable seeds. One of the most impressive items of interest that can be obtained from this book is the kind of genetics you should choose. Bad seeds can cause irregular or non-uniform growth. This guide advices you on how to avoid bad seeds by making the correct strain selection in the beginning even before you grow.This book reminds me of an extended cannabis science of normal botany guides crossed with real life growing scenarios. Already my pages are beginning to have that dog-eared look from my constant flicking through the index to find what I need.I got this book at the right time because I was already flowering and needed to learn when and how to harvest. My last grow was only okay and the bud was not potent because I had sun dried it as some other guides wrongly suggest.There is so much more to this book than I can describe here. Just get it and see for yourself. This is just what growers need. Every page is illustrated with a very good color section.

O.K., here is the lowdown. This book is very different from most grow guides. It is more dedicated to the new age growers and the growing community that has evolved over the past ten years. There is lots of links in this book to websites on the internet, grow shops, breeders and seed banks. So everything there is at your fingertips. You will benefit from these inclusions if you use them. If you do not use them then you may be growing bag seed. Like this book says bag seed is a big mistake. The other thing that is different is the approach to cultivation. It sets up a lot of botanical information about the plant and seed knowledge. There is lots of germination methods here. It covers all the important stuff that you really need to know as a grower. This is why I like it. It has that growers edge appeal to it rather than just being a botany book. So if you are looking to get a plant from seed to flower, then this book will do just that for you. If you are looking to get better yields then concentrate on the advanced sections and tips and breeding and genetics. It is all there.

Its layout makes it very easy to read and understand. It is well presented, well edited, authoritative and contains tons of very important cultivation information. It has lots of illustrations, lots of photographs and a very good reference with index and glossary at the back. This manual is really what helped me put a bunch of pot on the table. The next grow round is going to be even better! I have used many grow guides and internet forums to learn as much growing information as I could, but this book is 'the gem of grow guides'. I can not understate how important this book is to me or for you. It covers cannabis botany very well. There is an advanced breeding section in the back which will inspire you to create your own hybrids. There is a massive amount of data in this book for you to read through. Some of it is about the legal aspects of marijuana cultivation. It comes \\"high\\"ly recommended for both the recreational and medical user. Get this book for yourself at all costs if you want to do things the right way. See it for yourself, you will not find any other book like it. It even tells you how to choose the right seeds that you need and where to get them. I did this and it works. This books sits right there at the front of my batch on the shelf. Newbie, amateur, experienced or professional do not grow without it. It really is that Exceptional!Good points: It is not just a book. It is your guru.

The reason why I highly recommended this book to growers is because of the sheer volume of factual cultivation information as opposed to growing myths, stoner ramblings and old information.A book like this one really depends on how well it can be put into practice and I will stop short from calling this book the ultimate guide because I want to see more from this writer. If you have never tried to grow marijuana before or have had bad results then use this book to get you there from start to finish in no time. This is the one thing that really stands out about this book. It gets you there very quickly and with good results. Growers who are looking for a more experienced grow book should not miss this opportunity to turn a trick at adding a few pounds to their grow room by attempting some of the advanced techniques featured here. This is the high yielder surprise book that I got as an early Christmas present.[There is a breeding chapter which sets a new standards for books of this type.

So when I began some indoor plants for outdoors, I used this book for its principles and learned there is no reason why I should not be able to create a monster patch. I must admit you need room sized spaces to work with to get big crops even though I could have easily given away lots of cuttings to people close enough to drive by with their windows down.This book gives you good direction in choosing the right seeds you need and the number of plants you want for good results. We love skunk, so devoted most of our grow patches to skunk; and you'd be astonished at how big some plants can get so quickly. As a married couple without children we kept it secret, easy. The methods in this book are somewhat related to Dutch intensive marijuana agriculture, where special plants can produce big in a relatively small space. You just need to spend on good seeds.Another reason to own this book is for the soil and hydro enrichments. Helps combat any weeding, never had problems with indoor pests, even though the basement was not the cleanest to begin with but the book's advice works. Cloning, pruning and plant training were a lot easier than I thought. Learn any small part of any small chapter and it will be worth it.This is one of my favorite garden books and one of my favorite marijuana books. So it works both nicely.

There are writers who write about marijuana and writers who write and grow marijuana. We have seen a barrage of books from pot magazine editors and columnists to help fill our shelves. What we do not have are many good marijuana books written by growers so this is why it is good to see this change. I like it when a writer tries to develop a book with growers in mind and not just marijuana enthusiasts. This is a very grower orientated book and would be my first preference for marijuana growing information. This is not to say that marijuana enthusiasts can not learn from it. There is a section of legal stuff at the back. My only critic about this book is that the history of cannabis is only given two pages. I guess there is nothing wrong with that because the book is mostly about growing but that still could have been in there."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Plain and simple this is HANDS DOWN THE BEST BOOK FOR LEARNING ABOUT GROWING CANNABIS! This book covers every and anything you would need to know. Even if you know alot about cannabis you are sure to learn a thing or 2 from this book!"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Exactly what I was looking for. The book holds a vast amount of knowlege regarding growing, very informative. A good go-to book to have on hand."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Before you buy anything eles for your garden you need to buy this book.Whatever eles you think you might need, you need the Cannabis Grow Bible.If you are thinking about growing, already growing, or are just interested in the process of cannabis cultivation the information between these leaves will save you time and money.I found the Cannabis Grow Bible an excellent source of information covering all aspects of growing, from seed selection to harvest, curing and beyond.This book must be the most valuable piece of equipment for any cannabis growers garden and probably the least expencive next to your thermometer. Indoors or out, no garden is complete without the Cannbis Grow Bible."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This is a grow book from a good grower. That is really all you need to know because there is nothing else like that if you have done your research right. The Cannabis Bible reads and looks like a proper book. If you have been sick of reading books that are strung together by bad binding or look self published then do not let that put you off this one. This is a very different book to those. This book reads and looks like a proper growing manual and the bulk of the work is dedicated to growing. This book is a very big book but big on the information. Point to any page, line or passage at random and learn something new about cannabis. It is like that. This book does not beat about the bush and instead shows you how to grow great bushes. If there is any book you want to read then this is the book that you really want. Why settle for anything less than a grow book from a grower for growers who want to grow.On closing this review I leave a link to what I produced using this book. http://buddyman.iwarp.com/buddyman.htm"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Some ideas in this book are as helpful as any newspapers' garden section.

Being a true connoiseur and grower, I'd have to say that this book is not all it's cracked up to be: more hype and far too much self-promotion going on here for my taste buds."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"If you are a first time grower and growing from seed, this is definitely NOT a definitive guide. To be quite honest I have yet to find one. I had to purchase a total of 5 books to get the most comprehensive collection of knowledge needed for my first grow. This book in particular leaves you totally in the dark when it comes to the different concerns you might have during the germination stage which is pretty significant and lasts several weeks. If you're looking for a step-by-step guide, this is not the book for you. It does give a general idea of what you need to do.

This book is a no frills, straight into cannabis horticulture extraordinaire without the pseudo-commercial aspects of tagging a magazine label or anti-prohibition organization in with the author's name. Greg Green just appears to be a guy who knows the business of growing the herb and knows what I wanted to read and do. If this book proclaims to be the Bible then it does so for good reason. It just smashes right into horticulture like a big green bus loaded with tips, tricks, tools and commands directing you from seed to oversized \\"more than you can handle\\" harvests. I have used it, kissed it and slept with it. You should get to know it too if you want to exercise some blatant self sufficiency."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"A truely excellent product. Don't let the title decieve you, the cannabis grow bible has plenty of information about other topics regarding cannabis such as the legalization debate.

This is the only book about cannabis you will ever need!"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I doubt that there is anything else to recommend outside of this book at this point in time. I found it by visiting a site called International Cannagraphic Magazine, ICMAG. If you can find it online then run a search in the forums for an article called BOG SPEAKS ONLINE Tutorial Part 2 Organic Mix and Feeding.In that article you see a pro grower and breeder using this book to create what must be a single plant that produced over 1000g of bud in the end. He has a shot of a piece of sticky bud next the book that looks devine."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This guide is as expected. It has helpful tips and is a neat look at some new things like hashish making, breeding and flowering. It has a good hydro chapter. These systems all have diagrams with D.I.Y schematics. It does Sea of Green and Screen of Green with mother plant cloning examples. You can read about running perpetual cycles for anything including cabinet systems for smaller growers. The light chapter does small lamps, all fluorescent fixtures and all H.I.D. horticulture lights with a light spectrum chart and a bulb comparison table. The electrical costs can be worked out using the book's formula and your current bills. All soils are written up with examples of nutrient mixes and a breakdown of each of the macro and micro nutrient groups.I look through this book most days for things I want to read about and I usually find what I need. The book has appealing modern ideas. I think the book does gardening well because it also has outdoor stuff so it is done all in one go. It really amounts to a much deeper look at most of the topics done somewhere else. You will turn to this book if you want to learn more about cannabis. I recommend comparing it to other books to see the disagreements that the writer wants to scrutinize. Some things are interesting. I guess there are many assumed beliefs about the plant that could be wrong. This book is just good reading and helps you to make the most of what you can do with cannabis. I really enjoyed the micro photography. For what you get in the end the book is a real bang for your buck I think. Also your dank will be better than any street dank and much cheaper."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Anyone who wants to learn from an expert grow guide should get this book. I found it extremely informative and it has a lot of illustrations, pictures and formulas.

I certainly like it and you should get it."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"For the review below u really dont know wat u are talking about. and why is that that you are the only one that doesn't understand the book when every one else does and if you dont understand it then go got cannabisbook.com and post a message in the forum and the webmaster will tell you what it meant. This is truely a book that is from scratch and the way you know is cause there is no bibliography and most growing books have them which means they copied which also means all the information from CGB is from experience!!! Also this is the only book that has excelent editing others lack it like the indoor bible by jorge. dont get me wrong i love that book to but it was way to confusing had to read it over and over to finally understand wat he was saying and the CGB you only need to read once!!!

Very easy to understand, and in depth. Outlines many variations in growing techniques as well as a comprehensive guide on how to get started. Including an outline of what equipment you'll want depending on project size and location. Great illustrations for those of us who learn visually, lol. Even though that should be more then enough for you to realize this is the ONLY book you'll need, there's more. There is a forum style website setup for support in your indeavors as well as being a place to show your high yields and such to fellow growers. www.cannabisbook.com. I found the site by accident and at first thought it was just a setup to try and sell this book. It didn't take long for me to realize these guys really knew what they were doing, and so I went to a local bookstore to look through a few growing guides and such. This book stood out from the rest. Rather than flashy pictures, there is real content. From germination to security, it's all covered here.JoeSchmoe"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"What I like most about this book is that you only need this one book to have the full scope of general marijuana cultivation at your fingertips. So I am very happy seeing something do it all in one go instead of buying up on each one; indoors, outdoors, hydro and medical. I would still buy specialized books but there was never anything like this before it came out.Reprinting the front content table is a good idea as I have seen others have done.

Although Greg Green is not the longest running marijuana writer, you get around 600 pages of solid growing information. Each page is crammed with no nonsense information without extra filler internet photographs where you want words. In terms of text nothing comes even remotely close to that. And this is no nonsense information without babbling. By the end of the collection you should have a garden that defines the word awe. This is the kind of item that requires a few minutes of you hobby time a day over the course of two or three crops. The Cannabis Bible series creator Greg Green nails a powerful premise, realizing the contradictions and errors of pot journalism (that everyone talks about) versus real world growing and sets up a book at odds with what was done before and includes medical use. Most pages play along with the theme of teaching the grower everything from the ground up, focusing on new discoveries while eliminating confusion and erroneous information picked up elsewhere. There are no guest star writers appearing midway who start talking about the same thing another way or cancel out of confuse you even more. It is pretty much less about theory and more about showing the reader how it is done. It is a complete work from start to end. The scope or coverage is beyond that of what you might expect from a pot book. Just look.Chapter 1: The Cannabis PlantA Brief History of Cannabis, The High, THC, Resin, Zero Zero, The Plant, Male Plant, Female Plant, Hermaphrodite Plant, Sinsemilla Plant, Strains and Species, A Word About Male Potency, The Life Cycle of the Marijuana Plant, Germination, Seedling, Vegetative Growth, Pre-flowering, Flowering, Seed Production, Cycle Times, The Decision to GrowChapter 2: SeedsSelecting Seeds, How To Get Seeds, Choosing a Seed Bank, Breeder's Packaging, Storing SeedsChapter 3: Propagation and GerminationWhat is Propagation?, Propagation Logistics, Germination Techniques, Seed Soil Propagation, Seed Towel Propagation, Propagation Kits, Scuffing Seeds, Dangers when Germinating Seeds, Transplanting Seedlings, Transplant ShockChapter 4: The Great Divide: Indoors or Outdoors?Gardening Tools, Planning for Indoor Growing, Planning for Outdoor Growing and Guerrilla Farming, Security, The Most Important Advice Ever About Growing Cannabis, Indoor Security, Outdoor Security, Guerrilla Growing SecurityChapter 5: The Indoor Growing EnvironmentLighting, Color Bands and Plant Growth, Basics of Photosynthesis, Common Lighting Types, Horticulture Lights, Metal Halide (MH) and Mercury Vapor (MV) Lights, High-Pressure Sodium (HPS) Lights, Lamp Efficiency Tables, Wattage and Lumens, Lumens and Marijuana Growing, The General Illumination Formula, What to Look for when Buying a Lighting Kit, How to Get the Most from Your Lighting System, Adjusting Your Lights, 24/0 and 16/8 -

The deep hydroponics chapter was what I really needed to read the most but beside that I also learned much more. This book also has outdoor growing, so it is not just an indoor book. It is now the most used in my marijuana book collection and I would direct anyone to try this book out before anything else. It is the most understandable one of the lot and will show you how to directly obtain potent seeds. You can't go wrong with it. ;)"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"If you want to grow 2 ounce top colas in less than 4 months from seed in one foot square of grow space then this is the book that does just that. Got 16 feet -- 4 feet X 4 feet -- of grow space? Want to produce 32 ounces of dry weight bud in that space? Then read this book.From the initial few pages the Cannabis Grow Bible almost dives directly into cultivation standards that produce high yields at a low cost. Forget about smoking little packets of bud that grow on lengthy weeds which you obtained from some bag seed. Just stick to what this books outlines in its chapters and you will have the reference manual of a lifetime including the best hashish extraction techniques available.The initial four chapters covers cannabis history, where to gets seeds, how to start seedlings and how to prepare your grow for soil or hydroponics, indoors or outdoors. Overgrow the government and avoid the street dealer by using this book. Apply it and you will get something out of it."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Greg Green is an excellent head, no question. He's at once big cannabis fan and informative, talkative without being drifty. The problem is that Greg Green is trying to talk to the misinformed grower. That means those who have not read Greg Green but grow, should read Greg Green at least once, and this is the book to read. He has lots to say.I read about growers, and met a few, not so long who admitted that even they do not understand a lot of what was written before this book about growing, claimed Ganja cultivation information vagueness and fortunately all that is cleared up in reading this book.As a consequence I guess of other literature Green gives you a good deal of information pointing out the nonsense peppered stuff with some really horrid misunderstandings and errors gone by unnoticed throughout the years, most of them inaccurate folk tales about the herb and how it grows, even repeated quite recently.If you ever hoped that a marijuana manuscript would be vetted by editors or someone with a solid science background, or better yet, collaborated with a scientist on the writing, the answer is this book. I can't really recommend any else for such a valid analysis of different ways to grow the plant. The reader interested in how to grow should start here and those who thought they new it all should take another look. It does not just present you with information, it puts everything together. Emphasis on 'everything'."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Thanks to Greg Green since 2001 the internet was flooded with a PDF of the Cannabis Grow Bible.

Doesn't cost a penny. So naturally some of us wanted it in print. So we get a whole new book in print. A revised Cannabis Grow Bible in print.

I read it front to back right away and have been designing/planing while reading. I never thought I'd get so into horticulture. This book has me really excited about growing canibus becaused it's so much more than putting some seeds in some soil and watering it. There is a real science/art to growing WELL and this book seems to cover it all from start to finish and after. There is practical help for those who wish to grow in countries where it's illegal, (sound advice from experianced people who grow and have done so for years). I haven't read any other books on this subject to compare it too but I am very pleased with this book and feel I don't need another with more info.

The answer is - you can not. Obviously the breeding is right because the cultivation is right. If you find bad breeding information in a book then obviously the cultivation is not going to be that good in that book either. That is called logic. As for the plant pictures all you have to do is click on the cover. Tell me you do not want that in your basement. I DO!Rest Assured that if you get anything else other than this you will probably be buying the last of that stock because they are going to be updating their material with THIS BOOKS INFORMATION. And you will probably see this happen very soon.If anybody is suggesting that this book should take information from other books to make it better, then obviously you are only really going to be doing more damage to the cannabis gene pool than anything else.

It cracks me up to think that stoners could get up from their backsides to grow. If you are a stoner who can do that then go for it. It is fxxkxng planet sized book. I dont know if stoners would do this but if they did we would have much better blow for it. Ban MEX BRICKWEED and give us some skunk. Oh it is banned already. They should make this stuff legal though. Anyway it is a planet sized book about growing. Makes my school biology book look stupid if that means anything. They should teach this instead. I am sure we would learn lots more if they did. More intresting if you ask me."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Given the fact that most other marijuana magazine journalists use this book as their source I would not hesitate to recommend this book to anyone experienced or a first-time grower. The brand new information in this book came out in 2004 and you will not find it anywhere else. It was also the book that told you where to get seeds and how. In fact you don't need five books and if you do, then you probably have the whole marijuana \`grow' collection available in the book store. This book has the biggest seed germination section in any book, Chapter 2: Seeds and Chapter 3: Propagation. In fact it was so big that Chapter 2 and 3 are quoted in other guides and places. If you aren't following 2 and 3 for germinating seeds then you have probably wasted your time and money on seeds. Just do 2 and 3 and you will have very high germination rates. In fact this book is the reason why growers have been getting very high germination rates. If you aren't getting it right then you need to read 2 and 3 again carefully and stop trying to introduce others' growing myths. This book is a step-by-step guide and there is nothing like it. It has set by set photographs and illustrations. It gives you more than just a general idea of what you need to do. It is responsible for bringing out some of the most advanced breeding information of our time. It is probably not an only source of information because you will want his other book on breeding to learn even more about the cannabis plant."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"New growers who ask about starting are told to get this book.

Fancy breeding your own line of marijuana in your greenhouse or bedroom? Are you looking for the ins and outs of grow room design? This book has left no stone unturned. I love the way this book is designed ( like a growing plant ). There is good and new information everywhere in the book. You will grow some fat budz with it. There are illustrations to help you through some of the harder set ups. This grow book comes with online product support. Can you believe it?? ??There is where you should be going.

Do not miss this one if you are new on the scene or want to improve your grow like I did. IMO, this is a very important contribution to the marijuana cultivation scene."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This Swiss recently decriminalised cultivation and now we are allowed to grow for personal use. I got this book because a friend bought two and gave one to me. I think this book is much better than most people are saying because it is very much new stuff. This book is good for me and you because it is very much a gardening book with chapters also about botany. I have some experience with books like this before. Some of the books are more botany type with science about the plant. This book is about growing the cannabis. There are not very many good books that do this right but this book does it very well indeed. It is important to know much about what this writer is talking about and you can see examples in many of the pictures. I think people will learn soon that this is the book to get. I hope so because it is an important book for everybody and very new."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"Why do other book authors have to come here and bash this writer around in order to sell their own book? Guess trying to hop on the bandwagon is a sure sign of who is going in the right direction. I found out about this book because of its publicity (It is advertised in some well known cannabis places), websites and support system (Yes, it comes with a support system for asking questions.), plus the fact that people are using it to get what they need. This book is also distributed by the exact same distributors of all the other cannabis and marijuana books. If you want to prove to yourself that the reviews are genuine then all you have to do is click on the users names and see what else they have reviewed. As you can see they are all genuine and probably people who have used this book and its website. If they like this book then what more can you say? I see nothing to contradict why they like it. I can see plenty to contradict the negative reviews. I just used the amazon java review show order to put the lowest ratings first. It shows that this is the same guy. Now onto the book. Will you get what you need? Yes and more. End of debate there. Is it the most comprehensive marijuana guide available? Yes and more so. Is it the newest marijuana guide available? Absolutely. How accurate is the information here? This is a 100% grow book written by a grower, not a magazine journalist, not a photographer, not a marijuana activist group and not someone who does not know anything. Why? Because of the quality of the information between the pages. The book can easily sell itself on the information alone. To give this book 1 star is childish. To give it 2 stars would be inappropriate. To give it 3 stars would be an injustice when you compare it other books that are out there. To give it 4 stars would be much more suitable and 5 stars for those who really learned something useful and got those results they wanted. I give it 4 stars because it gave me lots to read and every paragraph has something to learn from. I dock it a star for not doing more on the outdoor front to match the wealth of information on the indoor front (*Edit this. I just gave it 5 stars instead. If this is the best book on the subject then I will give it what it deserves. Just compare it in the book store to see for yourself). This is probably the most definitive book on the subject to date and it shows. It shows in some of the negative reviews here and in the positive ones. The negative reviews are mostly - Do not buy this book because its photographs are grainy or Do not buy this book because it is too good to be true. The fact is that the photographs where taken by award winning Mr.Grossman (one of the main reasons why I got this book). His trichome microphotography is outstanding. He even has shots of seeds germinating just out of their shells. It is the only book to have a full color Hash Making section - Strike that - It is the only book to have any photographed hash making section be it black and white or color. The color section even has photographs of world's foremost leading breeding outfits in Amsterdam. It even has color procedures in progress. It is the most illustrated book on the topic, ever. The only person to give this book a negative review is the exact same person doing it over and over again to sell his own dated and inferior work. I actually own the other books too and this one stands out as the one. It is no wonder why he can only resort to bashing other growers if his material is substandard and can not live up to the kind of hype that this one generates. This is the book. Like other reviews have said it does not ramble like other books. It is all growing, growing and more growing. The self proclaimed experts have been razzled by it. It contradicts nearly everything they have to say. You want to know the bottom line? This book will force them to update their work. Watch as this book is implemented in anything new that they try to bring out. It is that revolutionary. It is that important and most significantly of all, this book is the only cannabis cultivation book that is not self-published. (Yes, read that again.), All of the other cannabis cultivation books are self-published. The writers own their own publishing outfits. The information in this book is second to none and it shows. If the only recourse other authors have is to scaremonger people from buying this book then you have to question the validity of their own goals. This writer wants to see people grow more of their own dope. That is a worldly endeavor that should not be condemned. Shame on them."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"A great book based around debunking everything preached before about growing grass and then shows the results of some good growing. It is no longer just about producing a one in a hundred photograph magazine quality plant, but having lots of them and with the potency to back it up.Greg has a strong incline towards enforcing the right genetics and then covering all the nuts and bolts about growing those genetics. In other words, most growers are just starting with rubbish and ending up with rubbish. He is also into optimizing yields every time for the long term. Greg has his science nailed down flat, and urges a complete revision of how you might have tried growing before. In other words, do it this way and you will not be disappointed.Ok, so stoners might think the breeding section at the end of the book a little too much for them. Greg, we understand that you have done your homework. You laboured hard to get us this information. But do we really need to know this advanced stuff? Maybe for breeding, if we want to produce our own stock. While that stuff is maybe too hard, it is still very welcome to have it there so that we know he knows he is legitimate.I love that Greg just presses home how to do it right and just arm-twists all the junk you have heard and read into surrender. He just shows some things that make you think, Duh? Why where growers not taught sometime so simple to understand before?The organization and presentation of the book does not suck and that counts a lot. It isn't like a pipe beaten old-timer has tried to churn out what they think is best. Greg is an author. His knowledge of cultivation is down on paper. He succeeds with hardly any failings. You don't need to sort through the pages to find the information. It is there, word for word of it.If you like the \\"start with good genetics and optimize them\\" ideology of this book, I strongly recommend that you try and eventually grow some mean Jack Herer from Sensi Seeds."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"The Cannabis Grow Bible by Greg Green is the first MUST READ book for any cannabis smoker/grower/breeder/enthusiast. Where other books have failed this book has achieved. On first view I thought the book was a little bit too big for a beginner to consume but after reading the first three chapters I was delighted to find that this was more than just your average grow guide. What Greg Green has done is to mix good growing information along with good growing advice while explaining the cannabis plants life cycle in over twenty healthy and highly illustrated chapters... The SOG and ScrOG systems look amazing and are highly understandable for the first time in the history of any cannabis grow book! This is why the book is a must read for anybody. I have never seen another grow book come even close to revealing some of the most important facts in cannabis production... Overall a stunning read and a massive improvement on ANY cannabis grow book out there. Write on Greg Green!"},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This book does not remind me of anything I have read before. It looks a way more professional than most for these types of books. It has a very workable plan to produce the best results in the smallest of spaces to big basement grows if you want. The strategies are clearly laid out and explained in sufficient detail. Readers can find plenty of pictures, diagrams and illustrations with instructions. It is very motivational. The clear and easy writing style should appeal to anybody. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I thought this book was going to be a quick cash-in for the medical cannabis scene in Canada but got it anyway. I actually found that I underestimated it and probably enjoyed it all the more because of that. Just to get the message across in this review I have to say that this is more of a brain book for marijuana growers that for stoners in general, although stoners may like it.The most striking thing about this book is the obvious time and effort that has gone into it. It is not just any old by the numbers marijuana grow book and does try a new approach to the genre. It is healthy addition to anyone's marijuana collection and certainly contains extra stuff that you will not find in other books like breeding techniques, creating female seeds, water hash extraction and seed banks.It is a helpful book."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I think if you want dense buds you need to read this and apply the information it advocates. I think breeding is of primary importance before you consider growing or you are wasting your time. This book just sets you up with the conditions you need to have some dense nuggets within a few months. I mean little chunks of bud that are heavy in your palm. Potent and heavy buds are what everybody wants and this book can help you pull out the type of baggy that just impresses everybody. If that is your goal then this book will help you realise it. It is very easy to waste your time and money doing it any another way. Don't waste your time. Do it this way."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"This book is highly resourceful giving you everything you could ever want to know about growing marijuana (and even more information you need to know about after your first time). I would definitely recommend this to anyone remotely interested in pot (which I would hope would be everyone who uses pot).Green's research is so thorough regarding every aspect of marijuana growing, from creating seeds and clones to how to breed plants and hydroponics that you can't help but feel like giving it a go yourself. It inspires you to grow.The reason why I say this is because the produce in this book is beyond anything I have seen outside of a magazine cover like High Times and yet you can see home growers doing just that in this book.If you really feel you might have a marijuana green thumb then this book is a reality you should look into."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I am a first timer and this book with a couple of others led me to a bumper crop the first time..."},{"Title":"The Cannabis Grow Bible: The Definitive Guide to Growing Marijuana for Recreational and Medical Use","review":"I think there is somewhere between ten million and one hundred active million marijuana users and growers on line right now. A new marijuana book, post internet, is going to be an improvement on anything that came out before that. If you are looking for something new then this is probably it. The single most important thing about this book is the treatment that the cannabis plant is given. Here there is a rock-solid growing base with compelling evidence on how to improve the cannabis species without damaging its genes in the future. I can see this as something that is currently happening now. Growers are using experimental formulas and hermaphrodite plants to create new lines. To be honest most other Books and CDs and DVDs are well behind on this type of thought except for Martin Booth's book, Cannabis: A history. This is something that should be considered in all books like this one. I think this book will save anyone an awful lot of money. Read something like this from start to finish is very helpful if you want to grow. (...)

Other books I have read on this subject where adamant that the plant will flower after I change to the flowering photoperiod. I asked some small time growers and they said that I had light leaks. I did not. Other books said the plant was weak or something was wrong with it. So I turned the pages of this Cannabis Bible and find an answer to this question. Now I have another question. If this book is so new then why has it taken so long to answer these fundamental questions about such a popular plant? They should have been printed long ago. Or how about this question 'When should I start counting the flowering times? When the flowers show or when I switch to the flowering cycle?'. The book answered that for me. If you have these types of questions then this is a very good book to get.To call the cannabis grow bible a grow guide is really doing it a disservice. This book is the new friend of the cannabis plant. This book gives the cannabis plant a new breath of life. The book has many morals about creating a better future for the cannabis plant.
