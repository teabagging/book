Still, just reading the chapter on Ford's dinner with the Von Trapp's was worth the price of the book alone! Hilarious! You can't describe the chapter; you just have to read it yourself and be prepared to laugh for the rest of the day. Ford is a master of the short form, but the longer pieces just go on and on.

The research in this book leaves little to doubt regarding the validity of guesswork and appropriation by said biased individuals.Egyptian Divinities continues in Moustafa's clear and concise way of presenting the Ancient Egyptian cosmology, dispelling the chinese whispers trickled from Greek and Western cultures. He explains in great detail some 80 important neterw (wrongly interpreted as gods) and more importantly their function(s) in relationship to each other and to the reader. Moustafa's words reach out to concepts familiar to life relating them to the symbolic view the Ancient Egyptians presented in their cosmology. Many of the neterw described in the book have separate sections markedly defined; &quot;In human terms,&quot; that allow the reader to closely associate more with the symbols of this culture rather than chanced abstract terms demoted to purely simple concepts of denegration.This book is not a fancy of the mind, Moustafa quotes and relates his points directly to Greek, and many other sources not to forget the reader's own common sense. If you have read Moustafa's work before then this book is literally a 'Benben' of his collected work to date. If you are unfamiliar with Moustafa Gadalla's work, this book is a great place to start and work one's way back through his collection."},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"A &quot;must&quot; for anyone intriqued by Ancient Egypt -- or anyone not afraid to think out of the box.

Do your consciousness a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"In Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are The One, historian and Egyptologist Moustafa Gadalla surveys eight Egyptian gods and goddesses to reveal how they interact to maintain the universe and the human being with the context of an antiquarian Egyptian theology. Westerners will find Gadalla's observations on the Egyptian concepts of monotheism and animal symbolism as fascinating and informative as they are insightful and iconoclastic. Egyptian theology was sophisticated and, in fact, an expression of monotheistic mysticism. A meticulously presented, ground breaking work of impeccable and original scholarship, Egyptian Divinities is enthusiastically recommended reading for students of Egyptology, metaphysics, and the history of monotheistic religion."},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"The author tried to present as fact that the Egyptian Divinities were not \\"gods\\" but did an inadequate job. But it did give valuable information."},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"Western Egyptologists are usually disguising the ancient Egyptian religion as polytheist in order to make Judaism-Christianity appear to be an innovation, unrelated to (Black) Africa. Moustafa Gadalla makes it clear that all neteru (so-called goddesses and gods; the Western \\"nature\\" having been derived from that term) were considered to be facets of the very same and only God. In a way, the ancient Egyptian religion is even more monotheist than Western concepts. Even rather pantheist (everything being part of that one God).The book provides the real Egyptian names of these neteru, next to their Greek-Western corruptions. Beware though, that the former are only approximations, as no vowels were used in the old Egyptian language and about every Egypt/Africacentered book provides other variations. The book provides the information of how these neteru are to be projected metaphorically onto us humans. Also, one or the other expression of every day Western life gets revealed with its ancient Egyptian origin. For example, why we \\"have guts\\" or a spine or why cats have nine lives. Intriguing, how much of ancient Egypt is still influencing the global age.This is an introduction into the Egyptian divinities only. Some of the chosen 80 neteru are covered for a few pages, others are only hastily described, some merely mentioned. I have given 5 stars for this 2001 booklet of some 100 text pages, in contrast to 4 and 3 stars for other ones by Moustafa Gadalla,Egyptian Romany: The Essence of HispaniaandExiled Egyptians: The Heart of Africa, though the latter two reveal more, which is much less revealed by others already and written in a more fascinating manner. However, I do not have to make any necessary subtractions for \\"Egyptian Divinities\\" and the latter seems perfect for that what it is."},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"Gadalla agains goes beyond space and time to bring forth such a well inform book of th NTRU. And has alot of explanation for them in detail while cross referencing thru other historical channels. This book dwelled alot of the Sufi Indians of Egypt who Gadalla expalns still worship and celabrate holiest of Kemet holidays under an Islamic cloak! Such as the festival of the begining of the flooding of the Nile is disguised under a celabration meant for a Islamic hero. A clever way of keeping the traditions. But my whole \\"big question\\" with this book is. If people from India are in Egypt now still hoding traditions under masked holidays. Where are the Africans who migrated from the Hapi Valley and spread and populated the rest of Africa. Where are their modern traditions to anicent ways. Yes I know our Indians brothers were apart of Kemet vast empire. But so long describing their customs and how they are still adhering to the anicent way. When its thousand of tribes and people all over Africa that do the same! Why go to JUST India? Because their in the physical anicent place? Ones who study this type of history would know that a large groups of Kemetians move toward the Niger river. And which became the new Nile. Do they still practice the same traditions, as when they were in Kemet? If not what else would they do? and who taught them? These questions he answered about with the Sufi Indians, but what about central Africans? Do they have an interesting story? Historians have always put the migration of original Kemetians OUTSIDE of Africa, like India! But one must realizes when Kemet was on the decline from invaders. These invaders were from the north and east. The Indians came in with them! They were under foregein rule and influence for a long time. Now these brothers are the only or one of the only ones who still practice these ways? That's a stretch, longer and wider than looking at Europe on a map!lol! The key is all fo Africa was influence and hold traditions from Kemet (Anicent Egypt) and he decided to show this in modern Egypt under muslim rule with Indians?!? The easiest way from one point to another is a straight line. This is why I gave this book 3 stars instead of 5. Because all 2 billion African tribes were ignored about holding anicent traditions of Kemet, besides our Indian brothers. -HRU CHA (Divine Kingman)"},{"Title":"Egyptian Divinities: The All Who Are THE ONE","review":"I purchased a number of books by Moustafa Gadalla including this one. While I enjoyed reading them, I don't think that the assertions he makes qualify as proof.As a scientist, Mr. Gadalla should know that the only absolute in science is data you can measure and results you can verify. Everything else is just theory that fits the data. But just because a theory fits the data does not mean that the theory is truth; it just means we have yet to find any conflicting data. All of the data present here, of course, fully supports Mr. Gadalla's theories.To me, this book contains some intriguiing theories that appear to fit the historical data, but I would like to hear from a professional Egyptologist who might be able to present conflicting evidence before I make a decision."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read this book with my book club.

There is no forward, information about the author, or any sort of conventional book apparatus I would suggest finding another edition."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"\\"What a hoot!\\" crowed Jane, knowing full well that no proper lady would use such crass language, especially in London, but she was on an insufferably indelicate farm in Sussex, and one sometimes has to throw down one's lace gloves and simply declare that a story is a downright hoot.Such is my opinion of Stella Gibbons' hilarious tale of young, urbane Flora Poste's foray into the sorry business and cursed characters of Cold Comfort Farm. What adventures she has as she meddles and sways and decides what's best for distant dysfunctional relatives at the farm. Their dysfunction is extreme and reform is challenging, but unflappable Flora cleverly prevails.In Cold Comfort Farm, Gibbons seems to be poking fun at idyllic pastoral novels and perhaps even literary romances of manners and morals. Lynne Truss' introduction to the edition I read details specific literary references and parodies. Without knowing all Gibbons intended, I recognized her intelligent humor. I smiled throughout this book and even laughed out loud at some points. The names alone are funny, for example the cows Feckless, Graceless, Pointless, and Aimless and the bull, Big Business. The self-pitying family matriarch, whose thumb the family members were under, was named Aunt Ada Doom. Last name: Starkadder.Here's a scene in a small-town restaurant that shows the book's droll tone:\\"By now Flora was really cross. Surely she had endured enough for one evening without having to listen to intelligent conversation? Here was an occasion, she thought, for indulging in that deliberate rudeness which only persons with habitually good manners have the right to commit; she sat down at a table with her back to the supposed Mr. Mybug, picked up a menu which had gnomes painted on it, and hoped for the best ...She was just beginning on her fourth biscuit when she became conscious of a presence approaching her from behind, and before she could collect her faculties the voice of Mr. Mybug said: 'Hello, Flora Poste. Do you believe women have souls?' And there he was, standing above her and looking down at her with a bold yet whimsical smile.Flora was not surprised at being asked this question. She knew that intellectuals, like Mr. Kipling's Bi-coloured Python-Rock-Snake, always talked like this. So she replied pleasantly, but from her heart: 'I am afraid I'm not very interested.'\\"The story is fast-paced and for the most part, lighthearted. Cold Comfort Farm is delightful."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"One of my favorite books. Love the humor.

Along came Stella Gibbons to take the scenario and run with it, and decades of readers have benefited by her hilarious version of the pastoral novel. Flora Poste, the young and impoverished orphan, is disinclined to do anything as demeaning as earning her own living. She has a token hundred pounds a year, which she is willing to bestow on any relative who takes her in on her own terms. Unfortunately, her relatives have their own terms, none of them to Flora's taste, but she eventually decides to move in with the Starkadders, an inbred farming family in Sussex. Flora is determined to make herself comfortable and this turns out to be a book-length challenge, as the family is large and none of them are normal. Every stereotype of the primitive countryman is skewered, but the brilliance of the parody is in the telling details: the promiscuous scion of the house is actually enamored of the talkies, his doting mother puts black crepe drapes around photos, his Bible-thumping father secretly yearns for a Ford van. There are so many characters that it's a wonder the author manages to round them out and throw in a working plot, but she does so, right down to Big Business, the stud bull. Hovering over all is the unseen Aunt Ada Doom, who is waited upon hand and foot lest she go mad, and underfoot is the farm itself - crumbling, dark, with no conveniences and every obstacle imaginable. Written in 1932, this is set somewhat in the future, but take that with a grain of salt. Flora is not above being satirized, either. Our heroine is totally ego-centric, and whether she does her relatives good or harm may be up in the air at times. Amazingly, the book wraps up all the loose ends in a believable manner and every rustic person is set upon their life's path. If you never read the type of book this pokes fun at, I recommend trying Mary Webb's \\"Precious Bane\\" first - it's a terrific book, but gives you all the feel of the genre which Gibbons punctures so perfectly."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If you have grown tired of the classic English gothic novels then this is your cure.

This woman was a genius! The characters are hilarious but somehow real - how about the jazz band! and the depiction of human weakness (eg Amos being tempted by a Ford Van to extend God's Kingdom!). The names of the characters are better than those in Gilbert and Sullivan Operas.

Without a doubt, this is the most hilarious and entertaining book I have ever read. I learned many new words and phrases in reading it, and it did take me forever to figure out what an embryo parson was. I laughed so hard I was in tears throughout the entire reading. I have never found anything else that so perfectly appealed to and satisfied my wry sense of humour. I used to watch the movie religiously - until I read the book, which is far superior. I personally felt that it was a more modern (and funnier) version of Jane Austen's &quot;Emma&quot;. But Flora was much more successful at making things come to the desired end than was Emma. I've always heard the phrase, &quot;Ignore it and it'll just go away.&quot; Well, Flora did exactly that. One of my very favorite parts is at the beginning when Flora is talking to Mrs. Smiling about how she avoided coming to enjoy games while she was at school (Everyone said she was &quot;no good&quot;). I use this book in screening potential comrads.

Gibbons' deft sense of humour and entertaining characters bring alive what could have been just another coming-of-age novel.Young Flora Poste unexpectedly finds herself orphaned, with only a tiny yearly allowance. But instead of getting a job and apartment, she decides to go live with relatives, so she can get life experience, tidy up, and make life nice and orderly. After a few vetos, Flora decides to go to Cold Comfort Farm, a \\"doomed house\\" whose inhabitants feel they owe a debt to her.When she arrives, she finds a clan of inbred Sussex hillbillies, including her grimly religious uncle, depressed aunt, \\"highly sexed\\" cousins, a very fertile farm girl, and the crazed matriarch, Aunt Ada Doom, who \\"saw something nasty in the woodshed.\\" Even worse, a pompous writer is infatuated with her. But Flora is determined to make things orderly, and so she begins changing Cold Comfort Farm...It takes a really good writer to straddle the line between spoofery and a serious book. Stella Gibbons was one such writer, and like Anita Loos, she was happy to eye everything humorously: the idle wealthy (Mary Smiling and her bra collection), people who live in squalor and hate it, but aren't willing to change (the Farm inhabitants), and even intellectuals (\\"Do you believe women have souls?\\"). Even the livestock gets funny names like Feckless, Graceless and Arsenic.For the most part, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" does seem orderly and tidy -- Flora drags it into the 20th century, sends people off to better lives, and arranges marriages, including one for her fey cousin to a young aristocrat. The only flaw is the ending: Gibbons never tells us what Flora's \\"rights\\" are, what Aunt Ada saw, or what happened with Flora's dad.At first, Flora comes across as rather manipulative and shallow. The odd thing is, as the book progresses, we see that Flora's liking for tidiness is essentially good-hearted. Like one of Jane Austen's heroines, she does these things not just for herself, but for their sakes as well -- she wants a \\"happily-ever-after\\" for everybody, including the mad matriarch, her womanizing cousin, and fire-and-brimstone uncle.While the ending of the book is not as tidy and orderly as I'd hoped, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" is still an entertainingly wry novel -- call it a comedy of improving manners."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Every time I pick this book up I know I will be smilling in minutes.

There she encounters all sorts of eccentrics and sets about turning their lives around.It is a slim volume but extremely good; humorous and sends up all those earnest melodramas so popular at the time it was written. It is a very English book and initially may not appeal to all American readers, but is one of the few books that improves upon re-reading. If you don't get it the first time, leave it a few months and then read it again. It is absolutely worth it.Not all the ends are tied up, and what the dotty aunt experienced in the woodshed is left to your own imagination."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Published in 1932, this novel is a hysterically funny, tongue in cheek parody of the heavy handed, gloomy novels of some early twentieth century English writers who had previously been so popular. Tremendously successful when first published, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" caused quite a stir in its time.The novel starts out innocuously enough, when well-educated Flora Poste finds herself orphaned at the age of twenty. Discovering that her father was not the wealthy man she believed him to be, she is resigned to the fate of having to live on a hundred pounds a year. Opting to live with relatives, rather than earn her bread, she seeks out a most unlikely set of relations, the odd Starkadder family who live in Howling, Sussex.Therein begins what is certainly one of the funniest novels ever written. When Flora arrives in Howling, she meets her odd relatives, who live in neglected, ramshackle \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\", where they still wash the dishes with twigs, and have cows named Graceless, Pointless, Feckless, and Aimless. Headed by a seventy-nine year old matriarch, Flora's aunt, Ada Doom Starkadder, who has not been right in the head since she \\"saw something nasty happen in the woodshed\\" nearly seventy years ago, they are a motley and strange crew indeed. Confronted with their dismal and gloomy existence, Flora sets about trying to put things to right.Peppered with eccentric, memorable characters, this book will take the reader on a journey not easily forgotten.

Comedy is one of those itchy things that you either get it, and love it or you don't. I didn't. I found the dialect frustrating: It was supposed to be set in Kent but the dialect read more like northern England, you have to read it slower to work out what is being said and in doing so you lose your attention slightly which takes the edge off the humour to the extent that you're not even aware that humour is present. At least that's what it was like for me. Whatever the nasty thing in the cowshed was isn't explained in the end but you're left feeling that there is a hint of bestiality that didn't really suit the book, being or trying to be a comedy, hence the lack of explanation.

This book was first published in 1932, yet one of the characters makes reference to Clark Gable and Gary Cooper being hot &quot;20 years ago.&quot; Another reference is made of a man, Flora's date for a dance, who served in a war &quot;in '46.&quot; I can't imagine Flora being escorted by a man over 90 years old (as he would have had to be if he served in 1846) yet it is clearly not yet 1946 in this book. Perhaps the author had a rather simplistic view of the future, where nothing has changed since 1932? So this has disturbed me ever since I read this book.Granted this is a work of fiction but when Flora is talking to her friend Mrs. Smiling at the beginning and she deduces from her cousin's name &quot;Judith&quot; that the husband will be Amos and the sons Reuben and Seth...well, I had no idea how she pegged that (because they ARE all named those things). I assume it's a Biblical reference, but how many people are going to know that?With almost all the characters Flora meets in Sussex, she is omniscient about them. She tells us all about how they think and what they will say and wear just by meeting them for the first time, and of course she is always right. I suppose we are meant to feel that Flora is an excellent judge of character but it seems to me that she was TOO right all the time. Like the author is hammering home Flora's sense of character judgment. They are almost all one-dimensional and Flora is easily able to sum up each character and make a simple decision which results in the improvement of each person. Too easy.Otherwise, if you can mentally transport yourself to a decaying English farm in the '30s, where owners of small planes can simply land them in convenient fields, enjoy yourself."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I enjoyed every character in Cold Comfort Farm!

J"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is a very funny parody of the Gothic pretensions of D.H. Lawrence-style rural melodramas. In this Gibbons is continuing the Jane Austen tradition of comparing reason and emotion and contrasting her works with Gothic novels. The characters at Cold Comfort Farm are hilariously stereotyped ones from Lawrence and others. Gibbons is very good at puncturing the insufferable misogyny of male intellectuals of the period (Mr. Mybug being the main example) and showing how it covers a craving for some kind of connection.Although there are parallels with Austen, in Austen's books the heroine would have a moment where she realizes that she has also been wrong. That moment never comes with Flora, who is always right and reasonable all the time. She is thus almost a symbol rather than a character that develops over the novel. Still, it is a very funny novel from a woman's point of view. Definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I read this book after having only seen snippets of the movie; rather, really having absolutely no idea what the story was about. A quick bit of research and observation in the first couple of chapters happily informed me of the gem of a satire this was.In a truly tongue-in-cheek poke at, well, classics in general Ms. Gibbons writes a thoroughly hilarious story of an orphan girl who decides to move in with country relatives and change them to suit her taste.It's full of all sorts of stereotypes, our dear little heroine included. The language gets ridiculously wordy at times and metaphors are used like there is no tomorrow. What is best is that everyone seems to be very much in the know of this.Even beyond the humor lies a plot that is actually entertaining and interesting.

Additionally I really like this cover that I found, although my copy from the library was just a plain blue. I wasn't sure what to expect other than hopefully a good time.I really struggled at first to get into the story. Flora was recently orphaned and she is looking around over her family relations to decide where she will live. She ends up picking the family at Cold Comfort Farm, where she is sure to encounter problems that she can solve. And she does. She finds a bewildering assortment of relatives, surly and intent on their lives as they've always been. However Flora wades in and sets their lives on a more modern path, arranging marriages for several and new career paths for others.Apparently this book is somewhat parodying some rural life novels of the time such as DH Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and the Bront sisters. I've only read the latter and references to them are explicit in the form of a character who argues that Branwell wrote his sisters' novels because certainly Wuthering Heights could not have been written by a woman! I don't understand his rationale at all but I was fascinated. Some of the characters also spoke in a \\"country dialect\\" akin to Joseph in Wuthering Heights albeit more comprehensible. The other elements were probably lost on me as I am unfamiliar with those types of novels.Another interesting element is that this book is technically set in the future (the late 40s) with video phones and a different historical path (I believe an Anglo-Nicaragua War is mentioned). That was not a very important aspect though as most of the story is set on a very rural farm.However I really liked the characters, especially Flora, the modern young lady who inserts herself into the lives of her relations and I would say makes them better. She was a funny character and very likable. The other characters were also enjoyable.Overall: A funny story with likable characters."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This is a funny novel. It is pretty delightful in that it has interesting characters engaged in interesting situations and interactions. Gibbons is witty and yet compassionate to all the characters. The heroine, Flora Poste, reminded me a little of Jane Austin's Emma, a character who thought she knew best for everyone and manipulated those around her to those ends that she thought best. Flora however is not brought up short as is Emma and thus continues to manipulate everyone and everything in her environment, always absolutely certain of her abilities and the correctness of her intentions and actions. Of course this leads to some outlandish situations. Flora is a bit driftless herself but gladly engages in rearranging the lives of others, particularly her country cousins. Every character has an issue and Flora tries to address them all. The underlying message is that win-win outcomes are obtainable for everyone. Everyone is a target for Ms. Gibbon's witty and sometimes sarcastic descriptions, but Gibbons seems to like every character and to treat them fairly."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"for Graceless, whose missing leg never seem shows up.Have sometimes wondered if this would be less of a cult classic & more mainstream is it had been written by a bloke (an Amis or Waugh perhaps - although the style & plot would be vastly different) - women just aren't allowed to be funny y'know."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Cold Comfort Farm (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)Completely hilarious and shamefullly forgotten.

Lawrence and Thomas Hardy. But don&#65533;t be put off if you are not familiar with these authors. If you have ever had a giggle or two about a steamy &#65533;bodice-ripper&#65533; or an author who goes on and on---- and on with descriptions of the morning dew, the heaving ocean, and the joys of primitivism; &#65533;Cold Comfort Farm&#65533; is a perfect antidote.Orphaned, genteel, and somewhat financially embarrassed Flora Poste decides to spend a year living off some carefully selected relatives. Though her worldly, soign&eacute;e London friends are appalled at her choice, Flora has her reasons. She plans to make herself indispensable to her god-forsaken, rural extended family who reside in Howling, Sussex at Cold Comfort Farm. The Howling, Sussex branch has unforgettable characters such as over-sexed Seth, fragile free-spirited Elfie who scampers over the moors in a scarlet cape, Amos who is called by God and a Ford Motor Van, and Great Aunt Ada Doom who &#65533;saw something nasty in the woodshed&#65533; and has been afflicted ever since.Not only is &#65533;Cold Comfort Farm&#65533; funny and sly, it is curiously comforting for Flora succeeds famously in exactly what she set out to do. She never takes a misstep or loses her fastidious equanimity. I found there has been a movie made of the book in 1995, and I have it on order.

A must read for anyone with a sense of humor and an appreciation for human foibles."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"This book is hilarious. More than once I made a fool of myself while reading it in front of other people, bursting out in spontaneous laughter when I got to a particular passage. It is pure parody. But of course, it helps to know what is being parodied: the object of derision here is the rustic, rural life portrayed in countless novels by D. H. Lawrence, Thomas Hardy, and Mary Webb. But even if you're not familiar with the dark, brooding nature of some of these characters, I think the book remains funny because it has aged very well.The book begins with the death of the Flora Poste's parents, and her relatively blas&eacute; reaction. Unaffected though she is, she finds that her parents have left no money to support her, and she simply cannot bring herself to work for a living. Instead, she decides to impose upon her cousins, the Starkadders at Cold Comfort Farm with only the aid of a favorite book, \\"The Higher Common Sense.\\" This is when the fun begins.On arriving at Cold Comfort Farm, she finds a host of backward, absurd rubes with names like Urk, Elfine, and Amos. (On the farm, there are four cows named Graceless, Aimless, Feckless, and Pointless.) Presiding over the whole clan is the loony, elderly matriarch Aunt Adam Doom, who at one point repeatedly declares that she \\"saw something nasty in the woodshed.\\" But none of this manages to perturb Flora, whose Englishness seems to foreordain a neat, tidy plan for everyone involved. She rescues Elfine from a freewheeling \\"loam and lovechild\\" life of writing poetry, and marries her off to a local man by the name of Richard Hawk-Monitor. She sets up Mr. Mybug, an officious hack-scholar who is working on a book supposedly demonstrating that the works of the Bronte sisters are really the product of their brother Branwell, with a girl named Rennett. Perhaps her biggest accomplishment is convincing Aunt Adam Doom to leave Cold Comfort Farm to finally leave the room she has confined herself to for twenty years to spend some time in Paris.This novel is wonderful lightness, but that should not be confused with being light: it is so wonderfully crafted, full of such deft sharpness and acerbic wit that it is difficult to write off as simply a parlor game satire. The narrative voice is memorably tart and sardonic, but not overweening. Whenever you think that Flora will trip up in one of her plans, you find that she is already three steps ahead of you: in fact, she already has you, the reader, figured out. The silly, unbelievable characters do prevent Flora from having a Big Problem to solve, but I always appreciated her ability to compartmentalize, rationalize, and order what she conceived to be a very disorderly universe. It struck me as a very English theme. And you'll probably walk away from the novel smirking at yourself if you've ever admitted that you admired a novel by Thomas Hardy or D. H. Lawrence."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Lovely book. Funny and entertaining.

They are a mixed bunch to say the least. Flora's attempts to civilize and organize them are hilarious. Let me just say that hygiene is fairly low on their list of priorities.The language and turn of phrase in Cold Comfort Farm is absolutely superb, some of which are unique to Stella Gibbons, but I find have already infiltrated my everyday thoughts.There are definitely echoes of Jane Austen especially touches of Emma Woodhouse in Flora.This book is hilarious from start to finish, and there are some amazingly witty turns of phrase. It is written by an English author. The British often allow their readers to draw their own conclusions, so some things are left to your own imagination. For instance what was so nasty that shocked Ada Doom in the woodshed? What terrible deed had befallen Flora's father? Did the goat survive?Stella Gibbons has written a modern masterpiece and credits her readers with intelligence.Definitely recommended and a definite keeper. The whole family has enjoyed it.

This one might qualify, for its humour both witty and broad and its country-house setting.Our highly-educated heroine Flora Poste, intelligent, witty, but fashion-addled, aimless, and seemingly shallow, descends on her rural relatives when her parents die leaving her penniless. Sharp parodies of rural England, the family includes, among others, an insane matriarch locked in her room, a love-mad and graceless granddaughter, a grandson who plays the same role among the maids that the bull does among the cows, an antique manservant who fails to notice when a cow's leg falls off. In short order Flora contrives to marry off the granddaughter to a local grandee, packs the grandson off to Hollywood, and generally manages things so craftily that everyone not only lives Happily Ever After but also does so with Good Manners and better haircuts.The most winning feature of Gibbon's book (after the fact that it is hysterically funny) is that she skewers not only the conventions of the 1930s upper classes to which Flora belongs, but also the working class denizens of the farm. At first everyone seems faintly ridiculous but over time your affections for ALL these characters grows. By the end you are actually happy to see them all happily settled, and Flora no longer seems like a conniver but a clever and sympathetic heroine-more Elizabeth Bennet than Becky Sharpe. A very neat trick on the part of the author, and one well worth the discovering.One miniscule note of caution: Gibbons, writing in the 1930s, sets her novel \\"in the near future,\\" and adds a couple of futuristic features that confuse the casual reader-telephones with televisions in them so you can see the speaker, references to the \\"Anglo-Nicaraguan War\\" and the like. You may safely ignore them without diminishing the book."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Every now and then, usually when life gets a bit too stressful, I need a good belly laugh. And if an author can do it in a clever fashion, then all the better. Such was the case with Stella Gibbon's Cold Comfort Farm.Written in 1932, and set in \\"the near future,\\" it's the story of the Starkadder family and what happens when they have a run in with the determined Flora Poste. Flora is one of those heroines who is decidedly cheerful, and very intent on fixing up other peoples messes and untidiness. Forced with the decision to either throw herself on the mercy of some relations goodwill to take her in, or (horrors!) get a job, Flora writes to the various relations that she has in search of a home after the demise of her parents. In exchange, Flora will hand over her slight inheritance of a hundred pounds a year.And it seems the only relations who do want her are the Starkadders, off in the downs of Sussex. Flora is imagining a tidy home farm. What she gets is a set of cranky, eccentric if not outright insane, cousins, with the ringleader, Aunt Ada Doom in the middle of it all. There is the son of Ada, Amos Starkadder, who runs the farm, but spends Tuesday nights off preaching fire and brimstone to the Brethren; his wife Judith who worships her youngest and views the world as perpetual misery and just wishes that everyone would leave her alone. Pretty Elfine, all of seventeen, spends her days running wild and imagining herself a dryad, twigs and leaves included. And then there are the boys, most notably, Reuben, who loves farming, but Amos doesn't trust him, and Seth, an oversexed, hunk of manhood who seems to have nothing but sex on the brain, but the reality is much more interesting. And then the ancient, muttering Adam, who 'cletters' the dishes with thorny twigs.In short, Flora has all sorts of interesting projects at hand, and it's a task that she falls to with glee with great practicality and not a little cunning on her part. It's a mad riot of a novel, generously slathered with wicked parodies of the overwrought prose of D.H. Lawrence and Thomas Hardy, asides to the writing of Gaskell and a great withering jab at the Brontes. For anyone who has survived a university level course in nineteenth century English lit, it's the perfect antidote to the general depression that follows such a course, and it's worth it.Asute readers will note that Flora blithely goes about her mission of improving everyone's lives and being a dreadful snob about it. It takes a little while to realize that Gibbons is making fun of her heroine just as much as she is of the popular novels of the time. Flora never quite seems to see the chaos that she is spreading about in her wake as she goes about her tidying, and assumes that she is 'doing the right thing.'From the names of the farm's herd of cows -- Aimless, Feckless, Graceless and Pointless and the stud bull, Big Business -- to the real intent and mystery of Aunt Ada, who saw something nasty in the woodshed, it's a grand read of a book. You'll find yourself giggling over the descriptions, the sly wit, and the oft-times ridiculous situations that arise in this tale of a tormented family. I enjoyed myself immensely, and found it vastly entertaining and worth it to mend the blues for an evening.It's not a very long book, just under 240 pages, and if you can, find the new release from Penguin Books, with a new introduction by Lynne Truss, and a delightful cover by artist Roz Chast. There have been several film versions of this one made, most notably with Kate Beckensale as Flora, and I urge anyone who hasn't read the book to do so.

The result is a book that's not only clever, funny, and well-written, but that is also unexpectedly, in the end, sweet and romantic.For those wondering, the 1995 film adaptation (available on DVD right here on Amazon) is remarkably faithful (with understandable trimming, folding and tucking), and likewise hilarious without ever being mean spirited.

The beginning of the story is somewhat jarring as most of the characters and relationships are considerably off the wall and reading about them for me was irritating. Even Flora Poste the main character, who I kept imagining in the form of Audrey Hepburn, had a peculiar but intriguing side to her that reminded me of the women characters in the early movies of the 30s and 40s.Leading up to the point where Flora effectively starts to free the family of the burden of the nasty thing that Aunt Ada Doom saw in the barn is like releasing them from the effects of a horrible family secret. Flora effectively changed the dynamics of the relationships and even freed Aunt Ada from decades of torment. In a sense, she was the deliverer because the psychological oppression was like an invasive tumor causing far reaching misery to everyone associated with them. In the end, Flora was also freed as the secret bound her to that whacky family at Cold Comfort Farm since she was Robert Poste's daughter, and somehow the secret involved him.Amazingly clever story line!"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"A scathingly funny portrait of society in rural England in the 1930's.Flora is such a delicious caricature ... because she is all so real ... yes, she is exaggerated and easy to lampoon but her heart is in the right place.All the characters are exaggerated and easy to lampoon because that is what the book is all about ... poking fun at the Great Rural Novel (Hardy, Lawrence, the Brontes).

It isn't. I can see how a bright twenty-something, raised on American humor would think so, I would have, back then, but while it is distinctly humorous, I wouldn't say it ever really breaks out into all out funny, I can't even remember laughing outright once. It is certainly very British, and they have a dry way with the droll, the understated and using repetition as humor.It's a good book, but with all the other books out there, if you've seen the movie (which is essentially very much like the book, but with some of the plot's loops straightened out through combining their elements with others near by, thus telling the story a bit more neatly, without any real harm to the basic intent) you're still not going to find out what Gram saw in the woodshed, or what Flora's rights are, or what wrong was done to Flora's father, other than it was something about a goat...It's a parody based on a dead genre, although DH Lawrence seems to have survived the demise, but it seems to be spoofing those books (or for later generations, movies based on them) where a bright young thing goes to the country and sets everyone right, as the country folk are too stupid to do it themselves. Part of the idea behind this, and coming from Gibbons' own life, is that people often revel in their misery, so one shouldn't feel sorry for them. Well, given this sorry lot of losers, the reader is certainly primed to take the author's lead and fall in with Flora Poste's efforts, but that's where I had trouble. She's a twenty year old, upper middle class city girl; with but a hundred pounds a year inherited income, sometime in the 1950's (not much even then), a revulsion towards work, and a horribly self righteous attitude that the book never seeks to mitigate. In a lot of such efforts, she would grow with the folks she's elevating from the fields, but not here.Semi-astute readers may note my reference to the fifties: Written in 1932, it's set \\"in the near future\\" and references later to Gable and Cooper as twenty years past would suggest this post war era, although of course the author would have no idea that Hitler would rise to power in 1933, or that a horrible war would change everything.Stella Gibbons certainly sets the tone well and creates a very believable atmosphere, maintaining it all throughout the book.What I didn't like at all, was this particular edition. It's as if the publisher wanted to bring the book to a new audience and figured whomever it was must be too stupid to take the book on its own terms. The cartoon cover is bad enough, but there's a note, inside, telling us how they changed the text, modernizing it, such that tomorrow is as it is today, in America and England, not as it was in 1932 British writing: To-morrow. To-day, to-morrow, good-bye, all have lost their hyphens.That's like taking the butter out of cookies, or the olive out of a martini. It can be done, but why would you (and no, don't tell me the olive only gets in the way)?The proper thing to do, if you're going to make a note of it anyway, is to explain why everything that is no longer hyphenated was left hyphenated, and tell the reader who might object to quit whining (or whinging) and get over it.All in all, as a light read it was worth the time. I would have preferred an older edition, without the changes, but there you are. The characters are certainly original, for what they are, and the reader is transported to a different age, and presumably, at least outside of the English countryside, a different place.I imagine that Sussex is now little different than Napa, with the white trash still hanging around, but with the least cottages costing a million a piece, and in pounds, not dollars..."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Every once in a while you come across a book that is so well done you just have to marvel at the spectacular writing.

Instead, with Cold Comfort Farm, our 20 year old heroine Flora loses her parents, and, faced with the prospect of living on 100 pounds a year, decides instead of live off of the most appalling group of relatives she can find, and then fix all their issues and basically \\"tidy up.\\"Almost all the characters are parodic stereotypes: the crazy, controlling grandmother, the gloomy cousin, the oversexed farm boy, the hellfire and brimstone preacher. And yet Gibbons writes well enough that despite that, you genuinely care for all of her characters and their fates.The writing is not only well done, but incredibly witty and clever. Gibbons can certainly turn a phrase, and there was more than once when I was working out on the treadmill -- in public -- where I was laughing so hard (or trying so hard not to laugh) that I was afraid I was going to fall right off.There is a BBC television movie that was made starring Kate Beckinsale (that was, of course, released theatrically in the States because the UK's standard for TV movies is our standard for theater movies) that follows the book almost religiously, complete with laugh out loud dialogue, impenetrable accents, and strange Sussex words like \\"wennet.\\" If you enjoy the book, I strongly recommend the movie, and if you've already seen the movie and liked it, PICK UP THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"One of the funniest books I've read.

I have enjoyed other satires, such as Jane Austen'sNorthanger Abbeyand based on a recommendation from a trusted source, I looked forward to enjoying this book. Unfortunately, I was disappointed.There were definitely some lovely moments of dialogue here and there that I enjoyed. But, on the whole, I found the book to be too over-the-top for my tastes. The first time there was a long overdrawn description of the scenery, it was funny. The second time, mildly amusing. But, eventually it was tiring. The melodrama was played too heavily for my tastes, again it was tiring. Also, I would have enjoyed it more if everything didn't come together quite so unbelievably perfectly. It would have been more interesting if sometimes Flora were surprised that things didn't go exactly as she expected, because don't young ladies of a certain age always like _____ or whatever. Northanger Abbey did this successfully, and was more to my tastes.One other caution, there is some sexual content, like the young man who thinks everything around him is phallic-shaped or it reminds him of some portion of a woman's anatomy, etc. It is relatively infrequent though.Overall, this book was just too much for me. Funny moments here and there, but too many deliberately overdrawn descriptions, overly melodramatic moments, perfectly aligned moments, etc for my tastes.

The poor-girl-meets-rich-man-and-lives-happily-ever-after scenario and its variations are lovely if somewhat fantastical stories. But they do get wearisome after a while. I mean, after reading Sense & Sensibility, Mansfield Park, and Jane Eyre, one almost starts to believe that being orphaned and poverty-sticken is the surefire method of finding true love.Fortunately, Stella Gibbons felt the same way, and offered up this little gem. While it follows the same basic recipe as all the other British chick lit of its day, my new best friend Stella had a little satirical fun with the ingredients.A very brief, non-spoilerish synopsis:Heroine Flora Poste, recently orphaned, considers her options, then blithely moves in with her cursed and dismally nutso cousins in the countryside. Each of her relatives is almost cartoonlike in their complete dysfunctionality; and all of them need some serious \\"tidying up.\\" Luckily Flora is just the girl to take up the work. There is the terrible and invisible Aunt Ada Doom, pious and furious Cousin Amos, morose Judith, virile Seth, sullen Reuben, and waiflike poetess Elfine.

Disregarding her friend Mrs. Smiling's advice that she find employment, Flora seeks out her only relatives to support her. Choosing the Starkadders of Cold Comfort Farm in Howling, Sussex, Flora sets about making life comfortable and orderly for her bizarre cousins.Setting the action slightly in the future, Stella Gibbons creates a hilariously surreal world pulled straight from Gothic-style novels of the early 1900's where descriptions of the country were prolix, decadent, and elaborate (she precedes those sections with ***). The dark and melodramatic and stereotypical are given much the same treatment Jane Austen gave the original Gothic novels in Northanger Abbey. In general, Gibbons seems to model herself after Austen just as Flora models herself after her favorite books. Flora is reminiscent of Emma Woodhouse (of Austen's Emma), trying to make everyone's life more perfect. Except in Flora's case, it works beautifully.Flora is a cheeky, but dignified character - everything she predicts happens exactly as she says, no matter how wildly preposterous the situation may be. As she begins to straighten out the chaos of Cold Comfort by allowing each member fulfill their dreams - of course, only in proper channels and as neatly as possible - she in effect takes over the family. The last obstacle is Aunt Ada Doom, a woman every inch as formidable as, well, Flora herself.Each of the thoroughly memorable characters are totally unique - I dare you to find any more eccentric and still lovable - with Dickensian names, but not the baggage. This is a book that didn't make me smile or chuckle, but positively laugh with glee.

Like one of Jane Austen's heroines, she does these things not just for herself, but for their sakes as well -- she wants a \\"happily-ever-after\\" for everybody, including the mad matriarch, her womanizing cousin, and fire-and-brimstone uncle.While the ending of the book is not as tidy and orderly as I'd hoped, \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" is still an entertainingly wry novel -- call it a comedy of improving manners."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"First published in 1932, this novel is a hysterically funny, tongue-in-cheek parody of the heavy handed, gloomy novels of some early twentieth century English writers who had previously been so popular.

They are a mixed bunch to say the least. Flora's attempts to civilize and organize them are hilarious. Let me just say that hygiene is fairly low on their list of priorities.The language and turn of phrase in Cold Comfort Farm is absolutely superb, some of which are unique to Stella Gibbons, but I find have already infiltrated my everyday thoughts.There are definitely echoes of Jane Austen especially touches of Emma Woodhouse in Flora.This book is hilarious from start to finish, and there are some amazingly witty turns of phrase. It is written by an English author. The British often allow their readers to draw their own conclusions, so some things are left to your own imagination. For instance what was so nasty that shocked Ada Doom in the woodshed? What terrible deed had befallen Flora's father? Did the goat survive?Stella Gibbons has written a modern masterpiece and credits her readers with intelligence.Definitely recommended and a definite keeper. The whole family has enjoyed it.

However, it is an incredibly amusing and deft parody of the cheesy gothic romances that we all secretly enjoy.Thoroughly modern Flora, recently orphaned, decides to spend the rest of her life mooching off of her relations so she ventures out to Cold Comfort Farm to live with distant cousins. She is shocked, absolutely shocked, at the completely backwards way they live and promptly procedes to spiff up the place: finding careers for all the young men, men for all the ladies, and discovering exactly what DID happen in the woodshed.It is perhaps going to far to say that it is completely timeless, and the reader must remember that the events are supposed to happen in a future which is now passed... but it is still a delightful and entertaining read for today."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"If she saw what we all suspect then she has been a crafty old lady playing on the sympathies of all her relatives for 70 odd years.

This abundance of family labour (poorly paid) has made Cold Comfort Farm a profitable venture. When Flora Poste eccentrically decides to place herself with these estranged relatives she sets about &quot;tidying things up&quot; (obviously a compulsive obsessive)! She liberates &quot;Big Business&quot; the prize bull from his dank barn, as well as Elphine the sprite-like granddaughter, as for Seth and the Sukebind the less said the better.

In the 1930s novels idealizing rural life were very much in vogue, and Gibbons wished to satirize them. She was highly successful and Cold Comfort Farm remains in print 80 years later, still cherished for its witty language, bizarre situations, and surprising plot twists. Inevitably the writing seems a bit antiquated here and there, and deciphering the Sussex natives' dialect must have been a challenge even back in 1932, butCold Comfort Farm is still well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"In Stella Gibbons's contemporary classic novel Cold Comfort Farm (1932), the orphaned, 20-year-old Flora moves in with distant relatives living on a remote farm in Sussex, England. Accustomed to glamorous London, Flora is not equipped to handle the hardscrabble life of a farmer, but with unflagging enthusiasm, she makes the best of her bleak circumstances. Flora sets about improving the farm and the lives of its inhabitants, who have suffered under the tyrannical influence of Aunt Ada Doom for many years.Flora's first glimpse of Cold Comfort Farm is anything but cheery:\\"Dawn crept over the Downs like a sinister white animal, followed by the snarling cries of a wind eating its way between the black boughs of the thorns. The wind was the furious voice of this sluggish animal light that was baring the dormers and mullions and scullions of Cold Comfort Farm.\\"As this overwrought passage suggests, Cold Comfort farm is intended as a parody of the sentimental and grim novels of rural life popular during Gibbons's lifetime (see, e.g., Mary Webb's The Golden Arrow). Despite a limited (or nonexistent?) collective memory of books like Webb's, Gibbons's parody remains fresh and accessible and, most importantly, hilarious. Overall, Cold Comfort Farm is an entertaining and unique reading experience."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I didn't intentionally buy an abridged edition and frankly, I didn't notice that there was anything missing from this, so I am not sure what was abridged.

Among the cast of eccentrics are:Flora Poste the 19 year old orphaned London young thing whose positive thinking views and desire to improve the lives of her cousins makes her an attractively winsome heroine. Flora is a do-gooder with a penchant for changing the lives of her family members. She is s a strong personality.Judith Starkadder is Flora's farmwife cousin married to Amos. Amos leaves on a preaching tour suggested to him by Flora. Judith will later be the patient of Dr Mudel, a famed psychiatrist, suggested to her by Flora.Adam Lambsbreath is the 90 year old farm hand wo loves his cows: Graceless, Aimless, Feckless and Pointless.Seth Starkadder is the handsome son of Judith and Amos who goes to Hollywood to become a film star.Reuben Starkadder-Another son who is smitten by Flora but ends up marrying another lass. He enjoys farming and makes many improvements to the Starkaddere farm.Elfine Starkadder is Judith and Amos' nature loving daughter who weds the wealthy Richard Hawk-Monitor. The ball Hawk-Monitor's estate and their marriage in the village church are highlights of the short 120 pages novel.Ada Doom is Judith's reclusive mother who stays upstairs in the attic like a character out of Jane Eyre. She becomes a pilot/She says she \\"saw something nasty in the woodshed\\" as a girl but it is never revealed what she actually saw.Charles Fairford is Flora Poste's second cousin living in London and studying to be a priest in the Church of England. He is love with Flora.Mary Smiling is a stylish widow and good friend to Flora Poste.The novel gently satirizes the works of such luminaries as Thomas Hardy, the Brontes, D.H. Lawrence and other more minor British novelists. It is an unusual but witty and gentle bucolic journey to Sussex in the early 1930s. It will be dull to some but enchanting to other readers. I loved the book and also the movie on which it is based.J"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Not long before she died, I wrote to Stella Gibbons to tell her how much I liked her books - all of them. She wrote back that most readers have only read Cold Comfort Farm. &quot;It's rather like having a brilliant eldest child who puts the rest in the shade&quot;, she said. Since, with the exception of Cold Comfort Farm, all of her literary offspring are out of print, content yourself with buying the brilliant eldest book. Flora Poste, a true Virgo, descends on the Starkadder clan and creates calm out of chaos. And as with all good fairy tales, even the Starkadders lived as happily-ever-after as anyone with such a lurid emotional life could. (Note: If you enjoy this book and want to try some of Stella Gibbons' other titles, there are some gems, but they are all quite different in style from Cold Comfort Farm - it is unique.)"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"The humor of this glorious funny book resides mainly in Gibbons' masterly control of prose style; if you have only seen the movie, you know less than half of what the author has to offer. Yes, she creates a wonderful gallery of extraordinary characters, and the story clips along nicely if rather predictably, but it is the author's language that really gets you laughing out loud. Written in 1932, the book is a parody of a certain kind of rural melodrama popular at the time, but of the authors mentioned by the Oxford Companion to English Literature as models only D. H. Lawrence is still read today. But no matter; there are strong echoes of Hardy and the Brontes as well, and anyway the language works just fine on its own. It ranges from gothic descriptions of a landscape primeval and stark, throbbing with the fecund sap of plant and beast, to gnomic sayings delivered in a rural dialect so thick as to be incomprehensible if one did not realize that half the words in it were probably made up by the author. And, as an added incentive, Gibbons has helpfully marked her most purple passages with two or three stars, \\"according to the method perfected by the late Herr Baedecker.\\"Flora Poste, twenty, fashionable, well educated, and recently orphaned, decides against working for a living so writes around to various distant relatives asking them to take her in. She decides to go to live with the Starkadders, some distant cousins whose alarming address is Cold Comfort Farm, Howling, Sussex. (This will seem less odd if you know English place-names, and throughout the book Gibbons' choice of names is both almost plausible and brilliantly absurd.) The farm is described in the first of the starred passages, beginning thus:\\"Dawn crept over the Downs like a sinister white animal, followed by the snarling cries of a wind eating its way between the black boughs of the thorns. The wind was the furious voice of this sluggish animal light that was baring the dormers and mullions and scullions of Cold Comfort Farm. The farm was crouched on a bleak hill-side, whence its fields, fanged with flints, dropped steeply to the village of Howling a mile away . . . \\".The extended family she meets there, all with short biblical names of Old Testament force, is equally dour, and the living conditions are primitive to say the least. The household is presided over by the matriarch, Great Aunt Ada Doom, who \\"saw something nasty in the woodshed\\" as a child and has barely emerged from her room since, but terrifies the others into submission for fear of completing her descent into total insanity. But Flora determines to take the farm and the family in hand, beginning with the youngest, the nature spirit Elfine, and working up to the old woman. The manner in which she does so forms the plot of the rest of the book.The gothic style which the author handles so well depends upon the ability to evoke impending doom, and Gibbons virtually redefines the verb \\"impend.\\" So the first half of the novel at least is superb. However, as light and warmth are brought into Cold Comfort Farm, the doom begins to dissipate. In nineteenth-century terms, Gibbons' influence changes from Bronte to Jane Austen, whom she can certainly match in witty observation, though at the loss of the gothic elemental power. The plot, too, lacks suspense; everything that Flora undertakes to do works out with few surprises; the main parody element at the end is the neatness with which it all does work out, even including the resolution of Flora's own romantic needs. But in exchange, as others on this site have mentioned, Stella Gibbons achieves a transformation of a different kind: the forbidding cast of caricatures to whom we are first introduced has become a family of real people, whom Flora finds herself caring about quite a lot. And the reader too. Skill of this sort takes Stella Gibbons beyond the ranks of a mere parodist and reveals her as a true novelist.[I actually read the book in the older Penguin edition, which has a fine cover, quite relevant to the period, taken from a painting by Stanley Spencer. But it is rather sloppily printed. The Penguin de luxe edition (which I have seen but didn't buy) is much better produced, and has the added bonus of a cover by Roz Chast -- a masterly match-up of two funny women working eighty years apart.]"},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Agree with the first reviewer.

Rather than make a living for herself by working she decides to foist herself onto her relatives at Cold Comfort Farm in Sussex.

Stories like Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice joined the work of Charlotte and Emily Bronte, entertaining the turn of the century reader with these melodramatic tales. By the 1920s, when some had thought this trend had passed, it moved into another phase, with pulp paperbacks filled with lurid descriptions and the purplish prose imaginable. Stella Gibbons in 1932 attempted an emergency rescue, and succeeded wonderfully with her novel, Cold Comfort Farm, recently re-released to coincide with a new movie version by director John Schlesinger.Flora Poste is the recently orphaned waif who finds it necessary to impose herself on some body of relatives. Her meager inheritance of 100 pounds a year is not enough &quot;keep you in stockings and fans,&quot; as her good friend Mrs. Smiling remarks. She writes to several distant family members and receives three replies. Most of them are appaling, except for the one from her cousin Judith Starkadder, which is, at least, interesting and appaling. She writes back and accepts the offer of boarding from Cold Comfort Farm, to find out what &quot;rights&quot; she has that cousin Judith mysteriously refers to. Her arrival at Cold Comfort begins a warming trend that ends up firing up every Starkadder in sight, including: Amos, the hellfire-and-brimstone owner of the farm and preacher to the Quivering Brethern; Reuben, his son and would-be caretaker of Cold Comfort; Seth, the hunk-a-hunk-a burning love that has terrorized the female countriside, to his mother's extreme shame; the flighty Elfine, who whisks around in ethereal garments quoting her own poetry; and the matriarch who rules Cold Comfort Farm with a iron fist, Aunt Ada Doom, who saw something &quot;nasty in the woodshed&quot; when she was a little girl, and who hasn't left Cold Comfort Farm since.Gibbons is artfully playing on the conventions of the melodrama, and it helps the reader to be familiar with the work of Thomas Hardy or Jane Austen to fully appreciate some of the playful work here. Without this meta-nature, Cold Comfort Farm would be amusing, but not nearly as effective. For modern readers, this is one novel that has weathered the intervening sixty years well, due in some part to Gibbons deft touch with her satire, but also her clear, readable style when not trying to out-purple the purple prose-wizards of the melodramas.This is the perfect novel for those book-weary high-school students still suffering under the weighty tomes of &quot;literature&quot; that is force-fed to them by our assembly-factory education system.

Some of the girls in my group were chatting about the film adaptation of it one night and I listened in as they laughed and laughed and quoted perfectly hilarious lines that had me itching to watch it myself, particularly given the wonderful cast, which includes Kate Beckinsale, Ian McKellen, Rufus Sewell, and Stephen Fry. One of the girls had actually read the book itself and told me I should make sure to start there before viewing the movie. So, when I ran across a lovely used copy on sale for a pound in an Oxford bookshop, I pounced on it and stashed it in my suitcase to read when I got home. You see, I had some inkling of how homesick I would be for England after I left it and knew I would need some good reading to get me through the transition back to the States. Originally published in 1932, COLD COMFORT FARM was Stella Gibbons' first novel and a cracking good one at that. With a wonderful and quite shameless panache, it parodies the dark and angsty rural novels popular at the time, particularly the works of Thomas Hardy, Emily Bronte, and D.H. Lawrence. Several of their novels are actually referenced in the book itself and anyone familiar with them (fans or not) will appreciate the light touch Gibbons takes while poking fun at them. I am curious as to how many of you have read, or at least heard of, this novel. It is an absolute gem and one that never fails to bring a smile to my lips.Flora Poste is in some difficulty. Having been meticulously educated to within an inch of her life, she finds herself unable to support herself when her parents die rather suddenly, leaving her penniless and homeless. After temporarily moving in with an old friend, she sets about writing a sheaf of letters to a host of distant relatives, inquiring after the possibility of moving in with them until she can come up with a way of taking care of herself. Though she receives numerous and downright alarming responses from various and sundry relatives, it is the last one that catches her eye. And for good reason.***The last letter was written upon cheap lined paper, in a bold but illiterate hand:\\"Dear Niece,\\"So you are after your rights at last. Well, I have expected to hear from Robert Poste's child these last twenty years.\\"Child, my man once did your father a great wrong. If you will come to us I will do my best to atone, but you must never ask me what for. My lips are sealed.\\"Child, child, if you come to this doomed house, what is to save you? Perhaps you may be able to help us when our hour comes.\\"Yr. affec. Aunt,\\"J. STARKADDER.\\"***Against her friend's probably wise wishes, Flora immediately decides to go and live with the Starkadders at Cold Comfort and see what exactly Aunt Judith means by \\"her rights\\" and if they might include something practical like oh, say, money. Or a house. But when she arrives in Sussex, it is clear that it is she who has something to give to her bizarre and backwoods relatives. And so, in true Flora style, she rolls up her sleeves and goes about setting things to rights. What follows is one the most hilarious romps I've had the pleasure of encountering.There's no resisting COLD COMFORT FARM's charms and that's all there is to it. It's really too funny for words. I can't imagine anyone being able to stay away from such a place and such people after reading that letter. From Flora's tribe of mad family members (all held under the imperious thumb of Aunt Ada Doom), to their hysterical habit of always referring to Flora ominously as \\"Robert Poste's child,\\" to the poor cows Adam is forever milking who go by the names of Graceless, Pointless, Feckless, Aimless, and Fury, it seems everywhere Flora (and the reader) turns there is another hopeless case just begging for her refining touch. And so she romps about the countryside, meddling in other people's affairs, fending off suitors, and all the while tamping down her dismay and befuddlement at everything from their nearly incomprehensible accents to their insistence that there is a curse on the farm itself. Something to do with old Aunt Ada having seen \\"something nasty in the woodshed\\" when she was just a girl. That's right. The whole thing is a perfect riot. Here is one of my favorite scenes, in which Flora encounters her cousin Reuben for the first time:***\\"Will you have some bread and butter?\\" asked Flora, handing him a cup of tea. \\"Oh, never mind your boots, Adam can sweep the mud up afterwards. Do come in.\\"Defeated, Reuben came in.He stood at the table facing Flora and blowing heavily on his tea and staring at her. Flora did not mind. It was quite interesting: like having tea with a rhinoceros. Besides, she was rather sorry for him. Amongst all the Starkadders, he looked as though he got the least kick out of life. After all, most of the family got a kick out of something. Amos got one from religion, Judith got one out of Seth, Adam got his from cowdling the dumb beasts, and Elfine got hers from dancing about on the Downs in the fog in a peculiar green dress, while Seth got his from mollocking. But Reuben just didn't seem to get a kick out of anything.\\"Is it too hot?\\" she asked, and handed him the milk, with a smile.The opaque curve purred softly down into the teak depths of the cup. He went on blowing it, and staring at her. Flora wanted to set him at his ease (if he had an ease?) so she composedly went on with her tea, wishing there were some cucumber sandwiches.After a silence which lasted seven minutes by a cover glance at Flora's watch, a series of visible tremors passed across the expanse of Reuben's face, and a series of low, preparatory noises which proceeded from his throat, persuaded her that he was about to speak to her. Cautious as a camera-man engaged in shooting a family of fourteen lions, Flora made no sign.Her control was rewarded. After another minute Reuben brought forth the following sentence:\\"I ha' scranleted two hundred furrows come five o'clock down i' the brute.\\"It was a difficult remark, Flora felt, to which to reply. Was it a complaint? If so, one might say, \\"My dear, how too sickening for you!\\" But then, it might be a boast, in which case the correct reply would be, \\"Attaboy!\\" or more simply, \\"Come, that's capital!\\" Weakly she fell back on the comparatively safe remark:\\"Did you?\\" in a bright, interested voice.She saw at once that she had said the wrong thing. Reuben's eyebrows came down and his jaw out. Horrors! He thought she was doubting his word!\\"Ay, I did, tu. Two hundred. Two hundred from Ticklepenny's Corner down to Nettle Flitch. Ay, wi'out hand to aid me. Could you ha' done that?\\"\\"No, indeed,\\" replied Flora, heartily, and her guardian angel (who must, she afterwards decided, have been doing a spot of overtime) impelled her to add: \\"But then, you see, I shouldn't want to.\\"***And that is just a small sampling of what you find inside this slim, delightful novel. The parody is masterful and the whole, twisted plot just gets zanier and zanier right up to its dramatic, fitting, and perfectly folded hospital corners conclusion. Highly recommended for Jane Austen fans in need of a good laugh."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"Stella Gibbons's \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" is a very intereting effort, despite some problems. The novel reads like a mix between Austen countryside prose and Wilde's cinism and desbilef, that made the book very interesting, but, on the hand, its characters are very shallow and monodimensional.When Flora losts her parents, she seeks any relative who can support her. The only family who accepts the girl are the Starkadder, who happen to live in the Cold Comfort Farm, hence the title. They are quite a family. Any of them has his/her problems, limitation and interests. Flora goes to live with than and she [can you guess?] changes everybody's lives, even the farm's.Gibbons's prose is fluent and interesting. The story, despite its previsibility, keeps the reader interested. The characters, as I aforementioned, are very monodimensional, ie, they are more types the human beings, like, the Sad Aunt, the Naive Cousin.... nevertheless, they are good to spend some hours with. Flora, the protagonist, is the more interesting, but and she suffers some changer through the narrative, but very smoothy ones. In the end, she is not very different from the girl she is the begining.The title is very interesting and self-explianable: in that farm, Flora finds some comfort, but this is still a cold place due to the weird people that live there. The farm can be read as a metaphor of the world and the some kind of people one may find, but even then, the author is a bit naive. Her world is too easy to live and the problems too easy to solve. Real life is a bit different.All in all, it is a funny reading. Despite being a bit of Austen and a bit of Wilde, this novel isn't close to any of their work. Anyway, it is worth reading for people who like an easy and sometimes interesting prose."},{"Title":"Cold Comfort Farm (Isis Large Print Fiction)","review":"I've always liked a book where the protagonist \\"fixes everything\\" and this story fell into that category..

Brownmiller arrives in Vietnam with a somewhat blase attitude. Her commentary is somewhat blah and seems to highlight the poverty in a \\"hmm, these guys won?\\" type overtone. As she moves through the country, however, her tone seems to change to a more accepting understanding that this way of life is viable and sustainable as it's not too reliant on \\"stuff\\".I grew to like her, she's witty, smart and has a sarcastic element to her that I find attractive. The banter between her and her guide(s) made me smile more than once. I get the feeling Brownmiller typified the average Westerner in a land deemed \\"underdeveloped\\" by western standards. The \\"how do these people live\\" eventually changes to \\"these people really are living\\". The population isn't hurrying around in a blur of goals and objectives but more concentrating on the moment.I found Saigon to be the most interesting of her chapters as, there is so much history for the westerner there. She talks about the Diem regime, the Buddhist monk immolation's of the 60's, the various coups and temporary governments that came and went with the seasons. She has done her homework.She gives us a lot of history which, I'm very grateful for. She describes the scenery and explains it's place in the French, Japanese and American wars. She recounts the places she visits during the American war, Danang, where the marines came ashore in 1965, Hue the longest holdout by the Vietcong in the Tet offensive etc It's fascinating stuff and, if you have any interest in Vietnam whatsoever, well worth your time."},{"Title":"Seeing Vietnam: Encounters of the Road and Heart.","review":"This is one of the worst travel accounts of Vietnam I've ever read.

This is one of his most interesting works. And his ruminations are quite relevant today. A key point at the outset of this work (Page 19): \\"If I am right in what I have been saying, there has developed in this century a functional derangement of the relationship between the mass of people and the government. The people have acquired power which they are incapable of exercising and the governments--they have lost power which they must recover if they are to govern.\\"He notes another disjunction--between \\"the people\\" and \\"THE PEOPLE\\" (my distinction in caps). As Edmund Burke, he does not believe that the people, as in government by the people, refers just to those living. In his view, THE PEOPLE is (Page 32) \\". . .a community of the entire living population, and their predecessors and successors.\\" Applicability? In today's toxic political atmosphere, the parties are only interested in their current base and those independents whom they can claim and, perhaps, scraping away some of the other party's supporters. In the process, the past and the future are neglected (again, Burke speaks to the same issue).Democracies need civility to function; they also need a \\"public philosophy,\\" based on core values, to bind the country together and to structure political discourse. I suspect that Lippmann would be most distressed to see the partisan divide today (although this is certainly nothing new in American political history). For instance, he argues that such things as an absolute right to property is not appropriate when one has a public philosophy. There is a greater good than the right to property. That gives a taste of his views with one specific example.It might be that many Americans would be richly rewarded by reading Lippmann's work. I surely have many questions about his argument, but the seemingly quaint arguments that he makes might lead to a more productive political process. The current \\"blood sport\\" does little good for the larger public's interest."},{"Title":"The Public Philosophy","review":"Walter Lippmann is one of my favorite non-fiction writers. He is a brilliant man, and his work has contributed greatly to the modern American political landscape. It's sad to see this book going out of print. Few tomes grant such insight into the fundamental weaknesses of democratic nations. In an age where the United States is the undisputed military power, some have confused democracy with god. It seems democracy is a word thrown around carelessly as a cure all for the world's ills. The Public Philosophy stays true to the Founding Father's fears that a democratic majority is capable of being as oppressive as a monarch. I highly recommend this book to any serious student of political science."},{"Title":"The Public Philosophy","review":"Walter Lippmann's The Public Philosophy is as relevant today as when it was written in 1955. His assertion that the traditions and customs of civility are in decline in both America and the West is only reinforced by the growing unreason and incivility of our age.Lippmann's belief that a role for political philosophy(ers) is of vital importance if our free and democratic institutions are to be preserved is right on the mark. The Socratic pursuit of the &quot;examined&quot; life is more rare today than ever. And yet, for that reason, it is all the more important.The Public Philosophy is a &quot;classic&quot; and serves as a reminder that the solutions to the problems of democracy are not found in further democratization.E.

There are books about prostate cancer but too few that approach the subject of intimacy, let alone include it in the title. Mr. Hitchcox not only takes it on but with an even rarer - and much-needed - sense of humor. (How often do you learn the year/make of a writer's car in &quot;About the Author&quot;?)Although Mr. Hitchcox is a firm advocate of including the companion in the process, I was pleasantly surprised to find &quot;The Wife Gets to Speak&quot; at the close of the book where his spouse gives her perspective on the ordeal. More first-person books should take this route because this disease affects more than the man.The book is short, laced with cartoons and a fast-read but perhaps exactly what most newly diagnosed men need. At that early stage, one doesn't have much attention span. There's also good resources, a list of questions for your doctor and a good, workable index. And don't let the year of publication (1997) stop you from getting it. He gives an attitude that will be needed as long as there is treatment for this disease.I enjoyed the book well enough to wonder why it isn't listed at more Web sites. It will be at mine with a recommendation to get it - as I did - from Amazon.com.Robert Young robert@phoenix5.org"},{"Title":"The Russian Revolution","review":"Some critics of Marxism and Bolshevism claim that we are simply dealing with a Christian or pseudo-Christian heresy, a kind of immanentization of the eschaton. This criticism often comes from libertarians or conservatives who are atheists. This book, \\"The Russian revolution\\" by Nicolas Berdyaev, also accuses the Bolsheviks for being a pseudo-Christian heresy. Interestingly, Berdyaev was no atheist. Quite the contrary. He was a Christian!Berdyaev was nominally a follower of the Russian Orthodox Church, but in practice he seems to have been an independent-minded thinker, closer to Existentialism than traditional Christianity. Berdyaev emphasized individual liberty, while also calling for a kind of Christian socialism or corporatism. There is also a strong streak of pessimistic Zivilisationskritik in his works. His ideas strike me as contradictory. Interestingly, he opposed Russian nationalism and rather eulogized the Early Italian Renaissance. Berdyaev was forced to leave Russia in 1922, and it seems that neither Bolsheviks nor \\"White\\" &eacute;migr&eacute;s liked him. He was too right-wing for the former, and too left-wing for the latter. He died in France in 1948.\\"The Russian revolution\\" is a short book first published in 1931. For good or for worse, Berdyaev doesn't analyze the material or political conditions in Russia which made Bolshevism possible and successful. Rather, he concentrates on Bolshevism as a psychological and \\"religious\\" phenomenon. The author sees intriguing parallels between Bolshevism and Russian Orthodox messianism and asceticism, especially in their \\"anti-establishment\\" forms. He also compares the atheist and materialist Russian Nihilists of the 19th century with the more sectarian forms of Russian Orthodoxy, and reaches the conclusion that psychologically, the Nihilists were a kind of Christian messianists without Christ. The author sees similarities between Nihilism and Bolshevism, as well.To Berdyaev, Bolshevism is de facto a kind of religion, an intolerant and absolutist religion, which cannot tolerate other creeds beside itself. It's a kind of \\"Hebrew\\" heresy, since it believes in a literal millennium on earth (presumably, the author is an amillennialist). Berdyaev regards Bolshevism as a combination of Russian nationalist millennialism and Marxist internationalism. Had Berdyaev lived today, he would presumably have applied this analysis to the Red-Brown blocs. I don't think Stalin's turn to Greater Russian nationalism surprised him. (During World War II, Stalin even rehabilitated the Orthodox Church!)\\"The Russian revolution\\" speaks for itself, and the above is only a small portion of its contents. Berdyaev had the strange ability to cover a dozen different topics in a short book, and this one is no exception. He does sound meandering and unclear at times, but overall this is the easiest book by Berdyaev I've read. (\\"The meaning of history\\" and \\"The fate of man in the modern world\\" were harder.) Bertrand Russell believed that Bolshevism was more similar to Islam than to Christianity, so it's interesting to read the work of a Russian-born Christian who sees parallels between Christianity and Communism instead. (Demonic parallels, presumably.)If Berdyaev's analyses stand closer scrutiny, is (of course) another matter entirely..."},{"Title":"THE AVERAGE JOE'S DIET: Complete Weight Loss Program for \\"The Average Joe\\" Plus Weight Loss Dining Guide to 56 of America's Top Restaurants","review":"This has been the best weight loss book I have read.

Pinchbeck presents a detailed, thorough, fabulous review of the changing working lives of women in England during the transition from an agricultural to industrial society.The economics of that era--whether pre- or post-industrial-- forced most women to work for pay if families were to be kept alive. Housecleaning and child-rearing were not enough. The grueling labor of cottage industry, whether it was making pins, buttons, or lace for sale--seemed as arduous as that carried on later in factories. Babies were kept quiet with opium so their mothers could work uninterrupted. Before mechanisation, it was women who carried coal out of the mines on their backs, or walked an estimated 5 miles per day to and from a spinning wheel (the &quot;walking wheel&quot;).

And you should read it.Amusing word plays - like the blood lusting Hemogoblin - show Powers humour to be unsubtle, unlike the plot, which is so full of sub-plots and different levels, that you can't help sharing the calm desperation of the main character as he sinks lower and lower into a reality he could not have suspected existed."},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"This is the first Tim Powers book I've read, and though I can't compare it to the rest of his work, it seems that he is more inclined to writing fantasy than science fiction. Yes, the setting is L.A. after some (unmentioned) armaggedon, and, without revealing too much, there are alien beings here, but the treatment is closer to a sword-and-sorcery tale... with swords exchanged for slingshots and guns, and religious mysticism for sorcery. And then, there are Powers' grotesques, like the hemogoblins and those weird trash men within the Holy City, that don't seem scifi at all.So: the tale IS about a man, Greg Rivas, bent on rescuing an old flame from the clutches of a religious cult, and the subsequent confrontation with the entity behind it. It IS NOT about this post-apocalyptic world the action is set in.In my opinion, the one weak point of the novel is character development: Greg goes through several mood swings that don't mesh together well. But the plotting is strong, giving an envolving tale.To those willing to taste this fanciful dinner, enjoy."},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer regarding Gregorio Rivas as a weak spot in the book. While on this &quot;quest&quot; for his long lost love, Rivas actually changes and grows as a character. Here we have someone who is affected by his enounters instead of just a fellow meeting external obstacles. Rivas doesn't have mood swings. He confronts himself as he revisits people and places from his past. He gradually goes from being a rather arrogant egotistical jerk to an empathatic decent human being trying to do the right thing instead of a one dimensional idiot bent on just earning his &quot;brandy.&quot; Here Powers has created a man capable of learning some things as the story progresses. How many contemporary authors of any genre can pull that off without making readers snicker and say, &quot;Yeah, right.&quot;"},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"As a writer, Powers had a penchant (reputation?) for being both tricky and odd in his constructions. His great talent is the ability to take a fairly \\"real\\" scenario and add layers of twists onto it that tweak it into something that is just left of the world we know, where magic lurks just underneath the surface and the stakes are as great as the rewards. His best novels (most people agree on \\"Last Call\\" and \\"Anubis Gates\\" being the peaks) section themselves off into a territory of urban fantasy characterized by intelligent and extremely deft plotting as well as a seemingly endless stream of ideas.\\"Dinner at Deviant's Palace\\", however, is something different. It's far closer to science-fiction than almost anything else I've read from him before. Granted, it's an early novel (though not embryonic, \\"Anubis Gates\\" had already been published) but it shows an interesting direction that he could have gone in, plus an example of what a novel in another genre might look like once he applied his abilities to it.It takes place in a future US where civilization has been drastically rearranged. Currency appears to be based on alcohol and several nuclear wars seem to have occurred, leaving the remaining cities to function more or less as their own entities. Fairly musician Greg Rivas is going about his business as usual when an old girlfriend's father shows up with a proposition. Even though he hates Rivas' guts, he will pay him handsomely for a job he used to do: \\"redeem\\" people. You see, there's a cult wandering around the area, the Jaybirds, who are very good at bringing people into the flock and not letting them out. In fact, people don't want to get out. Rivas, as a former cult member, is more than decent at it, so against his better judgement he goes in again.The most interesting thing about this novel is how straightforward it is. For the most part Rivas' quest proceeds in a linear fashion and while he runs into detours and obstacles along the way, we don't run into any big twists or surprises as the novel winds on. Most of the appeal of the novel comes from exploring the future world that Powers has created and looking to see where it deviates from our world. It's clear pretty much from the onset that he has thought this through to a ridiculously detailed degree, down to the slang terms and the texture of how this new world would operate, the rules of the differing factions and how those factions would affect each other. There's a certain sense of history to it, that this world had a long and fruitful life long before we came stumbling along to read about it. Done improperly, this could become a mere travelogue, with Powers like a kid who just bought a museum, eagerly taking you on the tour to make sure you've seen everything. And the plot skirts just clear of becoming that.What's interesting is that for all the issues it potentially could raise, the necessity of cults in a world without marked consistency, the the fear of falling into the comfort of a collective, the exploration of loss in an environment where you're constantly on the verge of losing everything, the fear of re-inhabiting the past in order to refute it, the novel sticks to the pace and conceits of an adventure story, content to move onto the next exhibit in the catalog.It's a world just on the verge of the magical realism, for every SF concept there are bits like the hemogoblin, a vague gaseous intelligent beast that likes to suck blood. And then there's the whole concept behind the cult itself, which vaguely involves space and I can't go into too much without spoiling the story. Powers clearly had fun coming up with it, putting as much research into it as he does for his more historically based novels, extrapolating as best he can. Which helps, because since the story lacks his typically controlled and breakneck notion of plotting, we're left with a man who is discovering his world at the same time we are. If the thrill of discovery is right up your alley, then there's loads to discover here, the machinations and the ins and outs of how the world functions. There's hope early on that this novel might go somewhere mind-bending, as Rivas confuses past and present as he gets back in the cult, but that perverted sense of time goes nowhere.Instead, we get the plot hurtling forward like a bird skimming the top of a lake, occasionally plucking out a shiny and iridescent fish for us to marvel over. We get scenes inside the cult. We get scenes of Rivas running and scheming and reacting and eventually getting closer to the aforementioned dinner at the palace of the deviant. Readers will probably have seen this coming before Rivas does but when the climax finally arises and we meet the head Jaybird himself, who the entire novel has spent foreshadowing, there's an odd flatness to it. Entering the palace should be an introduction to the Gothic and alien, a true tonal shift leaving behind all the strangeness we've seen already for a strangeness that even Rivas can't cope with. But the horror eludes us. There's one creepy moment of real danger and then it resolves and we're left feeling this was the way it has to be the whole time. At some points it feels like Powers was so fascinated with the world that he didn't pay as much attention to the plot as he normally does. And what was up with the sacrament anyway?It reads fast and maybe shouldn't leave any impression at all for the speed with which it races through itself . Still, the details that make it stick. The fracture of society, the way that cult members chant out the thoughts of another, the stalking of the hemogoblin, all of these are images that will stick with you, images that you won't be able to find anywhere else. Such is Powers' skill. But the rest of it feels like Powers doing what most of us are doing when we enter the book, feeling around this new world, trying to find our footing before moving off to see what we can see. Another novel in this vein of exploration would have been interesting, with perhaps a deeper examination of the themes that were starting to be raised here. But alas, where Powers wanted to go was somewhere a bit different. Oh well. It's nice to at least have this."},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"Very few books deserve a ten. This is one. It amazes me that this book is not a classic of modern science fiction/fantasy. Dark, mysterious, almost pre-cyberpunk. Powers does an amazing job of setting up a post-nuclear war devastated L.A., populating it with well thought out characters. Drop in drugs, violence, religious fanatics, and psychic beings and you have an amazing read. Anyone who has played the classic computer role playing game &quot;Wasteland&quot; will feel right at home."},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"I'm really sad to find that this book is out of print.

Although the writing style is not as polished as &quot;Anubis Gates&quot; it's definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Dinner at Deviant's Palace","review":"I like Tim Powers' books. I don't like this one too much though. Powers love of the grotesque is in full force here, but what you've really got here is two stories that don't need each other. Post holocaust LA and the mysterious evil thing don't need to be in the same story, and one basically distracts from the other. Also, what's Powers' deal with mutilation? Why ask here? Might as well here as anywhere."},{"Title":"Cap'n Smudge","review":"My son and I found this book at the library and truly enjoyed the story of mean, old Cap'n Smudge. Behind the silly story, however, were some great lessons in compassion, thoughfulness, and forgiveness.

If you want to learn a more creative, non-traditional approach to wedding photography, this is a great book to get you started."},{"Title":"Innovative Techniques for Wedding Photography","review":"The cover of this book should be a dead giveaway to the fact the pictures inside aren't very good and the advice is mediocre, at best. Why did they select a picture where the groom's face has a blotch on it from the rice or whatever is being thrown? The book is short on meaty advice, it is definitely for beginners. There's not a whole lot of creative images to draw ideas from. Photographers looking to get instruction on lighting, posing and other techniques for making people look good won't find it here. I don't care how \\"creative\\" you are with your equipment, film, filters and other gimmicks, the bottom line in wedding photography is you got to make people look good or they aren't going to pay for your work. This book consistently shows how to make people look bad, grotesque, stupid ... in the name of \\"creativity.\\" It also suffers from the fact the color images were converted to black-and-white and poorly converted. The highlights are blown out and many are contrasty. I also was surprised at how many of the pictures were just plain out of focus or blurry. I would have thrown away many of the shots in this book. The text is set in a big font to make it look like your are getting lots of information, when you're really getting very basic stuff.There are better books out there on wedding photography, but in my opinion the best way to learn it is with a video series. If you are serious about learning wedding photography, check out the David Ziser video series. They are meaty and will give you the tools you need to produce portraits that LOOK GOOD. I am disappointed that Amazon would recommend this book ... it's one of the worst I've seen on the subject. It's also outdated. Digital is taking over wedding photography, and it talks about digital as if it is still in the distant future."},{"Title":"Innovative Techniques for Wedding Photography","review":"As a wedding coordinator, I love to work with photographers that use creative verses traditional photography. Anyone can do the same 'set' shot. This book explores the endless possiblities of depth when a photographer allows his creative side to flow.

Good book!"},{"Title":"Causality in Macroeconomics","review":"The basic fundamental flaw in this book is the author's failure to understand the subtle nuances contained in Keynes's critique of Tinbergen's econometric approach in the 1939-40 exchange in the Economic Journal between Keynes and Tinbergen.The omissions in Hoover's(H)exposition are obvious on pages 182-183-184 and in footnote 32 on page 182.Keynes is not just a percursor of Robert Lucas. The Lucas critique represents a small subset of Keynes's much,much larger critique of Tinbergen.Lucas restricts his critique to the effects of changes in government policy on impacting the changing expectations of private sector decision makers over time.Keynes's critique includes not only this variable but quite a few additional variables ,such as changes in technology and innovation,changes in consumer preferences,as well as changes in the existing institutional,political,social and international structure that creates new inductive patterns affecting expectations of the future.There is nothing in the Lucas critique that is new,original,innovative,novel or creative.Keynes gave a general and systematic criticism of Tinbergen which includes the criticisms of Lucas.A vastly superior book on the topics that H tried to cover is the book by Hugo Kuezenkamp,titled\\"Probability,Econometrics and Truth\\".It was published in 2001,the same year as the Hoover volume appeared.Not surprisingly,Hoover does not cite any of Keuzenkamp's published work.Keuzenkamp recognized that the \\"Lucas\\" critique had already been done by Keynes in 1939-1940.Nowhere in Keuzenkamp's book is the \\"Lucas\\"critique mentioned.The reason is that its already all contained in Keynes's analysis of 1939-1940 ,which follows directly from Keynes's analysis in Parts III and V of the TP.Hoover needs to read this book if he ever intends to revise his own book in a future edition."},{"Title":"Elegy (cuRRents)","review":"Elegy is a unique collaboration of the poetry of E.D. Blodgett and the black-and-white photography of Yukiko Onley, to create a wistful remembrance of loss, death, and transition. The gentle, reflective poetry quietly muses about the unknown, while the still images of natural beauty evoke a picturesque mood that complements the verses perfectly. Elegy is not subdivided into separate poems per se; it is rather one long poem of memory, wonder, longing, and healing. I dreamt that I was not / myself but had become / a young birch that grew // beside a quiet stream / I understood that I had been / reborn my old life was gone // the wind blew gently through / my leaves and when it rained / the rain was simply rain // and as a birch I had / no other dreams than those / of birches root and branch // but when the waters of / the stream entered me / I knew that it was you // and even born again / it seems that I am I / and you are always you // dreams have nothing to do / with who we are and will / remain birth after birth."},{"Title":"Question Of Being: Reversal Of Heidegger","review":"While I agree with the previous reviewer's assessment of Rosen's originality it seems that there is a bit of confusion which I think should be clarified. This book is a careful, profoundly original discussion of Heidegger's misunderstanding of Plato and how it fundamentally colored the rest of his thinking. In order to clarify where Heidegger went wrong Rosen deems it necessary to embark on lengthy, difficult discussions of Plato, Aristotle, Kant, and Nietzsche. He also deems it necessary to take an occasional swipe at some of Heidegger's less-talented progeny as they are oblivious to the very difficulties their misreadings imply and their influence within the Academy is undeniable. Furthermore, in the case of Plato, it becomes necessary to &quot;save&quot; the dialogues from their many positivist admirers and interpreters. The tone of the book is not so much polemical as exegetical, and it is studded with Rosen's subtle humor. [N.B. This may be the source of the previous reviewer's accusations of &quot;arrogance&quot; ie. the self-confidence of the knower as opposed to the tentative gropings of the blind.]Rosen's &quot;platonism&quot; is not the neo-platonism which has been handed down to us by Iamblichus, Albinus, and Plotinus but a substantially &quot;deeper&quot; platonism which does not assume that the dialogues were loaded with metaphysical dogma. To paraphrase Rosen, the history of &quot;platonism&quot; begins with Aristotle. From this standpoint the literary structure of the dialogues are as important as the allegedly &quot;technical&quot; discussions of &quot;doctrines&quot; which have been canonized in the secondary literature. Rosen's sympathies always lie with Plato but he is very careful to cite instances where he agrees with Heidegger, Nietzsche, or Kant. Indeed, his judicious and balanced discussions of these men lay bare the fundamental problems which each philosopher was attempting to confront and overcome. He does not, however, spare any of these men when their conclusions went awry. No sound writing should avoid this responsibility, though it can be done well or done poorly, depending upon the writer.The book engages in a lengthy discussion of Heidegger's misinterpretation of &quot;greek ontology&quot; and in particular with regards to Plato. Rosen demonstrates the untenability of Heidegger's claims about a &quot;general concept of being&quot; animating greek philosophy. He also engages in an original reading of the central section of Plato's &quot;Phaedo&quot; as a way of contrasting Plato's slippery discussion with Heidegger's static, professorial interpretation. In effect we are led to realize that Heidegger read into Plato (and Aristotle) what he wanted to in order to make certain claims about them later on. Rosen also spends a bit of time on Heidegger's own political nihilism which he perceives as being fundamentally grounded in his philosophy. Along the way Rosen points out how Nietzsche's claims to having overcome Plato are really just less coherent instances of a quasi-platonic teaching and that Kant's transcendental ego is fundamentally flawed.As the title of my review indicates, this book is not for the &quot;uninitiated.&quot; It delves very deeply into areas of philosophy which most will find baffling. If, however, you want a challenging, profound discussion of philosophy and some of its most famous practitioners this book will reward many a careful reading. It will remind the reader that philosophy isn't the logic-chopping or ethical blather which we hear so often today, but is, has been, and always will be about what is the best life and how can we lead it."},{"Title":"Question Of Being: Reversal Of Heidegger","review":"This book is vintage Rosen, which means any number of both good and bad things. Let's begin with the positive. Rosen is one of the most intelligent philosophy professors in America today. He is a maverick extremely well-grounded in the great works of the tradition, and a strong enough personality to cut his own path amidst the hundreds of slavish devotees of today's most fashionable philosophical currents. At times, he also displays a hilarious mastery of polemical writing techniques. Anyone reading his books is bound to end up with a renewed appreciation for the virtues of intellectual independence.But the bad is here as well. As Nietzsche once wrote of the work of Ernst Renan, there often seems to be more ambition than love of truth in these pages. Rosen is a committed if somewhat unorthodox Platonist, and he spends an awful lot of time writing books about authors for whom he has no philosophical sympathy whatsoever, Heidegger among them. While the final product is a commentary far more interesting than those of Heidegger's rather bland followers, Rosen's goal is ultimately nothing more than to cut Heidegger down to size. The result of this ought to be a fine defense of an ancient thinker against the premature revolutionary claims of 20th century philosophy, but the arrogance of the author's tone is simply that of a competitive academic defending his turf. The book also suffers from some stylistic awkwardness-- taken alone, many of its metaphors are quite striking, but the overall effect of the prose is choppy, even nervous.Rosen's works are among the most original philosophical writings being published today. Their petulant and often rambling style can be off-putting at first, but the patient reader will be amply repaid for her efforts."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"Egyptian Harmony is penultimate guide to harmony and universal geometry of nature and life, Moustafa's seventh book is a challenge to the reader requiring closer consideration than some of his earlier books. However, \`The Visual Music' is by no means beyond the realm of the novice and only the domain of the academic, rather Moustafa has thoroughly explored, researched, measured and compared a science that is universal and presented it for the aficionado of Egyptian knowledge that directly applies to every culture, being and facet of life. Harmony is presented throughout the book with reference to geometry and mathematics fundamental to our building blocks of life and of place and shown with reference through the eyes of the Ancient Egyptians who were the first culture to employ and recognize the subtle geometry of the universe. Divided into thirteen knots, taken from the Egyptian cord that presents twelve equal divisions (just as it is with stringed instruments) the book itself is organized in harmony relating to harmony. Moustafa takes off where Johannes Kepler could only boast and does so without academic or personal gain using reference and intrinsic sense of the individual to offer a book of learning. Number has meaning, and beyond the occult trappings of so-called Pythagorean number mysticism Moustafa elucidates an understanding and breadth of related meaning behind number including its allegorical representations within Egyptian art and architecture. This book is a must for any who are frustrated by the sacred sciences of harmony distilled and diluted from the original source - the Ancient Egyptians."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music presents the sacred geometry of ancient Egypt and its extensive applications in various aspects of that age old culture. Author and independent Egyptologist Moustafa Gadalla reveals that the ancient Egyptians had an incredible and comprehensive knowledge of harmonic proportion, sacred geometry, music, and number mysticism. This is manifested in the ancient texts, temples, tombs, and artwork. Readers will discover how in Egyptian philosophy and religion the Word (sound) that created the World (forms) was likewise transformed to visual music by the Egyptians into hieroglyphs, art, and architecture. Egyptian Harmony is the result of painstaking, original, iconoclastic, thought-provoking research and highly recommended reading for students of Egyptology, antiquarian metaphysics, and the non-specialist general reader with an interest in Egyptian culture, artifacts and archaeology."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"It is becoming more and more obvious - all the laws of nature and creation were known to the ancient Egyptians, and it is manifested in their monuments, texts, traditions, language, art, etc. Gadalla uses purely Egyptian examples to explain sacred geometry and number mysticism, in his usual reader-friendly fashion. Everything falls into place so naturally and simply and so POWERFULLY. It is awesome to see that these monuments, etc are actually constructed in such a manner that they generate and resonate cosmic energies."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"I've purchased several books by this author and so far Visual Music is the best. If you like math and geometry, you'll probably find this book offers an interesting viewpoint. The author relates basic numbers to their meaning in ancient Egyptian culture and mythology. Some of the ideas seem radical but do make sense. The author claims that the 3-4-5 triangle originated in Egypt, not in Greece with Pythagoras. Egyptian mythology is argued to be the source for the 'trinities' in Christianity. This book makes you rethink everything you've been taught in and about Western culture."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"Being a lover of music and an Engineer made this book very quickly become one of my favorites. Learning about the ancient egyptian knowledge of harmonic proportions and sacred geometry was very interesting to me and I'm sure anyone with a love, or at least even an intrest in either or both. In his reader friendly style, Gadalla shows, once again, the vast expertise of the ancient egyptians, in a logical and easy to understand manner. This book is a definite MUST READ."},{"Title":"Egyptian Harmony: The Visual Music","review":"I purchased a number of books by Moustafa Gadalla including this one. While I enjoyed reading them, I don't think that the assertions he makes qualify as proof. Yes, it is interesting that pyramids have a proportion equal to pi, but that could be simply because the architects used a circular cubit to roll out the dimensions; it does not mean that the egyptians knew the precise numerical value. Similarly the fact that the Greeks and the Egyptians both used the &quot;Golden Ratio&quot; does not mean that the Greeks stole the concept from the Egyptians as Mr. Gadalla asserts.As a scientist, Mr. Gadalla should know that the only absolute in science is data you can measure and results you can verify. Everything else is just theory that fits the data. But just because a theory fits the data does not mean that the theory is truth; it just means we have yet to find any conflicting data.To me, this book contains some intriguiing theories that appear to fit the historical data, but I would not presume to take this book as truth."},{"Title":"Front-Page Girls: Women Journalists in American Culture and Fiction, 1880-1930","review":"What should have been a lively history of pioneering women journalists read like the lackluster thesis it is.

The author presents very few actual examples of the works that defined these women and even less information regarding their backgrounds and histories.This book could provide the impetus for my dissertation on why academic writing should be relegated to textbooks and journals: the pedant always wants to 'instruct' in the abstract instead of 'guide' through the tangible."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"This book was recommended to me by a player who had improved rapidly by reading it.

I like the idea of one reviewer to check the variations on a computer like Fritz."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"My favorite books: books that cover \\"tactics and combinations\\" (the reason why most people lose or win at the non-master level), \\"traps\\" (tactics in the opening while learning your openings are important) and \\"building and executing attacks\\".This is one of the most detailed (I haven't seen a more detailed one) books on building (from the opening on into the middle game in many cases) and the executing your attack! Many important themes are covered - these are the most common ideas - and often much of the time it will show why an attack idea has a flaw in it!"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"John Nunn did more than just edit an algebraic notation of the classic: he's gone over Vukovic's original annotation with original analysis that shows that even for grandmasters &quot;chess can sometimes be hard.&quot; Vukovic's book is still there: he presents a comprehensive discussion of the art of attack, expounding the most basic principles and most complex forms of the attack on the castled king.

I can't say whether it's a good book because it is too advanced for me. I've been playing chess very seriously for about a year and think I'd probably be rated about 1300-1500 if I competed.Most of the chapters have a small amount of text offering general discussion and then proceed with about 4 or 5 complete games that contain good examples of the chapter's focus. I worked (yeah, that's the right word) through several of the chapters and more or less understood what the author was trying to convey. My abilities might have increased some, but only by a small amount compared to the number of hours that I spent on the book.I'm not convinced that it's possible to generalize knowledge from this format, but I guess I can't really say. Chess seems to be a lot more about 1st-hand experience than about vicarious learning. This kind of book is definitely in the second category.I think that players at about my skill level would be far better served with chess puzzle books. I bought a book called 303 Tactical Puzzles or something like that and saw an almost immediate gain in my effectiveness. After going through about 100 of the puzzles I began to recognize patterns and combinations dramatically better than before -- and this took about a week. I play most of my chess on Chessmaster 9000 in the rated games section and beat an opponent that was CM rated 1670 and absolutely slaughtered one rated about 1550. 1600 was the previous record for me, so I'd say that's a dramatic improvement. I could see the computer's 2 or 3 move tactical combinations from a mile away because of my improved pattern recognition. I spent about 3x that much time with Art of Attack in Chess and couldn't see much, if any improvement -- it's just too advanced for me to get much of anything out of it."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"Vukovic's work is not intended for the new player. A sound understanding of tactics and positional play is strongly recommended for the reader to be able to access the ideas he espouses. With that said, this book is the 'chess bible of attacking principles'! It will show you the key principles of attack, common and sophisticated patterns present in a successful attack, and it will enable you to develope and take advantage of these attacking positions in your own games. This is a book for serious studying, but the benefits that the average club player will receive from working through it are well worth the effort. No other book on attacking chess that I have read even comes close to being as good as this work. Nunn's conversion to algebaic notation is also a welcome relief as well. I suspect that this book is one of the 10 most instructive books on chess ever written!"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"Apparently, a lot of players weaker than I have found this book extremely helpful. I am a Class &quot;A&quot; player (1800+), and I found this book slow, tough going. It is quite helpful in teaching how to attack, but I personally found it difficult to see the forest for the trees: there are long variations in many positions, and often there are errors (duly pointed out by editor John Nunn). When the errors contradict the author's point, what are we to think? And even when they don't, the wealth of detail can often lead you away from the principles Vukovic is trying to illustrate. So, in my opinion, this is a good book, but to use it, one must:1- work hard at going through all the variations, and then try to correlate them with the points the author is trying to make;2- be willing to make allowances for the mistakes and errors."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"I almost feel intimidated trying to review this chess book and not being that much of a player myself. Still for the many amateur players who play chess to have fun (not to reach ratings, etc.) here are some thoughts on why this is a good book to own.Most chess books that I own delve very quickly into positional analysis and the virtues of having your piece X on square Y. I understand that this is a vital part of modern chess and that most games on higher level are probably won by positional play. This book however, takes a different approach - it systematically explores the most fun concept of all - how to mate the king. One after another, the book develops outrageous strategies for preparing mating nets, sacrificing pieces, etc. and presents the reader with one amazing attack after another. I thought it was tons of fun after all the positional stuff. The analysis of classic games by Alekhine and Capablanca in the context of how to attack a castled king, uncastled king, focal points ofthe attack, piece sacrifices, etc. changed my play a lot.As a result of a series of books I have studied, my play was slowly becoming very boring to myself. I spent most of my time before the endgame trying to develop a particular position on the board and endlessly trying to calculate if the opponents moves are not leading to some attacking combination that would disrupt my nice positional setup. I probably won more games that way than I do now but it was boring. Now I boldly attack whenever I see an opportunity and although I loose more often I have played some games I am really proud of.I am no chessmaster and my interpretation of the approach of this book versus other books is probably not very educated. But still, this was a lot of fun for me. Try it."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"As you can quickly realize by reading the other reviews about this book, it is one of the best books ever written on attacking chess. Nevertheless, I disagree with the people that claims that this is the first instruction book you should get. I would recommend those players with a rating below 1600 to go through other more basic tactics books first. A good book for this is Chess Tactics for the Tournament Player by Alburt and Palatnik. Once you master the basic tactics the Art of Attack in Chess will put you through to the next level.You will also love this book if you are one of those players that was disappointed after trying to study Think Like a Grandmaster by Kotov and realized that it was way too complicated for you.Hope this helps!"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"This is a great read to get a solid grounding in the entire attacking process. This is coming from a 1300 player who took about two and a half years (off and on) to trudge through this one. Even though it might be a lot more helpful to higher-rated players, if you're willing to tackle it, I believe you will benefit. Just having concepts crucial to any attack such as focal-points, mating patterns, and preconditions for an attack explained has broadened my idea of what an attack is and how difficult it is to undertake correctly. The chapter on the classic bishop sacrifice was one of my favorites. Vukovic gives the reader a strong guide as to when the sac works and when it doesn't with clear examples and ideas. This was an idea I had not been aware of and now I'm better prepared not only to defend against it, but also to carry it out. There were many parts of the book that I did not fully grasp, particularly the later chapters (Defending Against the Attack on the Castled King and The Phases of the Attack on the Castled King). Even so it was an introduction to the depth that one needs to go to successfully attack at the highest levels of chess. I would recommend this book to anybody who loves chess, is aggressive over-the-board and is willing to put in some hard work."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"I like to call this book a work on positional tactics. If tactics are the loops, then this book is the thread. He dissects the positional aspects of tactics during an attack. For example, when breaking down a certain type of attack he'll discuss first the squares that will be important and then move in to how the attacker begins to manipulate control of these squares. In other words he talks about all the things that happen before a tactical shot: how a player sets up for them, even going into conditions (which happen QUITE OFTEN in real games) for which tactical set ups can become possible. He outlines basic positional conditions that will make the success of an attack more likely. Ever feel like a virgin in bed when it comes to an attacking position? This book walks you through step by step how an attack is conducted. And lastly he covers some extremely common attacking positions that will greatly expand both your tactical AND positional vision.Some great advice I've gleamed from this book: the power of a pawn on e5, the advantage of a closed center during an attack, great quiet moves (taking away squares from the king, connecting the back rank), anticipating the king's escape (and cutting him off), the tempo of an attack, thematic tactical shots. All of which cannot be learned very easily from just a book on tactics. However, tactics are the bedrock of everything below 1800.And lastly, this book must actually be read and practiced for it to be useful. I know it sounds obvious but I swear people review things without even using it."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"I agree with the reviewers before me who said that this is a great book, but I don't agree that one has to be a strong player to find it useful or worthwhile. I found it increased my enjoyment of the game tremendously and I am NOT a very strong player - not yet at any rate. To anyone who is afraid to launch a sacrificial attack on the opposing king without calculating it to the end - please read this book."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"John Nunn did more than just edit an algebraic notation of the classic: he's gone over Vukovic's original annotation with original analysis that shows that even for grandmasters \\"chess can sometimes be hard.\\" Vukovic's book is still there: he presents a comprehensive discussion of the art of attack, expounding the most basic principles and most complex forms of the attack on the castled king.

Vukovic tried to summarize why some attacks work and some don't. He provided some concrete evidences where the attack is successful and some where the intuition takes a major role. Without intuition and imagination, I doubt we have many masterpieces from Tal, Fischer, Kasparov or Alekhine.When we say \\"attack\\", the modern chess has two main goals: attacking the King and attacking a weakness (piece or square). Vukovic is all about the first goal. The modern chess somehow inter-connects the two goals, the attacker uses one goal to distract the defender's attention in order to start the other, and vice versa. The attack in the enemy King is more exciting, because checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess. A win is a win, but a direct attack on the King (together with some pretty sacrifice) seems like a slam-dunk while winning materially with a pawn promotion seems like a lay-up. Vukovic's writing was very detailed and authoritative. He gave some guidelines on how to attack an uncastled King as well as a castled King. With each King's position, he showed some weaknesses for where the attacker to aim at.The chapter about the 'classic' bishop sacrifice saved me a game. I played with the black pieces against a strong player. I had two Knights on d7 and e7 in some French Defense. Suddenly I saw my opponent lifted his King Bishop from d3 and slammed hard into my h7 Pawn (I had castled King-side). I was careful to preserve my two Knights during the game (I was lucky to scan thru Vukovic's book before). However, I was shocked when I saw he did such a sacrifice. It took me 5 minutes to double-check my defense; I could not see the forced mate. Finally, I put my reputation on the line (often I resign when the situation is hopeless or checkmate is foreseeable) to play on, and planned to turn down the King when a mate-in-three or four became obvious. I just wanted him to show me the ($$$) checkmate. There was no mate. With a trade-up to my advantage, a Bishop for a pawn (lost at h7), my opponent lost in a late middle game when my major pieces coming down to his King-castle. A few weeks later, my opponent showed his recent game with the 'classic\\" bishop sacrifice, and this time his sacrifice worked!!! So the knowledge on this 'sac' helped me save our game and also helped my opponent to sharpen his tactics for the Kingside attack. The story didn't end here. About two years later, I did the same 'classic' bishop sac and due to my lack of calculation depth I messed up the order of the Queen, Bishop and Pawn moves I lost the game. When I got home, entering the move sequence back into my CM8000 and it showed me that the sac was sound, just I didn't follow thru correctly.When I play a weaker player (about 200-point difference), when there is a decision about attacking a weakness or a King, no doubt that attacking the King is the chosen one. A few pawns sac or a piece sac to open his Castle is not a difficult choice. An attack on a weakness (square or piece), the opponent can ignore it; but an attack on his King always catches his attention, and the reply is almost forced. Often the persistent attack prevails.One time my opponent, playing white, early in the opening, maneuvered his Queen to d2 (blocking his QB) and g5 in order to steal my g7 pawn; and he challenged me to give up that pawn. He made up his mind to win that pawn; therefore I swung my QN to prepare an attack on the Queenside (as a decoy). After capturing the g7-pawn, he retreated his Queen back to d2 and castled Kingside (naturally). As soon as he castled Kingside, I castled Queenside and brought both Rooks to the g-file and attacked his King, sacrificing another pawn along the way. His QB blocked by his Queen could not help. He gave up instead of exchanging his Queen for a Knight and a Rook.This proves the above assumption that an attack on the King seems more powerful than an attack somewhere else. Vukovic's book shows how to conduct an exciting attack on the enemy King. So far, examples on the \\"classic' Bishop sac have given me some good experience. The attack on the castled King also works for me, and against me! There were quite a few times my opponents (at least two) know that I automatically castled Kingside, especially with black pieces. They prepared the attack with pawns to h4 and/or g4. As soon as I castled K-side, they castled Q-side or lifted the King to 2nd rank, and then the Q-Rook swung over to K-side to work in unison with other Rook. My King hit the dust soon afterward. And of course I too had been on either side of an \\"unbearable\\" attack on the uncastled King.Vukovic gave many many more examples of the 'slam-dunk' King-attack.P.S.: I can't depart if not mentioning: Yes, I have been also on either side of a \\"horrible\\" Dragon Sicilian, which Vukovic showed in chapter 'the attack on the fianchettoed castling position'. Chess is a game of give-and-take, however checkmate is better to give than to take... ;-)"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"This book will strenghten your play bigtime.

This was a very gutsy read, but it carries only one huge flaw. Vukovic doesn't seem to \\"get\\" the notion that you have to \\"Divide and Rule.\\" You can't go all \\"Bobby Fischer\\" with forced trades against modern gambits and come out positionally ahead. The art of attck is really to draw an opponents resources wide after the opening song and dance and then feign to pin and pick off piece by piece while looking to stengthen positionally or surprise checkmate with a quick combination blow.

This is a great book and will teach you everything you need to know on attacking. Whether it be attacking the un-castled king, castled king, fianchettoed castled king, it has it all! The section about the classic bishop sacrifice is amazing. This book also teaches a lot about castling. Whether you should castle king side or queen side, etc. The book is also fluttered with examples. Probably around 150-200. Some are full games (!) and others are just excerpts. I currently own the new edition that was edited by John Nunn. He went over all of Vukovi old annotations and added comments where he thought it was appropriate. He also changed the whole thing into Algebraic Notation and added 128 extra diagrams. If I had the old version of this book, the rating would probably be like a 7 or an 8. But this book still has a lot of good information. It is kind of advanced though, so I don't recommend it to beginners. Also once you own this book you must go over all the examples. It'll take some time, but it'll be worth it. I also suggest rereading this book from time to time (after having read more books of coarse). This will help clarify your understanding and help you remember what to do in certain situations. This book is relatively expensive considering what a small book it is ($ is what's printed on the book).

When Vukovic introduced this book as his attempt to do so and to help one derive aesthetic satisfaction from the attacking technique in chess, I was sold and so was the book. Though written forty years ago, this book has not been surpassed in its substance and comprehensiveness. Vukovic delivered on his promise and then some.At the end of the book, he stated the principle that fascinates me the most thus: \\"... by these methods they, [Alekhine and Capablanca], discovered moves which fulfill the chief principle of the attack on the castled king, namely, obtaining the maximum preconditions for an attack with the minimum of commitment.\\" To obtain a thorough understanding of this principle, one must study this book closely probably several times. This is not a \\"how to beat your dog at chess in nine moves\\" book but an \\"apply elbow grease and begin playing exciting chess for the rest of your life\\" book. You must pay to play and there is no getting around that.The growing popularity of this style of play has unleashed a proliferation of chess software on \\"attacking chess\\" - by say Alexander Bangiev and Jacob Aagaard, to name just two authors. Kindly note that Vukovic stated flatly that this method is founded on exact positional play so don't throw away Nimzowitsch's book, \\"My System,\\" or the like, just yet. Furthermore, this book is not just the deployment of ingenious tactical maneuvers and cliffhanging combinations - a quote attributed to Rudolf Spielmann says it all: \\"I can see Alekhine's combinations as well as he can, I just can't get his positions.\\" This book is about getting those positions.Several reviewers have listed the titles of the chapters in the book so there is no point rehashing them except to note that the discussion on \\"focal points\\" for attack -- weak squares in the vicinity of the king - is most instructive. For completeness, Vukovic did not forget one, were one to find oneself on the wrong end of the attack - he threw in an even longer chapter on how to attempt to ward off these kinds of attacks. This book was very well-conceived and presented with lots of complete games to illustrate the genesis and culmination of these creative attacks. While the book concentrates on direct attacks on the king, the author asserts that they are frequently combined with other attacks latent in the position. All told, a chess-savvy present-day hipster would conclude that, \\"this book rocks!\\"I beg to differ with some of the reviewers who awarded few stars to this book because there remain a few mistakes in analysis here and there. Chess players owe GM John Nunn our gratitude for \`editing' the formerly ponderous language of the book but more so for drastically emending most of the erring analysis. I concur fully with GM Nunn's, final assessment of this classic: \\"... it is Vukovic's general principles which will prove of most value to the practical player, and here there can be no argument about the enduring quality of his work.\\" Bravo!"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"This book reminds you that the ultimate focus of the game is to attack the opponents king, and helps you to understand how that can come about in the middle game.Previously once getting past the opening, it was hard for me to come up with appropriate plans to finish the game up, mostly trying to get small advantages and hopefully trade off pieces to have a superior endgame.

The chapters on sacrifices and focal points taught me to think about how to weaken a position - after all, giving all your pieces away is fine if the game is then going to be over, a simple concept, but taking that risk is considered a lot less than it should be, at least in beginner-intermediate chess which is where I'm at right now. The chapters on attacking with pawns were especially useful as well.This is one of the best books I've studied on chess, and in my opinion, it's a must for everyone."},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"What I mean by \\"Good Concepts\\" and \\"Poor Execution\\" is that this book shows the ideas well, but by golly there are some serious, serious mistakes in the detailed analysis. My Fritz Computer showed, many, many mistakes and I doubled checked myself.I wish that the author had \\"computer\\" checked his analysis before writing this book before having so many mistakes. It certainly needs serious updating in the analysis and the openings.But, but - the concepts behind the sacrifices and attacks are instructive!

The respond I got from a host of master level chess players was The Art of Attack in Chess. Since reading this book's first three chapters alone I have gain over 400 points in my tournament play. I would recomend this book to anyone interested in improving their chess strength to expert level and beyond.

I have to say that i always had a defficiencies in this topic, and from the start of this book i found things that made me feel that until now, i wasn't a complete player. I'm sure that anyone who reads this material will vastly improve in his or her attack properties and probably will change his or her way of general playing.In chess, the checkmate is the objective, so, if somebody not just read, but study this wonderful book, wiil be transformed in a really agressive player, capable of destroy any defense to beat any opponent. A last comment is that, unlike other chess books, this one brings REAL POSITIONS on it's diagrams, positions wich really could be found or obtainable on anyone's games!!!.

I've only read this one and Larry Christiansen's - Rocking the Ramparts :-) Though they are similar in attacking principles, the layout and organization is much better in Vukovic's book.

Run these games through Fritz (Chessbase) for example (a .CBF format of the games found in this book is available at the Ossimitz Chess page at the fortunecity website) and almost on every third page a variation of Vukovic's will be in error; some of the errors allow one side to escape with a draw instead of a forced win. GM John Nunn has done a good job with footnotes pointing out a lot of these mistakesAnother annoying thing is that supposedly outstanding (!) moves are not the best move (Fritz or any computer program will point this out in 'watch mode'). So if you are trying to guess the move, sometimes you will find yourself 'stumped' until you realize there is no 'best' move.That said, I still like this book because it shows how to win in OTB play against humans using aggresive play, where sometimes a shock move is useful (GM Tal proved this holds).I am a expert player. If you are a beginner some of the games here will 'shock' you since they seem to lose material, until the lines are played out.All in all a useful book, I also like for tactics Averback's Tactics book (if you can find it)"},{"Title":"The art of attack in chess (Pergamon international library of science, technology, engineering, and social studies)","review":"This book is a masterpiece.

Guss. 195 pp. North point Press, 1980.I first learned of this book from a review by John Updike, 'Happy on Nono despite Odosha,' which was reprinted in his 'Hugging the Shore' (Penguin Books, 1983, pp.669-75). Normally I don't read much anthropology, and have no particular interest in myths, but Updike's was such an excellent review and got me so excited about this book that I decided to get a copy. It turned out to be the most fascinating compilation of myth I've ever run into, and one with a significant difference.Rather than being recast in the scholarly prose of your standard anthropologist, the Watunna Creation stories are given to us as they issued from the mouths of the Makiritare themselves, a tribe which lives in the mountainous regions of the upper Orinoco in Southern Venezuela. They were pieced together by French ethnographer, Marc Civrieux, who spent over twenty years visiting the villages of the Makiritare and listening to their vivid and moving myths of the world's creation, and the role their tribe played tribe within it.The word 'myth' is, of course, a convenient catch-all. In fact it explains nothing. All it does is serve to excuse us from further thought, as does the word 'instinct,' a word which really refers to a kind of intelligence that we do not understand at all. But if even a tiny fraction of what the Makiritare are saying is true - if in fact these stories are not myth, but, as they themselves firmly believe, real history - it would indicate a knowledge of human history that reaches back in time for tens and perhaps even hundreds of thousands of years.But whether 'myth' or 'history,' the Watunna stories are fascinating, and they have been beautifully rendered into English by David M. Guss. Here are a few lines from the opening of the book:&quot;There was Kahuna, the Sky Place. The Kahuhana lived there just like now. They're good, wise people. And they were in the beginning too. They never died. There was no sickness, no evil, no war. The whole world was Sky. No one worked. No one looked for food. Food was always there, ready. // There were no animals, no demons, no clouds, no winds. In the highest sky was Wanadi, just like now. He gave his light to the people. . . .&quot; (page 21).Besides a Translator's Preface, and a 19-page Introduction on the history of the Makiritare and the nature of their Watunna, which in its highest form is communicated from the spirit world in a secret language, and is heard only by initiates while in trance, the book also contains a section of eight interesting photographs of the Makiritare people, a detailed 20-page glossary, and two maps. The book, as is customary with North Point Press, is well-printed on excellent paper, stitched, and bound in a glossy wrapper.If you're looking for something both different and utterly compelling, and if I haven't succeeded in convincing you, check out John Updike's review, because I'm pretty sure he will. He certainly convinced me, and he was right!"},{"Title":"Watunna: An Orinoco Creation Cycle","review":"This book examines and coveys the creation tales of the Watunna tribe located in tropical rain forest of Venezuela as collected over 15 years by the author. The stories and the descriptions of the story weavers are spell binding. One of the more interesting books I have ever read! See if you can find the connections and similarities between the creation stories of your people and the Watunna!"},{"Title":"Watunna: An Orinoco Creation Cycle","review":"This book was excellent! If every course I took had me reading a book like this, my grades would be pristine. The first few pages of the book are completely boring, but if you just skip the intro and go right into the folklore you will not be able to stop reading this book. Once you're done with the book you'll actually want to read the intro to learn about the people. My teacher told us this was a great book to curl up on a lazy afternoon and drink tea while reading...we all laughed at her...but she was not kidding. I will keep this book forever and re-read it regularly, it's great."},{"Title":"Community Analysis and Planning Techniques","review":"Richard Klosterman's Community Analysis and Planning Techniques is a poor example of how Professional Planners conduct analysis. Besides being overly wordy and perhaps never to the point, this book depicts quanitative analysis backwards. The combination of Statistical methods, Data processing, Urban economics gets lost in translation and is dated. Stay away from this book unless you are a helpless victim to being taught by Prof. Klosterman - I would imagine this is required material for his classes; and if that is the reason why you need to purchase this book, I feel sorry for you."},{"Title":"Community Analysis and Planning Techniques","review":"This is a one-stop-shop how-to for projecting population and employment figures, as well as developing location quotients. This is a great resource for city planners and those interested in detailed location analysis. It explains how population and employment projections are made as well as what methods are appropriate and when they should be used, so as not to misrepresent data. Though some of the text itself may be a bit technical from time to time, the mathematics are sound and chart examples are very easy to understand. The population projections, cohort population projections, and employment projection techniques were very easy recreate on spreadsheets with own data. This is a useful reference for any planning office."},{"Title":"Community Analysis and Planning Techniques","review":"This text is a must for the bookshelf of anybody wanting to understand economic projections, population projections, and other social science projection techniques.

This is one of the best on this sub-phenomenon of millennialism and violence. It has some very helpful theoretical/conceptual discussions by some of the big names in the field, along with a large number of manageable case studies, spanning much of recent history. The obvious ones are there--Branch Davidians, Aum Shinrikyo, Peoples Temple--as well as some less likely topics like Nazism and Russian Old Believers. For compact discussions of a wide array of movements set in a good organizational and analytical framework, this is an excellent offering."},{"Title":"The Omega Solution: Unleash the Amazing, Scientifically Based Healing Power of Omega-3 & -6 Fatty Acids","review":"Dr. Goodman's complete and thorough review of essential fatty acids is a must have for any holistic practitioners library. He evaluates the research in a clear, concise manner laying out the truth about the effectiveness of fatty acids. His clinical anecdotes are helpful for understanding how EFA's can be helpful in practice or as a layperson. Dr. Goodman describes how EFA's are useful for conditions that many people may not even know about. I was impressed with this book and I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in using natural medicine to promote better health and prevent disease."},{"Title":"The Omega Solution: Unleash the Amazing, Scientifically Based Healing Power of Omega-3 & -6 Fatty Acids","review":"I bought this book with a lot of expectations as I want to know more about the balance between Omega 3 and Omega 6 as it seems quite important for one's wellbeing but I was quite disappointed. I won't say that it hasn't some interesting facts but in the whole I found it quite boring and giving advice I don't think is wise, like telling you that saturated fats are bad, he also advises Canola oil but according to what I have been reading this oil seems not to be healthy at all, as well as corn, safflower and soybean oil.He is also very much on lowering cholesterol and bad and good cholesterol while all cholesterol seems to be very important for the human body. He does mention that in normal amounts cholesterol is important but what are normal amounts? Isn't what is considered normal nowadays set by the Pharmaceutical Industry in order to make money?As far as whether fish oils are good for the health or not I don't know, some experts say that they are very important, others say that you shouldn't even touch them.... all very confusing. He also let's himself be guided by the Food Guide Pyramid which doesn't seem the best thing as far as nutrition goes. But well, this book is from 2001, that is maybe the problem!Shopping for wild fish is indeed a great advice but here in Europe we can't buy many kinds of wild fish anymore. No salmon for example, only farmed.He also advises soy products which we now know can harm at least those who rely heavily on them, especially unfermented soy products.I also found it funny that although the author knew of cases treated successfully with EFA's he seems only to accept the evidence of that after being tested scientifically. In my opinion you can't test everything scientifically so in cases you know that there is no harm and other people had good results why not try and add your positive or negative experience to the existing ones? You can't always be waiting for millions to be available, many years of studies and many people? Anyway, it seems that at least in 2001 the jury was not yet out on whether EFA's are good for the health or not and what they could treat so most of the studies he talks about have no practical value!I have a lot more question marks regarding this book but let me just say that I will look for some other way to get the information I need and I won't buy a health book which is 9 years old again!"},{"Title":"How to Discipline Your Six To Twelve Year Old Without Losing Your Mind","review":"I highly recommend this book for any parent who wishes to delve deep within the psyche of their child. There is a wealth of material here that can be gleaned and utilized in order to make your life, and your child's, more comfortable and relaxed. I have used many techniques in the book already, and they do work! Overall, I rate this book superb and I will continue to learn and use the techniques outlined in order to have a stable, respectful and happy household."},{"Title":"How to Discipline Your Six To Twelve Year Old Without Losing Your Mind","review":"Finally someone has written a book that makes sense. My 9 year old is a good kid with some issues on additude! This was the book to make the difference! She wines I calmly state the house rules and give her a chore to complete! I am no longer the bad mom....She does a wrong! I calmly state her punishment and she now listens. I am sticking to it and it is working! WOW! I recommend this book to anyone that has children and to the teachers out there that teach our children! If we all ban together maybe we can change the meanness out in the world with the next generation! I know mine has changed!The best thing is now she wants to keep her room clean and her responsibilities done because she saw how much fun she could really have! and all the time she wasted by not doing her responsibilities!"},{"Title":"How to Discipline Your Six To Twelve Year Old Without Losing Your Mind","review":"I'm kindof a parenting book junkie. I have run acrossed a lot of them and I can't say that I always agree with the author's viewpoint. This book is really great because it brackets out behaviors with age groups and sort of helps the parent understand the child without taking things so personally. It's a great read. I would suggest it to any parent."},{"Title":"How to Discipline Your Six To Twelve Year Old Without Losing Your Mind","review":"Not only is this book in the most boring format and easy to put down, I could have written this book in 2 chapters. The same solutions are brought into every problem. The advice is GOOD, I am not saying it isn't, and most would benefit from reading this book. (If you can stick to reading it) But every chapter is filled with the same thing, build your child up or don't put up with their bad behavior. To me that is common knowledge that many parents don't follow through with. This is not groundbreaking theory. Every chapter has the same suggestion, if you don't do (whatever the misbehavior is) then you will do extra chores for me. And poof! Like magic, the child just changes in 2 days to an angel! Get real, we wouldn't need books like this if we could change our kids behavior this quickly. I didn't look closely enough when I was ordering this book to see that these were the authors of &quot;How to Discipline Your Children Without Spanking&quot;. Spare the rod, spoil the child! Sometimes a spanking is a way to let your child know they messed up and you aren't going to put up with the behavior. This gets their attention and after they calm down you can talk about things. Spanking definately isn't the answer in ALL instances. I am a firm believer that only if the child knows a rule (One that is important, not just leaving the tennis shoes in the living room) and decides to break it, then a spanking is in order.I don't forsee buying any more books from these authors, as I am not interested in reading what I already know."},{"Title":"Fire & Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860","review":"I have long been a military history buff. A few years ago the Army sent me and my family to Germany for three years - which was a dream come true. While there I toured several of the old forts built during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. It's embarressing, but I the military history enthusiast knew very little about these forts; the engineering, the purposes behind their construction, how the sieges were conducted, nothing. I realized that my knowledge of European warfare effectively ended in the middle of the fifteen hundreds and didn't resume until the mid - eighteen hundreds. The old fortresses fascinated me, thanks in a large part to the fact that I couldn't dechipher the layout of the walls. Centuries of vegetation, vandalism, urban growth, and decay had rendered many of the forts almost non-exsistent. Fire and Stone has helped to correct much of this. It is definitely a technical work and one written more for specialists then the general reader. But it never ascends to a level where the amatuer is simply left in the dirt. It has a wealth of drawings and diagrams, photographs, and schematics. The captions are well written and extremely helpful. There is also a very complete glossary at the back of the book which is not only a necessity but a god send. All to often it seems that authors forget such little details. Without the glossary this book would be impossible to follow. Numerous French, Latin, German, and Spanish terms for the various fortifications and their appendages are used, sometimes different names for the same structure are used! The glossary is an absolute must. The second half of the book is concerns the conduct of a siege for both the besieger and the besieged. Like the first half this part also shows the same attention to detail but never forgets the reader. All in all I have to give this book very high marks. Though it appeals only to a small sector of history buffs I recommend it. And if you have ever visited some of the old forts in Canada, such as Fort Henry in Kingston, Ontario, and marveled at the old fortress and its layout this book just might be for you as well."},{"Title":"Fire & Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860","review":"I felt comelled to write a review after seeing the one-star review. I just finished reading this book. I'm habituated to highlighting things of interest as I read, and in the course of reading this I went through two or three markers. Every paragraph is revealing, and the book is festooned with contemporary illustrations, many by the great Vauban himself. If you are a lazy reader you won't like this book - it requires a certain amount of thought as you read since it presents a vast amount of technical detail - how the classic artillery fortress was built, the rationale behind its form, and, in great detail, how it was attacked and subdued. If you love to learn and are willing to invest a little thought you will treasure this book. I can't imagine a better presentation of the subject."},{"Title":"Fire & Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860","review":"I have the original edition of Fire and Stone on my shelf, and am happy to see it in print again so those I recommend it to can actually get it! If you are interested in fortifications of this era, this is an excellent place to start. The overall view of European fortification theory and practice provides a good background for understanding the forts we see in North America, as well as other locations around the world from the age of European colonization. It has a good general focus on the era, not too wide or too narrow. If you are just interested in medieval castles or the Maginot Line, you will want something else, but you might enjoy this book anyway! I find any Christopher Duffy book enjoyable to read, with a good mix of general information, period quotation, anecdotes, and illustration."},{"Title":"Fire & Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860","review":"The title is a bit misleading, in that the concentration of the work is more on 17th and 18th (Duffy's specialty) centuries of European siege warfare, with relatively little on the 19th century, while Duffy reaches back to the end of 16th century for some examples. This is a very minor quibble, though. The book demands attentive reading, strictly as a matter of the technical vocabulary and the difficulty of describing architectural and geometric concepts in text, not due to the author's style, which is pleasant, verging on breezy. Additionally, there is a very good glossary and a profusion of illustrations by which the terms and concepts are illustrated. Highly recommended, especially at the current price of $9.99."},{"Title":"Fire & Stone: The Science of Fortress Warfare, 1660-1860","review":"I don't know what that dude is talking about. This book is really boring. You have to read on and on and on to learn how things were done and why. The information is not well organized and it appears that alot of the same things are said over and over again, just worded different. Also, it appears to follow the career of a particular castle builder, and doesn't really encompass the broader spectrum of castle/fort building. This should include types of seige warfare, the living conditions possible and common to the inhabitants, interior designs, and so on. I would think these would be included in a book of the same size as this one. But it really dwells on why castles/ forts were built. I can say it right now in less than 5 freakin' chapters, TO KEEP PEOPLE OUT!The text has a little (very little) valuable or awe inspiring information, and alot of filler. There are many more books out there that detail a greater time period with better information and better pictures. I don't know them off hand, but I recommend you put this book down and go look for them. Sorry Duffy."},{"Title":"The Playboy's Proposition (Australian Playboys) (Harlequin Presents, 2128)","review":"The story between Michele and Tyler was somehow predictable to me. Michele had known Tyler Garrison since her days at university. They were good sparring partners, always arguing. But Michele was in love with Kevin. Michele had an on-again-off-again relationship with Kevin, another friend of theirs. Kevin decides to get married without telling Michele, to another girl named Danni. Michele is heartbroken. Tyler steps in to save the day. They pretend to have a relationship going to show Kevin that Michele doesn't care that he married someone else. Now Tyler was supposed to be this big playboy, but to me it didn't really seem like he was. He didn't act all playboyish, he just seemed to really care about Michele, who was oblivious of him. They get a relationship going and Michele falls in love with Tyler. Tyler has been in love with Michele since university. He doubts her love for him and then he catches her innocently kissing Kevin. It all turned out good in the end, and it was a fast read. Not the best Miranda Lee book I've read, but I am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"Title":"The Playboy's Proposition (Australian Playboys) (Harlequin Presents, 2128)","review":"Miranda Lee is one of my favorite writers and always has fast paced, believable stories. I've read all of her books and this is one of the best. Tyler is the ultimate playboy, but has always pined for the girl he couldn't have.

With the little touches and those special looks but Michele can't forget that Tyler is the most eligible playboy, and there's no way he'd truly want her...could he?THE PLAYBOY'S PROPOSITION is the first of &quot;The Australian Playboys&quot; series. I liked the story because it had strong characters, but I thought the resolution was a little bit too icky. One thing I liked was how Michele and Tyler talked to each other.

Michele stays with her on-again-off-again boyfriend for ten years even though he's a self-center jerk. He's emotionally abusive to her throughout their time together and she just stays with him and takes it. Finally he leaves her for good and marries a different woman then she's all heartbroken and feeling sorry for herself. I could tell right from the start that I probably wouldn't like the heroine and I was right. Tyler, the hero, has been friends with Michele and her ex since the went to university together ten years ago. He's in love her and has been for years, Michele treats him like garbage and yet her keeps coming back for more. She has a giant chip on her shoulder about Tyler being rich while she isn't, she brings it up all the time. He tries to show her through his actions that he cares about her unlike her ex and that he'll be there for her. Tyler is a likable character, if a little bit of a masochist where Michele is concerned. He should have told her a long time ago how he felt about her and let the cards fall where they may.One of the few times I actually preferred the hero to the heroine. She was a doormat where her ex was concerned but she didn't mind being a jerk to Tyler over the years. I wouldn't read this book again and I definitely wouldn't recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"The Playboy's Proposition (Australian Playboys) (Harlequin Presents, 2128)","review":"The first time I read this it was a friends copy and I have been looking for my own copy because it stuck with me.Michelle, still in love with her ex who is now engaged to be married.

For those not aware, Moustafa is biased by neither Abrahamic religion nor Academic status, which in the study of ancient lands and its peoples puts him in the small minority, and as such his highlighting of the misdeeds these groups is laid clearly and factually with well documented research and common sense. There are those who consider his work controversial and Egyptian Mystics is not a book to placate history from an Abrahamized outlook, rather it is a document that shows a breathing culture who have maintained traditions, albeit surreptitiously, for thousands of years and more.As with all of Moustafa&#65533;s books published through the Tehuti Research Foundation, Egyptian Mystics shows a consistency in its presentation; well-bound for a softcover, B5 of size, a detailed table of contents (broken into four parts with appendices), and an introductory preface, terminology, chronology of the Egyptian Dynasties and a map of Egypt. The text is clear and easy to read with consistent use of fonts to separate sources both indigenous and foreign beyond the textual body that is displayed in bite-sized paragraphs.Part 1, The Hidden Treasure; this short, two chapter section begins by introducing the main points of the entire book showing the two paths of world spirituality, those following the dogmatic religions of a personal god and that of the mystics. Sufism is explained, its origin in Egypt and how it exists in its most widely followed path to date with clear facts that tie with the earlier introduction of mysticism. The concept of man and &#65533;god&#65533; is explored deeper with regard to union between the two as the essential and ongoing ingredient in the path of mysticism.Part 2, Transformation from Dust to Gold; interpreted/inherited and used in hermetic and philosophical practices throughout the world. Alchemy is the first chapter and Moustafa explores the spiritual process of transformation of man in that journey of purification with fundamentals of Egyptian mysticism that have multi-layered meaning and representation, rather than just the sheer act alone; words as symbols are presented. Links along this journey are detailed with rich information on the aspirant&#65533;s need for a guide. The purification process is examined deeply with page after page of the journey to cleanse body and mind in preparation for further &#65533;enlightenment&#65533;; breathing, moral fundaments, movements, cleanliness, etc. Finally, mysticism is shown less a dogmatic cult following a communal god than a personal journey of understanding nature and of the role of the individual/microcosm to the macrocosm, the realized world and beyond, through knowledge acquired in spiritual revelation by way of being guided along this path of purification. The Egyptian principles of Ka and Ba and their interrelation are examined specifically with their union or marriage of dualities into the whole. Those that have undergone this process are revered in shrines by the Egyptians with a clear spiritual backbone that is not just superstition but a process of deep and tacit understanding.Part 3, The Public Visitation Fairs; in this part a vibrant and florescent social culture is exampled following the fundaments of spirituality through tradition. The concept of nature as being cyclical, whether by seasons or the shift of planets is a given but this is nowhere more celebrated by the Egyptians who still continue rituals to remember the roles and that of humankind in the cycle. Mouleds, the annual festivals of renewal, are described in detail, not just the dates, locations, and practices but also of the ritualistic symbolism inherent. Lent, Easter, and other inherited traditions by the Abrahamic religions are shown in their full and continued force from their origin in Egypt, with strong meaning underpinning the date&#65533;s central to their whole tradition of renewal. Beyond symbolism the structure of the Mouleds is explained in day by day process, from the visitation of families to shrines to offerings of food. These traditions are not just purported in the modern sense but are accompanied by depictions of scenes taken from ancient Egyptian buildings.Part 4, Come One Come All; explores the mystical fellowships and their structure both in the material and spiritual senses. Moustafa breaks down organization, ethics, spiritual beliefs, roles in society for the reader leaving no room for a secretive or cabalistic personification of a group locked steadfast to their silence and elitism, pointing out the equality of man and women therein. The analogy of Auset (Isis) is explored from its representation in the story of her and Ausar (Osiris) as an ideal model of the philosophical tradition, using aphorisms and examples that show the path one must take if one seeks a path of enlightenment and as example of general conduct of any moral and honest being.The Appendices, a fairly new addition to several of Moustafa&#65533;s latest books consists of nearly another entire part of information covering; Miscellaneous Sufi Terms and their Ancient Egyptian Roots (fundamental symbolism of the Ancient Egyptians is explained with example of Sufism today), Sleeping with the Enemy (surviving Islam), Zikr: The Ecstatic Practise (a lengthy dissertation on the ritual of Zikr and its process in the path of seeking enlightenment), Reaching the Hearts and Minds (of how fiction is the best model for explaining models of behaviour), The Egyptians vs. The Latin Calender (an important examination of the Julian/Georgian systems developed from the Sothic year employed by the Ancient Egyptians).Finally a Glossary of Egyptian terms with concise paragraphed explanations precedes the Selected Bibliography, Sources and Notes, and an exhaustive and excellent Index.This book brings together much of Moustafa&#65533;s earlier books into a culture still employing symbolism and spirituality long thought dead or not at all. The book does not seek to gloat or to show an exact way of seeking a mystical way, but challenges the reader to examine his or her own standing in the world spiritually and personally; a book to be read many times and its learning employed."},{"Title":"Egyptian Mystics: Seekers of the Way","review":"Egyptian Mystics: Seekers Of The Way is an impressive and groundbreaking contribution to an enlightened and enlightening study of the Egyptian contributions to Sufism and Alchemy in the ancient world. Iconoclastic Egyptologist Moustafa Gadalla provides an informed and informative examination and correlation between the Ancient Egyptian calendar of events and the cycles of the universe -- including the Egyptian contributions to the Christian calendar in terms of Christmas, Easter, Pentecost, and more. Egyptian Mystics is an original, thought-provoking, and thoroughly &quot;reader friendly&quot; study which is enthusiastically recommended for students of Sufism, Egyptology, and metaphysics."},{"Title":"Egyptian Mystics: Seekers of the Way","review":"This book provides very good information as to the Baladi Egyptian Sufi practices. Moustafa Gadalla does not waste words and gives the information very clearly; this makes the book very easy and enjoyable to read. Moustafa states that Sufism did not originate from Islam or from Persia, but was preceded by Egypt, more specifically by the Baladi Egyptians. The author also states that \\"The Egyptian mystical (Sufism) teachings and practices are markedly different than those of Sufis in other Countries.\\" pg120. The author makes it abundantly clear that the Sufism of Egypt is a matter of \\"sleeping with the enemy\\" I.e. Islam (See Appendices B \\"Sleeping with the enemy - Surviving Islam) pg145-148. This tolerance is a matter of survival from fear of persecution and death from Islamists and the Islamic government.I was happy to see from the section entitled \`The Ego - Personal Enemy #1' that the author states \\"Controlling the ego was/is one of the most important ethical requirements in the Egyptian model of mysticism\\",\\" To reunite with the divine, we must be ego-free\\" pg 43. Sadly there is only an exoteric methodology of righteous living as a remedy given here. Still, on a positive note this is achieved with the help of the laws of Maat; once again reinforcing this as a necessity for liberation I.e. right conduct. I loved the information regarding the Egyptian Deities I.e. Isis, Osiris, Tefnu and Shu etc. Reading about these deities helped reinforce the information that I already got from reading Gerald Massey's \`Ancient Egypt' (Highly recommended).I fully accept the author's position that Christianity, Islam and Judaism swiped a whole bunch of stuff from the spirituality of Egypt. I don't accept the position of the author that there is no proof as to Jesus Christ having walked this planet. I do however accept that the Catholic Church massaged its dates to fit ancient spirituality.On the flip side of things, this book was not what I expected. I was hoping for greater mystical practices from this book, mystical practices of an authentic, perhaps different, but nonetheless safe nature. A good portion of this book was devoted to the subject of the Baladi festivals called Mouleds. According to the author, somewhere in Egypt you will always find one of these festivals occurring. This can even incorporate over a million people. Personally, I question where mysticism ends and religion begins with such numbers. The Central practice of the Baladi mystics is the \`Ecstatic' practice of the \`Zikr' or 'Dhikr'. This is also the central ritual of the Mouleds. Zikr is practiced once or twice a week in Baladi fellowships. The Zikr is essentially performed by concentrating on the guide/leader (who is absent from the room). \\"The seeker forgets his existence\\" and \\"allows himself to pass away (be absorbed) into the guide/leader.\\" This is done to rhythmic music and dancing towards ecstasy. \\"In order for the aspirants of a fellowship to gain knowledge through spiritual revelation, one or more members of the fellowship must be a spiritual medium who can communicate and connect, through the chain of past spiritual guides to a Pir/Mir/Wali-who is commonly known as the founder of a fellowship\\" pg 121 The author describes this lineage in terms of a chain or pipe. As described, this chain consists of people living and dead. Personally, I've always had a revulsion of anything that would attempt to gain control over me, this also includes addictions. Obviously the Zikr rang warning bells for me. I did a simple Google search incorporating the word Zikr and demon possession. I'm aware that this has obvious Christian connotations, but the facts reported bare evidence that this is not something that I'd have anything to do with or recommend, in fact, the devastations arising from this sort of thing would have me urge all those even considering witnessing such an event as a Zikr to flee in the opposite direction. See \`The influence of animism on Islam, chapter 12, The Zar: Exorcism of demons by Samuel M. Zwemer, F.R.G.SI accept without question that the Egyptians once had a great spirituality; a spirituality encompassing deep esoteric teachings, the training of initiates and of providing a path towards liberation. I've heard it said that a great spiritual temple still resides in Egypt in a different dimension. Sadly, as was the case with other great society's that also attained great spirituality, Egyptian spirituality fell into decay. I believe that this present book has a semblance of greatness of this past Egyptian spirituality, but that this particular form of Egyptian Sufi mysticism (I.e. Baladi) now lies in distortion.Recommendations: I enjoyed reading \`Sacred Sexuality-Ancient Egyptian Tantric Yoga' by Muata Ashby and have four of his other books, of which I am eager to read and further assess. I would welcome any recommendations towards an authentic Egyptian esoteric spirituality, especially to the depth of Samael Aun Weor; I would appreciate this added as a comment."},{"Title":"Egyptian Mystics: Seekers of the Way","review":"Great book and very enlightening, I definitely plan on reading some of the authors other books."},{"Title":"Lightning From The Cockpit: Flying The Supesonic Legend","review":"lightning from the cockpit by Peter Caygall tells the story of the design and development history of the lightning jet.

While reading Mnookin's overlong, dated tome it's difficult to cull whose ego is actually larger; his or Mr. Raines. How else could one justify writing such a fluffy, obviously padded book about old news? Mnookin's a media insider writing about media insiderness and his book will undoubtedly garner a good amount of [good] press, but Hard News delivers little new insight or anything that makes relevent today this seemingly ages ago scandal. What it does is make one wonder how, in this sad age for the book world, a more worthy, less pretentious work by a less connected writer could come to our attention."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Boring and very thin. Blair's book is a better read and magazine articles, including Mnookin's in Newsweek are more informative."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Seth Mnookin has written a sensational book regarding the downfall of two employees of the New York Times in 2003 and the sullied reputation for which the Times has fought hard to atone. The story revolves around an aspiring reporter, Jayson Blair, who finally got caught plagiarizing many columns while inventing others, and Howell Raines, the Darth Vader of the journalism world. If there ever was a boss one wouldn't want to have, Mnookin shows us that Raines was that man.The larger element is the world of the Times, the most important and influential newspaper in the world. Mnookin has a way with narrative and for those of us who have grown up with the Times he reveals the underside of a finished product. Like the old saying, \\"the two things no one wants to see made are laws and sausages\\", the author spins a chilling tale of how the incidents with Blair and the heavy-handedness of Raines brought the Times to its knees. When you read the Times on a daily basis it's sometimes hard to believe what goes on behind their closed doors. Mnookin takes us inside that world and reveals a site of petty politics, bruised egos, ambitious reporters and a workplace that often borders on the chaotic. There are good and bad people in this book.I highly recommend \\"Hard News\\". It's so good that once you get into it, you'll find it hard to put down."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"I have to admit, I was less than enthusiastic about reading what I assumed would be yet another sensationalistic account of the Jayson Blair scandal. I had always felt that the Blair scandal, though it clearly captivated the media world in New York, had received coverage out of proportion to its actual significance. It was beaten to death: a story told ad nauseam simply because a) the media was obsessed, much more than the average citizen was, with such lunacy at an august institution like the New York Times, b) the Blair story contained so many lurid, tabloid-style details.But a friend who had received an advance copy of the book recommended it to me, and, despite my reservations, I picked up a copy. From the first page, I was captivated. Mnookin is a truly special writer, blending pithy, relevant reportage with suspenseful plotting and effortless style. More importantly, it was refreshing to see that Mnookin had removed the Blair story from the center of the narrative, focusing instead on the much more interesting issue of the New York Times as an institution: its history, its philosophy, and the internecine struggles that created an environment conducive to error and failure. This book offers a fascinating window into the heart of American media. This is what the Jayson Blair story SHOULD have been about from the beginning: though Blair's individual case is certainly eye-catching, and though he deserves blame for his completely irresponsible actions, Mnookin makes the case that his failures were symptomatic of much more serious issues at the nation's paper of record. It is a fascinating, well-constructed, and well-argued thesis, and in the process of making it, Mnookin reveals much about the nature of journalism and truth-telling in America.This is an engrossing book with great significance for our country and culture, and it would be a shame if it were dismissed, wrongly, as just another reheated retelling of an overheated scandal."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"I'd followed the Jayson Blair saga and Howell Raines's resignation pretty closely, and I didn't think I needed to know any more about the scandals at The Times. But still I picked up Hard News, and I surprised myself by finishing it in two sittings. Mnookin has an easy, effortless style, and he tells a fast-paced tale we haven't heard before -- what happened inside The Times as it was chasing one of the most important news stories in its history. Hard News is really a detective story with a cast of characters -- Times reporters -- who make you feel that the paper as an institution will long survive. My only quibble is with the subtitle -- this book doesn't tell us what the scandals' meaning is for American media. And it doesn't need to. It stands on its own as a smart, well-researched and above all entertaining story about an exceptional American institution."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"\\"Hard News\\" is an unstoppable account of an editor's abuse of power and a reporter's abuse of trust. People may say that a book was \\"hard to put down.\\" In the case of \\"Hard News,\\" I picked it up, read for a few hours, went to bed, and then actually woke up at 4 a.m. thinking about the book and had to read it to the end. That has never happened to me before. Mnookin's feats of reporting, fast-paced style, and gripping and insightful yarn are impressive, but not what makes the book stand out. Rather, what kept me turning the pages was the way the characters of Jayson Blair and Howell Raines emerged, developed and then seemed to coalesce into two sides of the same coin of egomaniacal dysfunction. Subtle, devastating, and incredibly fun to read."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"\\"Hard News,\\" Seth Mnookin's fascinating and well-researched account of the now-infamous Jayson Blair scandal that shook the foundations not only of the New York Times but also the way journalists do business, is a crisp read. The author is always objective, and his sourcing would seem to be impeccable. For the most part he uses sources who will speak on the record, and when they would not he claims to have verified what they've said with others. And source notes and a bibliography are provided.In Mr. Mnookin's version, the story focuses on what happens to people who make wrong choices that they easily could have avoided--that is, if they were not the prisoners of their own ideology and life experiences. The account starts with the misguided notion of New York Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. that the head of the op-ed page, Howell Raines, a narcissistic, inflexible left-wing ideologue best known for his invective-laden editorials against, mostly, conservatives, but also Bill Clinton, could function as the newspaper's executive editor, in which position he would be in charge, not of a small group of like-minded ideologues, but of a newsroom with hundreds of employees of varying opinions and, of course, abilities.Generalissimo Raines couldn't function in that job, and in the process of failing he managed to alienate most of the staff while turning the newspaper into the journalistic version of a banana republic, led of course by himself.Then, the author moves on to the equally bizarre decision by Raines and his no. 2, managing editor Gerald Boyd, to send Jayson Blair out on big stories (the DC Sniper, Jessica Lynch). Blair, a dimestore sociopath, fantasist, and substance abuser, had already been warned by his direct supervisors about his job performance, but Raines and Boyd would eventually claim, improbably, not to know of this when the scandal broke.And scandal there would be. Blair would repay their trust in him with plagiarism, after which he graduated to fabrication, and ended up writing stories with out-of-town datelines without ever having left the Times Building on West 43rd St. in New York. (In the process, as Mr. Mnookin outlines, he demonstrated creative uses for cell phones and photo archives.)When Blair was exposed and forced to resign, the Times assembled a group of reporters and editors to investigate every story Blair had written, and the result was the sensational report that appeared in the paper one fateful Sunday in May 2003.That report made the Times the butt of jokes, and within two months Raines and Boyd were fired; then, after a brief interregnum in which the previous executive editor, Joe Lelyveld, who Raines disdained, returned to pick up the shattered pieces, Sulzberger selected Bill Keller, who had been passed over in favor of Raines two years before. Keller moved rapidly to restore order and institute changes, among them the hiring of the Times's first public editor.As for Mr. Sulzberger, he escaped unscathed--which is unsurprising: his family owns the New York Times Corp.The book is compulsive reading. Even though the outcome is known, \\"Hard News\\" nevertheless has the feel of a police procedural. Maybe you'll start imagining who might be cast as the principals if (or should I say when) there's a movie made of this cautionary tale."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Yes, Hard News tells the story of the Jayson Blair scandal, but that's really not the most interesting part of the book. What's more interesting -- and more the point -- is getting to see inside the institution that defines East-Coast intelligentsia, scares politicians, and produces Sunday Styles. And what better time to peek behind the curtains than when the editorial staff is slinging mud and the paper is in shambles?It's weirdly suspenseful, too, for a book whose ending you already know (hint: Blair made up sources). In the end, the book begs the question of whether the Times' handling of the crisis was a staff revolt against a tyrannical editor, an exercise journalistic navel-gazing, or a fight for the standards of media integrity.

There is, at the same time, a lot of craft behind his sleek, no-nonsense style. Mnookin knows precisely which details will propel his narrative to its conclusion and which ones will hinder it. The result is a speeding bullet of a book, which I read almost all at one sitting. The thoroughness of the investigation and the deftness of the exposition are together a tribute to the journalistic values that Raines' regime did so much to damage."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"This is the first review I've ever written, only because I want to encourage every American to read this book. It well researched, well written, responsible, insightful and very telling of how low our newspapers execs are willing to stoop. From now on everytime I pick up the NY Times I will wonder how much of the print is bogus! Thank you Mr. Mnookin for blowing their cover. I expect we will see and read more of this up rising young star author."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Seth Mnookin manages to tell you everything you ever wanted to know about the New York Times but never even knew to ask. Times readers who were shocked by the four page self-flagellating confession the Times' editors served up following the discovery of Jayson Blair's deceptions will be fascinated by thisbehind-the-scenes account. Mnookin's unprecedented access in reporting this book resulted in the definitive account of how the Times was duped and consequently mired in the biggest journalistic fraud in American history. Mnookin captures the personalities and pathologies of the key players and weaves a narrative that keeps you hooked the minute you start reading. This book is proof that truth is always more interesting than fiction and that some of the most interesting dramas are played out right under our noses."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"This book should be required reading for every journalism student.

Good education for the person who is not familiar on behind the scenes of news organizations."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Read six years after it was first published, Seth Mnookin's \\"Hard News\\" feels somewhat like falling through a timewarp. Could it be that just half a decade ago the biggest commotion in the hard news business was the exposure of a two-bit grifter?Or that a thoughtful observer like Seth Mnookin could suppose that the news collection and delivery business was sorting itself out?Well, much that Mnookin did not anticipate -- even though it was already started -- has happened since then.One was the introduction of Craigslist, which has destroyed classified advertising revenue streams for nearly all papers, crippling news operations budgets.Another was the interest (in two senses of the word) taken in large public newspaper chains. The dolts, who controlled billions of dollars in investment money, knew even less about newspapering than they did about banking, with the result that they destroyed the capacities that made newspapers able to survive as businesses - an easy task, since newspapers, like book publishing, don't make much sense in general market models: How do you make money delivering, every day, to the doorstep, a book's worth of information for 50 cents? Try getting somebody to deliver milk to your doorstep.A third was the influx of crooks -- as opposed to mere dolts -- who looted important newspaper chains. It reminds me of what happened to private intracity bus companies. A free market destroys what it cannot use, even if somebody else could have used it. Wall Street is like a plague of rats.A fourth -- not really new, but greatly invigorated lately -- was a well-financed, politically motivated assault by fascists (a word I use seldom and only with care) on particular sectors of American newspapering in particular and journalism in general. The one word name for this is McCarthyism.However, newspapers were busily creating their own problems, and a subset of these are the subject of Mnookin's \\"Hard News,\\" which at first glance is a recapitulation of the scandal created by Jayson Blair at the New York Times. This was a miniscandal at best, since -- unlike, say, stories about Bill Clinton running cocaine into Mena -- Blair's stories were not in themselves phony; he was appropriating the authentic reports of others and passing them off as his own. Blair was not Bill O'Reilly or Andrew Breitbart.As Mnookin is careful to state explicitly, the book is not about Blair, nor was Blair important, except that his exposure brought down a more serious do-badder, Howell Raines, the executive editor of the Times.It is not unusual, in the newspaper business, for a top reporter to be a failure as a top manager. Nor unexpected. Nothing in the background of a good reporter prepares him for managing. There is no reason to expect that picking newsroom managers from top reporters would result in having good management; and even if there were, it isn't always top reporters who get the call. I know.Raines was a respected, if not tippytop reporter, and he got where he was more by schmoozing the brass than by being the best at his next-lower Peter Principle level - just as, far down the food web, Blair got where he was by schmoozing Raines. Nothing unsual about that. I know.There's not even anything unusual about a paper keeping on a reporter who was a drunk, a coke addict, a thief and a layabout. I know.One thing that was new was the visibility of the executive editor of the New York Times. If it is the country's dominant news organization, as Mnookin says, until fairly recently its editor was usually not widely known (its publishers were).Through the middle of the 20th century, there were famous editors, but not usually in New York. New York had 10 or more dailies and the editor of the Times was not even first among equals. When you think of the editors who had national reputations, the names that float back are \\"Marse\\" Henry Watterson in Louisville, Ralph McGill in Atlanta, Jonathan Daniels in Raleigh, Lauren Soth in Des Moines, William Allen in Emporia. Manhattan editors were not famous, except for Herbert Swope, famously corrupt.Note how many of these names are Southerners. In \\"The Kingdom and the Power,\\" Gay Talese wrote about how poor boys from the South used newspapering to rise to positions of influence and power, if not fame. It may have looked to Arthur Sulzberger Jr. as if Howell Raines would be such another, although Raines had not grown up poor.Newspapering used to be a blue-collar job. Poor boys, often without much education and almost always without degrees from tony eastern colleges, started out covering crime news or town politics in tank towns, and if they were good and smart, they went to the big city. (There were some Ivy Leaguers among them, and some became very successful reporters and famous correspondents, but not too many of those became top editors.)The watershed that changed that was the big newspaper strike in New York City in 1962. When it was over, the Mirror, a paper that had had a circulation of a million, never reopened, and the World, the Journal and the Telegram only carried on a short while by amalgamating. Suddenly, instead of 10 big editors in Manhattan, there were 3 (the Wall Street Journal was then still a narrow, specialist sheet which didn't count), and only 1 (after the demise of the Herald-Tribune) was entirely respectable.And increasingly well-known. And the Times Corp. started expanding, buying small papers and sending out the also-rans from its vicious battles for the top spot to become executive editors of well-known regional papers. These men, good newspapermen in some ways, never stopped being Timesmen, and instead of owing first loyalty to the town they lived in, they used the local paper as a finishing school for the nave Ivy League boys and girls who had begun (after Woodward and Bernstein) to think of newspapering as a glamorous business and not the boiler factory it was and ought to be.They showed up in state capitals with a computer, a cellular phone, a PDA, a wardrobe and an attitude and helped ruin the localness of local papers. They couldn't be trusted to cover a one-alarm fire, and they left before they learned how, too; only to have their by-lines show up from Switzerland and Washington a few months later. I know.Raines, whose career antedated the worst of this plague, ought to have been a little better, but he wasn't. He didn't spend enough time in St. Petersburg or any other burg to learn to spot a con artist, something most cop-shop reporters learn soon enough. Everybody, from his high school classmates to his college newspaper colleagues to the lower-ranking newshounds at the Times, spotted Blair sooner or later -- usually sooner -- as a con artist. Raines, Gerald Boyd and the other bigwigs were taken in.That, to me, is the foundational sin of Raines. Mnookin makes a strong case that he was a narcissistic, arrogant, backstabbing, social-climbing schemer who drove off talented people. And so he was. But if he'd been able to spot a plain vanilla grifter, which is all Blair ever was, he'd have had a longer run at the Times than he did. Who knows, he might still be there after 10 years. I've seen others, much like him, last twice as long at other papers.Mnookin's book is a shade too gossipy for my taste but well-sourced (considering that neither Raines, Boyd nor Blair cared to give their versions of events). Its greatest fault is an omission. In a longish introduction to the development of the Times' news management before Raines was appointed, Mnookin lists several problems the paper had created or had created for it in the '90s. There is not a word about how badly it was snookered by the anti-Clinton conspiracy.At the time he wrote, Mnookin was not aware that the Times also was ignoring Bernie Madoff, despite clear warning signs. He cannot be faulted for that -- although the Times' business and metropolitan departments can be -- but knowing what we know now, some of his praise for the post-Raines Times' sounds callow."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Hard News is a peek into the New York Times at a moment that was one of its lowest points in the paper's history and explains how the Times got there. We've all heard of Jayson Blair but Hard News shows that he was a timebomb from the very begining not only becuase of his own problems but because of the vile atmosphere at the NYT.Most of the book centers on Howell Raines and it slowly but thoroughly explains what Mnookin thinks went wrong. Raines may have been right--the NYT had been resting on its laurels but the way he went about shaking up the old Gray Lady turned the staff against him and by the time Jayson Blair imploded blood was in the water.This isn't a thrilling book and it's occasionally long winded but when the author finally gets to the point it's worth the wait."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"More like a thriller than a media history, Mnookin's book is actually FUN to read. Who would have thought a book that covers a story already obsessively raked over in the media could actually feel newsy? A page turner."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"This is the story of a family who ran the prestigious newspaper passed down, The New York Times (Adolph Ochs to Punch Sulzber's son, Arthur, Jr.) and the almost fatal reign of an egotistical editor, Howell Raines -- as background so the reader might see how irresponsible they were to let this scandal happen in the first place.In effect, Arthur turned the paper over to Mr. Raines, whose browbeating style offended the politicians he lampooned. He is described as being short and \\"expansive\\" with dark, fierce eyes which intimidated the Times backbone (his subordinates) even when he wasn't speaking. He looked like an angry hawk to make up for lack of stature.In less than two years, after he was appointed to lead the paper into a 'bright future,' he was forced to resign in disgrace. He had taken over less than a week prior to the tragedy of 9-11-2001 and, with his prodding, the paper was awarded six Pulitzer Prizes (for their coverage of terrorism and its consequences). He became as visible on the society pages in gossip columns and the New York social scene as he was provocative in the editorial section, where he reigned supreme.The legacy he left was using a national emblem as his personal vitriolic \\"soapbox.\\" He slandered politicians unmercilessly about campaign finances, among other things. He was one to 'hit below the belt.'He took over and ran away anyone with morals; no one was ethically strong enough to contradict him. He proved to be the relentless \\"boss from Hell.\\" Soon, credibility of the Times suffered because of his activist role and questionable reporting. He had a definite \\"flood the zone\\" mentality which irked a lot of people, not just those who worked under him.It took another short male (only five feet tall) to bring this small man to his fateful moment of truth, resulting in the loss of his esteemed forceful hold over this paper. These two make me think of the words of the song, \\"Short People.....\\"Jayson Blair from Fairfax County, Virginia, was too ambitious but unreliable (the spelling of his first name is even false). He successfully faked a story in his school paper and got away with it. He became known as a prevaricator and scandal monger in his made-up stories. No one checked his background (serious problems with reliability, accuracy, and his colleagues) before having hired him as an intern at The Boston Globe (where he acquired a reputation for \\"trafficking in nasty gossip\\" and stealing story lines and ideas) and the Times (where he was deceptive about his education).All newspapers hate \\"embarrasing\\" corrections: my local paper recently left out an entire decade of happenings in a newly renovated theater, refused to acknowledge the omission even though they made the mistake, not caring who they hurt. Apparently, they had used the info from the management (not local people) and deemed it wasn't important enough to list as a \\"correction.\\" Thus, they lost a subscriber, many I hope. I wrote to the publisher that such an obvious omission is as wrong as using false statements, but it was not publicly acknowledged.A local t.v. station had made a similar omission in the history of the station, and got away with it, so it didn't matter as far as they were concerned. The media have lots to be responsible for and should admit when they have done wrong.Blair went from using others' previously published work to making up stories, then claimed mental illness. The fact that it happened at a national, prize-winning newspaper brought the truth out for the whole country to \\"talk about.\\" Thanks for Seth Mnookin, a former senior writer at 'Newsweek,' we learn how he pulled his con game and brought to an end the destructive reign of Howell Raines, who had incidentally sent Blair an email praising his 'journalism.' His version of 'hard news' never happened, or at least as presented in the N. Y. Times. I hope Bruce Hartman reads this book."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"This book didn't do much for me. I'm a journalism student, so typically \\"insider stories\\" about the news media fascinate me. But this one just laid out everything I had already learned about the Blair incident in my journalism classes. And the one real interesting character in this drama - Howell Raines - wasn't even interviewed for the book. The writing, at least was decent, but overall it was kind of a waste of time.

But instead its a rehash of events that have already been covered to death in magazine and newspaper articles, and, yes, several other books.

But like the movie \\"Shattered Glass\\" (about the New Republic's Stephen Glass), this book manages to turn the facts into a suspense story. And for a media junkie like myself, it's a great glimpse into the inner workings of the NY Times."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Very absorbing. Mnookin takes the reader inside the workings of The New York Times. He shows us Jayson Blair, who managed to write stories from locations he never visited, and Howell Raines, the editor whose newsroom style allowed this to happen. Most of all he shows us the reporters who uncovered the story. And then he connects the dots: what can the media learn from this, what does it tell us about how we get our news, what news we get. Read it. It's a good story. It's an important story."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Hard News is former Newsweek writer Seth Mnookin's book about Howell Raines' twenty-one month tenure as executive editor at the New York Times, during which the Jayson Blair reporting scandal occurred.Mnookin's narrative is almost always fast-paced and engaging, dragging only occasionally (notably when he gets into the minute details of the team of reporters responsible for investigating Jayson Blair's reporting). Even so, Hard News is more often downright entertaining. On the back cover, The Washington Post Book World blurb says, \\"Hard News reads like a thriller\\". While this may sound improbable, it is to some degree true.One of the reasons Hard News is so interesting is that Mnookin's main characters are larger than life. Howell Raines is interested in using the New York Times to build himself a grand legacy, and so he institutes his own changes, to an extent, for their own sakes. Raines more or less goes mad with power - he isn't interested in dissenting opinions of any kind. For Mnookin, Raines is a tyrannical dictator of the highest order. Mnookin really gives Raines the business. From beginning to end, Raines is the villain of this piece, misguided, arrogant, and oblivious, and the blame for more or less everything bad that happened at the Times during this period is laid at Raines' feet. Certainly, Raines was the one primarily responsible, and the situation that resulted in his ouster was to a large degree of his own making, but the reader may get the feeling here and there that Mnookin has at least a small axe to grind against Raines.Jayson Blair comes across as a pathological liar, who may very well have some kind of mental illness. He very clearly has no scruples, ethics, morals or principles. He showed no remorse for his catastrophic fraud; he tried to cash in on it with a memoir filled with more fabrications. And when adversity strikes, Blair is the boy who cried \\"racism!\\". Given his long history of journalistic problems and fabrications, Blair's rapid rise at the New York Times seems unbelievable. Certainly it fits well into the \\"truth is stranger than fiction\\" category.The full title of the book is Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media. Yet beyond commenting on how some media do more in-depth fact-checking (although he also notes that many media still do not fact-check), Mnookin really doesn't get into how the media changed. Rather, he hints at how these events have changed how the media are perceived by the American people, how they have lost credibility and trust across the board.On the whole, Hard News is about as gripping as an account as one might reasonably expect to have about this sort of thing. But the reader may well wonder if Mnookin has been fair in his representations of Raines and others and if, in the end, Mnookin has reported all sides of the story."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Hard News is about the brief and troubled reign of Howell Raines as executive editor at the New York Times. It is a powerful story and is ably suited for the book form with its sweeping arc of great success (winning six Pulitzers early) and then a great scandal followed by defeat and resignation in tight twenty-one period (although the author kindly expands this a little to give the reader context concerning life at the Times). The troubled writer Jayson Blair fits into this narrative but it is definately not his story. Besides being both gripping and informative, this is also a book for anyone who cares passionately about the concept of unbiased news, an idea that is sadly almost becoming quaint and old-fashioned in this new Fox-centric universe. This is also a story for those who actually care about the New York Times because despite its troubled period, the passionate people who work at this paper come out very well in this book. It is a book that is hard to put down, a tale told well by Seth Mnookin. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Few contemporary tales are as compelling as this one, or more important. At a time when we are ever more dependent on reliable, truthful news sources our faith in the institutions was challenged by Jayson Blair's deceit and Howell Raines' ego.

The good news about Hard News is that, it's a great read to boot."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Whether or not you're interested in media stuff per se, this book is a wonderful read. Seth Mnookin has a superb sense of how organizations work and the way that the strengths and weaknesses of individual reporters and editors combined to make possible the incidents of the Jayson Blair story. It's really fascinating, and the book is consistently well-written and gripping. I can't imagine someone not enjoying this book--it's a good present for anybody who's interested in institutions and psychology and history and wants to hear a fascinating and often sordid tale about human weakness."},{"Title":"Hard News: Twenty-one Brutal Months at The New York Times and How They Changed the American Media","review":"Great writing.

Satisfaction is firmly in that class of books. Unlike other recent outings from Devine, this book has a firm plot which stands up to and is more than a good skeleton for the sex scenes. The characters are well drawn, if not overly complex. None of them are people you'd think about after putting the book down, but Devine doesn't generally write that kind of book anyway.Read other reviews for the story details. Let it suffice to say that the conflicts are well plotted, with supporting villans and helpers who fit right in. The language is a bit rough for those who don't like a lot of basic Anglo-Saxon nouns and verbs. Otherwise it seems true to its period and flows convincingly.Divine's writing is improving with time and practice. She is learning how to draw her characters more vividly, and make her dialog sound real and convincing. Her work is improving by leaps in this novel, and I suggest that you visit her website to see what else she has written, www.theadevine.com.Would I buy this? Yes. Would I keep it?

While the Gaillairds lived the life of wealth, her family survived on a government job pittance. After years of bedtime stories of revenge, Jancie arrives at Waybury House as a companion to Hugo's dying wife Olivia. She plans to cause a rift between Hugo and his son Lujan by flirting outrageously with the father and seducing the younger.Lujan comes home to care for his beloved mother in her last days. He detests his father especially with his sexual predatory advances towards Jancie while his wife lies dying nearby. He wonders what game Jancie is playing though he finds he wants her. To her chagrin, she falls in love with the instrument of her revenge. With the sins of their sires in the way, anything between them beyond the death of his mother seems unachievable, but love has a way of accomplishing the impossible.Erotic romance readers will find SATISFACTION with this exciting historical tale in which the betrayal by a rolling stone adventurer leads to demons suffered by their respective offspring. The story line is exciting though Hugo and Edmund show no redeeming qualities. Jancie and Lujan are a wonderful pairing in and out of bed and his brother adds a fine rivalry for the heroine's affection. A late sidebar intrigue not involving vengeance provides further doubts between the lovers, but that seem unnecessary as their sires have done a wonderful job of that already. When it comes to sex in the Victorian Age, few writers provide as divine a story as this author does.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Satisfaction","review":"This was the book that made me buy 4 other Thea Devine books.

His greatest work is The Three Musketeers followed closely by The Count of Monte Cristo and countless other works. One of his last great novels is \\"The Black Tulip\\" of 1850. In this short, tense and excciting novel we learn much about Holland, tulips and the power of love.The novel is set in the seventeenth century when Holland was in chaos due to the war between the Republicans and supporters of the House of Orange. The de Wette brothers are executed by a mob of Orangemen. Cornelius the namesake of Cornelius de Wette and his godson is accused of being in league with the De Wette brothers (accused of being in cahoots with the French enemies of the Dutch Republic). He is a naive, intellectual doctor who has no interest in politics preferring, like Voltaire, to tend his garden at home!. Tulipmania was rife in seventeenth century Holland. His next door neighbor an evil man named Boxel is envious of Cornelius' ability to grow prize winning tulips. He turns him over to the authorities claming he is a traitor who received secret letters from the recently murdered De Wette brothers. Cornelius is condemned to death as a traitor to the Dutch Republic.Cornelius has his head placed on the executioner's block but is reprieved at the last minute by William the new ruler of Holland. He is imprisoned quickly falling in love with Rose a young Frisian girl whose father is the notorious jailor Gryphun.

The couple are wed. The evil Boxel diesand all is well. The novel is reminiscent of a fairy tale story where good is rewarded and evil is punished.The Black Tulip is a short novel of 200 pages. It is exciting as we read to see what will develop with Rose and Cornelius as they grow the tulip and fall in love. At one juncture, Rose is angry at Cornelius for loving the tulip more than he does her! This lover's quarrel ends happily as the joyous couple receive the award for their amazing black tulip and triumph over adversity. Rose and Cornelius are both loving characters for whom we care and hope for as the pages are rapidly turned leaving us on the edge of our seats!Alexandre Dumas was a deft author of countless adventures and intriguing political tales which will always be enjoyed for their romanticism, suspense and pure escapism. As a 21st century reader you will enjoy this book saluting Dumas for his literary genius! The Black Tulip is a flower to be savored as the reader is transported to a long ago and far away Holland!

Illustrated library edition)","review":"Yes, William of Orange is very much like the Cardinal in The Three Musketeers. I read a novel on Alexandre Dumas called The King of Paris. This novel claims he was often accused of publishing other people's works. He did this just to get them published under the Dumas name. However, this book called The Black Tulip was written by no one other than Dumas. The Dumas' were decendants of French Huguenots as were the DeWitt(e)s. Many persecuted Calvinist families fled France to the low countries (Holland). Dumas' interest in my ancestry compelled him to write a historical novel using true events. It is said that this was not a case where Catholics persecuted the Protestants, but two Calvinist parties in a conflict. The House of Orange fought to remain under monarchy rule while the DeWitts fought to advocate a free republic. It is also said that the man accused of causing this rioting mob, was later paid a royal pension. We DeWitts dropped the e, it was silent anyways. Our reunions claim a common ancestor named Tjerck C. DeWitt was a first cousin to Johan and Cornelious. Tjerck's father was Nicholas and he had a brother Jacob. Jacob was the father of the two brother DeWitts hacked to pieces in August of 1672. Now, the French Philosopher Voltaire used the two brother DeWitts in his writings. Once in explaining a doctorine of Hell. Perhaps Dumas, the ornry cus, was simply trying to outdo Voltaire. Mr. Dumas was a great philosopher, protestant and man to me."},{"Title":"The black tulip (The romances of Alexandre Dumas.

She is a rather weak female character if you ask me. She's got the whole swooning thing going on, and while I realize that this book was written a century before a Women's Rights Movement, I'm still annoyed that women's characters were either conniving and murderous or swoony and stupid.

The story revolves around Cornelius who is forced to choose between which is more important to him: his love of tulips; or the love of Rosa, a simple peasant girl who befriended him in prison.That's it.Now, I can easily understand how, due to cultural differences, the cultivation of Tulips might have been a more significant part of seventeenth century life than it is today, but even so, its a pretty bland topic. Yeah, if the only other choice you're presented with is the new John Grisham best-seller and you're faced with a two-hour layover in National Airport, this book will definately hold its own -- but I don't think there's enough plot in the book to maintain a even a low-budget Movie-of-the-Week on TBS."},{"Title":"The black tulip (The romances of Alexandre Dumas.

Later I had an opportunity to spend time in Holland and fell in love with tulips. So, when Alexandre Dumas was the selected author for a reading group I chose The Black Tulip since I knew most people would gravitate toward his more well known work. I was sorely disappointed.The Black Tulip contains components that typically I find enthralling. The story begins with the historical event of a lynch mob killing Cornelius and Johan DeWitt for reportedly colluding to have William, the Prince of Orange, assassinated. Cornelius' godson, Cornelius van Braele, is arrested as a conspirator. The evidence against van Braele is given by his jealous next door neighbor who does not want van Braele to succeed in producing a prized black tulip for which a hefty award has been promised by the Horticulture Society of Haarlem.Why did I rank it so low? While it is a real struggle to get past the first four chapters, I prefer the beginning to the rest of the book. I found the majority of the story to be simplistic and superficial with two-dimensional characters. Secondly, there was an abundance of historical inaccuracies. I was not as hard on this book as I usually am with respect to inaccuracies because I understand that research was much more arduous at this time and the translators do a decent job of pointing out the inaccuracies in the notes. Finally, the obvious archetypes assigned to various characters were frustrating to me, making much of the story too predictable."},{"Title":"The black tulip (The romances of Alexandre Dumas.

Dumas' writing, while not overly emotional in and of itself, definitely provokes emotion in defense of his strong characters. The villian is repulsive and unlikeable while the soon to be identified hero is awkwardly charming and by turns wiley.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, but in the spirit of full disclosure I was an English major that primarily dealt with British literature so perhaps that's why I enjoyed this book so much.

Illustrated library edition)","review":"While The Black Tulip lacks the swashbuckling, derring-do adventures of the other Dumas novels I have read, it is every bit as enjoyable to read.Beginning with the arrest of two brothers, deemed traitors to the throne, Dumas Holland-based story at least begins with as strong a conflict as his other more action-laced novels. But the story, while shifting focus to the Godson of one of the men arrested, concerns his passion and pursuit of the highly coveted black tulip, a strain of Holland's most popular horticultural export. Cornelius van Baerle, a man of comfortable means, is little concerned with his wealth, or with position; or at all suspicious of the papers left in his care by his Godfather prior to his arrest. M. van Baerle has but one pursuit, one goal, and one dream...to produce a flawless, rare black tulip.Thus his downfall, as an avaricious neighbor,Isaac Boxtel, shares this dream, but for entirely different reasons. While Cornelius van Baerle cares not for the riches and fame associated with growing such a flower, Boxtel covets both and plots to eliminate his competition and abscond with the delicate blossom which will net him one hundred thousand florins, more than enough to live like the King himself.M. van Baerle is, therefore, convicted of treason when Boxtel reveals the existence of the papers of va Baerle's godfather to the authorities, and M. van Baerle finds himself on the wrong side of prison bars.However, the appearance of an unexpected love awakens passions in Cornelius to rival those he feels for the black tulip, and ignites a desire in him to share the possible wealth associated with the flower, simply to assure it's development and care.Thus, the race is on to plant, grow, and deliver the black tulip to the Horticultural Society.Dumas' writing skills are in fine form with this shorter novel, sparing none of the humor, grace, and elegance of other works of his I have indulged in. And while foils are left in scabbards, no plots to overthrow a corrupt Cardinal materialize, and revenge is not sought against the bad-guys...this novel is every bit as exciting.A fine way to experience one of France's most prolific historical authors for the first time, or to further explore his catalogue of works."},{"Title":"The black tulip (The romances of Alexandre Dumas. Illustrated library edition)","review":"This book is not to be recomended by those who want an exciting swashbuckling tale on a par with Dumas' incomparable musketeer stories. It is to this end that many reviewers and readers of this book leave with an unfriendly opinion of this book. Although it is Dumas' last book, it is in my opinion one of his best. It tells the heartwarming tale of Cornelius van Baerle who lives purely to try and cultivate the rare and wonderous black tulip. However when Cornelius' godfather is asassinated he, without knowing it, enters a dangerous game of cat and mouse with his jealous neighbour (and tulip fancier) Issac Boxtel who has seen Cornelius being given a letter by his godfather. To this end Cornelius is jailed whereupon he falls in love with Rosa, the beautiful daughter of his jailer. Rosa aids Cornelius to cultivate his tulip inside the jail and they eventually succeed only to have it cruely stolen by Boxtel. I wont ruin the ending by telling you what happens, suffice to say I feel that for the first time in his writing career Dumas wrote a &quot;Happy ever after&quot; ending which irritated me to some extent. I do love this book and it earns its place alongside Dumas' great novels, my main reason for loving it so much is its final lines, it is one of the greatest pieces of philosophy I have ever heard, but it is important to read the book to fully understand its meaning, I know it so well that I can reel it off the top of my head thus, &quot; ... he wrote above his door these lines that Grotius had carved on the wall of his prison on the day of his escape: &quot;Sometimes one has suffered enough to have the right never to say: I am too happy&quot;To me these words have a beautiful resonance that is not only lovely to think of but accurate as well, I feel that anyone who reads this book and fails to be moved, if by nothing else by the bathos of the denoument, then they have ultimately failed to appreciate the true beauty and skill of one of the finest novelists to ever pick up a writing implement.

The beginning of the novel is interesting but a little dense and readers may get discouraged, especially as the sentences are fairly complex. However it gets much easier and flows much quicker when the story picks up with the introduction of Van Baerle and his neighbor. I encourage you to keep reading if you are interested in its following key points:-- The characters are incredibly believable and have developed personalities that are realistically complex.-- The depiction of tragedy, justice, despair are noteworthy.-- The story is rich and flows smoothly.-- It's an interesting look at the past, especially the politics and the references to the tulip-craze of Europe some hundreds of years ago. Even though it has fictional elements it still feels like you're holding a slice of the past in your hand.-- I've always hated romances, but the love in this story is carefully drawn with a subtle touch and depicted with realism. Genuinely entertaining.-- It's depiction of the ways that popular opinion can be swayed and deceived by politics, nationalism, and patriotism is chilling.-- It simultaneously shows us human nobility and human pettiness.When I first picked up this book I didn't expect much.

It's central character is young Doctor Cornelius Van Baerle, who is as happy as can be in his own little world of growing tulips and inventing new colors for the flower. He thinks himself void of all enemies, but of course, we know better. There is then an announcement that says that anyone who invents the Black Tulip first, wins a huge monetary award and the recognition the new flower will bring to the winner. This sends all tulips-fanciers everywhere into frantic competiton to see who can grow the Grand Black Tulip. Then, as Cornelius finally perfects his Black Tulip, he is suddenly arrested and sentenced to be executed as an accomplice to the 'traitors' John and Cornelius De Witte.

In fact, almost no one else that I could think of, could construct a story about a gardener whose main passion in life is to grow a new variety of tulip, and turn it into a compelling, intrigue-filled, heroic romance. But Dumas does, here.Certainly, Dumas shines in his more famous novels, like The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo, giants of hundreds and hundreds of pages (thousands if you consider the entire Musketeer cycle), repleat with swashbuckling, conspiracy, murder and ladies-fair. It is therefore understandable that some of his audience might be put off by The Black Tulip, which is a scant 200 and some pages, and has its hero in jail for most of the novel, struggling to grow a flower by proxy. But really, the lesson is how great Alexandre Dumas is, because The Black Tulip manages to be just as rewarding (and at times, as thrilling) as his more renowned epics. Also, Dumas here shows some of his versatility and his incredible understanding of humanity, in the lovers conversations between Cornelius and Rosa, and in his rye, good-natured and subtle observations that, really, concentrating on tulip-growing, as opposed to warfare or violence, is a sign of greatness, not of mediocrity.You can't come to The Black Tulip looking for precisely the same things you'd seek in Dumas' other winners, but if you're looking for a wonderful little story, almost perfectly told, you're in the right place. With this tale, Dumas takes his place as my favorite author, of all time."},{"Title":"The black tulip (The romances of Alexandre Dumas.

The Black Tulip is also a great glimpse into the world of flowers in Holland. Many have heard of the tulip frenzy. This book gives a glimpse of it and what it drove men to do.Also, there is the forbidden romance between two that should really have no contact at all between themselves. Dumas weaves their tale, and their emotional stress in a very believable manner.This is Dumas' most famous novel, and one of his shortest. At 200 or so pages it is a fast read full of intrigue and twists.

But Penguin gives it to us complete, in the translation of Robin Buss.Buss restores passages that others have omitted, such as a two-page description of the city of Haarlem in Chapter 31. Although he tries to give us a complete, authentic text, he does introduce modern colloquialisms. One translation says that Boxtel \\"scolded\\" Rosa's father.

It is well-paced, start to finish, it has some interesting plot twists, and the hero, Johan Eschbach, is at his finest.Fans of the series will already understand the basic premise. Columbia, an alternate-world semi-USA faces the twin threats of chronic oil shortages and Austrian Emperor Ferdinand's plots to dominate the world. Eschbach, spy, professor, war hero, and good guy who wipes the dishes and makes a fair salad, must handle both issues.This time, Eschbach must broker a deal with a creaky Romanov regime, trading technology for oil. There is plenty of intrigue, and Modesitt really has the Russian character-- proud, paranoid, but ultimately somehow likeable--down pat.It is a shame that Eschbach's ahem--itchy-ahem French wife is still along for the ride, fussing about every bowl of soup, but if you can get past that, White Nights isn't bad at all. Some odd plot twists like having Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel appear in the alternate universe as an insidiously smarmy US Ambassador to Russia, are a lot of fun, too.White Nights is a significant uptick on the previous volume, Ghost of the Revelator, which had almost nothing in it but the French wife crabbing about the chow!"},{"Title":"Ghost of the White Nights","review":"This earth is a lot different than that which contains science fiction readers of popular novels written by authors like L.E.

In this alternate plane, scientists know how to remove the soul from the living host to create a zombie and that if the soul lingers after the individual dies in distress, a ghost exists.Columbia desperately needs oil and feel Romanov's Russian Alaska is the solution. As part of a cultural exchange with Russia, Columbia sends critically acclaimed singer Llysette to Russia to perform for the Czar. Llysette's spouse Doktor Johan Eschbach, a professor of Environmental Science, accompanies her ostensibly to provide his beloved wife support, but actually to see what he can do to expedite an oil agreement. A former secret agent, Johan soon finds himself embroiled in stopping a dangerous plot for world domination from happening, one that will use new and very dangerous weapons.The final novel in the \\"Ghost\\" trilogy, GHOST OF THE WHITE NIGHTS, is an engaging entry that focuses on an alternate world. The book wraps up the series nicely though fans will want more novels. The story line is at its best when delving into \\"modern\\" weapons systems and ghosts in the machine technology.

When his government calls both of them into service, Johan finds himself returning to a past that he had thought was long behind him--that of a spy and assassin.In this powerful alternative history novel, Austria-Hungary, allied with Prussia/Germany, sits astride a conquered Europe with only Russia, Sweden, and the fading Ottoman Turks remaining to face it. With both conventional weapons and the ability to create zombie armies, Austria-Hungary is content to nibble away at its enemies. In America, Columbia (representing most of what is the United States and the maritime provinces of Canada in our reality) suffers under the energy blockade that Austria-Hungary now imposes. Under the cover of an artistic exchange, Johan is sent to Russia to negotiate oil leases in Russian Alaska.Russia, still ruled by the Tsars, is a challenge to Johan. The rocket branch of the Russian military seems intent on foiling the oil deal despite the obvious benefits to all parties. Johan comes to suspect a threat to the entire world order--one that neither Russia nor Columbia is likely to survive. Yet what can one man do against the intrenched bureaucracy of a centuries-old state?Author L. E. Modesitt, Jr. brings his emotionally compelling writing to a fascinating alternative history--one vaguely reminisent of Jules Verne, with its steam automobiles, dirigible travel, and its still-surviving Imperial heads of state, yet with a supernatural element of ghosts making their presence felt. Despite a few loose ends (what, exactly, was that bombing about), Modesitt delivers an exciting story with fully human characters. Johan, in particular, is wonderfully sympathetic as an aging college professor forced back into a way of life that he had thought behind him, now with the need to protect his wife as well as his country.Fans of Modesitt's pure fantasy as well as alternative history buffs will enjoy GHOST OF THE WHITE NIGHTS."},{"Title":"Ghost of the White Nights","review":"I originally read this book out of sequence picked up at the Library. and it was fantastic- Modesitt's world is similar to ours with a few glaring differences. great story setting and ghosts great author!

(Alt-hist purists may be upset, more than somewhat, to discover that Mr. Modesitt provides no turning point event to account for the divergence between this time line and our own, but the rest of us won't care all that much.)Eshbach, environmental economist and sometime spy and his diva wife, Llysette, are sent, at government expense, to St. Petersburg where she will perform before the Czar, while Eschbach himself must negotiate some sort of oil deal with the Russians so that the Austro-Hungarians don't corner the world's oil supply, and of course there are plenty of bad guys around that do not wish for Eschbach to succeed. (Naturally, like any secret agent who has to save the world, he comes equipped with a few special gadgets that tilt the odds in his favor--and usually not a moment too soon at that.)The book is smoothly written, urbane, and just plain fun. The few hours you'll spend in Mr. Modesitt's company will surely be worth your while. Try it even if you haven't read the first two in the series."},{"Title":"Ghost of the White Nights","review":"_________________________________________Johan Eschbach, retired from an eventful career as anaval aviator, Spazi agent, and cabinet minister, nowteaches environmental economics at Vanderbraak StateUniversity in New Bruges (New Hampshire in OTL). He's marriedto lyric soprano Llysette Du Boise, whose performance at Deseret'sSalt Palace (in Ghost of the Revelator), and the best-selling CDrecorded then, has made her reputation worldwide. Lysette isinvited to perform for the tzar in Moscow -- oh, and would Johanundertake a bit of quiet diplomacy for Columbia with the Imperialgovernment, while he's there?Not surprisingly, this 'quiet' diplomacy ends in violence, but doeslead, as hoped, to an oil concession for Columbian Dutch Petro inRussian Alaska. The thriller part is well-done & fun, but the realstrength of the book is the continued development of Modesitt'salternate world, and the closely-observed details of daily life inColumbia, which shares North America with Quebec, Deseret andNew France -- and the world with Emperor Ferdinand's cruel andaggressive Austrian (Hapsburg) empire.White Nights is the conclusion of the Ghosts novels, per the dustjacket, but I rather hope Modesitt decides to continue. I've becomefond of Johan, Lysette, New Bruges, the petty academic politics atVanderbraak State, the Stanley steamers, and the slow pace of life inColumbia.OTOH, Modesitt doesn't do well with long series..."},{"Title":"Ghost of the White Nights","review":"A different book from the author.

A good look at the west as it realy was."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"An autobiography by a natural story teller. Its conviction and power will bring the reader closer to life in the wild west than anything else in any medium - a true american masterpeace, equal to Melville any day."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"Andrew Garcia was blessed with an open mind and a keen memory. He was fortunate to have lived in a time and place on the cusp of cultural interface, european/native american, native tribe to tribe, and spanish/native american. He obeserved it all from within and without and recorded it in a memoir filled with love and humor. The people he met in that time and place speak in their own voices, still strong and true after more than 100 years. Above all else it is a memorial to his Nez Perce wife In-who-lise, a suvivor who saved him more than once. We are priviledged to be taken along the trails of the mountains with them both."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"A captivating story of adventure and love in 19th century Montana. This could be an award-winning fictional novel, but it actually happened. A must read for lovers of Western history. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"An amazing book of a time that is long gone. Recounts the author's life as a trader/trapper in Montana when the old West was only a few years from passing into legend."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"I only have a moment to say that I followed this man to the frontier of America expecting an autobiography of adventure and a view of history. I found a story of all that, and how love can be given by fate and taken as quickly"},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"This is supposed to be a true life story and part of it apparently is as no fiction author would write about some of the things related in this book. Some of it therefore has to be inspired by life events. Other parts of this book can only be made up as neither the author nor the characters in the book would have had the detailed information provided. The stories of the intertribal conflicts of the Nez Perce and the murder of John Hays are examples. How could the author or his wife, a teenage squaw, come to know the conversations held between Nez Perce chiefs or renegade warriors they never met.The story is uneven but then that has to be expected when one tries to write a book based upon the unpublished notes of someone who was basically uneducated and who has died. In one section of book the storyline does not even follow from one event to another. You simply start the next chapter with a whole new set of circumstances.Somehow all Indians speak as if they are poets. There is a beat to their conversations that reminds me of \\"Hiawatha\\". To maintain the beat certain phrases are repeated and repeated. The same is true for some words such a \\"evil\\" and \\"furious\\". By the time you are halfway through the book you have come to understand that everything is \\"evil\\" and/or \\"furious\\".Only parts of this book are believable and well written but it is still a fairly interesting read."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"The fortunate discovery of this manuscript gives the historian as well as seekers of true romantic adventure nearly more than one can stand. It is autobiographical, can stand on its own merits, but is best appreciated when read in conjunction with other books of a more general nature dealing with the Indians, their loss, the white man's gain, and the pursuit of Manifest Destiny. Love it its narrow sense; appreciate it in the broader."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"I purchased a copy of \\"Tough Trip Through Paradise.\\" Simply stated - it was delivered on time with no problems in shipping or the quality of the book."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"I was hooked on this autobiography from the moment I opened it to see if I might like it. The first page has the following: &quot;Montana, 1878 - Andrew Garcia left the army at 23 and went out with a party of traders to make a living among the indians in the Montana wilderness. Soon he acquired the name &quot;Squaw Man&quot; and an indian wife - the first of three. Indians, frontiersmen, traders, trappers and the &quot;Boys in Blue' - all were part of his &quot;paradise&quot; between two worlds and two eras of History in the old West. This is his story, discovered in a dynamite box in the cabin where he died at the age of 88.&quot;And after the first paragraph of the introduction I was hooked: &quot;In 1948 I found the manuscript from which this book was written. It was stored in dynamite boxes, packed solid in the heavy waxed paper that powder comes in - several thousand pages of legal-sized paper, both hand writtena and typed. Also in the collection were newspaper clippings showing Andrew Garcia at meetings of the Society of Montana Pioneers through the 1930's........&quot;Magnificently edited. A wonderful adventure story, wonderfully written and very readable, about one man's unusual life, which, in retrospect, in many ways was very priveliged... a way of living which could never be duplicated.."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"An incredibly moving glipse of an ordinary man's effort to live -- not just survive -- in the rugged wilds of the Montana West. As life unfolds, the biographic tale reveals a deeper, more spiritual quest for quintessential American values: truth, fairness, and peace -- in life and in love, among many different people from many diverse cultures. An odessey encompassing a tableau of Native American peoples, and an equally complex canvass of European settlers, French trappers, and a stalwart Texas-bred Mexican-American Westerner as hero. Literally too honest and good a story to be mere fiction. I read a dog-earred, creased, many times read borrowed paperback copy. I'd really like to own my own hardback, and a bunch of paperbacks to give as gifts to many others."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"Reading this book had a deep effect on my life. When it was first given to me I only had a vague idea about Montana. It was somewhere up there. I started reading it and it shocked me. The writing was not quite proper grammatically correct english you see, it irritated me so much that I stopped and put it away. But I had been hooked and I went back to it. This second time around I just could'nt put it down and wish it did'nt end. The dream of Montana became stuck in me.In 1980 I had the good fortune to find my way to Bozeman and by an unimaginable stroke of luck I even met Ben Stein the editor of what had become my favorite book. Tough Trip Through Paradise is very much also the work of Ben Stein. Ben had gone through the original found writings to form the book. Andrew Garcia and Ben Stein are now gone. But the remains of the story are still here with us. The site of Fort Ellis just east of Bozeman has been excavated and located. The building where Walter Cooper outfitted Garcia is still here on Main Street.The Musselshell still flows.If you take a trip to the Big Hole Battlefield monument you'll see the markings of the battle. A photo of In-Who-Lise hangs in the museum but there's no connection made with the book.Somehow Andrew Garcia and Ben Stein were able to conserve the essence of the 1870's and take us to that time. Not by telling us how it was but by making us feel it. This was their genius. It just seeps into you. Sit, read and just let yourself experience those times. The west as it was, the indians, and others who played their part will be changed forever in your mind because you will have been there."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"I have read this book several times and it is a favorite title for me to give as a gift. Simply told, it is a very honest story about real life. A case where truth is far better than fiction."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"This is a fantastic book. It was interesting from beginning to end. It tells in realistic detail the life of Andrew Garcia in the wilderness, his life with Indians, and his life with his beloved In-who-lise. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning about life in the wild, about life with Indians, and about the other side of the story of the tragedy of the American Indian. The episodes about a bear invading his camp and about the murder of John Hays were remarkable. This is one book I was sorry to see end."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"Until this book popped up as an Amazon recommendation, I hadn't realized how much I missed it, how sorry I am for giving away both my copies. Whole scenes from this book still seem fresh after 35+ years even though most of the text has faded into fog. I doubt you'll find a more comprehensive, close-up look at life in an encampment of the (remaining) plains Indians of 1978-79. Their tribal politics, their marital squabbles, their memories of lost battles, their tribal raids and barter habits. I was living in Western Montana then and could visit the places described.Most vividly I recall his terrifyingly hilarious midnight adventure in a tipi high in the Pintlar Range. The main players being the author, his squaw, their dogs and muzzle-loaders, and a large grizzly bear. The tale is worthy of the best of Mark Twain.This isn't your ordinary Mountain Man Tale distilled posthumously from public record and old letters by a history Ph.D. This is (impure) autobiography pieced together from a wooden boxful of ancient photos and papers scribbled by the man who lived that astonishing life. His memories and opinions are filtered by Ben Steins editing, but they're either unmistakably his own or the most imaginative and readable forgery ever ever published.Today I'm buying it again--for the third time. A book this good shouldn't be gathering dust in the back shelves of a used bookstore."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"This book was writen by my great grandfather and i find it to be very interesting and realistic. He tell how it was just a few years be for the extinction of the Plains Indians. His nine years living among them was an adventure witch impelled him to dress the part and gain there trust. Hunting, trapping and traiding while no other white man could."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"an excellent book for history and western america buffs, as well as pure entertainment. garcia's linguistic ability is not perfect, so don't take the translations of Indian names/words as truth, but an excellent, entertaining read. I couldn't put it down and wished it was longer when I was finished."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"The book is great if you like real stories of real lives in the little forgotten west. Andrew Garcia had a love of the land and was such a great story teller that it is one of my favorites of life in Montana when air was still clean and fences were few."},{"Title":"Tough Trip Through Paradise","review":"Gives a true to life description of life at the end of the mountain man era, with eye witness accounts of what life was like for the American Indians during this time period. It totally refutes the Hollywood images of Mountain Men, Indians, and Old West robbers and highwaymen. It is also a love story set in a rough and brutal era of American history. I wish I would have found it 40 years ago."},{"Title":"Learning English with the Bible: Spelling & Composition","review":"We have been VERY pleased to date with this series of English books.

I am impressed that the author came up with so many smells to include. Both my girls (ages 18 mos and 3) enjoy listening to this book and sniffing the scents. Not only does the book include a variety of smells, but it incorporates the smells in the scenes of Christmas and the sounds of Christmas. It seems to enhance the traditions of Christmas. A drawback to the book is that it has quickly lost its smells or maybe we have simply sniffed the smells all out too quickly. Another drawback, like most children's books today, the author uses passive, lazy verbs when more vivid verbs could have been used, such as the author's writing \\"had\\" instead of \\"ate\\" or \\"gobbled\\". Overall, The Sweet Smell of Christmas is a worth-purchasing book."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"We received this book as a gift for our 1 year old last year and we are reading it again this year.

He just likes to skip through and smell the 6 'sweet smells of Christmas\\": Apple Pie, Pine Tree, Candy Cane, Gingerbread Boy, Hot Chocolate, and Orange.The main down side of this book is that the scent wasn't very strong to begin with when we received the book new last year and this year it is barely noticeable. The publishing date on our book is 1998, but I'm not sure if it's been hanging around for that long or what. I would hope that it has been reprinted since then and if so has a stronger scent.I'd recommend this book for the fun and novelty factor even if the scent isn't all that strong."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I had this book as a child and loved it. A sweet story about Little Bear and his parents preparing for Christmas. Getting a tree, decorating, baking, waiting for Santa. Features 6 scratch & sniff stickers. Apple Pie, Pine Tree (my favorite), Candy Cane, Gingerbread, Hot Chocolate, Orange. Just as I remember from my own book as a child, the Gingerbread and Hot Chocolate are a bit faint compared to the others. However, I still love the book and I'm hoping that my niece will love it as well."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This book was my daughter's favorite. She actually ate the orange from the top of the stocking. She's now 34 and expecting her first child. She found this book in the basement and most of the scented pages still had a slight smell. I bought this book for her and for my nieces and nephew. The drawings are adorable and the story is very sweet (pun intended). I don't know any child who wouldn't love this book."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"It's a wonderful book , unfortunately it didn't arrive in time for Christmas for my granddaughter and I will keep it for Next Christmas"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"How astonished I was to stumble across this book on-line (which was a childhood favorite) now back in print. As a little boy I treasured this book, spending a great deal of time savoring the scratch and sniff smells, studying the bears decorations and The Bear Families simple traditions. Oranges, gingerbread men, coco are ALL such timeless holiday hallmarks. (Man, the hot coco scent is the best in the book. It smells as wonderful now as it did 35 years ago.) And the Boy Bear takes great joy in these simple, childhood-defining treats. Everything is exactly as you'd remembered it. Open the pages and you're a wee lad or lass all over again.If you're unfamiliar with it and have a little person in your life, I highly recommend presenting them with this sweet aromatic gem. The Sweet Smell of Christmas has taken on a new unintended relevance in a holiday which is becoming more and more consumed by possessions and electronics: in childhood and Christmas, it's the simple things that we often remember and treasure most."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I wasn't happy with the scratch and sniff stickers. It's hard to tell what the smell is. I wouldn't purchase this again."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Very cute book... My two year old really got a kick out of the scratch and sniff aspect of the book, but the story is only so-so..."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"when i found this book i had to get it as i had it when i was a child and i have many memories. the book is scratch and sniff when i received it i read it and as soon as i started to smell the scents it took me back to my child hood. the only dissapointment i had was one of my scratch n sniffers was missing it was my favorite one when i was young. i will keep this book and treasure it as its a part of my child hood. i reccomend it for small children 5 and up ."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Who didn't love \\"scratch-and-sniff\\" books, stickers, etc. when we were growing up? My toddler now enjoys this book as much as I did those books back then. He anxiously awaits the new smells on each page. We've had it a year and the scents are still strong."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Scratch and sniff has proven to add a great element to bed time stories for my little one. She loves to smell the stickers and it has taught her how to smell other things around the house like flowers and spices. This is a wonderfully illustrated little book that I also had as a child and remember loving! A+"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This book is truly adorable. What a cute way to tell what Christmas is all about. My little girl loves this book. I can't wait to get it out for next Christmas!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"My sisters and I had this book as children. When we pulled out the Christmas books for my daughter this year, the book still had smell on the stickers 20 years later. This book is one to read over and over again!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I'd never heard of this book before but purchased it based on the reviews here at amazon (great way to not wind up buying a \\"stinker!\\"). Wow, I'm so very glad that I did. My little one just LOVES this book and we have to read it all throughout the year. The scratch and sniff part is just his favorite and he really loves to remember all the smells of Christmas. Gets him going too! I have to say that the Scarry's are excellent at writing children's book and this one is certainly no different. Can't say that I'd change anything at all about this book. Oh, and when you read it, it brings back all the memories of childhood when you were young. The art of an excellent writer. Highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I ordered this for my son for his first Christmas, based on a recommendation from a parenting website that I respect. I agree that it is a nice Christmas story, but ours has absolutely no scents at all. My 5 year old niece read the book and complained that it \\"just smells like a book\\". Sorry folks, the stickers are stale. If they sold a replacement pack of stickers for it, I would buy it. In fact, that's why I came on Amazon tonight, although nothing appears to fit the bill. The scents you need for the book are: apple pie, pine, peppermint candy cane, gingerbread cookie, hot chocolate, and orange. If the scents worked, I would give it 5 stars."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"What a splendid book this was for me when I was a toddler--the scents of Christmas were so real-smelling, and the enchantment of the season were so vivid that this is one of the only books from that young young age that I really remembered (and regretted I couldn't find for my own child). Years later, it did get republished and I bought this last year for my little nephew. HE LOVED IT! Aha! I'm not that old, I guess. The illustrations, the sweet simple story, the great scratch-n-sniff smells, and the adorable story live on!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"It's a cute story. Not a classic by any means, but it is cute.The stickers do not last. The only sticker that still smells is the Christmas tree. This book has been packed away from January to November. Not used at all during that time. Again, only the pine has a scent to it.Very disappointing. Replacement stickers would be nice!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"My child loves this book ( she assumes it is the Little Bear from the TV series she loves too) and after enjoying it at someone else's house, I bought it only to find only one of the scratch & sniff stickers that works (the pine tree). One was entirely missing (chocolate) , and the rest have absolutely no smell and are shiny like they never had the microencapsulated smell particles applied. Such a disappointment, since the story is all about smelling the smells! Seems like others have had this problem too.I decided to buy smell stickers myself from a website and put them in the book. More expensive, but at least it will work for sure. We will have to get by with cinnamon smell for the gingerbread boy as I couldn't find gingerbread stickers.I also wrote to Random House, but am not really expecting them to have replacement stickers."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought 2 copies of this book for my two 4-year old nephews for Christmas. Usually, when they open presents, a book would get tossed aside (at least until bedtime) while they went for all the toys. But I told my nephews these were special books because of the scratch and sniff smells, and they looked through the books to find the smells. This is a great little book for small children!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I thought this was a great little book..very cute for 3 and under crowd. Only thing was a few of the scratch and sniff's did not work. Kinda disappointing."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought 3 of these books - one for my daughter and two as gifts. Unfortunately only one of the three works the way it should. The book I gave to my daughter had no smell on the stickers. I scratched and scratched over and over and only got smell from one sticker. I had to unwrap the others to check. One book was good and the other was not. Very disappointing after reading the other reviews. I will be trying to return the two without smells."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This book has a great story and illustrations. My 3 year old daughter and I enjoyed it. However, the scents were hard to smell. I think the only one that really had a strong scent was the Pine one. The hot chocolate and candycane for example could barely be smelled."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This was one of my favorite books growing up. I really think it is as fun reading it today as it was 30+ years ago. I still remember the story and the smells. The story is the same, though the scratch and sniff is better I think as it lasts longer and smells even better.It is a great gift for kids ages 1-9 and even good for parents that grew-up in the 70's and 80's as they will remember these books!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I remember reading this as I was growing up in the 70s. Every Christmas, it would come out and my sisters and I would spend time reading through, scratching and sniffing the panels. And like others, we definitely wore off some of the panels with our aggressive scratching.Well, my oldest son (4) recently got the latest edition of the book (which his Nana gave him - I'm pretty sure she still has the original somewhere). He wasn't sure of it at first, but soon got into it and insisted on reading it at least once a night. And of course, he's got to be the one who did the scratching. It's a fun little story that moves along but isn't too long to lose the attention to the story. He even insisted on putting the candy canes on our tree this year because of this story. Reading it with him brought back the memories (I loved the hot chocolate smell, in particular), and I smile when I see him enjoying it like I did.I can guarantee he will ask to have this one brought out next year, too."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I don't remember this book as a kid, but my mom swears I had it. Now I'm 33 and I have a daughter of my own and this was given to us Christmas of 2008. It was during Christmas 2009 when she really found this book and fell in love with it, as did I reading it to her. We just love it. As other reviewers have said, this book just evokes great memories of the Christmas season. And who can not love the scratch and sniff smells.Now here is lies the rub about this book. Only the very potent aromatic smells last at all. Pine and peppermint were still going a year later, but the rest (apple pie, gingerbread, hot chocolate, and orange) were pretty much dead. And after just one season even the pine and peppermint started to go. So what is one to do when your one of your daughter's favorite books loses its prominent scratch and sniff feature. Well you go on a sticker hunt and as of Sept 2010, I've now found them all.Since it was so hard to find these stickers I wanted to post a review of the book and a location that other parents like me could find replacement stickers. I started my search in June 2010 and found almost all of them at the website EverythingSmells.com. The only scent that seemed non-existent was gingerbread (unless you wanted to buy 2500 stickers from a custom company or cut your own out of Target greeting cards). So I emailed the company and asked if they knew of anywhere to get gingerbread. They didn't know, but kept my email and just wrote me today to tell me that they now have a gingerbread sticker for sale! So now you can get all the stickers in one place! Mind you, they will not look like the original stickers, but at least the children don't care. It's the act of scratching and sniffing that matters to them.So to the parents out there that bemoan the fact that the book has lost its smell--go get some stickers (with plenty of spares), paste them in, and re-enjoy the book with your children or grandchildren for all it's Christmas charm. I know we did and still do today."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"As a kid, this book was my absolute favorite and I read and re-read it year after year until the scratch n' sniffs were all out of smell. This book embodies all of the wonder of the Holiday Season, as seen through the eyes of a child. What could be more wonderful than the smell of apple pie baking on Christmas Eve or of the juicy orange nestled in the top of your stocking? When this fabulous book was reissued last year, I immediately bought a copy, so that I could share it with my son, who was a little over two at the time. Reading this book brought back all of the great memories of my own childhood Christmases and my son was delighted, as well. This is truly a classic to be handed down from generation to generation."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This was my all time favorite Christmas book as a youngster. I can vividly recount the smell of little bears hot chocolat and candy cane and the Christmas Tree. The wonderful sense of anticipation that any child will share as little bear waits for Christmas morning. If only this book were in print I would definitely buy a copy for all of my children and neices and nephews to treasure as a family heirloom. My childhood copy has since been lost and I would dearly love to share this story with my children. Golden Books - Please send this wonderful story to print again."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I remember reading this book to my baby sister when she was young; ( she turns 30 this year). About at this time the scratch & sniff stickers where all the rage as well as those smelly food markers! Any way.... I am very pleased that the book has been brought back in print and I love the story. The peppermint, hot coco and orange smell so good. My only complaint is when they redid this classic why they didn't make the scratch and sniff areas larger! They are the original size that they where back when ( the size of a quarter ) and I remember we scratched the sniff right off our book. In todays world where DK publishing in my opinion RULES the Scratch & Sniff books... like Food and the Garden book, why they didn't take the time to make the scratch and sniff areas BIGGER! They have the technology and I am sure none of us who originally owned the books would have complained because they made the smelly areas bigger! That is the only reason that I gave this book a 4 star rating rather than a 5 star. I have a fondness for Patricia Scary and her husband Richard... just make the scratch and sniff areas bigger! It's a cute story about baby bear and his mama and Papa Bear, I just love Papa bear's hat on Christmas morning!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This was my favorite book as a child. Now that I have a daughter, I thought for sure that it was still at my parent's home. I was disappointed to not find it. I went to order it and it is out of print. Please publish this wonderful classic again. I would surely buy several copies for my daughter, all young relatives and one for myself. I can still smell the hot chocolate, candy canes and pine tree. This is the greatest book and deserves to be in print again to be enjoyed from generation to generation."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This book is amazing. I cannot remember a Christmas that did not involve this book, the smell of the apple pie, the pine tree, the hot cocoa, the orange, the gingerbread...I even tried to lick the stickers when I was little and had to replace them with regular scratch and sniff stickers that had the same smell! I still have mine but just as I got Angelo his own copy of Little Bunny Follows His Nose (also awesome!), I am getting him his own copy of this book for Christmas this year. I will write a note under the front cover and hope that he has this book until he can read it to his own kids someday and maybe even get them a copy of their own. I love this book and it has made fond memories for both my mother and I and I hope it will make some nice memories for my son as well! If you are looking for a book to buy for a grandchild or for someone who is expecting their first baby, this is perfect (I might even get one for my niece too!) and is a book that will start a tradition of years and years of holiday reading...and scratch and sniffing. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"As a child, I knew it was Christmas when my mother brought out this wonderful book. I scratched and I sniffed, year after year, until all the scent was gone. Or so I thought... Last year, while unpacking a box of childhood books and toys, I ran across my copy. The fragrance is faint, but the memories are strong. What a magical feeling this book evokes, combining a charming story with scents that have lingered in my mind all these years. I just bought a copy for my own 6-year-old, and I can't wait to give it to him for Christmas!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"The integrity of this book is seriously compromised by the new, non-descript, circular stickers. They actually obscure the illustrations that they cover. It makes me sad that what used to be a childhood favorite is now seems so cheaply made. Also, the scents are faint. If you're buying the book for the story and illustrations it is still fun. But if the scratch-n-sniff aspect is an important component(why wouldn't it be?), you'll probably be disappointed."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"My children went through two copies of this wonderful book. We still have one copy but it is tattered and the smells are but a memory. My daughter is trying to find as many of her childhood favorites as possible for her daughter and was very disappointed that this is now out of print. Traditions are important in our fragmented society. Please bring this book back."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Some kind soul gave my 30-year-old &quot;little&quot; brother a copy when he was a toddler and, luckily, I happened upon a it five years ago to give to my own son. Now my brother's son is ready for his own copy! The story is simple: a young bear delights in anticipating Christmas. But the scratch-and-sniff illustrations tell the story so viscerally that many years later, I can still smell the orange in the little bear's stocking (and the gingerbread, pine bough, hot chocolate, apple pie and candy cane). This book proves that smell is our keenest memory sense. In both of our family's copies, the scent patches have all been scratched nearly through to the page. This year, my wish is that Golden Books would reprint thousands of new copies to put under next year's Christmas trees."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I had this book when I was a child and I still remember the scents in it. I decided to buy it for my classroom library. I took it out at Christmas time and the kids loved it. I hope that they have fond memories just like I did."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I had this book when I was a little girl, so when I saw it in my suggested items before Christmas I had to buy it. It was just as magical as I remembered it, and my 6 and 1.5 year olds agree. There is just something about this book that gives you that warm and fuzzy Christmas feeling.As parents everywhere know, some kids books are just annoying to read. This is not one of those. The story line is pleasant, and the scents are unoffensive. My children love to rub their finger over the scent circles and sniff the pages. This is the best kind of interactive book for children."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Seriously, best Christmas book ever. I was so excited to give this as a xmas present this year. I remember when I was little, my friend had this book, and we'd chase each other around the house fighting over it to smell our favorite pages. The book got so much use, it was falling apart. Decided to get it for her for Christmas this year, and also bought 3 more for my nieces. They enjoyed having me and my fiance read it to them. I think the scratch and sniff is a great way to get the young kids to interact and enjoy a book. Great idea!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"The book is cute, but it is not the book I thought it was. Good condition, good book, just not the book I was searching for. Gave it to a different recipient than originally intended."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I recently purchased one for a gift and one just for us! My grown kids were happy to see it. We wore out two copies of this book when kids were little. Everyone loved it! Great memories!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Great old book (1970) back in print. A bear family notes the coming of Christmas through smells in and around their home. Six great scratch and sniffs with very strong smell. Not sure how long they'll last, but so much fun for now! Scents include: Apple pie, pine candy cane, hot chocolate, gingerbread and orange. (though my 1 yr. old doesn't quite get the scratch and sniff concept:-)"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought this book for my grandchildren because I still had the one my daughter (who is 38) had when she was young. I read the original one to them and the scratch n sniff still had an aroma after all these years. So I ordered one for them to have and they love it."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This was a book that I had read to all 3 of my now grown children at Christmastime as they grew. I wanted to find one for each of them to have for their little ones, and now I have enough for all of them."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"My children had this book when they were small. I gave it to my 3 yrold grandson. He loves it. It is so much fun to sctrach and sniff all the Christmas scents."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Great smells in this book and great memories too. I am 49 and had this when I was a child. I buy it for my kids and my nephew this year. I hope it is always available!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I was so disappointed when I learned that this wonderful book is no longer available. My two boys (31 and 26 now) each received one when they were little and it was read many, many times and sniffed until it could be sniffed no more! I still have their copies and use one of them to read to preschoolers at the school where I am a Media Specialist. The children of today love it just as much as those of 30 years ago. I would love to be able to buy this book again so that I can give a copy to their children when they come along. Please Goldengraft, consider reissuing this wonderful book so another generation of boys and girls can smell the apple pie, the candy canes and all the other wonderful Sweet Smells of Christmas."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I thought the concept sounded really nice, as scratch and sniff can be fun for children. The book is colorful and the sniff spots are all themed with Christmas baking traditions which is nice, however the main event of the simple story is Saint Nicholas arrival to bring gifts to the little bear and the other associated myths, rather than the true celebration of Christmas as Jesus wonderful arrival."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought several scratch and sniff books for my daughter. I'm quite disappointed that this one has the father bear smoking a pipe throughout the book. I know many of us may have grown up with our father smoking a pipe, but we're trying to teach our daughter that smoking is unhealthy. I didn't realize that this book was originally published in 1970, which explains why the father bear is smoking. I guess it allows the parents to bring up the subject with their children, but I wish I had known before I purchased the book."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"It's a sweet little Christmas book that every child will enjoy. The scratch and sniff parts are mostly true to what they are intended to smell like, but not always. I have a feeling they will wear out quickly too."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought this book for my children and they loved it so now I bought several for my grandchildren and gave it to them early. They love it as well as their parents did. I even gave 1 to a Kindergarten teacher. She reads it daily to the children in her class."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This book has a great story and love how it is interactive with kids. The smells were a great addition to the story and the illustrations were well done."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I found these adorable Christmas books called, The Sweet Smell of Christmas, to give to my son's gym class friends. I have never heard of it before, but I am so glad I found them now! The story goes through all different smells that you smell during Christmas time and then has these scratch-n-sniff stickers in parts of it, so they can actually smell the things - pine trees, hot cocoa, oranges, candy canes, etc. I kept one for my son and smelled it and they smell so realistic and amazing"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I did't dream of ever finding this book, but it is the one I remember. love it the sweet smells of christmas"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I bought this for my 2 year old. However, my 6 year old likes it just as much. It is a cute book with a cute story. However I do wish it had more then 6 smell pages. The tree in my opinion does not smell that great either. I would buy it again, it is worth it."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"Love these books. Have a copy that is 25 years old and the sents are still working.

It is timeless!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I had this book as a child and looked forward to my parents reading it to us every year. The scratch & sniff brought the story to life! Now I'm continuing the tradition with my own kids.

This is sure to please any child...or adult for that matter!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I went to three bookstores in our area and couldn't find scratch & sniff books.

Wonderful memories!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This was my favorite Christmas book as a kid. I remember having my mom and dad read it over and over for several consecutive Christmases as soon as it came out of he Christmas storage box, so I knew I had to find it for my 18 month old Godson. I was shocked when I couldn't find it in either of my 2 local bookstores, so when I found it here, I snapped it up (okay, I snapped up 2, in case I ever have a kid) and as soon as I opened it, I teared up at the memories....My dad has been gone for several years, but looking through this book, I could hear his voice reading it and picture us smelling the scents together....The best Christmas book ever - Buy it - You will NOT be disappointed! (Obviously, the memories last a lifetime!)"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This is a wonderful story sharing the Christmas traditions in Little Bear's house that are similar to our own. As the kids sniff each sticker, the memories come back quickly about how we get ready for Christmas. There are six \\"smelly\\" stickers (apple pie, peppermint, pine, orange, etc.) that hold up well even with lots of scratching and sniffing. My family loves it, and it is always a big hit as a gift. It is not a religious book, but it doesn't try to hype Santa either. It is more about memories and preparation for the holiday."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"What a heart-warming experience to introduce another generation to welcoming the holiday season by reading The Sweet Smell of Christmas. My two-year old grandson simply cannot get enough. Smelling hot chocolate, candy canes and Christmas trees, talking about what we like at Christmas time and anticipating the arrival of Christmas Eve make the season more fun for all of us. I highly recommend that every grandmother take the time to share this delightful book with her young grandchildren."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"My youngest brother received this as a gift from our Grandmother. This has been a favotite of mine for 40+ years. When my youngest brother had his first child I sent a new copy to him...13 years ago. I have found that the book goes out print periodically. For years I couldn't find it. Three years ago Barnes and Noble had it. I bought all the copies on the shelf leaving just one. I have been giving them out to the next generation. Even my childern 21, 18 and 14 still like the book, however roll their eyes when I buy multiple copies. Once or twice when my children were younger we relived the entire day with Bear. Christmas trees are really cheap on Christmas eve."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I had flashbacks when I saw this book again.... I used to read it every year as a child, until all the smells had disappeared and I had to imagine them. I just read this book to my 4.5 year old son, and he loved all the smells just as much as I did. Looking forward to sharing this book with him during the season and future seasons! Definitely a winner, and highly recommended as a wholesome Christmas story.

The smells are just as I remembered."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"I loved this book as a child, and it is fun to see my 19 month old daughter enjoy it too. The text is a bit too lengthy for her at this point, but she loves to scratch and sniff and to identify the items in the illustrations."},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"This is one of the cutest secular Christmas books I've seen in a while...it will definitely make you smile when you read it, whether you're reading it to a child or not! For adults, it will bring back some great memories, and I think it will make a child anticipate Christmas even more! My grandchildren are going to love this book!"},{"Title":"The sweet smell of Christmas,","review":"It was so great to hear of other readers who are looking for this book as well.

My mother usually keeps everything, but this book is missing.

I still have my original one that I received on my 5th Christmas back in 1974. I was hoping to purchase a new one for my daughter so that she could enjoy the smells just as much as I did, but alas!

Hmmm, real Christmas spirit there) and all lacked the wonderful story that conveyed the excitement of Christmas preparations at the Bear household. I finally found my copy from 1973 last year. It smelled better than the other books I'd bought, but the scents were really faded.

It was my favorite book in the world! I loved the illustrations of little bear, but my favorite part was the scratch-and-sniff smells. I can close my eyes today and still remember the Christmas smells from the book! Now that I've grown up (I'm 25 years old now.), my mother has put the book in a chest that she keeps all my favorite things when I was growing up.

I am really sorry to find it out of print and hope that this book is brought back so that another generation can enjoy the Sweet Smells of Christmas once again. There are certain things of childhood that change the way you view the world as an adult. The Sweet Smell of Christmas is one of those things.

We had oranges in our stockings, candy canes on the tree, and hot cocoa on Christmas Eve while we looked at the tree lights in the dark.

It was absolutely one of our favorites b/c it's the only scratch and sniff book we ever had...and the only one I've really ever seen. We read it over and over again, especially at Christmas time.Then my sister's daughter got it when she was little as a hand-me-down. She is now 13 and got very upset when she realized her mother had passed it on to my 11 month old son b/c it was one of her favorite books.Due to the number of words, I would think that this book is best for 3 years and up. HOWEVER, my 11 month old loves to scratch the sticks and stick his face in the book. I don't believe he's smelling anything, just copying us, but he really has fun with it.What amazes me the most is that after 25+ years the stickers are still fragrant and ALL of us love it - from the baby to the 13 year old (who, by the way, doesn't like ANYTHING right now) to us 30+ year old moms.

Most of the stickers smell like what they're supposed to be and if you put your imagination into it, they all do.

Within 4 weeks of first opening this book, most of the stickers had lost their scents. I must add that it had only been read about 5 times during this month.

In his newest work of fiction, SEX FOR THE MILLENNIUM, Jaffe creates a chilling vision of the deterioriated state of humankind, circa Y2K. In a series of \\"extreme\\" tales which chronicle a thematic end of the world, cancer becomes the metaphor for the human condition. In Jaffe's vision, the Y2K issue is not merely a computer scare, but a miasmic finale in which the governmental-industrial combine has leeched humanity, sucked out its soul. The resulting world is an archetype of dissolution--a miasma of chaos, perversion, and antagonism.The fictions in the collection portray the extremes of human behavior which arise as civilization mutates. Sexual encounters become fetishized exhibitions of brand-name consciousness, or sadomasochistic quests for true sensation in an environment where all is homogenized, sanitized, and prescribed by corporate conglomerates. Pornographers and religious zealots become indistinguishable as they battle for the spotlight in a media-driven reality. Serial killers become the focus of popular attention, as individuated sensuality is unavailable, and all experience is merely vicarious--screen-deep. Lines are blurred and stereotypes transfigured. Jaffe's tales deconstruct and reposition valuational norms.SEX FOR THE MILLENNIUM comprises a series of sharp, sectioned texts, a pastiche of fictive inventions. The texts are simultaneously narrative and interrogatory, positing ironic image systems and fresh levels of linguistic observation. Jaffe's \\"extreme tales\\" are aggressively satirical, yielding deep sociocultural insights. His visions of the millennium are shocking and important. We must take them to heart."},{"Title":"Sex for the Millennium (Black Ice Books)","review":"Sex For The Millennium will make you tip your cream (Nestle). Pages turning with ease, it fits well in the hands, has mad flow, is perfect for short shirtless sittings. Thrust forward and commit ethical murder (Cancer Is the Mother), do and kill your mother (Cody in June) and discuss basketball with a serial killer (Circle Jerk). Like the leprous loon (House of Pain) being done in four orifices with electrified dildos, like the viscous onslaught of (mis)information rammed down our rots on and offline daily, these texts will assault you variously, simultaneously and utterly. Sex For The Millennium, like the funhouse mirror, reports a subject beyond distortion, rendered in language sharp enough to leave a \\"back full of knife cuts.\\" In line with Picasso's declaration, Harold Jaffe creates images so unacceptable their only home could be The Millennium."},{"Title":"Sex for the Millennium (Black Ice Books)","review":"Hilarious, daemonic, absolutely on target. The target is the institutional colonization of everyday life, including interior life. Jaffe lets it rip as we careen from one &quot;extreme tale&quot; to the next. As always, the writing is innovatively structured: &quot;unsituated&quot; dialogues, collages, indexes, linear narratives. The net effect is an extraordinarily potent interrogation of the dominant culture, in the name of humanism."},{"Title":"Sex for the Millennium (Black Ice Books)","review":"The situations described are shocking as the book promises. One big problem: you have difficulty following the stories. Written in a rather stream of consciousness style, the characters and events become more art than &quot;reality&quot; which I thought was the goal of good fiction, especially anything falling under the term &quot;erotica&quot;. Not erotic at all."},{"Title":"Sex for the Millennium (Black Ice Books)","review":"If you're normal, neither will you. This book is nothing but filth that doesn't make any sense.

The book is sectioned by Michelangelo's works, such as by sculptures, paintings, and architectural works. The photos are beautifully displayed and each work has a description for the reader. In addition, a chronological biography is outlined page after page as it relates to his works. Information such as his lifestyle, personal events, and affiliations and accomplishments are described. What's great about the book is the fact that it includes information about the renaissaince, such as other artists and important figures of the times. This gives the reader a feel for the period and gives an opportunity to make connections to its significance in time. A great book for both young readers and adults."},{"Title":"Michelangelo (1475-1564): The Last Judgment (The Pocket library of great art)","review":"\\"Michelangelo: Master of the Italian Renaissance\\" is part of the subperb Masters of Art series that was re-published in the United States. The series was originally published in Italy and characteristic of Italian children's books feautured outstanding illustrations. Simone Boni and L.R. Galante are two of the finest illustrators to ever work in children's literature. They are known for their intensely detailed architectural style of historical illustration. In this book, they do an outstanding job of recreating Renaissance Italy. As for the story line, it well written and covers all the key episodes in Michelangelo's long and very productive life.

Scholarly, but not very readable, knowledge of Greek would be an advantage (the Greek is not transliterated). His translation of the Greek is in bold, but his knowledge of the Greek is one of the strengths of this commentary.He regards the first seal as the word of God, the 144,000 is the church militant, the two witnesses are the true church in its witness and prophecy and the gospel in its public ministry, the woman of Ch 12 is the OT and NT church, Babylon is the antichristian empire, antichristian seductiveness, on Ch 20 he is Amillennial.Lenski is the 30th cited author in 7 modern scholarly commentaries on Revelation.

St. Peterburg, Russia in 1894 - d. Christmas Day 1995 in Los Angeles at the exceptional age of 101 years, 9 months, 28 days) was an institution. He labeled himself a 'musical lexicographer,' having written several indispensable musical reference works such as 'Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians,' and 'The Lexicon of Musical Invective' (containing hilarious entries from reviews and other sources), as well as the esoteric and encyclopedic, 'Thesaurus of Scales and Melodic Patterns.' He also wrote one of the most amusing musical autobiographies around, 'Perfect Pitch.' But before he became a scholar/writer he was a pianist, conductor, composer, and champion of modern music. For instance, he was the first person to conduct an orchestral work of Charles Ives in Europe, and in an appendix of this gargantuan book (1260 pages) he prints twenty pages of letters he received from Ives. Because he lived so long he knew just about everybody in the field of twentieth-century music. (I even met him once when he was approaching his 100th birthday.)The primary content of the book is a day by day account of musical events throughout the Western world from January 1, 1900 up to the death of Ernst Krenek in 1991. This volume, its Fifth Edition, contains all the material of the previous editions (with corrections and additions) plus 1500 additional entries for the period after the Fourth Edition.For a reasonably well-informed music-lover there is rarely a page in this book without information about events in music history that are familiar, as well as others that are interesting but otherwise unknown. To illustrate this I opened the book literally at random to pages 150-151 and found entries, among others, on the premi&egrave;re of Zandonai's 'Francesca da Rimini'; a squib about the fifteen-year-old Henry Cowell demonstrating 'tone clusters' to the San Francisco Music Club; the premi&egrave;re of 'Hashish,' a tone-poem by Sergei Liapunov; the premi&egrave;re of George Butterworth's 'The Banks of Green Willow'; the premi&egrave;re of Vaughan Williams's now-beloved 'London Symphony'; the premi&egrave;re of Franz Schmidt's opera 'Notre Dame'; the premi&egrave;re of Alb&eacute;ric Magnard's magnum opus, his Fourth Symphony; the first performance as orchestral piece (as opposed to accompaniment of a ballet) of Stravinsky's 'Sacre de printemps,' Pierre Monteux conducting. All these took place in February-April 1914. You get the idea.Also included is a section of musical 'documents' such as the Ives letters mentioned, as well as things like the Futurist manifesto, a talk by Alban Berg entitled 'What is Atonality?,' letters to Slonimsky from luminaries such as Arnold Schoenberg, George Bernard Shaw, Anton von Webern and Edgard Var&egrave;se. There are documents from Soviet Russia illuminating the control the government placed on composers and some of their responses.Also included is a valuable section of definitions of musical and allied terms applicable to the modern era with entries from abecedarianism (a gentle term to describe simplistic music - oh, what he has to say about what we would now call minimalism!) to Zen (and its influence on the avant-garde). He also defines some of his own neologisms; for instance, he tends to refer to twentieth-century music as 'vigesimosecular.' One can imagine him smiling at his mock-pompous use of such words.Slonimsky's writing style is idiosyncratic. He is frequently puckish, sometimes acerbic, always superdensely, polysyllabically multifactual; I counted 300 words in one exuberant Russian-doll-like sentence. He created an enormous number of musical neologisms to describe musical processes and styles, some of which have entered the technical vocabulary; for instance, 'pandiatonicism' to describe the process by which 'all seven degrees of the diatonic scale are used freely in democratic equality.' He takes sly pokes at music he does not admire but is never mean-spirited. He gives technical analyses of major works (e.g., his extensive exegeses of the Mahler symphonies which were premi&egrave;red in the 20th century.) He has some inexplicable hobby-horses. For instance, he gives the precise age at death of important musicians as I've done in my opening sentence. He raves about composers that few others seem to care for, e.g., the Swiss Hans Huber. He completely omits some composers that are now well-thought-of, e.g. Sweden's Wilhelm Stenhammar. He tends to go on at length about uses of scales and melodic patterns, not surprising considering his expertise in that area. But overall he is fair-minded and although not anywhere near complete - that would be impossible - the encyclopedic nature of the work requires fervent admiration. There are a few typos along the way - unavoidable - and an occasional error of fact, although it is clear that he makes every effort to correct them (there are frequent retractions of errors made in earlier editions); this even extends to poring over governmental and church birth and death records and newspaper reviews of premi&egrave;re performances.For someone like me who often writes reviews of recordings of obscure twentieth-century works, this volume is indispensable. For others who are generally interested in the musical history of the previous century it would be valuable if not absolutely necessary. Every library worthy of the name ought to have a copy. Slonimsky was one of our cultural treasures and thank goodness his words will live on.Review by Scott Morrison"},{"Title":"Race and Intelligence: Separating Science From Myth","review":"This is a great book. It takes readers from the origin of humanity to how far it has come including beliefs or myths created as populations drifted away from Africa. It's also a great analysis of how perception changes as we go from one environment to another."},{"Title":"Pyramid Handbook","review":"Now in an updated and expanded second edition, Moustafa Gadalla's Pyramid Handbook is a unique, informative, and iconoclastic contribution to Egyptology with its focus on the pyramids of antiquity. Featured are the locations and dimensions of the interiors and exteriors of the pyramids; varied theories on the construction, purpose, and function of the pyramids; the sacred geometry that was incorporated into the design of the pyramids; and a great deal more. Pyramid Handbook is fresh, original, thorough, scholarly, completely accessible to the non-specialist general reader, and enhanced with useful illustrations of the sites and interiors of the Egyptian masonry pyramids. If you have an interest in Egyptology, the Pyramids, and iconoclastic archaeological studies, read Moustafa Gadalla's Pyramid Handbook."},{"Title":"Pyramid Handbook","review":"This book contains a complete synopsis about the pyramids. Finally, there is a book that gives all the information about the pyramids, their locations, dimensions, profiles, why they were built, and how. The sacred geometry of the pyramids and pyramid power are very interesting. Well researched, and well written."},{"Title":"Pyramid Handbook","review":"From having traveled to Egypt myself, I can tell you that this is one of the best books on the pyramids I've ever read. If only I had this when I was there, I could have been so much more fullfilled. I was especially interested in the writtings on sacred geometry. I can't wait for for the next time I get a chance to go to Egypt and visit the pyramids armed with Gadalla's book. This is a must own for anyone traveling to Egypt or has ever wanted to know the truth about antient Egypt and the pyramids."},{"Title":"Pyramid Handbook","review":"In contrast to books like \\"The Giza Power Plant\\" by Christopher Dunn - highly recommended - which theorize about the purpose of the pyramids and their component parts, this brief volume offers a well-written account of each of the major pyramids of Egypt. Conveying \\"only the facts\\" of the location, design, & construction of each, this book provides a useful frame of reference regarding the pyramids.One VERY INTERESTING thing claimed in the book is that the blocks for the pyramids were \\"poured in place\\" rather than quarried. IMO, this may be reasonable to assume. However, it is NOT a known fact as the author likes to claim his book only portrays.All in all, an informative book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"REX","review":"There are umpteen different paperback covers for this book. I have one from 1968 and one from 1970, both from Corgi, UK - but it doesn't matter: the story is the same.Joyce Stranger (recently deceased) was an inexplicably underrated writer of an avalanche of animal books, mostly canine; some fiction, some not. The only reason I can give for her obscurity is that she has been slotted into 'children's' category. I'm not saying that children wouldn't like these books, but they are not candy floss. I lent 'Rex' to two people in their mid 70's and they both adored it.Without giving too much away, Rex is a feral collie (his mother fled captivity) who is adopted by a child, and then shows his genius as a sheepdog. It is set in a fictional but utterly realistic rural British village featuring many of the same characters as her first novel, 'The Running Foxes'.It is plainly written and quite rivetting. It never borders on excess, nor strays into doldrums.I thoroughly recommend any edition of this book to anyone who likes border collies, working dogs, or who lived in a rural England which has all but disappeared. It's quite wonderful, and IMHO would suit any reader from mid-teens to any adult age."},{"Title":"Preparing the Portfolio for an Assessment of Prior Learning","review":"The Assessment Of Prior Learning program is a great opportunity to earn college credits for your life and work experience.

McClelland does a little of each and so I am not sure if anyone is finally thrown out in this West Coast Florida twist up. Perhaps he has been caught up in the essential tolerance of Ceday Key and forgives even the bad guys. While Largo to Key West have an overgrowth of kooks and undergrowth of condo developers, Cedar Key has few such folk and so the author invents some characters and plots which do not quite fit into the \\"Clam Capitol of America.\\" This makes for a sort of silly plot centered around a scheme to develop a casino on the historic dock. There is a feel the author picked up some superficial bits and pieces, but missed much of the essential Cedar Key life. Additionally the novel misses the real sub-tropical beauty of this old seaport. Certainly there is anough grist on the island for an author, yet I confess I may be holding him to a standard of \\"didn't do.\\" All in all I would read this if I had it to do over, but I would not take it up as enthusiasticaly as before."},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Mix a hip shooting group of Florida islanders into a lazy island setting with apparitions and tarnished journalists and sooth saying tattoo masters, throw in a sea monster and a pirate or two and a flatulent manatee, and you got exactly the book I want to read as I lie in the sand and feel the sun on my face. It's the next best thing to a frozen drink at sunset. Not as psychotic as Tim Dorsey's creations, or quite as eco-conscious as Hiassen's, the book is a well-written little adventure that's just plain fun!"},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"Cedar Key is a small self contained place which has been undiscovered by developers and where nothing much ever happens. When Desiree Dean, a rich college student who left home to live her own life, not the one that is expected by her father. She decides to get a tattoo at Pimlico Phil?s tattoo parlor and she believes she?s getting one that says Golden Dragon but at the strip where she works as a hostess dressed up in a dragon costume, she learns the tattoo means ?with hot sauce?.She goes over to Phil?s in costume and accidentally sets fire to the place. Both she and Phil disappear and a story in a Florida paper talks about the incident. Robin Chanterelles of the tabloid The Weekly Alarm is sent down to investigate. She becomes involved in the fight to save Cedar Key from a developer who wants a referendum to get the land he owns rezoned so he can build a casino which would destroy the uniqueness of the island.This zany tale is filled with lots of off beat humor and eccentric characters that make the meandering storyline somehow always come back to the main theme of saving the island from those who would exploit it. Michael McClelland has an original and refreshing writing style that will appeal to the reader who likes to read something different on occasion. The author has the talent to put people in impossible situations and have them find a way to do what is right even if it costs them a boat load of money.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"Laughed so hard my tattoo fell off my butt, I mean my butt fell off my tattoo, I mean .... it's funny."},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"stumbled across this novel a year or so ago. found it again yesterday and, in rereading it, am remembering how light-hearted and delightful it is. yes, it has all the cliches we expect in a novel about florida after Carl Hiaasen's success, but there's an originality and lightness there that is all McClelland's own.once heard that \\"smile comes from within\\": reading this novel will nurture that smile."},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"Purchased used book through Amazon.com.

For anyone who has fallen in love with Cedar Key, it's a MUST READ. The author certainly knows the unique island in the Gulf of Mexico and uses his knowledge of the people and places to his---and the reader's---advantage. He uses the real names of places and some characters are composites of actual people.It's not just another wacky book about Florida.

I couldn't find his second, Tattoo Blues, anywhere but on Amazon. Used, at that. I happily bought it. About half-way through he seems to lose his way, or his voice, or something else one wouldn't want to lose, and it shifts from easy-funny to strained. Don't get me wrong - I'm sympathetic to messages about ecology,and \\"green,\\" and tolerance, and the impovrishment that comes to any culture that sets monetary wealth as the primary value on all fronts. That's all fine in a novel, but not when it causes the author confusion with his plot and charachters as he works to get it all in there, sometimes drifting towrds the obviously contrived or even the maudlin. Maybe there will be a third novel, and McClelland will have regained his voice, thus effectively delivering a smashing read that includes the undelying \\"message\\" as an inherent and flowing part of its body."},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"This book is a great gift for your friends who have gotten or are thinking about getting Chinese Character Tattoo's...

The author continues to introduce the wonderfully eccentric characters -- it's impossible to get bored and altho the end is somewhat predictable (reason for 4 and not 5 stars), it is enjoyable, completely angst free, entertaining and leaves one feeling happy -- not a bad deal. Anxious to read more from this funny guy."},{"Title":"Tattoo Blues","review":"as a huge fan of both carl hiaasen and dave barry's hilarious characters and their ability to set them against relatively standard plots in the setting of a corrupt florida political landscape - i grabbed this on a whim in an airport bookstore (should have been a bad sign right away). mcclelland borrows heavily from both authors in concept and his attempt to create people who beg a suspension of disbelief to anyone who'd never been to florida. the similarities end quickly. instead of creating a small cast of both connected and inadvertently connected characters that are both fully fleshed out and utter self-parody, mcclelland creates an ensemble of 20+ people who only become loosely connected at the novel's predictable and uninspired conclusion. these people aren't self-satire, by florida citizen standards or otherwise. barry or hiaasen would revealed each of these players' character eccentricities by page 10 and fleshed them out. that creates humor, concept alone does not.for a novel that claims to be a mystery and a comedy it presents only the loose potential and zero execution of both. if you, like me, were going to pick it up expecting an analogue of the other two writers' biting satire and breezy but engaging writing style - don't bother."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I expected a dramatic book about mountaineering (in the beginning), survival, and determination but got mainly a memoir about family problems, bouts with depression, childhood and earlier climbs. I really tried to like Beck and I do admire his ability to come back from death and recover; but does one need all this drama and trauma to make a man realize that his family and loved ones come first and are the main things in life, and you don't have to climb a giant mountain to understand? In my observations, I always find obsessions a bit weird and off-center in life. In fairness to Beck, the 1996 story has been professionally and strategically told by others, so maybe he and his ghost writer had to fluff up the pages to make a book. There was definitely enough for a great magazine story but a stretch to find over 300 pages to keep the reader interested. Enough said...Beck, hope you're back on the job and helping others like so many helped you. Mabuhay!"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Like many people I was interested in another account of how events *really* transpired on the Everest in 1996. Those details are certainly included, and they add to the picture gained from reading &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; and &quot;The Climb&quot;. Weather's book however, is about a lot more than that. His humor had me laughing out loud in spite of the obvious tragedy of his own grave injuries and the deaths of people he liked and respected, as well as the less obvious tragedy of his own personal shortcomings and their effects on people he loves. If you want gobs of technical climbing detail indeed you must look elsewhere. But for a good read and some insight into people who engage in &quot;extreme&quot; sport, curl up somewhere warm and read this book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"To date, the books about the 1996 tragedy on Everest have told this story from the perspective of other climbers. At last, Beck Weathers tells us what happened to him as HE remembers it. If you've read other books on this subject and thought that anyone who does this sort of climbing must be a bit crazy, this book is for you. With the perspective of time, pain, and recovery, he analyzes his own reasons for climbing high and shares very personally what this addiction did to his personal life. I developed a keen interest in this story because our daughter has worked with Beck's brother at Medical City Dallas for many years. She filled us in on Beck's progress through recovery and reconstructive surgery. Also, we lost a friend on K2 about the same time. Wanting to understand what drives a person to expend the money and energy to make so dangerous a climb and to go where a human cannot exist, I began to read every book I could find about this subject. Now I've conquered Everest seven times-vicariously! However, Beck Weathers descriptions of the geographical features and meteorological quirks of the mountain refined my mental pictures. His experience is a miracle, and it will convince you that the human spirit can rise above most anything! Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"While the fateful events on Everest of May '96 may have thrust Weathers to center stage, 'Left for Dead' treats them simply as a focal point in the much larger tale of Beck's life itself. This is really the story of how an ordinary guy with ordinary problems gets so seduced by the power of the mountains that he doesn't see all that has gone askew in his life until his seduction nearly kills him. I think that's something that all of us who spend time in the mountains, or are wrapped up in any hobby, can relate to. Sure, his ramblings about the nuts and bolts of his family history get really old really fast. Sure, sometimes I wonder if this book was written by Beck and Peach's marital counselor. Sure, I wonder if my lasting memory of this book will be about a married couple so dysfunctional that they were only able to express themselves through their cats. But I like the &quot;un-edited feel&quot; of the first person narrative -- there is no doubt that you are hearing this story from Beck, the ordinary husband, father and physician from North Dallas, and not some larger-than-life rock jock."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This book has a great title, as it sums up Beck Weathers' Mt. Everest experience.Unfortunately, this is the only great thing about this book. It is, at best, a mildly interesting book.

His survival, which is truly amazing, is almost glossed over and turned into a sad soap opera about a marriage gone stale with time.It does seem that Beck's patient wife, Peach, had been ill treated in the sense that he would go off to do some amateur mountain climbing (with the emphasis on amateur), leaving her with the kids for weeks at a time and remaining incommunicado.

Still, she is an utter bore.What is good about the book is Beck's sense of humor and his indomitable spirit, which is undoubtedly what kept him alive in unbelievably harsh conditions on Everest. Though it is those like him who, financially able to go on these expeditions but lacking the technical skill to effectively navigate the harsh terrain, put themselves and others at risk. While it is clear that he was delighted to be rubbing shoulders with the mountaineering elite on Everest, it did not seem to dawn on him that he was just another foolhardy dilettante who, though having had some climbing experience, simply did not belong on Everest. It is this hubris which brought him to this pass. Quite frankly, given his description of his mountaineering efforts on some of the world's other tall peaks, it is a miracle he was not left for dead long before Everest."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"\\"Our climb began in earnest on May 9. By then we'd successfully negotiated the Khumbu Icefall, surmounted the Western Cwm, and now were halfway up a moderately steep, four-thousand foot wall of blue ice called the Lhotse Face, which the prudent climber will traverse very carefully.This extreme care is a function of the physics involved. With hard ice such as that found on th Lhotse Face, there is no coefficient of friction; you are traction free. Fall into an uncontrolled slide, and your chances of stopping are nil. You're history. A Taiwanese climber named Chen Yu-Nan would discover the truth of this, to his horror, on the morning of May 9.\\"I first picked up this book knowing very little about the 1996 Everest tragedy, except that it left nine people dead, when it probably should have been ten. When I first saw the book, the photo of Beck Weathers, with a frostbitten face, reminded me instantly of news footage and magazine articles of the so-called miracle at the time. I decided to pick this book over others which I had heard about simply because it was written from the point-of-view of the man that survived the impossible.The book is easily divided into three parts: Part 1- The Climb and Rescue, Part 2- Beck's Recovery, and Part 3- What Was Learned From the Near-Death Experience. Part 1 was easily the most interesting piece of the book. It told of how Beck had gotten addicted to climbing as a way to escape the depression that had haunted him since college, and how this addiction affected his family, particularly his wife and children. It then goes on to talk about the climb, with Beck giving such specific details about his surroundings that you feel as if you are there with him. The latter half of Part 1 goes on to describe the rescue of Beck, after being left for dead, exposed on the mountain for eighteen hours in subzero weather. This part, although one of the most interesting chapters, became hard to follow simply because of the fact that Beck could not remember much, and the majority of the rescue was written through the eyes of Peach.Part 2 was a dull, slow read talking about Beck's recovery through reconstructive surgery and physical therapy. It seems to go on forever, which may have been how Beck wanted it since that is how it probably seemed for him; however, it almost makes you want to put the book down and not pick it back up.Part 3 made me glad I decided to stick with the book. It tells of what Beck learned from his experience, and how it took a near-death tragedy for him to realize he had a family and friends who truly cared for him. In addition, it makes you wonder if Beck will ever get over his feelings of depression and inadequacy.Pros: The book tells the story of a tragedy-turned-miracle through the eyes of the man who lived it. The description of the climb, and Beck's like before the climb are incredible. Beck Weathers tells the story exactly how he remembers it, and you can feel the tension he has with other people on the mountain. It makes you feel torn up one page, and has you laughing on the next; such as when he got the rescuers to sing the song \\"Chain of Fools\\" while carrying him down the mountain. The story is told like no other.Cons: Parts of the book are extremely dull and dry. The story of his recovery is agonizing reading. In some parts Beck puts in quotes from friends and fellow climbers that seem to have nothing to do with the story at the time. I wish the book had been written mostly about the climb and rescue, with his recovery and family life on the side, not the other way around.Although parts of the book are difficult to read, I would recommend it to anyone who wants to read a good book on a man's brush with death on Everest. It tells the story the way no other book could tell it, through the eyes of the man who survived death."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"OK - I admit it. I read this book without reading all the reviews. My bad - and I have no one to blame but myself. I could have saved myself the trouble.If you are looking for further insight into the 1996 disaster, don't bother. There is little of that here. Filled more with the self-obsessed ramblings over his personal battle with his wife over which of them is the worse spouse (yawn), and his own shortcomings, a great deal of this book is just poorly written and boring.If this wasn't bad enough, I have a tendency to be none too pleased when personal opinions are presented as fact. Sandy Pittman is an excellent mountaineer? Yeah right, because all of the excellent mountaineers I know are willing to risk the life of their Sherpa by having them haul their cappuccino machine up a mountain. There is more of that in this book, but I won't go into the boring details.While I admire his ability to survive, and I never begrudge anyone their opinion, this book is less a riveting story of survival and the aftermath, and more about self indulgence, self-obsession and dysfunction. It is said that most of the people who climb Everest have no business being there - oh, so true."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The image of Beck Waethers' frostbitten face is one I have stamped on my memory. I have often wondered what happened to this survivor of the deadly 1996 Everest Expedition. Beck returned to Dallas to try pick up the pieces of his life and discovered, for all intents and purposes, he had almost lost his family as well. This book is the combined stories of Beck Weathers and his wife, Peach (I was so glad to find she actually had another name). It touches on Beck's growing up, his schooling, getting married and how he became obsessed with conquering the Seven Summits. Peach adds her observations and commentary on the family that for all intents and purposes came along for the recovery. It is a tale of struggling to find self, (both Weathers)and a marriage. The most interesting thing about this book is the narritative style and the absolute honesty of both writers. You find yourself wondering if Beck will ever overcome his feelings of inadequacy and will he ever really reach out and make an emotional connection with those closest to him. There is enough about the climb to remind the reader this was a serious and driven climber. Left For Dead is more a story of redemption, and a tale that leaves its reader wondering if it will ever be completely found in Beck's mind."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I read this book and was severely disappointed in the story. I've read a lot of the accounts from the 1996 tragedy and Beck Weathers story was particularly fascinating. I truly expected someone who came back to life to really have something good to say, lessons learned, but that was not what I got out of the book. He does not seem contrite that he left his family alone most of the time for years for his climbing pursuits, comes back half dead needing them desperately. The book makes me think he'd do it over again and did not learn much from his ordeal. His wife seems extremely bitter (probably not unjustified)."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Anyone who has read Jon Krakauer's &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; should read this as well. I was curious to get a chance to hear Dr. Beck Weathers' side of the story, and he tells it in a straightforward way, not blaming anyone for the tragedy that left him with multiple amputations and several other people dead, when in fact there was plenty of blame to go around. What is off-putting are the included comments from Dr. Weathers' wife, who clearly does not understand him in the least and has consistently refused to share any of his interests (one fine example being her comment that she wouldn't go sailing with him because the boat wasn't air conditioned) and then complains that he has ignored his family. Well, it seems as if there is plenty of blame to go in both directions. Fortunately it's fairly easy to skim over the family dysfunction stuff and concentrate on the climbing. Dr. Weathers is a courageous, humorous man, and he seems to have survived his ordeal in better order than might have been expected. You'll finish the book wishing him well, as I do."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Jon Krakauer's book, Into Thin Air, is the book to read for a compelling picture of the May 1996 Everest tragedy. Beck Weathers' account would have been better left for a personal family memoir - printed for friends and family, the only ones likely to be interested in it.Obviously the experience on Everest was a radically life-altering one for Weathers, and one can appreciate that. But his book, filled with bits and pieces about his relationship with his wife and children, his (and his brother's) personal history (yawn), his wife's history (more yawns), is simply boring.Krakauer's book was riveting because it was the story of a tragedy and a mountain, and because at the end of it you felt, briefly, that you too had been on the mountain. The prose in Weathers' book is clunky, and the pieces written by friends and family are even worse.The moral of the book seems to be &quot;Make time for your family.&quot; OK ... I agree. But the point has been made better, and by better writers, and unless you're looking for something to put you to sleep quickly, skip this book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I just finished the paperback. Actually I could not put this book down. I stretched it to 10 days and have ordered another round of Everest books (being a fellow Everest junkie like all of you.) The first Everest book I read was the superb &quot;Into Thin Air.&quot; Since then, I have been finding all the subsequent Everest books on Amazon.The only complaints I have about this book is the lack of high quality photos (paperback version), the only photo's being grainy blk &amp; whites group shots of Beck Weathers and friends. The other is that there is a rather large section of the book going into deep detail on Beck's family tree. I skipped that part and went on to experiences Beck had on the other 7 summits of the world and the narrative was worth the purchase price ( I had bought &quot;The 7 Summits&quot; and the narrative was so bad, I could not finish that book...and what an interesting subject. Too bad that book wasn't written by a good ghost writer.)For Everest junkies, this book is very well written and gave me some insights into my own marriage. Beck has had a life-long mid-life crisis it seems and Everest finally purged the demons from his life. I hope he lives a long happy life."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"By about halfway through I was bored with this book. I read this book because I thought it would be about his experience on everest, how he got off, and how it changed his life. If that is what you want to know about then read the first three and the last three chapters and you will have read just that. However, this book talks more about his life growing up and his wife. I think what bothered me most about this book is that the opinions of his wife, kids and friends are interjected. A lot of the time they all repeat what the first person had said. There are even times in the book where his wife and him are arguing within the text. It is almost like they sat down and told the story to someone else who recorded it and they wrote exactly what they had said. Disagreements and all."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I'm laughing from reading the other reviews....this book was definitely a bait and switch but I still mostly liked it even though Mt. Everest figured only as a backdrop. It was more like reading someone's personal journal and I did find it interesting. Actually, I listened to the unabridged tapes. I am sorry to say this but the reader was horrible and grated terribly on my nerves... almost to the point of not finishing. My biggest complaint was the reader's rendition of a woman's southern accent. Maybe the real Peach really sounds like that but I live in the south and the accent sounded totally fake to me....the way a non southerner would imagine it. Also, I'm nit-picking but there were several mispronounciations: the worst for me as a nurse was calling an AMBU bag an \\"AMU\\" bag. I guess Beck didn't listen to the tape???? Also....hello, Beck? One doesn't walk into a hospital for a summer job and work as a \\"Scrub NURSE\\". Last time I checked we still had to go to nursing school and take state boards before practicing as an RN. I'm splitting hairs...I guess he was referring to a scrub STUDENT? nurse/tech position but as a doc he should have known better. Like Peach said, he was NOT aware of how other people reacted to him....still isn't, I guess.As one other reader mentioned, my favorite part was about their cats. That was pretty creative and made me laugh. I did like what Beck says at the end about his spiritual side being a \\"work in progress.\\" but I didn't get the feeling he'd really made ammends with his family."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I checked this book out of the library for my husband to read because he is interested in mountain climbing. Once I got it home, I started to skim through it, and could not put it down! I thought the first part about the Mt. Everest climb was very interesting and I wish there was more description of the climb and the experiences that happened on the mountain. After reading this, I cannot understand why anyone would want to climb mountains. Every climb Beck described sounded like hell. I cannot believe how terrible he was to his wife and family, and they still stayed with him. I agree that most of the family stuff was boring. It also made Beck out to be a very unlikeable person, not worthy of much sympathy. The person that amazed me the most in the entire book was Madan KC. Just reading about his selfless, heroic act was worth reading the entire book.."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"It may seem unkind to trash a book written by someone who survived the terrible ordeal that Mr. Weathers did. However, I really think this is a dreadful book. It reads like a religious tract: man becomes separated from his family due to his obsession with (insert alcohol, gambling, work or mountaineering here), barely survives through miraculous intervention, and is a changed man from that day onward. There's almost no description of climbing here. The Everest expedition is over within the first few chapters! Instead, most of the book is a long history of Weathers' childhood and family life; why this should interest anyone is unclear. If you're looking for a book about climbing, adventure or the beauties of nature, avoid this."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"If you're wondering what happened to Beck Weathers after he was rescued from Everest in 1996... keep wondering. This inappropriately titled book focuses on the climb itself and Beck's life story, with almost no details on how Beck managed to surmount the terrible injuries he suffered while climbing Everest. Details of the climb itself occupy about 1/3rd of the book; 109 of it's 335 pages. It's the same story you've already read in \\"Into Thin Air\\", \\"The Climb\\", \\"High Exposure\\", and numerous magazine articles. Beck's telling is more informal and provides less detail than those other sources. Interspersed with Beck's narrative are occasional quotes from his wife, family, friends, or other participants in the climb(e.g. Charlotte Fox and Madan K.C.). Ultimately, this portion of the book proves unsatisfying if you're read any other material concerning the 1996 climbing season on Everest. The remainder of the book covers Beck's life story: his family life, difficulties with depression, family and marriage problems, and previous climbs. Those who bought \\"Left for Dead\\" with an interest in mountain climbing will be disappointed with the rather short descriptions of Beck's previous climbs. The final chapter, say 40 pages, describes the surgeries and rehabilitation needed to recover from the injuries suffered on Everest, along with family life at the time, and the death of his wife's brother. Again, the chapter moves along quickly without much detail. While this book is somewhat entertaining, it reads like a transcription of several hours of telephone interviews with all the limitations that implies; one wonders if co-author Stephen Michaud was simply the typist who transcribed these conversations. In the end, while you may have learned a bit more about Beck Weathers and what he went through on and after Everest, he still remains largely an enigma."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This book has a great title, as it sums up Beck Weathers' Mt.

I've read books about that specific Everest disaster, including Into Thin Air and The Climb. While both of those books were fascinating, they don't touch Left For Dead for one main reason: Beck Weathers was changed by what happened. He didn't just go \\"wow, that was close\\" and go onto the next mountain. Nor did he decide that it was a little too close, and put his energy into figuring out who was to blame for the deaths on Everest. Beck Weathers did something that took a lot more guts: he looked into his soul.The book's main story is his life, how and why he had chosen that life, and how it affected his wife and children. The climb on Everest brackets that story. The first part is an honest and chilling account of the disaster; the latter part documents his recovery, and the lifelong effects it had on him.Beck Weathers writes his story (and lives his life) with real insight and an incredible humor. He wasn't some tough, fantasy climber; he was just a man, and a deeply-flawed man, at that. But he took what happened and made it a catalyst to more than just survive, but to excel, and to change. He also puts a lot of the credit on the human support system that made this miracle possible, from the courageous pilot who rescued him, to the hurt and angry wife who found the will to stay by his side.If you want a \\"he should have tightened this rope, she should have carried her own bags\\" story of Everest, this isn't it. If you are looking for something a lot deeper, don't miss reading Left For Dead."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"After reading many accounts of the 1996 tragedy on Everest, I expected Beck Weathers' story to be one of the more interesting. After all, he endured life threatening injuries, a night out in the dead zone, an unprecedented helicopter rescue, and a long recovery period. When I saw the book, I thought &quot;Great! I always wondered what happened to that guy!&quot;I think I probably would have been better off with my own fantasies and speculation as to what became of him.His account of the events leading up to his helicopter ride off the mountain was sketchy at best. It didn't explain to the reader the difficulties in logistics, the weather complications, the complex terrain and technical expertise required to climb Everest. I suspect he remembers very little, but this doesn't stop him from stating his opinions as facts (Sandy Hill Pittman is an excellent mountaineer, Anatoly Boukreev sacrificed the Hall climbers to save the Fischer climbers, etc). These types of statements will serve to polarize readers, who likely have their own opinions of the other players and will find it annoying that this egotistical, underqualified, wealthy hiker who could afford to be pulled to the top has the audacity to speak ill of anyone else on that mountain. At this point in the book, I decided the interesting part would be his recovery, the road to self enlightenment, and the reunification of his family. Wrong again! I was subjected to several chapters detailing his family tree (who cares?), his upbringing (not relevant), his courtship with Peach (boring), and entry into the world of mountaineering (uninspired). Peach comes across as an angry uptight woman constantly left wondering where her husband has disappeared to. I found Beck to be self absorbed and whiny. His jokes appear to be made in an effort to distract others from real issues. He didn't delve deeply enough into the issues that redeemed him in his family's eyes and I was left to think they were so grateful he was alive, they just decided they'd all kiss and make up. Other than his clear vision (apparently the only time his vision was ever clear) of his family when he woke up face down in the snow, he never answers any of the obvious questions---in what ways has he changed? How does he view his family now? Are they a family, or do they continue to be 4 individuals who sometimes interact with one another? I was letdown in a big way with this book, and look forward to reading the next installment, the one where Peach discovers &quot;divorce&quot; CAN be in her vocabulary, and his kids finally say &quot;I thought he'd changed, but he didn't&quot;. On second thought, I don't look forward to that at all."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The subtitle is &quot;My Journey Home From Everest&quot; which should actually be the title. By page 99 out of page 340, Mr. Weathers is out of the mountains trying to cope with being back in civilization after going through lleh.I didn't read the subtitle when I was buying the book and was expecting most of the book to be about his time on Everest. Unfortunately it wasn't to be. By page 160 when he is battling with his psychological demons, a problematic family life, etc., it was time for me to put the book down and move on to other books. While he was successful with most of his battles and no doubt is inspiring, he uses his Mount Everest experience to springboard into his personal spiritual battle.If you want to read this book, read it as a spiritual conquest by someone who happens to climb mountains.Do not read this book as a mountaineering book.I have listened to a speech that Mr. Weathers gave to the American Bar Association and think the world of him and what he went through on the mountain.

I have read all the books I can get my hands on about the 1996 Everest tragedy - enjoying mostly what I've read - but this book has been different. It has a more human appeal than the other books. We get the &quot;behind the scenes&quot; look at what it takes to go through something like Beck did. Beck takes us through the tragedy, the aftermath, and his life before. This is truly an amazing account from an amazing man who puts the whole tragedy into perspective.

He prefers to lay the blame on a few select people with an unsettling amount of venom and self-righteousness that he doesn't use on himself on the rare occasions on which he does check himself. If it hadn't been for him, I'm sure Mike Groom would have led Yasuko Namba back to the tents, but Weathers clung onto Groom and Beidleman and even the more able women as his life was slipping from him. Now, no one knows how they would react in this situation, but hindsight after the disaster, should have given Weathers some humility, but all he seems to want to do is get in a pissing match with Krakauer, who obviously outranks him in all things moutaineering and all things male and human. If this had been the Titanic, Weathers would have jumped into the boat ahead of the women and children. Must be a peach to be married to this guy.

Everest in the 1996 tragedy speaks at last.....about his depressions, his disintegrating marriage, and his personal problems.The Everest material takes up very little of the book, and the reader will have to read other authors to find out what really happened, but the psychological study of an egotist presented here is fascinating in its own right.The author's wife and others speak to the reader, too, providing an odd contrapuntal chorus which is strangely affecting, covering mountain climbing as an obsession, the climbing fraternity, and how, as the author's wife put it, a man who &quot;only knows how to go from goal to goal&quot; falls apart.Weathers is an excellent writer, in the brief passages about his experience on Mt. Everest, he manages to make the reader understand things the other books don't, too bad he didn't continue....Lazarus needs a sequel."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"It is inevitable that Beck Weather's remarkable surival on Everest would prompt a book, but this is a book that offers inadequate descriptions of his mountaineering (although plenty about dung and bodily elimination). The comments provided by his long-suffering wife Peach and a few friends, personal trainer, and kids.... are sophomoric and boring. Weathers, a self obsessed man with a smart-alec attitude, is never likeable or particularly empathetic. To the question of whether he would do it again, his answer is &quot;Yes, Eveni if I knew exactly everything that was going to happen to me on Mt. Everest, I would do it again.&quot; Fortunately most people don't need to lose their hands to appreciate their families. The unfortunate emphasis in this book is a simplistic look at a dysfunctional marital and family relationship, and who cares. The narrative is poor, leaving the reader clammoring for better descriptions of the Everest climb from Weathers, more about the colleagues who saved his life, more details of the time on the mountain before and after the return from the dead, and its aftermath within the climbing community and the relationships then and now with those well respected and competent colleagues who helped him down,including Breashers and Ed Viesturs. Weather has no ability to bring the mountains, let alone the climbing, to life and he is always anxious to move on to demonstrate his own familial inadequacies. The few black and white illustrations are primarily uninteresting family photos. Readers are much better off reading Tom Hornheim (outstanding prose and a real ability to vividly portray the challenge of climbing, Arlene Blum (who writes with insight as well as solid descriptive narrative)Rick Ridgeway, Jim Wickwire, and of course, Breashears and Krakauer. Wish I could return this one."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"After reading Into Thin Air and The Climb I was anxious to find another viewpoint about the Everest disaster so I turned to this book. That was a mistake. I suffered through the family history at the beginning which is extremely dull. I felt cheered when I began to get to the part about Everest which was fine and going well until he began to malign Anatoli Boukreev. Many of his objections (climbing without oxygen - coming down the mountain quickly) I felt were just parroting what Jon Krakauer was saying. One wonders how Beck Weathers honestly had any idea what Anatoli was doing considering he spent most of his time sitting in one spot, snowblind, waiting for Rob Hall. It's interesting that he and Krakauer (both complete amateurs in high altitude climbing) feel the need to criticize someone that was considered one of the foremost experts in high altitude climbing. But let's get past that. After Beck complains about Anatoli not using oxygen (which actually would have left them even more short of oxygen than they already wore and more than likely would have caused at least one more death) claiming that, in effect, he was not properly caring for his clients, he then goes on to complain that Anatoli did not rescue he and Namba when he was rescuing the others. He puts it basically like this: Anatoli rescued Pittman, Fox and Madsen \\"(Mountain Madness Clients)\\" and left me and Yasuko \\"(Adventure Consultant clients)\\". So now we are to believe that Anatoli did not care properly for his clients by not climbing with oxygen but should have left his clients and rescued Beck and Yasuko? What sense does that make?I wonder that Beck was not annoyed that Mike Groom (who had actually been with them for some time) walked off back to Camp IV without EITHER him or Namba?? I wonder that Beck commended Rob Hall for staying with Doug Hansen knowing that he was likely to die also. I wonder that Beck doesn't come to the obvious conclusion (as anyone else should that has read anything about the Everest expedition) that Rob Hall should never have gone up to the summit with Doug Hansen at all and that in doing so, he chose to forego the well being of all his other clients (and guides!). But that obviously is not as big a crime as climbing without oxygen when oxygen was in short supply.The real question should be: why did Beck even NEED to be rescued? When he realized he was snow blind he should have been returned to camp by one of the guides or the Sherpas. What kind of client care is it to tell your client to sit and wait while you go up to the summit and back down again (likely a period of possibly 12-16 hours) while your client cannot see and has no way to go up OR down the mountain???? And then when you know you have a snow-blind client waiting for you to sit just under the summit with another client who is clearly not going to make it and refuse to leave?? Rob Hall had 3 clients and one guide who desperately needed help and he chose to remain with only one client and leave everyone else to fend for themselves - causing the death of two and severe injuries to the third. What kind of client care is THAT??Anyow, after I read that I could not in good conscience continue with the book. Beck Weathers probably needs to keep his opinions to himself regarding who did the right thing and the wrong thing on Everest and remember that the Mountain Madness team had all of its clients survive and with very little injury thanks mostly in part to Anatoli Boukreev."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"If you like to read about real mountaineering, try a book by Joe Simpson or Jon Krakauer.

As much as I feel empathy towards the author not only for what he had to go through on the great Chomolungma, but also for his personal problems including depression, the book is so filled with tedius bits and schizophrenic intervening voices that I ran out of empathy and patience to continue reading. A good example of a \\"tedious bit\\" is a comprehensive survey of pet animals that the author and his family had, that went on for PAGES, which I, even as an animal lover, in the end found simply unbearable. It is too bad, since I believe that this book, given the material, could have been much better. Perhaps the fault lies more with the editor and ghostwriter than the author. Either way, I am sad to report that this is the first \\"1 star\\" review rating that I have ever given on Amazon.com."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This could have been the greatest story of willpower and physical determination, yet Beck Weathers is so full of himself, does not put any responsibility on his own actions and he wants to belong to the selective group of the best mountaineers on the planet so badly, sorry Beck after reading your book you are not. He is condescending of the villages, cultures and people in the climbing regions and his jokes are misplaced. He is looking for excuses for his own mistakes. If the book was meant to describe an emotionally disturbed person with low self esteem trying to be somebody, it would have been a great success, yet everything points to the fact that Beck wants to be liked and appreciated for what he has done in the mountains and the person he has become. He survived an amazing thing, nobody has ever stood up from the death and could talk about it, why not write about that experience? The family story? Sorry no interest and bad book filling. The power of books in this genre is often the understatement and the matter of fact story telling, like: \`Endurance, Shackelton's incredible voyage', or \`In the land of White Death', or \`the Climb'. Do yourself a favour do not waste your time, energy and money on this book, and remember Beck Weathers for the extraordinary accomplishment of determination by walking of Mount Everest alive, against all odds."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Divided into four parts, \\"Left for Dead\\" is not only about Beck Weathers' near death on Mount Everest, but his life before and after the disastrous expedition. The first part of the book describes the events on Mount Everest; the second part is autobiographical; the third part is about his depression and why he took up mountain claiming; and the fourth part is about his life today. Also discussed are his marriage woes and how his marriage survived his various obsessions (such as motorcycle riding and sailing, as well as mountain climbing). The book isn't written solely from Weather's point of view; there are reflections from other people in his life, most notably his wife, Peach.\\"Left for Dead\\" is an interesting read about a flawed human being. Beck Weathers has a good, at times self-deprecating, sense of humor, and is very honest about his flaws. His wife, Peach, is aptly named, but I had to wonder why she stayed married to a man who was absent much of the time and difficult to live with when he was around. There wasn't as much about mountain climbing as I would have liked, but in the end Weathers seemed ill prepared for Everest. Mountain climbing was just an outlet for Weathers' ongoing depression and it's a miracle he wasn't hurt in some of his earlier attempts. While the book goes into much details about Beck's childhood and troubled marriage it glosses over other elements - most noticeably the cost of Beck's climbing expeditions and how Beck was able to take so much time off from work. Finally, I'd like to see an updated postscript on future editions to see how Beck and his family are doing today.This was an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The only amazing thing about this book is how it managed to get published.If you want to know about the 1996 Everest tragedy read *any other* book. Not this one.It is a badly written book. It's not really about the bad journey down Everest: it's about this guy's entire (uninteresting, middle-class republican,self-centered, suburban) life. And his wife's (uninteresting, middle-class,country club, Texan housewife's) life, to boot. Can you say 'narcissistic'?"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This is definately no \\"Into Thin Air\\" or other excellent Himalayan climbing book. It dwells on Mt Everest for the first quarter of the book, and then we have to put up with the medical, amputations and problems with his wife. Virtually no photos, just a rambling tale of the aftermath of the disaster, I have all the sympathy in the world for Dr Weathers, but planning the story ahead of time would've mad it a much better read in my opinion."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I've read numerous mountaineering books, particularly about Everest. This didn't disappoint from page 1, and the first 89 pages are as gripping as they come. The tone changes once Beck comes down from the mountain, and becomes an autobiographical, self-analytical tome about his life, before and after Everest.It was still interesting, and good to get to know more about the character who so nearly lost his life, but I found I wanted more excitement. It's why we city-slickers read mountaineering books, to get that vicarious thrill.But as I say, I enjoyed getting to know him, and now I want to go back the Part 1, to re-read the thrilling part. Because now I know him, now I care.Cheers and take care this coming Everest season x"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I have always looked beyond the flippant \\"Because it is there\\" to understand why people climb mountains like Everest. In Weathers' case, it was depression, perhaps manic-depression. While he was busy challenging his physical existence, he did not feel depressed, it was that simple. This book tells, in his own words and those of his devoted but long-suffering wife, friends, and children, the story of how this escalated to the point where he nearly killed himself. If you are looking for more facts, figures, objectivity, etc., about the ill-fated 1996 climb, read Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer, an excellent book. This, however is about Weathers' epiphany, how his upbringing and personal history contributed to his obsession with climbing, and how after maiming his marriage and his physical self, he is attempting to live a normal life. Weathers is not a writer, but I defy anyone not to be moved by the passages about his brother-in-law's death."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I'll admit I'm an Everest adventure junkie so I liked the first part of this book that told about the climb and the rescue...in fact I read that part twice. But, while somewhat interesting, his personal history didn't interest me quite as much. I borrowed this book from the library so I didn't feel bad about not loving the book...however, it did inspire me to order Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air since I lost my copy and I can't wait to read it again. You won't feel like you've wasted your time by reading Beck Weather's book but it doesn't pack quite the same punch."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Since so many others have gotten their 15 minutes of fame from this tragedy, and probably a lot of money as well, it is about time the most celebrated survivor weighed in with his two cents. His survival and recovery are indeed remarkable, but it is almost hard to care, because there is little about Beck that is likable. Some people can confess that they have behaved horribly and you then find them to be more likable; not so here. He sounds more self-serving with every &quot;confession&quot; of weakness, inexperience, and insensitivity to others. At times he almost seems to be bragging about how badly he treated his family, and how dumb his risky behavior was.I agree with other readers/climbers: there is little new material here about the climb. There are many more authoritative and well-written books about Everest, the tragedy, and climbing. This book is a patchwork of oral history from people who weren't on the mountain. What Beck can remember of the experience is summed up in a few paragraphs.What I cannot understand is why this dilletante thinks that (a) he had a right to be rescued by professionals, who would risk their lives to do so, and (b) why he so relentlessly slams those who were not willing to risk their own lives to save his. For instance, he rips Anatoli to shreds because he was not trapped in the storm with the others; instead he was back at Camp 4, making it possible for him to save three other lives. Had he been up on the summit, those three would have died. Also, Beck does not have a word of censure for the expedition leaders, who were responsible for decision making. And least of all, he sees nothing wrong with the fact that inexperienced amateurs like himself put others in danger. No one but Beck himself is responsible for his own mistakes and misjudgements, but those mistakes put others at risk. Mr. Weathers is quite selective about whose mistakes were forgivable and whose were not."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Amazing, riveting, a real page turner...all descriptions of many Everest adventures ( I have read more than my share). This one may top them all. Why? Because while most of us cannot actually go climb the highest peaks in the world like Beck Weathers, most of us can identify with the complex challenges of emotions and day-to-day life that he faces. Though thankfully, without the depths of his depression.This riveting account of how one man would be more willing to face the &quot;death zone&quot; of Everest than confront the death zone of marriage, fatherhood, his profession etc. is amazing.The best part is Weathers, who literally rose from the dead on Everest, comes back and with the intention of raising his marriage and the rest of his life from near death as well. One could come to the conclusion it is THE reason he did so.Beck Weathers has to be one of the funniest men alive. There were many times I actually was laughing out loud reading this book on the airplane (especially as he describes living conditions under the dictatorship of Muffin the cat). There were also times I was glad to be alone as my eyes were brimming with the emotion of this man and his family's journey.The book is written in a wonderful structure, with his wife and children's perspectives juxtaposed coincidently against his own. It is amazing to see two or more people view the same events from diametrically opposite perspectives.As a reader of more than 100 books a year I can easily say this is the best read I've had in years.My heartfelt congratulations to Beck Weathers, his wife Peach and their children. As with any expedition through major challenges in life, we never know if we will make it or not. And while their expedition continues, I openly admire their efforts.Simply a must read"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"If you haven't yet read Into Thin Air, do it before reading this book; it'll help put the necessary perspective to Dr. Weathers' incredible survival tale. And could there possibly be a better title than he has chosen? No other words adequately describe his situation when the other climbers, struggling themselves to survive against terrible odds, found him, determined he was dead, made it down to shelter, and told everyone else that Beck Weathers had died. Indeed, nine climbers did die, but Beck Weather was not among them. After spending 18 hrs in exposed sub-zero conditions, he miraculously regained consciousness, stood up, and walked into camp. Horribly damaged both physically and mentally by the experience, Dr. Weathers was urged and supported throughout his long and painful recovery by his wife, from whom he was estranged at the time of the 1996 expedition.In this deeply personal story of estrangement and redemption, Beck Weathers tells a terrific tale that further fleshes out Krakauer's book"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Especially liked the story of his private life and the impact climbing had on his marriage and family along with the story of Everest. Would highly recommend."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This is an autobiography, and not \\"a return from Everest\\". Not to his fault, the problem with this saga is that he spent some 12-16 hours unconscious, lying down on the ice. There were no 12 hours of wondering around, eating insects, struggling trying to survive. The man came to, walked about 400 meters in the correct direction (judging the wind), and made it back to camp. This makes his story's actual material very limited. Again, not his fault. But I could have not imagined a worse way of writing this story; and the 2.9 stars it gets at Amazon is proof of the lousy style and content of the book. There is something to be said when others' books telling YOUR story, get better reviews.The book starts with the author diving right into Everest and the events of the expedition for the first 90 or so pages; and he is done. Done. Then you need to return for the last 30 pages or so to get info on recovery, surgeries, etc. The middle 170 pages or so are boring beyond belief. His wife, who was instrumental in getting the helicopter rescue going, not only gets her deserved space to describe those painful events going on in Dallas during the rescue. But by then you have gotten used to her interrupting the story; and she does all through out the book; to the bitter end. If this is not enough, her girlfriends get into the action too (I was waiting for: PATTY: Beck never does the dishes, and Peach hates that!). You start coming across these names writing for half a page or so and you wonder \\"who are you???\\", and \\"who cares??\\".You do sympathize with the author's battle with depression and suicidal thoughts. Otherwise, as so many have mentioned, this guy is not someone you want to be stranded with alone on an island. Early in the book, you get the first hint you are dealing with someone \\"special\\". Most of us would break in new hiking boots before going for any hike. Not Mr. Weathers; he showed up at Everest with sparkling new, \\"unbroken\\" boots; because \\"I do not believe in breaking in shoes\\". Your reaction as you read that is a \\"no way!!!, you gotta be kidding!!!\\", followed by an explanation to your wife sitting next to you.This book could have been saved by adding more details on his life back. It was published some 4 years after the tragedy; plenty of time to settle in his new life and daily routine. All this detail could have replaced his childhood years (and his very annoying wife's bio).Some people don't break in shoes; some of us do not pay attention to Amazon reviews when we are set on reading a topic. Shame on me.Beck; this was supposed to be your book; not your wife's. I am sure Howie was a great man (your wife sure wasted plenty of pages of your \\"Left for Dead, my return from Everest\\" to tell us about him); but welcome to the lives the rest of us live. We all lose love ones to cancer. So you got frustrated and angry because Howie's health insurance company did not care and would not do anything for him? Well, welcome to the club; imagine the rest of us that do not have connections like you do (one of the Bush twins was in your daughter's class). I hope part of your transformation was not only becoming a better husband and father; but also a better human being."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"A extaordinary, candidly written work.It seems Dr. Weathers was for a long period lost to himself as much as to his wife and family.That he lived for climbing and nearly sacrificed his life to it is above all a much rued self acknowledged fact.That he awoke to this reality in such a state is nothing if not miraculous proof of Dr. Weathers' real and deep love for Peach and their children avalanched as it was by this deep-rooted obsession - I find no other word for it. Great people often suffer from great flaws and this prince of a guy received the grace that turned his into blessings. Beck and Peach are truly deserving of each other and their second chance. Thank God."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I am very fond of the Mt. Everest climbing books. They show so much bravery, courage, determination and spirit. Beck Weathers journey to and then home from Mt. Everest did not let me down.He was on the mountain on May 10, 1996 along with nine other climbers who perished in a blizzard high on the mountain. On the following day Beck Weathers, who had been left for dead, was given a second chance at life. The true story is thrilling and inspirational."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I'm a 16 year old beginning climber. I became interested in mountaineering because of the Everest 96 tragidy. I read as many books on that disaster as I can get my hands on. When I saw this book in a book store I couldn't wait to read it. I thought it would be great to read from Beck's point of view. There was very little about what happened on Everest in 1996 in this book. There was to much of Mr. Weathers personal life and not enough about Everest. The reader can tell that Mr. Weathers does not like Anatoli Boukreev, the only person who tried to rescue him. I found that Mr. Weathers was to boring and his wife was to cocky. I like for a climbing book to tell little about the family and much about the climb. After I read this book I thought maybe it was just me and it was really a good book. I let my uncle, who is also a climber, read the book. He said it was so boring that he could only read one page at a time. Don't waste your money on this book. I belive that, like other reveiwers said that Mr. Weathers just wanted to make some money so he wrote this book. Leave out everything written by his wife and family and you might have a three star book. I admire Mr. Weathers courage, that's why I gave this book two stars. If you really want to read a good book on the Everest 1996 tragidy read the &quot;The Climb,&quot; by Anatoli Boukreev. If you want to read just a good climbing book read, &quot;Within Reach-My Everest Story,&quot; by Mark Pfetzer. If you have some money you want to blow you can read this one or just some extra time on your hands you can read this one!"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I have not read this book and will take the advice of those who have said to &quot;skip it&quot;. I am still mystified why everyone of the experts ignores Anatoli Boukreev who was the only one to save anyone on the '96 expedition. Krakauer and the rest of them tried to point the finger at Boukreev as some sort of negligent and uncaring person and apparently have been successful in denigrating this heroic man. Weathers was in a spot he never should have been, Krakauer, Hall and the rest of them knew it before the whole thing started but did nothing. They were more interested in the commercial aspects of the entire journey. I am not interested in Weather's personal life."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I have read several accounts about the 1996 disaster on Everest, and was eager to read Beck weather's version. I think the book can be divided into three parts: an account of his climb (Part I), the story of his recovery (Part II), and how the event has changed his life and given him new perspective (Part III). Part I was enthralling, although I was somewhat disappointed that it did not contain more detail as seen through his eyes. Part II was very slow and agonizing reading. I am glad that I stuck with it as I found Part III somewhat redeeming. The organization of the book is frustrating. Certainly, it was worthwhile to hear other perspectives from Beck's family and friends, but there could have been a better way to incorporate this information other than sticking quotes in places that often times seemed not to make sense. If you a a true Everest addict, this is a must read. But if you are looking for something as well written as Krakauer's INTO THIN AIR, then this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Having read just about all the books that are out regarding the 1996 Everest expedition I didn't have much hope that Dr. Weathers would have anything much to add. But I was wrong, I was surprized by his openness and surprised too to hear the rest of his story. It's an amazing story in more ways than one. Dr. Weathers has a way of writing that is very personal, almost like you could hear him speaking. I enjoyed his droll sense of humor, dotted though out the book and learing how his mountaineering career got started, the training that he did. I liked the comments from his wife and kids I though they added another dimension to the story."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The first 120 pages of this book are mesmerizing. They deal with the climb from his prespective. His writing style and comments can be very humorous at times in dealing with this massive trauma he was facing. Clearly, he looked death in the eye and has come out a better man. I started this late at night and couldn't put it down until I finished this section.The rest of the book deals with his family relationships (poor) and his early struggles with depression. There is no question this reads slower but I am still glad I read it. Clearly, his marriage was on the rocks from his noncaring attitude and he admits as much. Climbers may not like this part of the book but if you are involved in a intense personal relationship but have lived your life as an &quot;A&quot; type individual, read this to learn what might happen to you. At one point, he admits the accident was a positive experience for his interpersonal relationships even though he lost his hands. That's a powerful statement.This book has something for everyone but maybe not enough for any particular type person. I applaud Beck Weathers and wish him, his wife and his kids well. I enjoyed the book but make sure you're ready for both sides of the story. Hard core climbers who are only in it for the thrill may be disappointed with Beck's life lessons."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I am fascinated by stories of high-altitude climbers, and have read a few. After readingInto Thin Air 1ST Edition, I thought it would be interesting (to say the least!) to get Dr Weather's take on the events of May 1996 on Everest. NOT SO!I found this book to be literally _unreadable_. Not only is it poorly-written, but the more of it I forced myself to plod through, the more I disliked Beck Weathers. He came across as profoundly selfish and self-centered, shallow, and a whining, self-aggrandizing braggart, with nothing, really, to brag about. His mentions of his wife and family only reinforced my opinion. Any sympathy I originally may have had for Dr Weathers was very quickly drowned in my dislike.In my opinion, rich, bored, \\"clients\\" who spend tens of thousands of dollars attempting to trivialize huge, magnificent peaks into their next \\"mine is better than yours\\" vacation have no business at all in \\"the death zone.\\" (It is called that for a reason, get it?) I wouldn't wish what happened to Dr Weathers on anyone, but why was he there in the first place?I could not finish this book. I actually threw it across the room in disgust. The ONLY good thing I can say about it is that at least it was Dr Weathers himself ringing the register to cash in on his own suffering.Do yourself a BIG favor, and read something by Maurice HerzogAnnapurna-Heroic Conquest of the Highest Mountain-26, 493 Ft.

It was very difficult to stop. The heartfelt story of Beck's astonishing walk to Mount Everest's Camp Three; his rescue by an helicopter; his recovery; and his family. . . It was hard to keep from crying on occasion. A great story!"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Unbelievable. That's all I can say. There isn't a soul on this planet that could even begin to comprehend what Beck Weathers went through high in &quot;The Death Zone&quot;. This man literally defied death, having been left for dead 3 times and surviving by sheer force of will and his love for his family. This side of the 1996 tragedy hasn't been told until now. Several books have been written about that fateful climb, but Weathers' account delves much deeper than that deadly storm. He gives us all a look into what drives many of us to reach for such lofty and deadly goals."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Dr. Weathers who is quoted in the title of this review is many things. His ability to joke about the damage he sustained is unusual. Perhaps surviving such an ordeal grants perspectives to those who live through them, whether the experience was begun by choice with terrible results, or an equally terrible random accident.Ever since the events of 1996 I have become almost preoccupied by the stories of that expedition as well as others. I have read all the books, and probably have more volumes than a non-climber would be expected to have.This book is unique, as the author does not point fingers or make judgments about what happened or the individuals that were involved. There is one exception but that is my opinion only. Dr. Weathers does a better job than others of paying tribute to those who survived and those who did not. He often would make a comment on how an individual should be remembered by using positive memories as opposed to apportioning blame as previous books have.One &quot;professional review&quot; described this expedition as a &quot;fiasco&quot;. Dr. Weathers would probably let this affront to those who survived, those who died, and the families left behind, as a comment made by a writer in need of a dictionary.Anyone who has the courage to climb one of these mountains is many things, but they are not planners or participants in fiascoes, or as Oxford states &quot;a ludicrous event&quot;. They are adults who make they own decisions and attempt what few ever have or will do. This does not make them better, but it certainly does not open them to ridicule that oozes from ignorant writers of insipid book jacket reviews.This is a very very personal account of what Dr. Weathers and his Family and friends went through. This is not a moment-by-moment recounting of the Everest trip, rather a reflective look on his life that is painfully candid, together with equally personal comments from his family.This is completely different from previous books; it extends way beyond the confines of one author's attempt at spin control, to include the extended group of people that wait thousands of miles away during these assault attempts. It includes the hellish weeks for families and friends, and the type of relationships that can survive this extreme sport.These people choose to go where they climb, and they take the associated risks. Is every decision on every assault perfect, no more than any other day in any other life. The real climbers are of the same &quot;right stuff&quot; that can be found in other high-risk professions. The fact that for most climbing is not a career, does not mean their judgement is questionable.As I have read all of these books, my fundamental respect for these people as a group has grown. Are they perfect, who is? Before anyone throws out a word like fiasco, let him or her attempt that which is almost impossible. Until they do maintain your ignorance in silence, it looks pathetic when published.Great read, amazing men and women climbers, and the families and friends who support them."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Beck Weathers story could be the most incredible individual survivor-story in the history of Mt. Everest and possibly in history. The first-person account of what he went through is worth the purchase price of the book. One definitely learns a few things about the various participants that tragic season that aren't in the other published accounts. Like most people have said in their review of the book, the last half was BORING. It's a fairly entertaining read right up to the point that he is in a Kathmandu hospital and then he manages to bore us to death with his family life. The thing about it is that this is such a recurring theme in mountaineering. A climber's first love is the mountains. Everything and everyone else take a back seat to the climb. Basically, this was Beck Weathers' problem and he was only able to see the value in his family when he thought he would die. I mean, you're somewhat happy for the guy that he has re-evaluated his life and discovered what's most important to him, but it's difficult not to think that if he hadn't have been such a selfish bastard to begin with, none of it would have ever happened. Like I said, the parts of the book that detail his experience on Everest were riveting, but the rest of the book could have been left out."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Beck Weathers' account of the tragedy on Everest offers something that the others do not: a picture of the dedication and self(ish) sacrifice demanded by the &quot;big&quot; climbs. The value of this account is the hardship that Everest claims on the families of climbers before, during and after the expeditions. I would recommend this book to climbers and their families as a tale from a man who had it all, and didn't discover it until he was left for dead."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"After reading Into Thin Air by Jon Krakauer, I wanted to read more about the disaster on Mt. Everest. I found this book, although not what I expected, to be a very telling book about Beck Weathers. He was a very selfish, self-absorbed man who had to go through near death to appreciate what was around him, a.k.a., a family who loved him, a good medical practice and friends who liked and cared for him.Is it an exciting read from the perspective of an adventure enthusiast? Somewhat. Is it an exciting read from the perspective of a man reclaiming his life and learning to appreciate the simple things? Absolutely. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"To be perfectly clear, I am glad I read this book. The problem is that I'm only glad to have read about 20% of it, the rest is stuff that I frankly could care less about. Now, there are people would appreciate the soap opera Weathers describes as the relationship between he and his wife deteriorates. You can find these people in the trash-novel section of your local booksture. The folks who browse the mountaineering section of said bookstore are more interested in the 20% that I was referring to above - The actual experience on everest and its aftermath, which is presented honestly and is quite intriguing. Even gripping. It has value. It is worth the $7. It is the reason why I gave this book two stars, not one. However, the majority of this book is a chore to read."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I was expecting more of an account of the actual Everest event, which I had previously read about in Jon Krakauer's excellent book. This was a poorly written account of the author's time on the mountain, with much more gratuitous writing about his relationship with his wife. While I ultimately did finish the book, I wondered why they felt the reader would be interested in much of the book past Part One, and why they felt compelled to share this personal information. Proceed with caution."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I have been fascinated by the 1996 disaster on Everest after having read Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air.\\" I then read Anatoli Boukreev's \\"The Climb\\" and Matt Dickinson's \\"Other Side of Everest\\" before reading Beck Weather's \\"Left for Dead.\\".I found the first part of this book very interesting but it lost me in the part about his recovery. Too long and just not as interesting reading for me.An ok read but doesn't compare to the other ones I have read about the tragedy.For other books that I found gripping and well worth reading, see my other reviews or my listmania list. I am an avid reader of true adventure and/or survival stories."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I think this book would appeal to the sort of people who are trying to search out answers to questions about what motivates mountainclimbers. It has often been suggested that mountaineers (mostly,but not exclusively men) are completely ego-centric beings, lacking in some capacity, unable to form relationships which have primacy in their lives. That most certainly seems to be, or have been, the case with Mr Weathers.This is not a book for someone just interested in derry-doing and gonzo activities, though the first part of the book is an excellent account of the &quot;miraculous survival&quot; we have learned about from various other books, and an account of &quot;what happened next&quot;.I enjoyed the way the book was structured with the other voices added at various times. Mr Weathers survived and was able to set down his story. In another book I loved, &quot;The Fragile Edge&quot; by Maria Coffey we hear about the destructive nature of this sport on intimate relationships, the devastation left behind, but because her partner and his friend died, we don't have the benefit of their thoughts on the matter.I agree with the reviewers who said that Mr Weathers was fortunate in the extreme to have both the money and the political connections to be able to take off as he did, and be brought back. If people with lesser means and less social standing than a rich pathologist abandon their families, then they are condemned for following dreams , chasing windmills.It is my personal belief that there is something quite odd about people who feel they have to conquer nature in this way - people are NOT meant to be hauling themselves into death zones! It is fundamentally selfish. I thank Mr Weathers for his honesty. I know I would not have liked him, but am glad that he survived to tell his story and make a scond chance with his family."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"7 years ago , I was diagnosed with non hodgkins lymphoma, and not curable, I read this book 5 years ago in the peak of my mental struggle, it was a turning point for me, I empathized with Beck, am I going to die?, or walk down that Mountain, even when he walked into the camp he was written off, only he knew he would survive, after reading this book my fear went away of my own mortality. That is what this book did for me, I am happy to report I remain in remmission."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I have read several books and many articles relating to the 1996 Everest disaster and was looking forward to reading Beck Weather's account.Instead, we get a whiny, pathetic tale of poor little rich man who needs to indulge his every obesession and whim at the expense of his family and friends. Although his tale of survival on Everest is amazing, in the context of this book the reader will be amazed that Mr. Weathers lasted so long as to get to Everest in the first place.The writing is horrible and self-serving, with interludes from various people in his life, including his wife and friends, many of which seem to have nothing nice to say about him.Conversely, one may find it tough to relate to Mr. Weathers or those who interject themselves into the narrative, in particular his wife Peach whose life seemingly revolves around the gossip of other North Dallas housewives and standing a top a high perch of revolting moral righteousness [at one point, she acts like a divorce is akin to cold blooded murder]. About two-thirds of the way through the book I was hoping that somehow Mr. Weathers and his wife would both find themselves trapped in a hopeless cold, this time without such a happy ending."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I believe that I am one of the few who actually enjoyed this book. I started reading with low expectations. I had seen Dr. Weathers speak.He is an engaging person, but after listening to Dr. Weathers, I knew his book would not be a another version of INTO THIN AIR, John Krakauer's tale of the 1996 Everest disaster. However, I like the book's format. I wanted to hear his family's and friend's input. This story is about physical, emotional, and psychological abuse. Dr. Weathers was a very self-absorbed man. He abused his body in preparation for the climbs besides abusing himself during all the climbs. None of the climbs were magical or wonderful but a case study in surviving under the most brutal conditions. Dr. Weathers emotionally abused his family by being an absentee husband and father. He emotionally abused himself by not seeking help for his severe depression. He psychologically abused his wife by ignoring her and leading a seperate exstence within their own home. How his family survived and stayed together is truly the miracle. The book does not to attempt to find all the answers to Dr. Weather's troubles. In fact, I would like to know the financial costs for all his expeditions to climb the highest peaks. He never discusses them. His partners probably would not given enough credit. How was Dr. Weathers able to take so much time off from work? He was gone for 4-5 weeks several times. Most of us employed or in my case, self-employed, can not accomplish this feat."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The book was okay. Beck talking about his climbing and the incident on Everest was great. Even the background of his life was nice as it gives the reader a little window into who mountain climbers are. Not ever climber begins climbing at age 5 like Messner. The reason I'm giving this book only 3 stars is because of the \\"other\\" writer, his wife Peach. She simply bashes him throughout most of the book. Rather than admit she mad a mistake herself and got married to beck too young, she comments throughout the book about how everything is his fault. He is the one with the problem. What sadden me was that towards the end Beck starts agreeing with her. For her comments in a majority of the book I give it 1 star. All the additional comments by his children and others, especially his wife's friends, gets a bit much (I had to skip over some of it-male bashing etc). As a climber myself I'll admit he did climb some impressive peaks prior to Everest. It's sad that he didn't get to complete the 7 Summits. As long as you don't read Peach's comments then it's a good book; read her comments and you'll be very annoyed."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I suppose I was expecting to read more about the climb and the months he spent with the group of people he was climbing with. But the book seemed to me to be more about his wife's life who comes across as a woman who would make me very tired. I kept getting this impression of her standing over him with whip in hand telling him how she wanted the book wrote. I had to force myself to even make it half way through. At that point I finally told myself that this thing is not going to get any better. I then closed the book and never finished it."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"There was nothing compelling about this book. I expected much more writing about the actual climb and less about Beck Weathers personal family history. I don't care to know about such intimate details regarding Beck's marriage or what his children think of him.Also, I was amazed at some of the medical references he made such as not knowing you don't necessarly feel thirsty when you are dehydrated....isn't he a doctor???Honeslty, If I was climbing Everest, I would not want a person like this on my expedition...the eyesight, the lining under his clothing...some of this is common sense."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I'm glad Beck survived, that is truly inspiring. I would probably go and listen to a lecture by him. However, don't buy this book if you expect interesting climbing stories. It's more about family dysfunction. In 10 minutes you can glean most of the climbing out of it.The rest of the story? Pull out 20 years of poorly written, overly long Christmas letters from eccentric 4th cousins - substitute names and you have this book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This is a very interesting and heartfelt book about Beck Weathers and his family and the effect that his mountain climbing had on their life. When he was in serious trouble and thought to be dead on the mountain, he made several promises to himself about his family and he has followed through. A sad tragedy with his wife's brother cemented his agenda and he and his family are now in better shape. This book is very touching and I recommend that anyone who followed the tragic events on Mount Everest in 1996 add this to their library."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"You kind of have to dig to find out what Dr. Weathers really thinks about the whole Everest 96 disaster. Bottom line: He was climbing when he should have been husbanding. The most telling line in the book: Boukreev didn't stay with the people who paid him to guide them. When he did make his way up to the South Col, he only bothered to save the ones in his expedition."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I am about 3/4 of the way through and have read the constant bickering that took place between his wife and himself. We wanted to read his account of the tragedy on Everest and he wrote about 2 chapters worth (there are 24 or 25 total) on the tragedy. The rest is about his failing marriage. If I wanted this, I would have read an Oprah book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book. In my keen interest in the story of the 1996 disaster on Everest I was eager to find out the turn of events according to Beck. Instead I got a book which gave us an insight to a man's dull and failing marriage besides other personal problems. What a waste of money. Hey we've all got personal problems and people have suffered a lot more than the Weathers family. I admire the man for his determination for striving and reaching his goals but he sounds more like a big wimp than a man who attempted to climb everest."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I was fortunate enough to hear Beck Weathers speak at our national convention (Medical Library Association) in Dallas last month. The story he tells his extremely compelling. When he tells the details of the climb and rescue, he does not mention the more personal anguish of depression and the derailment of his homelife. This is very integral to the major event of the climb, so I was glad to have the opportunity to get to know Beck Weathers through this book in addition to his personal tale of the struggle of life and death on Everest. I know that many reviewers thought this was extraneous, but it's not! And that's the whole point. To understand the psyche of this man who was overpowered with the idea of climbing the \\"Seven Summits\\", one cannot ignore the personal drive and journey that Beck Weathers took, virtually \\"solo\\" with the concomitant neglect of his wife and children. While this might seem very egregious and selfish, it appears that the author was so driven by depression and the need for concrete achievement, that he was almost unaware of the impact of the toll that this path would finally take. It's interesting that his children were always forgiving; the greater impact was on his wife who, although very angry (and justifiably so), never waivered (at least on the unconscious level) in her faithfulness and love towards him. The most poignant part of the book deals with Beck's relationship with his dying brother-in-law. Peach (Beck's wife's) brother is the role model for Beck's children. He was always there when Beck wasn't. The irony is that Beck is there for him at his time of need - out of genuine love and insight into what this man did for his family - and also as a means to demonstrate to Peach that he indeed loves her and this is one way to genuinely show it.The mountain cost him plenty. He will never \\"undo\\" what he did to his family. But he does have a second chance to engage in a life where he knows the true value of his family. How many people get to realize this even once in their lifetime!Bravo for bringing all the pieces of the puzzle together in this book. If you ever have a chance to hear Beck Weathers speak, don't miss it! During his speech, he mentions how against all odds, he made it back to camp after being left for dead, and told the audience that everyone has the \\"metal\\" to go on and do what he did. I went up to him afterwards and told him that \\"no, not everyone has that ability\\". It's sometimes easier to give up than to go on. And this is what makes this true story so very powerful. Hats off to Peach, too, and their two terrific children."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Beck Weathers and his family have bared their soles for this revealing look into a climber's head and his family life.Starting with the actual tragedy that has been chronicled in many venues, Weathers follows this with a microscopic view into his personal and family life. Nothing is left to the imagination as he battles inner demons and resulting family crises.His quest for climbing skills and knowledge is shared with the reader, including the many disappointments and mistakes, culminating in his Everest epic. He concludes with revelations of the seriousness of his injuries and his mistakes.Although I was disappointed in the low quality photos, it is still a valued purchase that I will keep."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I read this after reading Jon K's book.Almost right off the bat we discover Beck was having some issues with depression....this trip was either going to be a wakeup call or a deathwish.His writings I didn't mind...this trip humbled him. The parts from his wife could have gone....what an arrogant angry woman.As far as how this relates to the rest of us...if it was me on that mountain, I would be dead. The governor wouldn't even have picked up the phone.Save your $$. Check it out at the library, or read Jon Krakauer's book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"But the rest of the book was a big yawn. I really did not feel personally involved enough with the author to read through his tedious 200+ page life story. If you are after an account of what happened on that fateful climb, stick to &quot;The Climb&quot; or &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Porly orgainzed and scattered. About half way through I strted skipping over the family stuff. I got for the climbing story - don't buy - borrow and skim for the climbing (still weak, but it does give antoehr view of may 96 on Everest)."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Somehow, Beck Weathers managed to write a book about the tragic climb and descent and death and coming back to life atop Everest totally boring. Enjoyed Beck and Peach's chapters on their cats more than anything."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"He has a story, a good story, to tell. It's more than what happened on Everest and his near death experience. Aren't we all climbing the same mountain and don't we all want to be the few who reach the top? He had also reached the pinnacle of success in his career and what is it that one finds of value up there? What is it that we want so badly that we are willing to journey through cold and darkness and hardship for? Is it to be validated for our achievements or for just being alive? To be loved, just as we are with all our flaws. And to love others; to actively love others in some way. To be of service and to nourish a hobby or two."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Have you ever been in a conversation with someone who states &quot;To be perfectly honest with you ...&quot;? Don't you want to ask, &quot;Have you been untruthful up to this point?&quot;Beck Weathers gives you that impression everytime he tries to sound humble during his climb or during his relationship with his family. I had just finished another nonfiction book by a new author (Conover) and found it most interesting to go &quot;inside&quot; a prison through the eyes of a guard (not correctional officer - they don't correct anything). So I wanted to read this actual account of the horror of being part of the deadliest day for climbers on Mount Everest. The first few chapters kind of gave you the flavor of the terror and pending doom all of the climbers must have felt that day; however, Beck skips over the death of others as if it were like putting out the trash. The rest of the book is a self-serving look at how he abused his family and why we should feel sorry for him.Every now and then he does throw in some climbing tales but his self-importance clouds any attempt at story line or drama. For example, in one climb he describes how this group passed several people who died and were frozen. Oh well, he and his party (lead by a neo-nazi) kept on going placin more importance on the Jack Daniels he had to dispose of halfway up the mountain.Frankly, this guy sounds like someone who got alot of attention and somehow thinks he's a national hero. My God his wife, kids, the helicopter pilot are the real heros. Beck is just a self-centered bore. You know, I and a lot of other people have disabilities. Getting on with your life doesn't make you a hero... It just means you chose life over death. Group up Beck. Too bad. I was so looking forward to feeling the horror of true helplessness at the hands of nature. All I got - All you will get if you bother to read this - is Jerry Springer."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This is a pretty good book. However at least half of the book is dedicated to Weathers' home life and problems with his marriage. While not bad, I didnt really buy a book on mountain climbing to read about family issues. Anyway, Overall though its pretty good as long as your not expecting solid mountain climbing action through and through."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Pretty much the autobiography of how a man almost lost his life on Everest, but somehow recovered his body and soul in the end. This book has got some nice insights into what attracts a man to climb the mountains. But sometimes it wander too far off to tell us about the author's martial affairs that don't really concern with the main plot of the story."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Having a chance to meet Beck Weathers and hear his story during an event at work I thought &quot;I want to know more\\" and being that my first name is Beck as well I ran out and got the book. The first 25% of the book is great. I could not put it down. But the other 75% Beck gets on a soapbox about depression, and it almost come off a little whiney. Do not get me wrong, I would recommend this book to anyone. I just think most people who go to pick this book up are going to assume it deals with 75% of what happen on the mountain and how the doctors put him back together and 25% of how his depression got him there and saved him and his family. If Beck was to write a book on just what happen on the mountain I would read it in a heartbeat."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"All readers are intrigued by life and death struggles such as conquering Everest. If drama, suspense, excitement, and insight into a near death experience from a personal perspective are your interest, you won't find it here. Every chance the authors get to instill the feeling of what it must have been like to endure this expedition, they fall short. Its as though this book was written as an epilogue to &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;. This book never takes you anywhere. The style of conversation-blocking with family members and friends smacks of a journalist transcribing tape-recorded conversations. If you want to taste Beck's emotional experience, you will have to hear him in person - there is no comparison. But if you want to know the fury of Everest - find another book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Large chunks of Beck's book are written in dialogue form, where passages written by the people who populate this memoir add there own insights and commentary. It makes for excellent reading.Since reading Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, what Beck himself describes as the definitive book on the 1996 Everset Disaster, I've become very interested in the event. Beck provides a layer to the story that only he could provide and I thoroughly appreciate it."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"If your interested in the 1996 Everest disaster, you might try reading, &quot;Into Thin Air&quot; too. I enjoyed this book but found Jon Krakauers book more gripping and detailed about the Everest event. I found it startling that Dr. Weathers had to go through such HELL to appreciate his wife and kids. When I was done with the book I told my husband, &quot;what a slime ball.&quot; I'm glad he has finally conquered the demons that sent him to Everest in the first place. After hearing him on a national radio talk show I couldn't wait to get the book. I probably would of enjoyed it more if it had more about the actually climb. He says, he didn't write it for anyone, but wanted to write it for himself and what brought him to Everest in the first place. Good Luck Dr. Weathers and your family."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"After reading Krakauer's and Boukreev's accounts of the '96 tragedy, I eagerly snatched this title when I saw it on the &quot;New Releases&quot; shelf from the library.As I stayed up late plodding through the novel, I could not help but think how I could not relate to a single word this guy wrote. I mean, his wife just HAPPEN to have the governor's home phone number to call for help? And the Weathers family knew the state reps well enough to have the State Department in Kathmandu shop around for the best helicopter pilot available?! And Beck used to have a CHANCE to bump into the governor of Massachusetts on his way to work?!?!Let's get real here, Ladies &amp; Gentlemen. Although Beck partially learned his lesson (his naivety still shows in his resume-like writing style), &quot;poor&quot; Beck is NOT the typical climber. I bet if Rob Hall had made it down to where Beck was, he still would have died because his family likely doesn't know friends of the State Department. As a taxpayer, I was fairly outraged (moreso than usual) to learn that the people who I elect will only make themselves &amp; their friends accessible to government resources. I'm sure my paycheck helped fund the fuel required to rescue Beck Weathers off Mount Everest.By the way, Mr. Weathers, you're welcome."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Dr. Weathers clearly has undergone a terrible tragedy; however the tone of this book is clearly one of hopeful self-flagellation--&quot;maybe if I beat myself up enough about what a jerk I have been others will stop doing so themselves!&quot; Let's hope his wife doesn't let him forget. Not very well written, but it is faily entertaining."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I watched and listened in horror in May 1996 as 8 climbers died on Everest in the worst one-day disaster that had ever happened on that mountain. I was overjoyed and incredulous when the news broke that one of the climbers, Beck Weathers, who had been left for dead on the mountain, had somehow managed to walk back into camp. Dr. Weathers lost his nose, both hands and his toes from frostbite, but he lived through his ordeal on the mountain.This is Weathers' story. It follows Weathers through his depressions to his discovery of mountain climbing and from there, the story really begins. This book is told from Weathers' point of view with his wife, Peach and several friends, relatives and acquaintances chiming in with their recollections.I enjoyed this book. It is a quick read and very interesting. I do have to warn you, however, there are times that this book reads as if it were a marriage counseling session between the Weathers. I found that Beck Weathers is a person to be admired for his sheer will and determination, but he is very human and very flawed."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The parts about climbing were very good. But just too much of his personal problems to be a 'climbing' book - might be good for those who want to know about the problems of depression/etc.Seem he, like many other who wrote about that tragedy, did a book for self healing. Which is OK.But it did help me better understand somthing's bout Everest in May of 96. I have read most of the other books about that tragedy. Any one of which puts a different slant on what happened - read 'em all."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The book is OK.I like to know all the book about 1996 Everest disaster.The middle part of book - about Beck life history - was boring.The climbing parts were OK.In my opinion the best book was \\"The Climb\\""},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I bought this book because I was impressed by Beck in Jon Krakauer's book Into Thin Air and I wanted to hear his story. However, much of the book is devoted to his and Peach's relationship. I have trouble having much sympathy for Peach. Yes, he leaves her alone a lot, but it seems like she doesn't want to let him do anything he enjoys (\\"everything I hate he wants to do.\\") Maybe she isn't as shrewish and self-centered as she comes across, and being a \\"mountain widow\\" has to be harder than being a golf widow or a sports widow, but there isn't any indication that any interests he has that take time away from her are acceptable. She is thrilled when he comes back injured from Everest, both because she can say \\"I told you so\\" and because he is badly enough injured so she can keep him tethered to her. He tries to find out what her interests are and get her involved in something, but she says her only interest is her home and the kids. She doesn't work, takes very nice vacations on his salary, while bemoaning the fact that he doesn't want to come along under her conditions, which seem to involve doing nothing and talking about nothing except her and the kids. The best thing she did was to use her network to get the rescue helicopter to pull him off Everest.It would have been nice if she could have appreciated his drive and discipline and accomplishments instead of doing what so many women do, which is spending their time tearing down their husbands to each other. She says she doesn't want her children to grow up without a father; but then she plans to accomplish this by divorcing him (huh?)But, happily for her, he almost dies, and now he's home full-time. How long is it going to take before this starts to drive her nuts? The kids sounded a lot better, healthier, and happier than she did. I would have more sympathy for her if the book showed her making any effort to understand what he was doing and why. The impression is, sorry Peach, that part of the reason he was gone, was because you were constantly on his case when he was home. Maybe that wasn't the case; maybe we need a sequel here to explain her point of view, but all that shows up in the book is her complaints and criticisms.If the book is going to be about his relationships, then it would be nice if it weren't all self-castigation about what a horrible person he's been to have been focussed on things outside of his marriage and how now he's rededicated himself, all is well. It would be interesting to hear the follow-up in a year or so -- how's his depression doing now that he's stuck at home? How does she really like having him home full-time?Ultimately the book does tell what happens to Beck, so it covers the bases, but it's really mostly a book about his marriage and how it was affected by his climbing and by his survival."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"For a real life story it does not get much more real than this, a passion becomes an obsession that takes away the hero status that he was aiming for in the first place? . I found it easy to read. A bit of soft filling in the middle and couldn't really relate to the relationship with his wife."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Of all the people involved in the 1996 Everest expeditions, Beck Weathers should have 1 of the more interesting stories to tell. Blind, severely frostbit, and left to die (twice), Weathers stood up and basically walked down the mountain to a high altitude helicopter evacuation.This Everest story involves about a quarter of the book. It quickly becomes apparent that Weathers' greatest accomplishment in life was to almost die.The rest of the book is about Beck and his parents, his brother, his wife, his kids, his pets, his depression, his faith, and his job...and it's pretty boring. In the end, we find that Weathers neglected his family for so long, they basically gave up on him...not caring whether he was around or not. But of course Beck is given a second chance to make everything better and now he wanders around his house telling his kids, wife, and pets how much he really loves them (at least that's the impression I got).What I found most interesting is that Weathers at no point absolutely swears off mountain climbing (despite having lost a good part of his face and most of his hands to frostbite, not to mention the strain it put on his family).Will Beck climb again? Will Peach divorce him and take the kids? What will happen to the family dog? I'm sure there will be a sequel and I'll tentatively call it &quot;Back To Life&quot; and give it 1 star. The gravy train on Everest books is coming to an end."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"The book isn't too bad and an easy read if you are bored for a weekend. I have read several mountaineering books and I was eager to get this one. I was somewhat less impressed with the account of the May 96' disaster on Everest in this book. Into Thin Air, by Jon Krakauer, did a much more detailed job of this. But, I don't think that was Beck's purpose in writing this book. I think this was an attempt, a very good one I might add, to describe his emotions and feelings towards climbing and in particular how it affected his family. I appreciated the rawness of his writing. There are no hidden messages in the book, his life was falling apart and it took a near death experience at twenty some thousand feet to help put it all in perspective and he could then work to put it all back together. All in all good book and a descent author."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Beck Weathers' book starts out mildly interesting as it explores his story of the 1996 Everest diaster, and then regresses into a self absorbed examination of how intelligent and how atheletically able Beck Weathers sees himself. Weathers airs out his struggle with an affliction suffered by millions, depression, but it's hard to judge if he truly is afflicted, or if his claim of depression is just an excuse for a life of self absorbtion and selfishness. The first few chapters of the book is a cheap and not well written attempt to grab the readers attention as it thinly describes the Everest adventure, the middle of the book about the life of Weathers growing up can (and should)be skipped entirely, and the end has some intersting tales of Weathers' climbing experiences around the world. When you finish this book, you'll want two things. First, you'll want at least half of whatever money you spent on the book back, and second, you'll feel certain that Jon Krakauer is owed the other half, because Beck Wethers certainly would never have sold a single book had Krakauer not published his brilliant \\"Into Thin Air.\\""},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This book has a great title, as it sums up Beck Weathers' Mt. Everest experience.Unfortunately, this is the only great thing about this book. It is, at best, a mildly interesting book. The only truly interesting part is his recollection of the Everest trip and its immediate aftermath. His survival, which is truly amazing, is almost glossed over and turned into a sad soap opera about a marriage gone stale with time.It does seem that Beck's patient wife, Peach, had been ill treated in the sense that he would go off to do some amateur mountain climbing (with the emphasis on amateur), leaving her with the kids for weeks at a time and remaining incommunicado. Since her voice is interspersed throughout this book, you can see why he might want to get away. A more insipid voice, I can't imagine. She is what is bad about this book. Yet, at the same time it was her efforts, along with those of her friends, which were the catalyst for the herculean helicopter rescue by Colonel Madan K.C. who brought Beck down from the mountain. Still, she is an utter bore.What is good about the book is Beck's sense of humor and his indomitable spirit, which is undoubtedly what kept him alive in unbelievably harsh conditions on Everest. Though it is those like him who, financially able to go on these expeditions but lacking the technical skill to effectively navigate the harsh terrain, put themselves and others at risk. While it is clear that he was delighted to be rubbing shoulders with the mountaineering elite on Everest, it did not seem to dawn on him that he was just another foolhardy dilettante who, though having had some climbing experience, simply did not belong on Everest. It is this hubris which brought him to this pass. Quite frankly, given his description of his mountaineering efforts on some of the world's other tall peaks, it is a miracle he was not left for dead long before Everest."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Probable one of the worst books I have ever read.

And I like the idea of getting inside the psyche of the sort of man who'd leave his wife and kids for months at a time to do life-threatening and pointless things like climb deadly mountains. But Weathers isn't a very introspective man, and while he mentions several times having had an epiphany, I seem to have missed it in the actual narrative of his resurrection from the dead. One sign of Weathers' psychological distance from himself is that he refers to himself as \\"you.\\" \\"When you freeze your hands solid on Mounth Everest, your hands feel like chunks of wood.\\" Where is the first-person pronoun here? And oddly, that lack of self awareness seems to persist even in the post-epiphany stage.Even though I'm a woman and a non-mountainering type, I still couldn't get interested in Beck and Peach's marital therapy or how their parents met or their pets. Skip that section entirely, is my advice.I like the clear way Weathers explains what you actually do on a mountain--I could picture things more clearly in his descriptions than in most others I've read (and I'm kind of on a Mount Everest and Himilaya rampage at the moment.)But essentially this book is pretty much an anti-mountain-climbing book which presents what would normally be seen as accomplishments as symptoms of psychological and moral failings. The pathology of adventure-seeking at 29,000 feet. (btw, Weathers claims that his becoming a pathologist was not related to his own pathological mental state, but the whole book belies that claim.)"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"If you, like me, are an avid armchair mountaineer, gripping your cup of hot chocolate at the risk of either spilling your drink or breaking the cup as the National Geographic Channel or Discovery Times takes you over the breathtaking vistas of the Seven Summits; and if you, like me, stop to read or listen to every story of the mighty Everest and the hundreds of people who've braved its summit since Tenzing Norgary Sherpa and Sir Edmund Hilary cut the ribbon, you're bound to be drawn to this book. And certainly if you, like me, know by name everyone on Rob Hall's and Scott Fischer's teams in 1996...those who perished, and those who survived, along with a preview of the breathtaking tale Beck Weathers tells here of his rescue from the mountain, you may scratch your head in puzzlement when you realize that you are less than a third into \\"Left for Dead\\" when you've reached this point in the book. What more could there be to tell?Don't stop reading.First of all, Beck does a spectacular job, aided by his wife, now, who adds comments about how his obsession with climbing afffected the family, of his entire history of climbing, including the colorful characters and the close calls that accompany Beck and his companions during their climb. But now as he looks back, Beck is able to reflect on what he missed.Oh no. Is this turning into a screenplay for a chick flick? Well, not really. Or not entirely. But by the end, Beck has realized all that he came very close to losing ....even after the Everest climb...included much more than a hand, and was much more precious.Although I still would have liked a bit more build-up before the crisis on Everest, I thought this was a darned good book. I would not ask the author to lose any more extremities, but if he could manage to write another without losing one, that would be OK."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I am an avid reader of mountain adventures, sailing adventures, caving adventures and the like. I like fast-paced, riveting stories, with a good balance between background information and excitement.I first heard about Beck Weahters and his ordeal when reading Jon Krakauer's \\"Into Thin Air.\\" So I ordered Beck Weather's \\"Left For Dead.\\" I was disappointed.It was ok but not as good as others I have read. The part about the climb was excellent, the part about his recovery dragged on, and the part about how he has grown from his ordeal was ok. I became bored very quickly about his writings of his wife Peach.Ok book, but not great."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I was a little disappoined in this book. If you have read \\"Into Thin Air\\", you know how riveting it was, and it gave lots of details of the tragedy on Everett. Beck Weathers, in his autobiography, does not provide much more detail about what happened to him and how he survived. Worth reading, but i was looking for more."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This book should have been fantastic. Beck Weathers went through hell on the side of the mountain and could tell one of the greatest adventure stories ever. Unfortunately what the book contains is a lot of self congratulating about past accomplishments, needless anecdotes,and most irritatingly, a lengthy argument between him and his wife about who is the worse spouse.If you want to read about the Everest disaster go out and get Anatoli Boukreev's The Climb or Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air. Both of these books focus on the event itself, not boring filler."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"\\"I searched all over the world for that which would fulfill me, and all along it was in my own backyard.\\" That's how Beck Weathers sums up what his harrowing Everest adventure taught him.If you're looking for suspense, look elsewhere. The facts of the 1996 climbing season on Mount Everest are well known, and Dr. Weathers (a Texas pathologist) tells his own climb's story in his book's first section. This is one man's personal memoir, not a mountaineering book, and I knew that when I bought it. His reasons for wanting to summit Everest were entirely unlike pioneer climber George Mallory's famous, \\"Because it is there.\\" For Dr. Weathers this was one more way to insulate himself from the growing pain of living.What could make such an outwardly successful human being feel that way about his life? Beck Weathers had it all, and not just the material things that a partner in a thriving medical practice can afford for himself and for his family. He also had a loving wife, two healthy and gifted children, a host of friends, and a supportive extended family. Yet this brilliant and charismatic man could not bring himself to believe that these people really did love him, and wanted his company. Nor could he allow himself to enjoy theirs, because in his mind he did not deserve happiness. He deserved, instead, the kind of punishment that extreme sports inflict.The enormous gap between Beck's world as he perceived it through the filter of chronic depression, and Beck's world as it really was, closed when he to all intents and purposes froze to death on Mount Everest. Opening his eyes after hours of lying out in a blizzard, left for dead not once but twice by comrades unable to carry him to safety, was his first miracle. Getting off the mountain alive was his second, after the Base Camp doctors responded to news of his revival by telling those trying to care for him after he stumbled into camp horribly frostbitten: \\"He is going to die. Do not bring him down.\\" The third miracle, though, is the greatest one. Beck Weathers held onto his near-death epiphany. He believed the truths he'd finally glimpsed, and used that knowledge to transform his life.Slow reading at times, as we follow Beck's early life and go with him through young manhood? Maybe. But everything he says in those chapters is necessary to the story, and his flashes of wry and biting humor had this particular reader howling at times. He spares himself nothing, and allows others who know him - wife \\"Peach\\" mostly, but also his children, brothers, and associates - to add their viewpoints even when they honestly disagree with his own.No, this isn't a book about mountaineering. It's about redemption, and how high a price one man paid to find the happiness that should have been his all along. I am very glad I read it."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"This is not a typical mountaineering book. If you are looking for detailed descriptions about Camp 4 or the Hillary Step, this is not the book for you. It also does not devote a lot of space to Beck Weathers' Everest climb in 1996 and his opinions on what went wrong. The Krakauer and Breshears books are better if you want a more adventure and climb oriented perspective. However, if you are interested in the psychology of a driven, focused, destructive personality, the book is fascinating. It is an excellent biography of this man's struggles.The major theme of the book is Beck Weathers' personality and how he wrestles with depression and being extremely goal-oriented, and how this personality nearly drives him to death. It also discusses the carnage he inflicts on his family as he relentlessly follows his passions. The book contains many first-person points of view with some of the most interesting be those of his wife Peach as she deals with Beck's behaviors, tries to run a family, and hang together as Beck travels the world.The writing is quite lively and there is very little filtering on the language as Beck's comments are often contradicted by the people around him. On the other hand, some of the conversations are not so poignant, and you feel as if some of words have been lifted too directly from the family interviews.Beck's personality is very interesting to me because he reminds me of a modern Fitzcarraldo, and his choices raise many questions in my mind. Is he a madman for pursuing his dreams? Did his dream save him from suicide? How could he have expected his family to shoulder his burden? Will Beck pick up some other all-encompassing passion? Has he really changed? As I turned the pages, each anecdote seemed to provide some clue in the answers to these questions.The book concludes too quickly to have any sort of definite conclusion about these questions. I still get the feeling that Beck and Peach have many issues to resolve. The family still seems to need more time to work the animosities out. And I get the feeling that Beck feels quite comfortable with the risks he took and the outcome. Fascinating that he can lose his nose and fingers and still focus positively on the insight he gained. And his personalty and his struggles are what makes the book interesting."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"There are lots of people who will not like this book. They will want &quot;Into Thin Air&quot;mark II. This story is remarkable in that there is more description of the motivation for Beck being where he was. As a climber who was nearly killed himself I can appreciate a lot of what Weathers has to tell us regarding his own life that led him into the mountains. I used to say that every man needs, like Christ, his 40 days in the desert. So much has been written aobut the 96 Everest tradgedy that to simply recount the event from Becks perspective would have been dull. To make the event the beginning was a wise decision. I would recommend this book to anyone who is thinking about tackling big mountians. There is very little jargon and detail. for that read Greg Child, John Krakauer, etc. As J. Krackauer said in his book &quot;it is an intrinsically irrational act&quot; to wish to climb such peaks. It take an amazing series of internal and external forces, all acting at the right moment, to send a man or woman into the Himalaya. Some say it is a rich man's folly. Well I would disagree. Most rich men wouldn't be caught dead in the Khumbu. Beck is not a great man, none of them were up there. What is supremely edifying is to know that they are not superhuman, they are, as you and I are, human beings frail and small yet cabable of feats of nobility and self sacrfice. And best of all Beck shows us that, no matter what, we all can change for the better."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Of all the books telling the tales of the 1996 Everest debacle, I had hoped this would be an admirable entry. WRONG!. Not only is Beck Weather lucky to be alive, he is lucky to be published...what a tragedy in the publishing world. We now learn why Beck has a miserable life, he didn't care for his family and still doesn't, except to fill in some gaps in this drivel called a book to help him fill the pages he could not. Sympathy aside for his near death, Weathers proves over and over he should have stuck to golf or reading, not the mountains. He is what is WRONG with climbing wannabees...he hasn't a clue about safety, common sense or mountain lore. He cares more to drink bourbon at the end of the day than safety. He takes brand new out of the box boots to Everest rather than broken-in ones and proceeds to as Krakauer says, &quot;chew his feet into hamburger.&quot; He climbs Denali before he even knows what the climbing equipment is called.Weathers is an idiot and can't write to save his life, which is a mystery why he lived to begin with...he climbed against all logic and wanted only tales to tell his drinking buddies. Save your money...and time, this book is &quot;Better Off Dead.&quot;"},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"As an avid traveler and collector of books about travel, guide books, etc., my opinion of this book about a tragic yet fascinating time and topic, is very low. The book by Jon Krauker (sp?) is an example of tasteful telling of the tragic year. This book is more gore and bore."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"All though a good start, the core and ending was thin.I expected more of a mountain story and less of a personal feeling thing i suppose, but i do appreciate the post trauma of a tuff climb. Krakauar's account entertained supreme, however after reading Lobsang's and Anatoli's points of view i think he may have somewhat missed the bulls eye. The I-MAX struck me as completely avoiding the great opportunity of recording this event.

After reading Jon Krakauer's Into Thin Air, which is supposed to be the definitive account of the tragedy which took place on the 1996 ascent, I was curious to read the accounts of the same event told be other people who were there. This book (Left for Dead) was one of them and I found it interesting not so much as an alternative account of what happened but as the personal journey of one person and how he was changed as a result of what happened to him."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"When reading other books about the May 1996 tragedy on Mount Everest I got more interested in the man who was declared dead, but then miraceously escaped the maountain. So I was really happy to find this book. The first part of this book tells the story from his own perspective. The second part of the book is more about his life in general and the recovery. The book is definitely worth reading, but after such a thrilling opening the second half gets a bit of a transportation to the end."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"I read this book after reading Into Thin Air and then the very good book by Anatoli Boukreev (the guide much maligned by Krakauer). It is a different style of book not dwelling on the Everest climb (though it is a large part of the book). It is more an autobiography and states how the climb changed his life. For those with a preoccupation with the climb of 1996 there are little bits not included in the other books which help round out the picture. More important to the book though is the picture of this incredibly selfish man (? trait of lot of climbers?) who claims the events changed his life - though not a lot of evidence is given, though it would be hard to show in his own words. The comments of his wife are littered through the book and give good insight into his character. What I also found interesting was the number of politicians who did all they could to help and the one who refused to help (Governor George W Bush). This is an indictment (another) of the current president. All in all an interesting if flawed book."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Beck Weathers gives a different side of the story well worth reading."},{"Title":"Left for Dead: My Journey Home from Everest","review":"Yet another book on the 96 Everest tragedy....while an account by a well known (and good writer) Krakauer might be of interest, the story somehow looses any pigment when related for the 15th times by someone who should never have been there in the first place.

Sad....."},{"Title":"Egyptian Rhythm: The Heavenly Melodies","review":"On reflection, what were striking to the book were its clear and concise references elucidating hard and common facts. Standing on its own or as a companion to Moustafa's book Egyptian Harmony, Egyptian Rhythm is well researched and could fit easily into a school or public library for all manner of ages. Vibrant, the book shows a living and breathing culture of the Egyptians, often shown in modern and popular culture as an enslaving race, as a peaceful culture dedicated to the understanding of nature and its laws. Egyptian Rhythm is not just a guide on the \`music of the Ancient Egyptians' - though it does certainly covers that - it is a guidebook to music itself not just as a hobby or business but as it relates between oneself and the world. \\"Rhythm means flow\\" Moustafa writes, this book explores that flow, the science of nature and of echoing its harmonies.This book, like others from Moustafa Gadalla continues a tradition of retaining excellent chapter headings and an in depth index. Preface, is followed by explaining a few musical references and their standards and terminology, an Egyptian Dynastical Chronology, and lastly two maps of Egypt and its surrounding countries. Coupled with the text this book has an easy practical application.The first part of this book - five in total plus appendices, glossary, selected bibliography, and a detailed brake down of notes and sources - explores the cosmology of music by asking of meaning which the Ancient Egyptians saw as the harmony of the spheres. Music like other concepts the Ancient Egyptians held strong to was that it flowed, not just into a sheltered system of memory repetition as it is nowadays, into other facets of their life. Moustafa presents with facts and research how music/spheres influenced their daily, weekly and yearly cycles.The second part explores at core root beliefs of harmony, its application, representation and symbolism of the practiced musicians of Ancient Egypt. Modern musicians can easily find common symbolism and harmony not just in a purely mathematical/geometrical or memorized form but as it applies beyond the music to certain rhythms in life. The tetrachord, unison, the octave all have meaning beyond their direct musical implementation, and as such every page has an epiphanous quality more so in the hands of a musician than student, though if you're familiar with Moustafa's books the concepts behind the music will not be alien to you.The third part takes formation of music and rhythm and explains the patterning used in Ancient Egyptian music, from song structure to scale harmony, the \`how to?' of how such a culture implemented techniques frequently derived as of coming from Greece and heavily accredited to the Western World. A sceptical mathematician could check Moustafa's research (he clearly provides the maths &amp; harmony) and be left wanting.Part four clearly shows the vast quantities of instrument types used with the examples of what few instruments are remaining, current numbers have little part in explaining how broad the range of Ancient Egyptians' instruments was. From the Lyre to the Kanun (yes, Canon) Kithara (Guitar) and Clappers, four sections explain the four main groups; Stringed instruments (both open &amp; stop types), Wind instruments, and Percussion instruments. The references to existing instruments and the level of detail researched on each would be hard pressed to find in any encylopedia.The final part rounds off the implementation of music into daily applied life, in festivals, or simply public activities. Again as with the other chapters, clear illustrations from hieroglyphs and paintings show the Ancient Egyptians not just as drum beating primitive culture, but one that had and still has a high value to their belief and representational performance that exist purely fragmented in our own society's today.Note should be made of the appendices. A small chapter in itself, Moustafa explores five topics that go to answer critics or academics further on the topic of music and its dilution from Ancient Egypt.Westerners may have difficulty with agreeing with elements of Moustafa's exploration into music but the quality and consistency of explored facts without a selfish bias makes it impossible to denounce. Whether for musicians seeking meaning behind the concept of sound or for students of Ancient Egypt, or to a friend of family member, Egyptian Rhythm is an uplifting book of a vibrant and diverse culture that has respect and practise with the laws of nature and its observance."},{"Title":"Egyptian Rhythm: The Heavenly Melodies","review":"Iconoclastic Egyptologist Moustafa Gadalla's Egyptian Rhythm: The Heavenly Melodies is an amazing and impressive study of the intricacy of ancient Egyptian music, from the 24x7 Egyptian Musical Chart to its religious aspects and daily uses in life. Very highly recommended reading, Egyptian Rhythm details the theory and practice of the ancient Egyptian musical system, and is presented in depth for scholars and serious music study students, as well as the non-specialist general reader with an interest in ancient Egyptian culture and tradition."},{"Title":"Egyptian Rhythm: The Heavenly Melodies","review":"An informative book on a missing piece of the history of music and music theory, but lacking a larger perspective because of the author's polemic attitude toward his own explanation of ancient Egyptian culture. The author appears to occupy something of a minority position, and he cites other authors on music and Egyptology mainly to refute them, citing only himself in favor of his ideas. Although I confess to having a certain sympathy with his opinions, the flaw in the book is that it gives the impression of being possibly full of jumped-to conclusions and wishful thinking, and the reader has to simply take the author's word for authority. Many of his conclusions are drawn from a combination of his reading of ancient Egyptian sources and his knowledge of still-existing traditional music of Egypt, and you would really have to know both of these fields to judge his work.The most valuable and practical section of the book is Part III, chapters 9 through 12, which describe 2 microtonal tuning systems and various other musicological details. Whether these are accurate or not, they are emphatically interesting, and they fit well with other sources I've read that discuss tuning issues in medieval western music and other non-tempered musical styles in various parts of the world, most specifically in maqam and raga. They could well be genuine, or they could be informed historical fantasy - I can't tell from this book. However, if true, they fill in a gap in ancient music history, and if fantasy, they point toward a reasonably possible explanation of this gap. The gap has to do with the incomplete links between ancient Greek music theory and the European music theory of the middle ages from Boethius on, and the possible (but to my knowledge un-documented) influence of the Muslim communities of medieval Spain on the music of medieval Europe. Gadalla maintains that the Muslims received their musical knowledge directly from Egypt when the Arabs conquered it, which is a reasonable hypothesis (from my point of view, anyway). Ditto for the ancient Greeks, including Pythagoras, who has quite a reputation as an ancient music theorist based on very slender evidence, but Pythagoras is indeed said to have studied in Egypt. Gadalla also claims an Egyptian influence on Hindustani classical music, another very interesting hypothesis which is at least worth considering (Arab influence we know about already, but Gadalla would say this was 2nd hand, passed on from the Egyptians). Of course the whole field is complicated by the fact that music notation whether modern or ancient is undecipherable without musical training, that music practice has been historically passed on directly from teacher to student and that ancient written materials only refer to musical knowledge and are seldom explicitly didactic, and that there can be a whole lot of cultural evolution in a century or two of musical style, even with very strong traditions and prohibitions on innovation, just as there is with oral history.There is one curious apparent \\"wrong note\\": Gadalla claims the Dorians to be Egyptian, in his explanation of Egyptian influence on Greek musical culture. He cites Herodotus, who did ascribe an Egyptian origin to them. However, modern historical and archeological opinion seems to be that the Dorians were an early iron age warrior tribe from somewhere north of the Mediterranean who worked their way SOUTH into Greece, displacing the earlier Mycenaean culture and founding Sparta, later conquering Crete as well. Also, Gadalla equates the modern \\"Dorian Mode\\" with the same mode in ancient Egyptian music, apparently believing that there is a historical continuity. This is a bit of musical naivety, I believe. According to Knud Jeppesen, (\\"Counterpoint: The Polyphonic Vocal Style of the Sixteenth Century\\") the application of the term \\"Dorian\\" and the first three other \\"Greek Mode\\" names (Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian) were a medieval mistake and do not correspond to the ancient Greek modes (for those who don't know, \\"Aeolian\\" and \\"Ionian\\" were added in the 16th century, and \\"Locrian\\" in the 19th) which they were presumed to replicate. Thus Gadalla's extended discussion of the Dorians and their music appears to have some mistaken assumptions at its root, and the emphasis he places on his argument makes this reader wonder how many other faulty assumptions may be lying unquestioned under the rest of his book.There is an extended, and interesting, discussion of the Egyptian concept of correspondences between the planets, the days of the week, and the seven tones of the diatonic scale. However, Gadalla allows to pass without comment that the Egyptians' view of the planets is an archaic visual one that lists the planets, including sun and moon, in order of their apparent visual distance from the earth, from a geocentric bronze age point of view, and that the correspondences based on this order are somewhat metaphorical. A writer with a broader perspective might have at least commented on the dissonance between the ancient Egyptian ideas and the Copernican view, in order to speak to the modern reader and avoid the impression of occultism.On page 69 he describes a dual-scale system \\"based on the fact that each natural tone has a mirror image ... at a ratio equal to the Egyptian comma.\\" Three sentences later he throws in this nonsensical zinger: \\"In western terms, the twin scales are called 'plagal' and 'authentic'!!\\" (The twin exclamation points are Gadalla's.) This could conceivably be so but I have not yet read any mention of such a relation of plagal and authentic modes in medieval European theory. This needs a serious footnote, which should be available if this is fact and not fantasy, but like every other such assertion in the book, there is no source quoted.Bottom line: a very interesting read for anyone interested in ancient music and music theory, but undocumented and un-foot-noted, so file it under \\"interesting and stimulating ideas to be taken with a grain of salt.\\""},{"Title":"Egyptian Rhythm: The Heavenly Melodies","review":"Must read for Tribal Musicians and dancers!!!This is a great overview/introduction to egyptian music.

Further, being originally a civil engineer he is versed in numbers and numerology thus identifying the meaning of numbers. Plato preceeded him in their significance to the Egyptians. But unlike Plato who was Greek, Gadalla grasped the Egyptian spirit and tries to fetch for a unifying theme which relates music to religion to mathematics and astrology. This book adds up to the other masterpieces of Gadalla.

He skips from person to person as they relate stories from John Barr's life and career. The mystery of Barr's life is slowly revealed.

The book also includes a cast of memorable characters, from the Rickey Henderson-esque Old Swizzlehead to the shortstop Roberto Rodriguez, who knows two words on English, one of them being &quot;you&quot; and the other word being unprintable in a family website.A great book; well worth reading if you can get your hands on it."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"I just don't have the heart to rate a work of fiction with baseball as the topic with just one star. Still...Like a lot of writers who take on baseball, Baker just doesn't take the game all that seriously. How else to explain the caricatures disguised as characters in this tedious tome of a novel? The book has it's \\"good guys\\" who are all beyond reproach and it's \\"bad guys\\" led by a baseball manager who is so over-the-top foolish it's impossible to find him believable. Because the characters are caricatures, the book lacks credibility. And please, to all fiction writers who write about baseball: enough with the nicknames! Not everyone in baseball has one, particularly names like \\"Swizzle\\" and \\"The Big 'Un\\". Enough already.Now, you can get away with thin characters in a novel if you've got a larger point or symbol... or something. Baker drops hints throughout that his book is really about tying in all the wonderful legends and myths surrounding some of the games greats (baseball fans will recognize the past of Cobb, Clemente, among others). His point being... well, I don't think there is one which is terribly disappointing because I've heard Baker is a pretty damn good writer. I think Baker fell into the same trap that other writers fall into when the they write about baseball--they're fascinated by the sport but not enough to take it seriously as a basis for art. I remember when Ken Burns was making his documentary on Jazz and he said it was refereshing to work on a serious subject because his last documentary was on baseball. I can't help but feel that after this effort, Baker is looking forward to his next effort.If I were to summarize it one sentence, I'd say the book reads like an R-rated after-school special, with characters about as deep as what we grew up watching on ABC--predictable and forgettable."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"I picked this book up at a book fair for a couple of bucks thinking it would be your average baseball book.

Highly recommended for avid baseball fans."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"So often you hear the sports writers say &quot;there's no such thing as a good baseball book or movie, just good baseball games.&quot; This is the exception. Real true to form. Deals with real life issues that even players deal with. There's just one thing that I find hard to believe and that is the way the Mets won game six. Other than that, this is a great baseball book."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"It's a shame that this book is out of print. If you are into sports stories and want to try a new one, I'd recommend seeing if you can pick up a used copy. I liked it more than, say, the book of The Natural. I saw Field of Dreams, which is perhaps my favorite Baseball Movie, and I think this book is sort of in that league.A small bit of plot: A tremendously good player, of Ted Williams Calibre, arises almost out of nowhere. His past is very mysterious, and the book presents several points of view in observing him.There are several characters who are clearly composites of famous personalities, such as a bit of a Billy Martin character, a Mays-ish character and several others. So, it's a fun read for those who enjoyed following those personalities. The hero is, so far as I can see, a composite of a few as well, but I'll stop there.jl"},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"I found this an interesting and often humourous book. Although many of the characters were caricatures, I was able to suspend my disbelief to the point that I became enthralled in the mystery and enigma of John Barr. As a result, I found myself rooting for his professional and emotional recovery from a near season-ending slump.The novel is told largely in the first person through Barr's teammate, &quot;Old Swizzlehead&quot;. The story lost some of its credibility as this character's narrative swung (sometimes in mid-paragraph) from inner city black street slang to grammar and vocabulary more befitting a college educated WASP English major.The author shows a real inderstanding for baseball and athletes and as such I would recommend it to baseball fans. Others may find it a bit tedious."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"Wonderful book with great characters, great plot, great humor, and this perfect flow that wants to take you to the end and give you just what you want from a book. Unpretentious good writing full of life and fun yet with suspence and satire mixed in.This book is a winner, the best baseball novel I have ever read and maybe the best book I have read all year. Mr. Baker has writen a masterpiece.You do not have to even like baseball to love this novel."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"An unbelievable, yet believable, story. I can never put it down, no matter how many times I read it. You actually begin to believe the many amazing feats that John Barr accomplishes with his glove and bat. Has many similarities with &quot;The Natural&quot;, but far more interesting. Gives you a great inside look at one season in the sun for one team. A GREAT book."},{"Title":"SOMETIMES YOU SEE IT COMING: A NOVEL","review":"Three stars because Baker is such an extraordinary writer that he deserves no less, but this baseball novel is a mostly hollow, unrealistic, and frankly, boring, walk through the (fictional, of course) career of the game's greatest player, who is also the game's least-known player. What?Within the covers you'll find the fast-talking leadoff man, the hard-boiled plaid-jacket wearing old sports reporter, and the Kathryn Hepburn-like aging woman sportswriter (who is so sketchily presented it makes you wonder if Baker's ever met a woman!).Allen Barra, formerly of Salon, recently named this the best baseball novel of all time. Yikes! Read &quot;The Southpaw&quot; by Mark Harris instead. It's cliched, it's hokey, but it is really about baseball. Baker's book, on the other hand, sounds like what a novelist thinks baseball should be. If you love the game, the incredulities of the last sections of this book will have you reaching for your scorecard and marking clearly in black pencil, &quot;E-1.&quot;"},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary","review":"Adam Clarke's Commentary is the best expository Bible Commentary ever written. Clarke was a great scholar who knew over 20 languages. He read widely on the customs of the ancient world, so he explains cultural references that would escape most of us.More importantly, Clarke's total respect for God's Word and his complete devotion to his Lord are apparent throughout his works. Clarke examines the Bible phrase by phrase and sometimes word by word with an unusual carefulness both for the correct understanding of the text and for the souls of his readers.This is an expositional commentary not a devotional commentary, but Clarke frequently pauses to apply the Scriptures to your life.Clarke was a good friend of John Wesley, and his theological positions are primarily Arminian, but his Commentary will be a tremendous blessing and help to any sincere student of the Bible."},{"Title":"Clarke's Commentary","review":"I've always been fascinated by old commentaries. They give you a glimpse of the thought of the time period from which they come. I'm greatly looking forward to using this commentary.

Over time the procedures have changed, the reverence and dignity shown to the dead and to their survivors has increased. The amount of effort expended to find and identify any remains has grown significantly down through the years to include the latest scientific techniques. We have come a long way since the soldiers at Cold Harbor wrote their names on pieces of paper and attached them to their backs for later identification purposes.This book is the story of how the American military treats their dead. It is a book filled with pathos intermixed with cold facts. Some of the stories told reflect the horror of the situations, some tell of times when the procedures failed and the survivors were not treated as well as they could have been. After all, the military is filled with people just like the rest of us, some less capable than others.To go with this book there are a couple of other recommendations: First the book: 'Shane Comes Home',the true story of the return of a body from Iraq. Second the movie 'Saving Private Ryan' which is based on a true story of one GI returned from combat after all of his brothers were killed, and showes the effort that the military can expend.I really don't know how to rate this book. It is supurb in what it does, but what it does not not very plesant."},{"Title":"Soldier Dead : How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen","review":"Although death in war is usually a grisly subject, the author has handled it with a compassion and reverence that helps us put a human face on the ultimate act of sacrifice of our military. He does not dwell on the macabre, instead giving a very poignant account of the social aspects of death. \\"Soldier Dead\\" gives insight in to our culture and values in dealing with \\"casualties\\", and how media treatment of this subject has changed over the years--one example being turning a human \\"Soldier Dead\\" into a euphemistic \\"casualty\\". The author compassionately maintains focus on the fact that a Soldier Dead is a person, not a faceless \\"troop\\", as well as examining the social aspects of soldiers giving their lives for a cause, and how it affects their comrades and families. I recommend this to those interested in the human costs of war, as well as those seeking insight in to how our society deals with death in general. Certainly any leader who puts our soldiers in harm's way should read this book. Although war can sometimes be a necessary evil, our society should never be allowed to ignore the the human cost."},{"Title":"Soldier Dead : How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen","review":"Having served in Graves Registration during the Korean War I have an appreciation for the content in Mr. Sledge's book. He has accomplished some serious research on the subject of how we recover, identify, bury and honor our military fallen. For me the book provides a true picture of this country's efforts to do its best for our military dead. It is backed up with detailed references, index and notes. To my knowledge this book is a primer for anyone wishing to know more about the subject.Lynn H.

He discusses policies and difficulties of identifying war dead, our changing policies on returning the remains to families, and burial practices. Although Sledge does cover some the treatment of dead during the Civil War and Spanish-American War, most of his focus is on the 20th century wars.Sledge is not a historian, nor does he have a military background; instead, he has extensively studied sociology and psychology. However, his perspective works because he brings in outside analyses to help explain why we treat our military dead this way, why it is difficult for families whose loved ones are still missing, and the ways people react to their losses.The book is well-researched, although it is apparent that sometimes the available material on the subject is slim. Because the book is organized thematically and not chronologically, he has to re-cover the same ground repeatedly, and this detracts from the work. Still, although this book can be difficult to read at times, it tells the important and compelling story of how America uses our vast resources to try to recover and honor our war dead."},{"Title":"Soldier Dead : How We Recover, Identify, Bury, and Honor Our Military Fallen","review":"This work was a carefully researched and readable study, although it is not for all audiences given the subject matter.

There seems to be a basic repertoire of stories that make the rounds. Pompous composers and even more pompous singers fill the history books with their adventures and faux pas.What's different about Mr. Mordden's collection is that he includes brief biographical sketches of the lives of many composers (Gluck, Mozart, Wagner, Rossini etc.), singers (Caruso, Flagstad, Callas) and musicians (Toscanini, Beecham). These bios, sometime covering two pages or more, provide interesting incidents and commentaries on the lives of the famous. There is even a short history of the castrati.All in all when you finish this book you've not only had some good laughs, but have learned some interesting new things about the world of opera."},{"Title":"Opera Anecdotes.","review":"Don't pick up this book at bedtime if you have to get up early next morning. You might not be able to put it down until you finish it.The book is not a historical source, but nor does it purport to be. He tells of an organ-grinder who was playing the Intermezzo from Cavalleria Rusticana. Mascagni passes by and advises him to play it at a different tempo. The next day, the organ-grinder is seen wearing a sign saying &quot;Student of Mascagni.&quot; In other anecdote collections, the organ-grinder is either a &quot;Student of Verdi&quot; playing an excerpt from Il Trovatore or a &quot;Student of Puccini&quot; playing Musetta's Waltz from La Boheme. Could this be a true story which happened three times?The author occasionally strays from the assigned topic of anecdotes to discuss individual composers and performers. He makes value judgments with which the reader may or may not agree. He certainly does not esteem Puccini as highly as I do.Just one grievance: the author assumes that every reader knows every well-known opera ever written. He refers to operatic characters and operatic highlights without telling the reader which opera he is referring to. I felt like I was the only opera-lover in the world who was too stupid to know that Kundry is a character in Parsifal."},{"Title":"Opera Anecdotes.","review":"This book consists of operatic biographies-by-anecdote. If anyone remotely connected to opera in the past three hundred years said or did anything clever, then he or she is lovingly quoted in \\"Opera Anecdotes.\\"Sometimes, as in \\"The Famous Story of Handel's Cook,\\" the reader might have to strain to find the humor:\\"How great a composer was Gluck? Some say very great---\\"The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera\\" calls him \`opera's second founder.' Handel said not so great: \`he knows no more uff counterpoint zan mein cook!'\\"Handel's rollicking commentary is included in Mordden's anecdotal sketch of Christoph Willibald Gluck.Even the author admits to the existence of operatic greats who are not remembered for their sparkling wit:\\"One doesn't expect [Arnold] Schoenberg anecdotes---is this not the most austere character in music?---remote, complex, patriarchal, silently disapproving? Schoenberg is like Moses, bringing a new code of behavior to his people---twelve-tone composition---and raging when they prove unworthy.\\"Of course, Mordden does go on to tell Schoenberg's story in three pages worth of anecdotes, many of them grim---there really is nothing humorous about twelve-tone composition, or about being chased out of Germany by the Nazis (\\"Maus\\" comics notwithstanding.)Usually this book looks at the lighter side of operatic life, and it includes my favorite story about Leo Slezak, who must have been one of the funniest tenors ever to grace the Wagnerian repertoire. Here is the \\"Classic Leo Slezak Story:\\"\\"Backstage at \`Lohengrin' before his first entrance, Slezak was bemused to see the swan-boat take off just before he got into it: a stagehand had jumped the cue. As the boat glided into the opera without its silver knight, Slezak turned to someone and asked, \`Wann geht der n&auml;chste Schwann?': What time's the next swan?\\"If you love opera, you'll love \\"Opera Anecdotes.\\" If you don't---well, Dave Barry has also written a book about music."},{"Title":"Opera Anecdotes.","review":"I absolutely enjoyed this book.

The facts were interesting but scattered, and the appealing part came up in the second half, leaving 80 pages of reading that would have put me to sleep if I didn't force my eyes to stay open. The first 80 pages of the book were the first half of Judi Liebowitz's diary about her very, very boring life. It was all about the people at school teasing her about her weight, how her English teacher Ms. Roth was extremely fat, how Nancy Pratt was extremely skinny and the most popular girl in school, about her \\"diet\\", how she has a huge crush on this guy named Richard Weiss... Judi just goes on and on and on about her tremendously dull life.On page 81, the book finally gets into Judi's bulimia problem. While in the bathroom one day, she hears someone throwing up in one of the stalls and finds out that it is Nancy Pratt, the most admired, fashionable, skinny girl in school. Judi soon found out that Nancy had been throwing up her lunch, and how she binges and purges every day. Nancy uses two fingers to stick down her throat, making her gag so she barfs all her food up into the toilet bowl.Judi becomes very jealous of Nancy's figure and desperately tries to be like her, even if it means suffering Nancy's secret binge-and-purge cycles of bulimia. After a while, Judi is guarding the door while Nancy purges in the bathroom. Nancy had taken especially long, and so Judi checks out Nancy's stall and finds out that Nancy has passed out while puking up her food and must go to the hospital.Judi kind of realizes that throwing up her food is dangerous, and she promises herself that she will never do it again. But can she keep that problem? Weight for Judi is no longer just another typical eighth-grade problem. It's a matter of life and death.That is basically what happens in the rest of the book, but in between is issues about Judi's best friend and her having a fight and so on, and the information about bulimia is scattered and not detailed. It didn't learn much more than I already had learned about bulimia. What I did learn was that bulimics can sometimes find blood with their vomit, and this could be a problem. That's about it, though.The book did not flow too well, and therefore was not of my liking.

She asked if they were ok and shecouldn't believe her eyes when the most popular girl in school Nancy Pratt walked out. Judi asked Nancy if she was ok and that is when it all happined. Nancy Pratt let Judi in on her 'dieting' secret (binging.) Judi figured that if the most popular girl in school did it then why couldn't she? So from then on Judi and Nancy covered for each other while they did their 'buisness.' Their signal was holding two fingers up and moving their hand up and down. Judi decided that binging might not be such a great idea when Nancy was taking longer than usual in the bathroom. So she decided to check up on her and found her passed out in the bathroom stall. Judi promised that she would not ever throw up again. This did not seam to work for long. Read the book to find out what happins to Judi and Nancy. Do they stop for good or keep binging? This book is very suspensful. It keeps you on the edge of your seat untill the end.

Now she has a secret weapon.But the secret weapon turns out to be a two-edged sword and Judi learns that the downward spiral of bulimia can be life-threatening.This book for middle schoolers is an entertaining and heartfelt look at a serious subject. Judi's voice is authentic and girls will relate easily to her as they learn some of the dangers of bulimia.When I was reading this book, I felt like it could have been my diary (except for the throwing up) and not just at age thirteen. We live in a society where the loudest voices (movies, TV, magazines) tell girls and women that our only value is our looks and that we should be ultra-thin. One online article, citing several studies, states that the number one wish for girls ages 11 to 17 is to be thinner and that girls as young as five have expressed fears of getting fat.The author, Leslea Newman, has struggled with body-image issues herself, and she edited a collection of women's writings about food called Eating Our Hearts Out. She was inspired to write Fat Chance after reading about a girl who had died and left behind a journal filled with her misery about food and weight."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"This book kept my attention & I kept reading on to find out what would happen next. It makes you realize what some teen girls are going through in their lives right now. Every teen girl should read this story because it teaches you some good lessons."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"I bought this book when it first came out, when I was in the sixth grade, and had just entered middle school. It was around this time that I was beginning to learn about the dangers of eating disorders, drugs, and alcohol in Health class. This book make a nice learning supplement.Judi wants desperately to be thin, because she thinks that she's fat. However, reading her diary, you see that she is just an average girl: her height and weight are average, and she should have nothing to fear. Leslea Newman captures the effects of peer pressure and the want to be thin wonderfully. Judi soon drowns in a world where the perfect weight is 100 pounds, and she will stop at nothing to acheive that goal.Now, six years later, I still read this book with fervor; the only difference is that it takes only one or two nights to get through it, as opposed to the week and the half I spent reading it before. I look in the mirror and don't always like what I see, but keeping this book in mind, I will never try to get thin by becoming bulimic or anorexic."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"Last year we had to read a social issues book.

Over the course of a few months, Judi realizes that another girl in her school, Nancy, is also sufferring from an eating disorder. After realizing that they have the same problem, Judi begins to emulate Nancy's behavior, and even \\"cover\\" for her while she throws up her lunch in the school bathroom.Although the idea of this novel intrigued me, I didn't find it very original, or very realistic. Any reputable psychologist will tell you that people with eating disorders are almost never able to recover on their own, and have a greater chance of relapsing if they do. However, in Fat Chance, Judi simply stops throwing up after learning the dangers of eating disorders, deciding that losing weight isn't worth it. The problem with this idea, is that people with eating disorders are not generally concerned with the toll that they are taking on their bodies. Instead, they wish to continue the behaviors, and lie consistantly to cover it up.Therefore, while there are some good aspects to the novel, I think that it presents a rather fluffy and sugarcoated idea of eating disorders. I think that if readers are looking for a more realistic view into the world of eating disorders, they should consider reading memiors like Stick Figure, or a psychotherapist's view, like The Best Little Girl in the World. These books better demonstrate the extreme complexities of eating disorders and their effects on those who suffer from them."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"I enjoyed this book because it is easy to read and entertaining.

Judi thought that if the most popular girl in the school could throw up and lose weight, why couldn't she. As of that day Judi started to binge and purge. No one knew about it except for Nancy. In a weird way, this started their friendship. Judi hid this from her mom and from her best friend Monica. In school, Judi kept a diary for and English class assignment. In her diary she wrote down all of her feelings and thoughts on subject such as, school, boys, friends, and her body image.

It's a good picture of life with an eating disorder but read with caution"},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"Fat Chance by Leslea NewmanLife in middle school is already tough enough when you are an unsatisfied American teen like the main character Judy. Although the constant comments made by Tommy Aristo, a mom who won't even let you wear makeup, and growing up being the \\"fat girl\\" in the class doesn't make it much easier. So when Mrs. Roth the English teacher assigns the class to write in a journal periodically, Judy comes up with three goals in life that will supposedly solve all her problems: One, decide what she wants to be when she grows up; Two, get a boyfriend (preferably Richard Weiss); And three, lose weight because \\"Everyone knows guys like skinny girls, the skinnier the better (p. 3)\\". So with the help of her best friend Monica, Judy decides to do what she thinks will lead to happiness and popularity by becoming skinny. However while battling the numbers on the scale, she also discovers a risky way to stay thin, even if it that means threatening her health.Leslea Newman did an excellent job by using realistic details and even some educational facts in this contemporary fiction novel. It has the perfect amount of drama, comedy, and even a bit of romance. She makes it easy to relate to because of the real life scenarios and issues almost all teenage girls go through, without sugar coating it or being too graphic like many other dramatic books do. It is a must read if you also liked books such as Are You There God, It's Me Margaret or Just As Long As We're Together by Judy Bloom. Newman and Bloom have a very similar writing style, however Newman usually provides a bit more detail and is more dramatic in her description. This book may take awhile to get into, but once hooked on Judy's personality and exciting turn of events, it is impossible to put down. I found myself intrigued by Newman's interesting style of simple word usage that really makes you think and feel as though you are there going through everything with Judy. Pre-teens and teenage girls everywhere would enjoy this easy read and should be required to read it in the seventh and eighth grades."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"I could really relate to this book, and I know alot of girls can too.

Judi has to deal with constant criticism from her peers as well as her mother as they try to develop a deeper and closer relationship. Judi is given a diary as an English assignment and this diary becomes a very important part in her life.This book has a wide variety of characters in it whom all of which are realistic but funny in their own way. I liked Judi because she had to deal with a lot of problems that regular teenage kids deal with today with fitting in at school, dealing with the way she looks and developing relationships. Judi for example, she has problems just like any teenage girl. She wants to have a closer relationship with her mother. And she wants to fit in at school, which becomes a big problem for her based on how she looks. Or at least that's the way she sees it. Like for example, Judi tries to do different things to change the way she looks and this becomes a problem for her as well as her friendship with her best friend Monica. I also liked Nancy Pratt as well. She was the typical cheerleading type girl who everybody likes and she was snobby in a way and she used people like Judi. She got Judi to bring her things and do things for her. And Judi did it because she wanted to fit in and she wanted to be liked. So Nancy was very manipulative. I deffinatley liked the subject matter of this story because it was very realistic and it talks about a common problem with many teenage girls have at this point in time. And it is something that is very serious, but the author told it in a way that was interesting. I like that as well.I would strongly recommend this book to anybody, but especially young teen girls. It sends a very strong message and it tells that you don't always have to change your look or be somebody's gofer just to fit in at school and be liked."},{"Title":"Fat Chance","review":"I chose this book randomely, and ended up reading it in one day.

In many ways, the story is like the Elseworlds tales that DC comics run. Ellis has taken the characters we all know and love and placed them in a very different, darker world, which is perfectly suited for his style of writing. This is worth reading for the new spin on Nightcrawler alone. The art is also terrific (even for an &quot;X&quot; book, which is saying something). i think some people may have avoided picking up X-Calibre if they weren't fans of the Excalibur series, which is too bad because they missed out on the best written chapter of the whole Age of Apocalypse."},{"Title":"Love Roma 2","review":"Hoshino and Negishi have been together for a while now, but what do they really know about each other's lives? I mean, for instance, this volume includes the first time that Negishi actually visits Hoshino at home and meets any of his family. She meets his sister, Rei, whose name also conjures up images of Japanese WWII Zero fighter planes, and she can't really tell if the meeting went well or not. While Hoshino still has a love that maybe borders on the creepy or at least too idealistic, he decides to get a part time job at a restaurant in order to expand his outlook on people. It doesn't help when he's honest with his do-nothing co-worker, flatout telling the loser that he doesn't like him. This isn't good because the lazy bum is actually the owner's son! This second volume also hits on some school manga mainstays such as a \\"haunted school\\" story and the school festival in which Negishi and Hoshino star in a play whose plot and characters sometimes mirror their real lives too closely.Love Roma has an elusive charm that you can't quite put your finger on. The art is pretty simplistic and reminds me more of Western style comics than manga. While slightly tapping on more mature issues, it firmly falls into the category of appealing to a high school audience and the young at heart. These are not flesh and blood characters but romantic stereotypes pushed into a comedy, and that's what makes it funny. The romantic, wooing lover a la Pepe Le Pew pursuing his reluctant but ultimately willing object of devotion. Don't expect a real love story here. But if you like a cartoony kind of love, have at it."},{"Title":"No Place to Run: A True Story as Told by David Gilbert (The Library of Holocaust Testimonies)","review":"David's story starts on the day the German army attacked Poland at the beginning of World War II.

Through every twist and turn first, while hiding from the Nazis then in the Warsaw Ghetto and finally in Bergen Belsen his quick thinking kept his family safe.You will not put this book down until David's final liberation. This book is a tribute to his zest for life. Through all the death and destruction David never lost his faith.David Gilbert is a true hero. His story makes personal what now seems so far removed.

My father ran off with a neighbor when I was 14. My mother drank. This friend was beaten. That one was sexually abused. It's a wonder we all made it to adulthood. But we did, and with a sense of ourselves that may be keener because of the pain we grew up with. Kids who are hurt become, inevitably, observers --- they must master their feelings, anticipate attacks, live with abandonment. They must see clearly.This Paula Fox does, without self-pity and with enormous elegance and understatement. In BORROWED FINERY, the story of the first 20-odd years of her life, she shows us pathological parents, remote from the normal pathways of love: She was barely allowed to be a child at all, in the ordinary sense of being nourished and cared for. It is her mother and father who are the kids in this book: a reckless, feckless, quick-witted, handsome, and thoroughly self-destructive pair. Having abandoned Fox at birth, they proceeded to waltz in and out of her life --- never really taking responsibility, but not letting her forget them, either.Fox's parents did not hit or rape or starve her. They simply weren't interested and were not often present. And their behavior, when they were there, was so antiparental (unparental is not strong enough) that it boggles the mind: Upon hearing Fox observe that her room-service tray had no milk on it, her father threw the dinner out of the window. She went to bed hungry. He borrowed (and never repaid) fifty dollars from her when she was 11 or 12 and took back a typewriter he'd just given her. Her mother once \\"fixed\\" Fox's toothache by taking her on a terrifying car ride through the mountains.One is appalled but fascinated and grateful that Fox wasn't relegated entirely to the world of orphanages and foster care. \\"By chance, by good fortune, I had landed in the hands of rescuers,\\" she writes, \\"a fire brigade that passed me along from person to person until I was safe.\\" The first and foremost of these was \\"Uncle Elwood,\\" a Congregational minister who, out of the goodness of his heart (they were not related), took care of Fox in her early years, making room for her \\"real\\" parents from time to time. They lived in a town called, unbelievably and aptly, Balmville. \\"I would have been one of those children found in a wilderness, written about in case histories, if it had not been for Uncle Elwood,\\" Fox writes; \\"I had learned civility and kindness from him.\\"After that sanctuary ended, her life morphed into a crazy-quilt of hand-me-down clothes and serial schools and temporary arrangements --- trains not met, bills not paid, affection not given. The cast of adult characters was always shifting, and no one seems to have been entirely in charge. Maybe that's why Fox's chapter headings are place names, not people: Hollywood and New Hampshire, Long Island and New York City, Florida and Montreal. In a way, she brought herself up. Forced to assess what each person or relative would be to her and learn --- yet again --- how to fend for herself in every new situation, Fox became an expert at uncertainty: \\"I knew how to behave in parlous circumstances, to temporize and compromise, a lesson taught me by my father.\\" Her father, a screenwriter, also passed on book lore, taught her to swim (cruelly) and drive (patiently). \\"I had begun...to notice an impulse in him --- noble, he would have called it in someone else --- to teach,\\" Fox writes. But his \\"servitude to alcohol\\" got in the way.Fox gives her readers enough time-and-place markers to know when and where we are, but her book isn't a saga heavy with detail and rich in long, rolling sentences. It is a montage of scenes and epiphanies, as if portions of her past had suddenly been made visible by a flash of lightning, and the writing is vivid and precise and spare. On her first meeting with her father, at the age of four or five: \\"The word father was outlandish. It held an ominous note. I was transfixed by it. It was as though I had emerged from a dark wood into the sudden glare of headlights.\\" And at the other end of the book, as she struggles with adulthood, \\"My life was incoherent to me. I felt it quivering, spitting out broken teeth.\\"It is taking nothing away from Fox's originality to say that BORROWED FINERY is strikingly Dickensian: her abandonment as a baby, not to mention the array of eccentrics --- Uncle Elwood could have walked straight out of David Copperfield, name and all --- who rescued and rejected her. And there is a twisty, almost Victorian symmetry in the final chapter (the surprise is too good to give away), where Fox defies her chaotic upbringing and reasserts a sense of family. Like Dickens, who also had an abysmal childhood, she not only has moral intelligence, but she knows how to tell a hell of a good story.--- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman"},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"I had never even heard of this author and a friend was reading it at work and couldnt put it down.

I ended up ordering every other book she has written for adults and then when I asked other people about her it seems the whole world has read Paula Fox and loved her work except for me. IM so glad to have discovered her and reading her memoir makes reading her other books even more special.Even Oprah recommended her.

Borrowed Finery is a memoir of her life that provides us with a collection of small episodes extending from childhood through her teen years. I hate reading memoirs, but decided to read this one to get a better understanding of Paula Fox the Novelist. Nothing much pleasant transpired during these years; the brief incidents that we hear about are, perhaps, the only ones she feels at ease telling.Her parents simply didn't want to raise her. Father was a screenwriter, and mother was offended by a daughter who disrupted her life by being born. Both were heavy drinkers. Ms Fox's father seemed to have some affection for her, while the mother reacted to Paula as if someone had let some mangy, un-housebroken dog into the room. Young Paula was sent to live with a variety of people during her life, and she never knew how long she would spend with any of her caretakers. For some time she was taken by her grandmother to her great grandmother's Cuban plantation where she was left totally on her own. She got up, went to school, came home, talked to some of the servants and went to bed without any contact with the grandparents.It was a sad life for a child, but Ms Fox grew up, married, and wrote 21 children's books and her excellent novels. By the way, she is also Courtney Love's grandmother.Borrowed Finery also provides some insight into the mind behind the characters and themes in her books. My suggestion: read her memoir and her novels."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"At the age of five, Paula Fox is wrested from the security of her life with the kindly minister, &quot;Uncle Elwood,&quot; who had been raising her from infancy, into&quot;the hands of rescuers, a fire brigade that passed me along from person to person,&quot; including her maternal grandmother, her uncles, her father's mistress, and assorted neighbors. Her parents, who would appear in her life sporadically, disrupted her brief interludes of contentment. Her mother, who Ms. Fox ponders how she could have been &quot;organic enough&quot; to have carried her in her belly, is cold and cruel, with a smile which is described as &quot;neutral.&quot; Her father, at times &quot;playful,&quot; is impotent in the face of his wife's rancor towards their daughter, and his awkward attempts at kindness are neutralized by his alcoholism.Although Ms. Fox's memoir -- which is comprised of vignettes of her experiences in different cities in the United States and Cuba -- recounts a young life of abject rejection, her tale is depicted with such detachment and aloofness that it was difficult for this reader to sympathize with her plight. Although it was refreshing to read a memoir that was not characterized by the typical maudlin excess which plagues many contemporary memoirs, the voice in this story was so reserved and composed, it was as if the author were writing about someone else's life. Perhaps this dispassion is a symptom of her upbringing, but it seemed to damage the story. This reader was also frustrated by the failure of the author to even attempt to explain why her mother viewed her child's mere existence as &quot;calamitous.&quot; Was her mother mentally ill? Surely, as an adult, the product of such utter abandonment by her mother would seek some explanation for her mother's callous treatment. This reader was also disturbed by the failure of the author to examine how her upbringing impacted her as an adult. Ms. Fox mentions a failed marriage to an actor/merchant marine, and a child, apparently the product of a brief affair, whom she places for adoption and with whom she reconciles many years later, but she neglects to flesh out these relationships as if she were anxious to conclude her story."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"This is certainly the best book of the year that I have read.She spares us nothing of the torment of her life;yet it is told with such simplicity and elegance. anyone who considers themself a serious reader owes it to themselves to read this memoir."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"I accidentally came across this book at a used book store - I was immediately drawn into the drama of this lovely lady who had the very strangest of childhoods, and yet, managed to escape madness. The author makes each little snapshot of her life come alive - it is a moving and tender book in many places and then again, the reader wonders how she is able to hold onto such a pleasant outlook on life. Her memoir writing style reminds me of Anne Morrow Lindbergh in some respects and I always felt Lindbergh was writing to me personally. I think this is a must read. Kathleen Wyatt"},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"This is a book I want to love. The prose is precise and sometimes quite haunting. But it's hard to get fully immersed in the narrative. The author seems to be holding her readers at a distance--by giving us summary rather than scenes and reflection.That said, I am glad I read it. If you are a fan of Paula Fox, I think this is an important read. And if you are interested in memoir, again, this is a good book to spend time with."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"Paula Fox's memoir hardly needs my approval; it has been acclaimed by critics. I wish more people were aware of Fox's writing; she is one of the best fiction writers in the U.S. Check out her short novel Desperate Characters."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"\\"Born in the twenties to nomadic, bohemian parents, Paula Fox was left at birth in a Manhattan orphanage...\\" What a range of people she had caring for her over her growing up years, what neglect at times, what an interesting range of geographic locations she lived in during her childhood. This \\"memoir\\" seemed to hold such promise, but really I found it a chore to read. A collection of memories, not always connected up, it never hooked me in, leaving me eager to find out what happened next. It also completely lacks any analysis - of the characters, events, Paula's reaction to them, the impact on her life, etc. Its main redeeming feature for me was its brevity - had it been longer, I may well have given up. Maybe if I was a fan of her novels (certainly her memoir is well written), or interested in other members of her family (apparently she is Courtney Love's grandmother), I would have been more motivated to enjoy rather than just tolerate this book."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"The memoir genre has mushroomed in recent years and prospered on tales of wild dysfunction--true or not. Memoirs also seem to have become the last refuge of the self-indulgent literary ego: 'It really is all about me, and I suffered, dammit!' Paula Fox's 'Borrowed Finery' is an antidote to all those therapy-fed toxic dumps, telling a stark, beautifully crafted tale that persistently shifts focus away from the author and to her fascinating parents, both seemingly momstrous egos in themselves. Like Jeannette Walls' Glass Castle, this book transcends genre and provokes sincere reflection on the concepts of parenthood, childhood and resilience."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"Great book, but the customer review alleging that Marlon Brando sired Courtney Love's mom is untrue. In an exclusive interview with The Oregonian, Paula's daughter and Courtney's mother Linda Carroll angrily confirms that her father is NOT Marlon Brando."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"It's hard to empathize with Paula, the discarded daughter. This memoir is so disconnected, so lacking in insight as to the characters. Her growing up was surely terrible, abandoned from birth, then living with various people in bizarre circumstances. I would have liked to know how the lonely, reclusive girl became a renowned writer and was able to relate to her own family. The same detachment is evident in Paula Fox' adult novels, so I can now see where it comes from. This is better than many of the current memoirs, yet somehow falls flat."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"Never got hooked on this book. Continued to read and finished the book because she is Courtney Love's grandmother and wanted some insight in that regard. I thought it was boring and all over the place. Best memoir I ever read is \\"The Glass Castle.\\""},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"Although I have sympathy for Ms. Fox, I felt that I wanted to know more about her parents. For example, was she ever diagnosed as mentally ill or perhaps a personality disorder? She should have been locked up for her actions toward her daughter? I felt that Ms. Lock herself did not take what happened to her as a child seriuosly-she was quite abused and was treated in a manor not fit for a dog! The memoir seemed as if it were more fiction than anything-due to the writer's inability to write with any feeling about her life."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"Returned the book. Started to read the book but within the first cou0ple of pages couldn't get past the word-jams and author's long convoluted sentence structure."},{"Title":"Borrowed Finery : A Memoir","review":"She's Courtney Love's grandmother, Linda Carroll (famous therapist) is the child she gave up for adoption.Now her daughter Linda is going to write a bio of HER life where she mentions who her father is (at least that's the rumor), and supposedly Linda Carroll's father is none other than MARLON BRANDO!How's THAT for a bombshell that is missing from this book?"},{"Title":"Hispanisms (Hispanic) and Homosexualities (13 Essays)","review":"This was the way it used to be: Cono Sur scholars deciding for us who \\"belonged\\" in Gay and Lesbian Literature and ignoring Latinas in the USA.

Unfortunately, the stodgy texts on ancient Spanish authors often drown out the cool articles about gay US Latinos.

However, you are better off buying &quot;Eminent Maricones&quot; by Manrique or Cherrie Moraga's books."},{"Title":"THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH","review":"Howard Philip Lovecraft (1890-1937) did not have a high regard for his novelette \\"Shadow Over Innsmouth\\". To paraphrase from the Wikipedia: Lovecraft wrote to August Derleth that the story \\"has all the defects I deplore especially in point of style, where hackneyed phrases & rhythms have crept in despite all precautions.... No I don't intend to offer 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' for publication, for it would stand no chance of acceptance\\". It was eventually published as a slim book with a run of 200 copies. The only book of Lovecraft's fiction distributed during his lifetime. August Derleth called The Shadow Over Innsmouth \\" a dark, brooding story, typical of Lovecraft at his best.\\"Not withstanding Lovercraft's oppinion this reader believes that the \\"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\\" to be a spendid example of HPL's fictional writings and exhibits many of the compelling theams used in his other works.I will attempt a very abbreviated summary of the plot with no spoilers. Our narrator, who is never named, undertakes a \\"tour of New England for sightseeing, antiquarian and genealogical - and had planned to go to Newburyport and on to Arkham whence my mother's family was derived\\". He takes a dilapidated old bus that makes the Newburyport - Innsmouth - Arkham run only to have it break down in Arkham stranding him for the night. The back-story of strangeness and horrors in Arkham are conveyed to the narrator by three individuals: the curator at the Newburyport Historical Society, a clerk in the First National (grocery) Store in Innsmouth and by the most intriguing character in the story 96 year old Zadok Allen, town drunkard. The narrator escaped Innsmouth and capture by the very peculiar inhabitants with the help of a map given to him by the store clerk.I suspect readers new to Lovecraft will finds this story more than mildly confusing what with all the unexplained terms, Lovercraft's over the top descriptions of terror and the maze like journey thought Innsmouth's many streets.Lovecraft peppers his story with terms that beg a description but none are giving. We encounter the old topper Zadok Allen and his mouths \\"R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga\\" with no explanation and asks his listener if \\"ever hear tell of shoggoth?' A what, you say. The narration visits Miskatonic University in Arkham. This town and school show up in several other stories but you would not know it from this tale. Several references are made to the \\"Esoteric Order of Dagon\\". Hmmm sounds very creepy. Fan of HPL relish these links to other stories but new readers be warned.Lovecraft had a way with words and used them, overused some would say, to convey the atmosphere of dread or creepiness he was attempting. For example: \\"It took no excessive sensitiveness to beauty to make me literally gasp at the strange, unearthly splendor of the alien, opulent phantasy of the tiara...the pattern on the piece hinted of remote secrets and unimaginable abyss in time and space\\". Innsmouth is a \\"Festering city of death and decay\\". Zadok lays it on thick also \\"Thar's whar it all begun-the cursed place of all wickedness where the deep water starts. Gates o' hell-sheer drop daown to a bottom no saoudin' line kin tech.\\" and \\"Yew want to know what the reel horror is, hey? Wal, it's this- it ain't what thern fish devils haz done, but it's what they're a-goin' to do! They're a-bringin' things up aout o' whar they come from into the taown....ever hear tell of a shoggoth?\\" My favorite is \\"Haow'd ye like to be livin' in a taown like this, with everthing a-rottin' an' dyin' boarded up monsters crawlin' an' bleatin' an' barkin' an hoppin' aroun' black cellars and attics every where ye turn?\\" Whew what a place!Well, it does not take much common sense to know that Innsmouth is no place to be if the fish-frog guys are after you so take out your map and make tracks. Lovecraft knew where he was going but I could never figure out his directions, for example: \\"At Bates Street I drew into a yawing vestibule...was soon on my way again approaching where Eliot Street crossed Washington at the intersection of South.\\" Later the directions are, well, confusing \\" I edged around into Babson which crossed Federal...noised continued on Washington...darted around the corner into Lafayette Street and crossed Eliot...my greatest dread was re-crossing South Street\\" and on and on.If you want to \\"dig in' to this story, and I hope you do, get a map of the fictional town of Innsmouth. Do a search on the internet, find it and print it out. Now it all makes sense.Now about those mysterious terms shoggoth, Dagon, R'lyeh wgah-nagl fhtaga and ol' Miskatonic U. Well, you don't need to know about them to just enjoy the story unless, of course, you just have to know...well that's what Google is for!Ok, \\"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn\\", which translates as \\"In his house at R'lyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming. Is it time to read another Lovecraft story?Added 03-14-2011There is another level of interest concerning this story that may appeal to the curiosity of some readers. Thoughout the text Lovecraft incorporated numerous real place and family names from Essex County in Massachusetts; in addition there are subtle references to other Lovecraft stories. If you are intrigued by this tale and motivated to fill your cranium with a lot of useless but interesting bits of trivia read the Necronomicon Press edition of the illustrated and annotated \\"The Shadow over Innsmouth\\". The book contains 150 detailed footnotes, a 15 pages introduction, a discarded draft of the story and 5 full-page illustrations by Jason Eckhardt. The two paperback editions of this title (1994,97) have long been out of print but copies are available used.Oh yes, I was raised in Essex County and have visited many of the towns he enjoyed visiting and writing about."},{"Title":"THE SHADOW OVER INNSMOUTH","review":"H. P. Lovecraft tells some truly chilling tales. I really enjoyed The Shadow Over Innsmouth, but it wasn't the best Lovecraft I've read. So far, my favorite is At the Mountains of Madness.

I saw \\"Dagon\\" as a teenager-obsessed with horror movies-and the story always stuck out because you almost believe it could be true.

The band takes a back seat to Crimson's relationship with her deceased mother, a subject touched on briefly in &lt;em>A Light in the Darq&lt;/em>. Crimson's thirteenth birthday approaches, and as it gets closer, she pulls away from her friends, who end up having to scurry around trying to figure out what's going on with her from others when she completely shuts down. It was a bold movie for a series that had already established a direction, but it was, in my estimation, a successful one; in fact, this ended up being my favorite book in the series (so far, I fervently hope). Black dug much farther into Crimson's character, and tackled issues a lot more personal than her usual stomping grounds of cliquishness.

Everything, even printed scores, was hand-written and -engraved. Part of the music school experience was learning to write manuscript correctly, legibly and uniformly. In this Prof. Read and his book were indispensable.Interestingly, in this age when textbook prices are rising faster than the price of gasoline, this edition of Prof. Read's book is *half* the price of the original trade paperback that i bought almost forty years ago.Are there better books now?

Every chapter is well organized, and the reference tables are a particularly helpful resource.Being a young composer, I found this book extremely valuable for providing me with the knowledge that, although essential to all musical fields, is rarely taught in any manner. A must buy for all musicians."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"I have had this book on my reference shelf for over twenty years. While it hasn't answered every question I've ever had about music notation, it has always at least pointed me in the right direction. Anyone interested in putting music on paper should own this book--and read it.(I also think that this book will most certainly outlast--&quot;Pentatonic Scales for the Jazz-Rock Keyboardist&quot; by Jeff Burns. At least Mr. Read has something to be pretentious about.)"},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"As others have said, this book is extremely extensive. It covers just about every notational circumstance (available up to the mid sixties that is) in great detail. This is my number one reccommendation for a notation book.However, the section on Jazz is absolutely horrible, and offensive. Not only does it contain numerous flaws, it is missing a ton of stuff that the Jazz composer needs to notate. Also, it is offensive in that he refers to most Jazz music as \\"not serious.\\" The book would be almost perfect if they would just leave the Jazz section out altogether. He apparently did not take very much time researching Jazz compositions (I don't think he every looked at one!) and did not put an importance on that chapter."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"I realize that music is a far broader field than one person can encompass. But I also realize that there are plenty of people who are well-versed in all fields of music who would be glad to help a person who is writing a book on the subject. Read obviously did not consult anybody.Read could not have thought very much of recorder consort music. Otherwise, he would have given the subject more than the cursory glance on pages 339-340. He also could not have played in a recorder consort. Otherwise, he would know that the tenor sounds as written and the bass sounds an octave higher than written, contrary to the misinformation which he gave us.The discussion on string instruments isn't razor sharp either. The greatest blooper is on page 387, where we see a sample of fingered harmonics at the fifth. This would require an unrealistically wide stretch, so nothing like this would appear even in solo music. Any violinist consulted by Read would have caught this mistake in a jiffy.Now I see that Joel Fass and Joe Lewis have similar comments on the chapter on jazz. Do mistakes of this sort run through the entire book?I don't know very much about woodwinds and brasses. If Read misrepresented the recorder family, the string family, and jazz instruments so badly, can I rely on what Read told us about woodwinds and brasses?Most orchestration books begin with a list of musicians of different specialties whom the author had consulted. Why doesn't this book? efgoldman tells us that Dr. Read was \\"pretentious, overbearing, and condescending.\\" That could be the reason."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"Not for the newbie. Not because it's hard to read--it's not. But when you have the basics of music notation well in hand, there are a host of detail questions about getting those little nits right. For example, if you have a phrase where the last two notes are tied, and you want to slur the phrase, does the right end of the slur go over the FIRST tied note or over the SECOND? And if you have 13 notes to a quarter note, do you notate those as 16ths or 32nds? Questions like these are far from academic--in a commercial performance situation (e.g. studio) ease-of-reading because your score is consistent with standard notation practice translates directly into fewer reading errors = save $$$. At any rate, I keep just a handful of reference books in ready reach by my music workstation, and Read is one of them."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"This is one of the most informative and INTERESTING books I've ever read concerning the subject of musical notation. It goes into the history of notation and shows the evolution of how it began to where it is now, and where it is going including newer experimental notational methods. I won't go into detail as previous reviewers have done a great job of that, but even if you never write a single note of music, there is much to be gained by reading this book. What I like most is the critical detail of EXACT procedure when notating music by hand. Computerized music notation programs do all the notating details for you and the composer who relies solely on these programs for musical notation is not understanding what it is that they are doing. This book clearly explains, using plain English, how to go about the task of hand-writing music with many, many examples and even tests to see if you understand what you are learning. I have a degree in Music and I have learned more from this book about music notation than I ever did in music school.I can't say enough good things about this book and it is my favorite music notation book so far. I have several others."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"As a free-standing piece of work to someone unfamiliar with the technical mastery it takes just to notate creative music, this text may seem ineffective. However, to the serious, grounded composer looking to martial the skills of not just any given solo instrument but also the extended techniques of all the major instrument families, it is an absolute gem."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"I have had occasion to re-evaluate this book.

It is rather much, however, to call everyone who feels otherwise unserious and ungrounded. Well, this book is more extensive than most music notation books, and that is worth something. On the other hand, 1) it misunderstands rhythm--as the grounded and serious and often performed composer Paul Creston points out (much more often performed, by the way, than the author of this book) and 2) for most &quot;extended techniques&quot; there generally is no standard notation, as a glance at &quot;New Music Vocabulary&quot; by Howard Risatti will demonstrate.The supercilious composition student (or soi-disant &quot;serious, grounded composer&quot;) can learn much about rhythmic notation from Paul Creston's &quot;Principles of Rhythm&quot;, yet I recommend Paul Creston's &quot;Principles of Rhythm&quot; for all musicians of all temperaments.

Especially where that matter is widely available elsewhere, as in this case, it is appropriate to judge such a book by its manner of presentation. I find &quot;Music Notation&quot;'s manner of presentation deficient. It is difficult to use and difficult to trust, and its style is obtrusive and annoying. Again, although music-notation reference books tend to come and go, there are many alternatives to this book still available. I agree that one of the best is &quot;The Norton Manual of Music Notation&quot; by George Heussenstamm."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"I bought this because it was recommended in an interview by a great composer-arranger, the late Oliver Nelson. I'm sorry to say I disagree with Mr. Nelson, and am greatly disappointed. And I'm VERY sorry to have to report this, due to the tremendous research and work Read obviously put in. Plus,I was very impressed with another of his books: &quot;Style and Orchestration&quot;. I couldn't recommend that one more highly. So go figure.Jazz being my own indocrination as composer and performer, I turned to Read's chapter on jazz notation. I wasn't halfway through one page before shaking my head at the mischaracterizations and general misinformation contained within. To wit: He starts out a discussion of staves by stating that &quot;the five line staff is used by all the jazz instrumentalists except guitar and ukelele&quot;. Well, gee, Mr. Read, that comes as an awful shock, since I'm playing guitar 35 years, since age 12, and am fully capable of reading treble and bass clef--thank you very much---as are my many colleagues. The fingerboard notation he takes for standard practice went out with high button shoes. You will never see it but for ancient lead sheets. As for &quot;tablature&quot;, it's strictly for rockers, beginning players or those too lazy too read. Ask around. Jazz, it seems, grew up when Mr. Read wasn't looking, and its practitioners on all instruments ought not be insulted like this. He later goes on to demonstrate rest notation in jazz scoring and states that after indicating the desired number (i.e.: 6)telling the player how many bars to &quot;lay out&quot;, in his words, &quot;the remaining measures of silence are then left blank&quot;. Wrong again. I've NEVER seen that, and wouldn't write that way myself for fear of confusing players who just finished counting bars to rest. Finally, a body blow to the corpus of work of great jazz arrangers and composers is landed at the chapter's close, when discussing dynamics he states &quot;dynamics are usually at a minimum in jazz scores. Frequently an instrument will have no indication of the desired dynamic level&quot;. All he had to do was look at ANY score by a top jazz writer---Oliver Nelson, Gil Evans, Thad jones, Bob Brookmeyer, Manny Albam, take your pick---to know not to write such utter twaddle.I cannot comment on Read's grasp of classical notation, as I have not written enough in the idiom, and lack the expertise. But, frankly, after encountering the misinformation on jazz notation, I'm afraid to read and take it at its word---don't want more of the same. I feel terrible saying this, as his other aforementioned book is of top quality. Other parts of this book I've scanned seem very comprehensive in their research and scholarship, and I will read on, hoping that the jazz chapter was an ill-conceived wrong turn into territory he's unknowledgeable about. He's obviously quite a fine musician, and I'd love to hear his compositions. But I can't recommend a book so full of 24-karat misinformation in just one chapter."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"This book is filled with bad and ill-considered advice. It is ineptly written, stilted, pretentious, and poorly organized--the worst music notation book I've seen.

I recommend you buy this instead.I also very much recommend PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"Title":"Music notation,: A manual of modern practice","review":"Paul Creston in his authoritative &quot;Rational Metric Notation&quot; points out several of Garner Read's errors. Here is one:1) &quot;Chapter 10 of Gardner Read's book 'Music Notation', entitled 'Meter and Time Signatures,' begins: 'TIME, METER, TEMPO, RHYTHM--musicians often use these terms imprecisely. But the four expression are not synonymous, and only two are interchangeable. The analogous terms are TIME and METER...' The first sentence and the first phrase of the second sentence state a truism; the remainder of the statement vitiates the truth.&quot;The more than two dozen dictionary definitions of TIME can be condensed into one synonym, DURATION, which is present in every definiton of TIME. The word METER is derived from the Greek METRON, the Latin METRUM, and the French METRE; in ANY language, it means MEASURE. In music, therefore, TIME means DURATION, and METER means MEASUREMENT OF DURATION. Hence, TIME and METER are NOT analogous or interchangeable.&quot;"},{"Title":"Apartheid: A history","review":"First off, the book was an amazing resource to get me the historical information on the formation of apartheid. It includes various details that other resources did not have. The author obviously did his research, including not only a detailed account of ALL events associated with apartheid (and leading up to it) but succeeded in capturing the major causes happenings, and results of South African apartheid.At some points, however, it was a difficult read. The book was a very good source but sometimes the chronology of events was hard to understand and follow (sometimes the book focused on a certain time period then skipped ahead to years later, only to return back again). All in all, it allowed the me, as the reader, to leave with a greater understanding of the South African apartheid.

Written by a pediatrician and mother, it contains all the necessary information in an easy-to-use, nicely illustrated format. But doesn't have the personal vignettes and \\"tales from the front lines\\" advice that books like \\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\\" have, advice and personal accounts that I found comforting as a new mother.

According to Lubbock,\\" The labour was atorment, a care, and a delight, as his letters and the Prefaces themselves amply show. The thinking and the writing were hard and full and critical to the point of exasperation; the purpose was high, the reference wide, and the terms of discourse had to be conceived and defined as successive need for them arose. He had to elucidate and appropriate for the critical intellect the substance and principle of his career as an artist, and he had to do this, such was the idiosyncracy of his mind-specifically, example following lucid example with the consistency of mathematicl equation, so that in the Poetics, if his premises were accepted his conclusions must be taken as inevitable.\\" p. viiBlackmur says that criticism has never been more ambitious, or more useful. He cites James' definition of his task in his preface to 'Roderick Hudson'. \\"These notes represent over a considerable course the continuity of an artist's endeavor, the growth of the whole operative consciousness, and best of all, perhaps their own tendency to multiply , with the implication, thereby of a memory enriched'.Among the prefaces included are those to 'Roderick Hudson' ' What Maisie Knew' 'The Princess Cassamissima' 'The Spoils of Poynton' 'The Altar to the Dead' 'The Tragic Muse'' The Lesson of the Master' ' The Aspern Papers' 'The Awkward Age''The Portrait of a Lady' ' The American'James famous advice to the writer about ' trying to be one upon whom nothing is lost' certainly seems to apply to himself in his effort to understand and deepen the meaning of his own work both for himself and for his readers."},{"Title":"A Spell For The Fulfillment Of Desire -","review":"Don Webb is a major figure on the fringe of science fiction (or &quot;speculative literature&quot; or whatever they started calling it ten minutes ago) who hasn't yet gotten the attention he deserves. Combining sharp self-awareness, poison wit, and an itchy need to write stories a few standard deviations from the norm, he takes more chances on a single page than many writers take in their lifetimes. Webb reminds me of Robert Anton Wilson's Cagliostro the Great, who followed his magic act with explanations of how he fooled the audience and then went on to explain how they were also fooled by the government, media, religion, etc.Sometimes his trickery inspires great fiction, as in &quot;Nor Sleet Nor Hail,&quot; in which a postal worker can't bear to deliver bad news and takes matters into his own hands, sometimes it inspires amusement--&quot;After Abish&quot; contains only words starting with the letter &quot;A.&quot; Mostly, though, Webb simply inspires thought, a claim credibly made by few authors."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"This collection of sermons by one of America's most talented writers provides the reader with profound insight into not only the challenges of the human predicament and the foibles of endless human striving, but, more importantly, the giftedness of life and the grace of God. In his peculiarly winsome manner, Buechner reveals to us that the most extraordinary things in life are available to us not as a result of our own efforts, but as pure gift."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"Originally intended (as per Buechner's Introductory Note) for congregations consisting of predominantly young people, this compilation of 18 essay's speaks to every Christian who would sit down and read them. The Magnificent Defeat is broken down into 3 parts. I - The Challenge to Surrender , II - The Triumph of Love, III - The Mystery and Miracle of Grace. Each essay starts with a quote from scripture and then continues on with Buechners typical introspective point of view on the life of Christ, and in turn our own life as a result. While Buechner does touch on some theological points, a lot of his essays deal with the search for the Truth. Given the fact that it was originally intended for young people it does touch on the matters of the legitimacy of God (He does exist!) and why the person of Jesus Christ makes sense. As an apologetics resource, I think Buechner touches the most basic of subjects in an easy to understand AND relateable manner. These essays are powerful, and can also serve as a good topic of discussion during particular Christian seasons (i.e.: 2 essays on the Birth of Christ, 2 essays on the Death of Christ) as well. I highly recommend this book, along with all the other Buechner works. His style is unique, but just as relevant and just as strong as other great Christian writers, such as C.S. Lewis."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"This is a great collection of sermons. It's a great gift especially for young people. I have given this book as a graduation gifts to college students and have led book discussions with college students.

Frederick goes into great detail in explaining what might have went on inside the lives of the people involved in the &quot;Christmas&quot; story.Somehow, he is always able to help the reader relate to the characters in the story. He does it by bringing in everyday life illustrations, and helps us see the characteristics in the characters to be very much like ourselves. One example is the way he describes the innkeeper who only gave Joseph and Mary a barn to spend the night.The author is like Max Lucado in that he writes in very easy-to-read language but provides much food for thought."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"Frederick Buechner is a tremendously gifted writer - something lacking in the Church these days. This collection of sermons was a delight to read; I found myself challenged and I had to underline several lengthy passages for their beauty and truth. The one thing that distracts me from Buechner's writing at times is that, those these sermons are each inspired by a few verses, Buechner rarely uses extensive Biblical teaching to back up his thoughts, relying primarily on his own experience and his own view of human nature. There is something to this, as it could broaden his audience and sometimes our day-to-day experiences can illustrate the truth of the Gospel in ways Scripture cannot, but for someone from a conservative, evangelical background, it is agitating at times.One notable aspect of this book (and one which is entirely understandable considering it was first published in 1966) is that much of the tension that seeps through Buechner's writing in \\"The Magnificent Defeat\\" concerns itself with the Cold War and the threat of nuclear oblivion."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"Our book club just finished reading this book.

As fate (or God) would have it, each woman brought to the discussion a chapter that had meaning to her - and in a room with 8-10 people, each had a different \\"favorite\\" chapter! The whole book was great and I plan to read this book over and over again for years to come."},{"Title":"The magnificent defeat","review":"This is a collection of sermons which begin with a piece of scripture and then interprets it to give meaning to the audience's everyday lives.

Unlike the standard Perl reference, which had me tearing out my hair, this one does not assume you already know other languages, though it does assume you have familiarity with basic HTML.This book won't take you far into perl but as far as it goes, holds your hand and is very focused on what's needed to do cgi scripts. At just over 260 pp it is less daunting than the standard reference.Castro explains different data types ( scalars, arrays, etc.); shows how to create a cgi script; how to set permissions; how to set up forms on your html page so the data you receive is labelled right and how to analyze it; use of basic perl functions; how to access external files from a script; and more. She tells you what information you have to get from your ISP in order to set up and access your cgi scripts.Most helpfully, each section is heavily cross-referenced to minimize fruitless flipping back and forth trying to understand examples.Even so, a beginner will doubtless find some things confusing."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"The author knows the subject well; two problems: - I cannot read it without a magnifying glass (and it is not my eyes; I am a commercial pilot and pass a physical every year) the use of point 6 type and smaller in screen shots makes an otherwise good book unreadable.- the instructions are for computer illiterates: ie page 113:&quot;1.

I've been using the HTML and Perl/CGI books since 2001 on various projects and have found them extremely useful. I have a few other books in the VQS series and I can tell you that they are not all created equal. Castro, however, is pretty thorough which is why this book is not only a good starting place, but a usable reference as well.Some topics covered include getting familiar with Perl syntax and functions, installing Perl, communicating with Web servers, creating HTML pages and forms, serving up data, and dealing with security. If you know any programming language, you can begin to pick up Perl very quickly from her examples. In fact I used this book to tackle my first Perl script and had it working fairly quickly. She assumes some knowledge of HTML and the basics of Web servers and browsers.Advanced topics such as using databases to store or retrieve data on Web pages is not covered in this fairly small book, but that is a topic worthy of a separate book anyway. Other issues such as dealing with specific Web servers are also best left to other books. For the price and ease of use, I highly recommend Castro's book.

So I decided on perl and picked up this book. My thoughts are as follows:1. I read alot of reviews saying that you could not take the scripts directly from the book and use them in your own site. Of course not, this book assumes you have no prior programming experience but it also assumes that you have problem solving abilities exceeding those of farm animals. You can easily pull things from the examples together to make very usable scripts.2. After completing this book, I read others on the subject and realized that alot of ways things were done in the book are very messy. The great thing about perl is that it can look very neat if written well. Apparently mrs. Castro really doesn't believe in this concept. Take into consideration the following example:-looking for something particular in a file. Castro: open(FILE &quot;&lt;file.txt&quot;) || &amp;error; @file = &lt;FILE&gt;; close(FILE); foreach $entry(@file) { if ($entry =~ /$search/) { print $entry; } }yet, a much easier way to do it would be:open(FILE, &quot;&lt;file.txt&quot;)or die &quot;Can't open file.txt\\\\n&quot;; while (&lt;FILE&gt;) { print if /$search/; } close(FILE);Sorry about the code, but it makes a valid point that you can learn alot from this book, but be prepared to relearn everything if you want to advance."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"With 71 other reviews there's no much to add -- but I'll throw my two cents in here anyway.If you're looking for an 'in-depth' book on Perl/CGI -- look elsewhere. If you're a beginner like me, this is a book to buy.Seriously, if you're teaching yourself then you'll always need more than one book on whatever subject you're learning. You'll want to suppliment this volume with other manuals. But viewed by itself, the author does an admirable job of getting her subject across -- even to thick folks like myself. I found concepts and codes shown in this book to be much clearer than in other texts I've read. Now I can go back to the 'other texts' and (hopefully) understand what they were trying to teach me.I also believe that I will find this to be a good reference volume as I write scripts. Each function is laid out in step-by-step detail and won't take a lot of reading or thinking to refresh my memory.If you want to learn Perl and you're just starting out. This is one of the first books you should buy. Quite reasonable at about $15, too.*** Recommended ***~P~"},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"Last week I knew nothing about CGI or how to go about learning it. I've been in the computer industry for decades &amp; am well aware how difficult it is to find a good book on anything to do with computer technology. As I browsed the shelves of internet books at my local bookstore, looking for something that would help, I have to admit I felt somewhat disheartened by the hopelessness of the task. You see, there were so many books on the internet and it seemed, each were 700 pages or more in length. (I looked at a few of them. Hopelessly complex.)There wedged between two 100 pounders were two copies of Perl and CGI for the world wide web. By pure chance, I reached over and picked one of them, took a seat and began to browse through it. In no time, I found my self scribbling down web addresses mentioned in P&amp;CGI until I came across the section on getting and installing a personal web server. How to set up your own little test environment. It was written in plain English ... and small capsules of information that could easily be understood. I was sold! I paid for it and hurried home. Within a few hours I was deep into the book, having downloaded the requisite PWS and set up my development environment. Everything worked exactly as your book says. When I uploaded my simple CGI script to my basic webpage voila! it worked there too! Now I know how marconi felt when first he heard the crackling of the radio signal coming across the Atlantic!This is why I writing to you. I feel compelled to congratulate you on the marvelous job you've done in presenting this material. There are only two other books I can remember in my 30-year love affair with computers that come close to your book ... both were on PC-Forth. Yours is an amazing feat. A fantastic introduction that demystifies CGI, Perl and web programming. You deserve a gold star! &lt;gold star&gt;."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I have some experience with Perl and no experience with CGI, so I was looking for a book that would help me make the transition to using CGI. After looking around a lot, there did not seem to be a clear choice. Most of the books were aimed at someone who knew nothing about either or already had a solid background in both and wanted to increase their skill level. I finally decided to try this book.I have only previously purchased one other book in the Visual Quickstart Guide series (PageMaker 7 for Windows and MacIntosh). I soon learned that there is a difference in a book written about an application and a book written about programming. Although this series may work nicely for an application with menus and so forth, the picture format is not that helpful when learning programming. Probably the first thing I noticed was that many of the \\"screen shots\\" were in Spanish. Although the text is in English, many of the examples are not. (HTML, Perl, and CGI are \\"universal\\" languages, but plain text--the web page content--is not.) Although this is not an insurmountable problem, it did make following the examples more difficult. Therefore, I removed a \\"half star\\" from the rating for this weakness. (Let's face it, how hard would it be to type 20 scripts using a different language and change the screen shots in the book?)The author stated that the book's format would not allow printing everything (there is a clue there), but that you could download the files from one of two sites. Although you have interaction of three different structures (HTML, Perl, and CGI), you may not see them all in the book for any given exercise, and some of them will not be complete. Here is an typical example:1. The author presents a screen shot of the HTML page that generates the values being used. It does not include a listing of the underlying HTML markup. Therefore, the reader has to guess based on the appearance of the web page what the underlying markup looks like--including variable names and types. You will find as the exercises get more complex, that guessing becomes very difficult without resorting to examining the downloaded files.2. The author shows a snippet of the Perl program, revealing the new content. You are assumed to have already mastered the rest of the program to some extent.3. A final screen shot that reveals what the output looks like.4. The book's text that accompanies these images uses generic phrases such as \\"Type 'name', where name is the content of the HTML form element's NAME attribute.\\"By sitting back and pondering each exercise, you can figure things out, but it is unacceptable (in my opinion, at least) to make the reader work so hard to put all the pieces together when the author could have cited a specific example in the book. Therefore, I removed another star from the rating for this combination of weaknesses.In some cases the text is not related to the images at all. As an example, I cannot comprehend how the text and images on page 144 (that discusses referring to multiple items in an array) go together. The instructions refer to text that does not appear anywhere in the screen shots. Therefore, I removed another \\"half star\\" from the rating for this, since it happens more than once. (It makes me wonder if anyone put anything beyond a cursory effort into proofreading this book.)The Visual Quickstart Guide series promotes itself as a source where you can get what you need by going directly to the relevant chapters and using it partly as a reference rather than as a tutorial. Unfortunately, programming does not work like that unless you already understand the content presented earlier in the book. In my opinion, unless your CGI needs are very minimal, you will need to read the entire book in order to establish a working knowledge of this topic. I do not consider that either a strength or weakness of the book. It is more the nature of the subject matter. Still, if you plan to purchase this book and scan for a few ideas and be \\"up and running in no time\\" as the book cover claims, you will be disappointed. (Unless you already understand the topic and will just use the book as a reference to remind you of certain commands or formats.)While writing this review, I realized that this is not a standalone book. Although I did not spend an extensive amount of time in other books, I did need to refer to other Perl and HTML books occasionally to grasp the concepts being presented, probably spending an hour in each to supplement and better explain various topics discussed in this book. For a book aimed at beginning and intermediate programmers, I believe this is unacceptable. The author does suggest that if you need to brush up on HTML that you should buy her other book(!), and she also says that this book (Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web) is not an exhaustive guide to Perl. I suppose this could be taken to warn the reader that they need some knowledge of both before using the book, but I believe the coverage for a \\"beginner\\" is too sparse. It would not have killed them to add another 50 pages to the content and explain things more thoroughly. Although it is possible for people with zero knowledge of any of these elements (HTML, Perl, and CGI) to put something together using this book, I suspect that most of them will get things done more as a result of copying what they see than really understanding what they are doing. Therefore, I removed another star from the rating.Overall, I rate Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web at 2 stars out of 5. You can learn some Perl and CGI from this book. Unfortunately, the process is more difficult and confusing than it needs to be. Although this book has great potential, I believe it needs a major rewrite--perhaps even by a different author who has a better \\"teaching\\" ability to \\"Teach yourself Perl and CGI scripting the quick and easy way!\\" as the cover claims."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I like this format.

The purpose of this book is not to impress Perl Gurus, it is to explain what Perl is, the basics of how it works, and how to get started understanding, and eventaully writing your own code. This book has given me a huge head start in learning the language, there is a lot it does not explain, but I think that is a good thing, it is called 'Perl and CGI for the WWW' not 'everything about Perl for Gurus'. It says on the book 'beginner to intermediate' it says that for a reason! You can say the author talks about forms too much, but this book has the term 'CGI' in the title, what would CGI be without INTERFACE. This is the best money I have spent on learning the Perl Language as of yet. If you are new to Perl, and/or just want to add interactivity to your pages, or if you aleady use Perl in CGI and just want to understand how it works and learn to write your own code, this is the book, if you are a guru, looking for something to put down, find somethign else!"},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I thought that I'd never find a book that could teach a purely HTML literate person Perl, but now I've found one that could teach an 7-year old!

This book covers a lot of material and even though is misssing the HTML part of the codes, any web designer can figure it out by him/her self.She explains the code and what it does, and that is something most of the visual quickstart guides are missing.What I didnt like about this book is that it assumes that you are going to use a Unix or Linux OS when a lot of people are hosting under Windows NT or 2000 servers. The extra part at the end that talks about basic Unix commands and how to do simple stuff is very useful for the newbies who dont know what an IP is.I really recomend this book to anyone interested on learning Perl for the WWW."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"If you're seeking to learn how to write scripts, this isn't the book that will teach you. It is a guide only to basically understand Perl and CGI (what certain groups of characters mean, how it basically works). It is a beginner's book, but learn html before you buy it. Early in the book Castro uses terms (w/o any explanations) that only someone familiar with code might understand. The more you know html before reading this book, the better.Even after reading it, you still won't be able to write a script on your own. You should be able to use others' scripts though. Although there is no CGI/Perl reference/glossary in the book, it is well-organized and most of the language is simple and easy to understand for the average reader.

It is marketed as a 'first programming book, and is tailored at perl for the web---A great concept. &quot;For the essence of space&quot; she has left out details, writes Castro. Unfortunately, I am discovering that I am unable to make the leap of faith she assumes to produce results. I think the book has value for learning how to set-up scripts, but you had better look for a second book as a strong reference on the actual perl.If her book had full-blown examples of the concepts reduced for space in the book, I think the book would be more complete.I hope the 2nd revision made marketed improvements.

I'm now very comfortable with the language, and have moved on to more advanced projects (and, consequently, more advanced resources).

There they were brutally attacked by several different types of birds all trying to do one thing get some sort of revenge. During these attacks many people were killed because of the crazy stages these birds were going through. It leaves you hanging the whole time to try to figure out why the birds want to commit such hideous crimes. What could possibly cause them to do such horrible things?I thought the movie was well thought out but after reading the short story \\"The Birds\\" it makes you wander what similarities there were between the two, I can answer that question none.

She also didn't forget to incorporate very obvious ads about her other HTML title in almost every chapter.At last, I have to say she is very brave.

This slim volume is packed with punch because instead of having to plow through pages and pages of enigmatic codes, you can check the scripts you write in the chapters by comparing them to the downloaded material.

It's the essential missing material that should have been in the book, which the author promised to post on the companion web sites but never did (precedence table, ASCII chart, index, etc. etc. etc.).By the way, if the companion website at cookwood.com is an example of what people can learn from the HTML book--FORGET IT! Very boring, and the message board takes forever to come up on the screen.Don't count on anything from the author, she's busy counting royalties somewhere in Spain--she's posted to the web site ONE time in the last THREE months.There ARE a few useful tips in the book (mostly non-Perl items such as cookies, UNIX essentials, resources, etc.), so just buy the book (or skim it over a hot cup at Barnes and Noble), make a note of these items, and get a &quot;visual&quot; overview of Perl and CGI. Then return the book and buy &quot;Learning Perl&quot; by Randal Schwartz and Tom Christiansen."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"There is a reason why this book is number one at Amazon.com forCGI programming. Elizabeth does a superb job of making peopleunderstand the concepts and ins and outs of CGI programming. The nice thing is that everything is geared towards to the web, which is what I wanted. She starts out very simple, and slowly builds on what you learned previously, giving lots of example code, and showing you what the code does in the browser as well, including the coding in HTML to make the CGI work. Towards the end, she gives you helpful tips on how to debug your work, and gets into the neat things like writing information from a form to a text file and having another file read in the data, a small example of what you see everyday on the web.The nice thing about everything is that if you are creative enough, you can take her examples and expand them tremendously. Since using her book, I have been able to write a semi-database script for several websites I have made, all of which have grown in popularity way beyond my expectations. I owe it all to Elizabeth Castro's book for starting off on the right foot. This really is a great starting point to learning CGI and PERL and I suggest that if anyone is in that position, this is the first book you should buy."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I purchased this book solely on the name of the author, whose HTML book I found immensely helpful. This one was good, but not exactly what I needed. Some of the examples were hard to follow and they didn't all work on my server, even when I typed them (I thought) verbatim. Overall, it's not a bad book and it does do a decent job of teaching CGI scripting, but it wasn't complete enough for my needs; I had to buy another book before I felt comfortable with writing even basic scripts on my own."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"Helped me get started right away with perl programming once I set up a simple web server on my own PC.

This book will get you to the point where you can make your own &quot;guest book&quot; web page (ie., log their comments into a text file). Though this book does not guide you as where to go to extend your knowledge once you have finished this book, I think the next best book to read after this would be the &quot;Perl DBI&quot; book(say if you want to develop web&lt;-&gt;DB applications) and perhaps have some kind of &quot;perl command reference&quot; book handy as well.

(But the title of the book series makes this pretty obvious.) I'm an experienced programmer, and I've had some experience with Python, a language very similar to Perl in some ways, but nevertheless I found this book helpful, even if it is somewhat simplistic. It provides a good, if shallow, introduction to the possibilities of the Perl language and CGI. This book is enough to get your feet wet; it is not enough to make you a competent web application developer. But once you finish this book, you can move on to something more substantial. What I like about this book is the way the author continues to repeat certain basic concepts, so that a beginner won't get tangled up and lost. (Things like the \\"here\\" document and \\"default\\" variable, for example, can throw the beginner for a loop.) So overall, I think this book is a pretty good starting point for Perl and CGI.Absolute beginner programmers may still find this book too complex. There is a certain assumption of familiarity with basic programming concepts. But if you have even a small amount of experience with even a simple language like BASIC, you should be fine."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I ALWAYS buy the Peachpit Press books for everything I need to learn.

Even if you are one of those that did need to get another book to get you through the hand holding of learning to program for the first time with Perl, you will quickly find yourself wondering how to do things with Perl and this book will probably answer your questions so I think this book is indispensable for anyone that wants to learn Perl."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"A letter a wrote to Ms. Castro:I just wanted to say Thanks! for teaching me HTML and PERL in your great to-cool-for-words Visual Quickstart Guides!My first VQS Guide was HTML for the World Wide Web, the first printing.

Then I bought the JavaScript, UNIX, and Photoshop 5 VQS Guides, and when I saw PERL and CGI for the WWW, I had to have it, especially once I saw it was written by YOU! :)Next, I plan on buying RedHat Linux 6 and Illustrator 8 (the bookstore didn't have Linux 6 in, and when I had to choose between Photoshop 5, Illustrator 8 and PERL and CGI, well... the only real tough desision was Photoshop or Illustrator).And one last thing, if you know C/C++, and havn't planned on writting a VQS Guide... then you should! After I finish your PERL and CGI book, I'd like to learn C and C++, but there are not any VQS Guides on the subject.

If you still had enough hair to pass the first, second, or god forbid, the third chapter, you deserve a honarary medal. No one with a logical, straight-forward mentality could possibly deal with Castro's backward and nonsensical method of instruction.Castro's examples fail to function properly on the unix server, even if keyed verbatum, and the annoying use of &quot;refer to page #&quot; are enough to make anyone want to throw the text into the incinerator - which would be the proper location for such a piece of work.I somehow took the trip along the &quot;downward spiral&quot; venturing as far as chapter 4.... I have decided to do what comes naturally, and place this text book in the circular file (the trash).Chapter 3 makes an attempt to create a basic HTML form page. After this, we are misguided into the realm of HTTP_Referer's, HTTP_USER_AGENT's and other matters that never build on the primary question... How in the world does one obtain any results using the example form page?Anyone with a sense of direction can plainly see that examples used in one chapter, are never seen again, and do nothing more than sharpen your typing skills.I have several years of experience as a Software Engineer, and have programmed languages such as C, C++, Java, and VB.

The people who have reviewed this book and given it only a single star, have obviously never used a Perl Interpreter. They said that they couldn't get their scripts to run on Unix. Well, I don't think that is a script problem; it's a programmer problem. What would you do if you had to run a cgi script on a server that doesn't have an interpreter? You have to know your resources before you can use the code.Speaking of resources, this book provides a firm foundation for understaning Perl and CGI. My company site is a good example of taking this book for all it is worth. PerlShop, a popular, free-ware shopping cart script had lost it's ability to process credit cards or a check until only a couple a months ago; just shortly after I read this book. As a beginning programmer, I was able to have an effect on a system that many people use each day, and I must say; it felt good. The improvements I made, using Elizabeth's book as a guide, have improved a free-ware script, but the changes have also added substantive value to a version of this script that can be purchased. This is real value. It is also a &quot;real&quot;-world solution.

Like all Perl books, it answered a few questions that the reader was dying to know, such as: &quot;What is CGI?&quot;, and &quot;What is Perl?&quot;. The intro even says &quot;It is a beginner's guide to using Perl for one particular purpose- making Web pages interactive.&quot; That may sound good, however, I feel that she did an inadequate job in providing practical examples to make a page interactive.The book consists of chapters that define forms, Scalars, Arrays, and Subroutines. The examples are functional, but not practical. For instance, a form that takes information and produces a simple result. She goes into no detail how the script processes that information to get that result. She often gives a line of code and skips the definition of it. It would have been nice if she explained what the code was thinking and how it decides to process information. Show subtle variations of the symbols will produce an entirely different result. Also, I wanted to see how I could construct a working program with several subroutines that has a practical purpose. That to me is &quot;Interactive&quot;.In summary, she does not give practical examples, she does not give explain the inner workings of how a script thinks, she does not inspire the creativity of the reader.

It seems to me she wants to avoid explaining Perl too much and still be able to teach CGI. Thus, she go back and forth between CGI and little tutorial on Perl.

I have read a few negative comments about the book - these are not really true: 1) The font is too small! No, it's only small when the author don't want you to see the real text, but she want you to look at the layout of the page instead. The explaination, the codes ... are all font 12. 2) The design is bad, too many &quot;see page x&quot; or &quot;see page y for details&quot;? If you complain about this, i'm not sure you know how to read a book. When you see &quot;see page...&quot;, that means you need to turn the page only if you really want to see the details.

At the time, I had done some BASIC and VB programming, but knew nothing about Perl and CGI except that it was one of the most common ways to add some interactivity and form handling to a web site.Admittedly, the coverage of the subject is a little light, and the hold-the-novice-user-by-the-hand- style was actually confusing (she should have used the more standard method of using bold, italics, and monospace fonts to indicate output, user required input, and variables) BUT considering I was at the absolute beginner level with respect to Perl and CGI, I feel the book lived up to my expectations. I wanted something to get me started quickly, and not to assume I knew anything about CGI and PERL but did assume that I knew HTML. I did not want a book that would cover the subject matter exhaustively, just give me a basic &quot;Quick-Start&quot; which it did quite well.I continued to use the book as a reference for a few months, though it's really not laid out well for that purpose. (I would suggest the O'Reilly Perl CD Bookshelf for that) If you know PERL and CGI basics, this one is not for you, but if you're comfortable with HTML and want to start doing more, It's worth a try."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I taught myself CGI programming with the first edition of this book a couple of years ago, and have spent most of the ensuing time as a professional web programmer. This alone is testament to the effectiveness of Castro's teaching/writing ability.The second edition does add much that was missing from the first edition, such as the &quot;use strict&quot; pragma that forces programmers to declare variables, and the CGI.pm library that, for one, circumvents the tedium of parsing form data. Arguably the most important edition, however, is the discussion of setting up a local test environment, but it is also in this area that the book falls short.In particular I find it bothersome that the author does not recommend installing Apache as a test environment. After all, Apache is the environment under which most CGI scripts will eventually run on virtual web hosts running the Linux/Unix operating system.So by testing with Apache for Windows, you will be emulating the actual production environment of the script much more closely than by using the other web servers that are recommended. In fact, there are a number of (free) products on the market that bundle Apache and Perl together, so that you don't have to go through the extra step of downloading and installing Perl seperately from the web server software, as in the book's examples.Another sin of omission is that no consideration is given to the persistent storage of data, other than cumbersome text files. However, this has been one of the areas in which the greatest strides have been made since the first edition. Retrieval and storage of data from web applications, using some sort of database, are practically a given today.Perhaps the author thought that a discussion of the Perl DBI (Database Interface) would be too much of a digression, and would involve setting up additional database software. However, a few of the same bundles I mentioned above not only include Apache and Perl, but also the mySQL database engine.At the very least I think there should have been discussion of the very simple &quot;DBM&quot; database system available on almost all Unix systems. Perl makes it very easy to store hash arrays to disk in this format, and just as easy to import them into hashes. This would at least provide readers with a stepping stone to eventually investigating the more robust DBI library.So I rate the content a 5, but I take off one point for what the book lacks."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I just completed a class on writing CGI scripts with Perl, and although this was not part of the reading list for the class, nevertheless it's what I used to actually learn what I needed to know. This is NOT a book about learning Perl. It is about writing CGI scripts using Perl. You'll get a decent introduction to Perl syntax and Castro will move you right into applying it to writing CGI scripts, primarily for handling forms. I'm not aware of any other book that gives you exactly what you need (if this is what you're looking for) in such a nice, compact introduction. The &quot;visual&quot; part of the book (the pictures the previous reviewer is lamenting the absence of), is really just simple &quot;screenshot&quot;-like figures showing what Netscape or Explorer would look like given the particular exercise being explained.

I looked at several other texts that were larger but seemed to contain a lot more fluff instead of actually useful information. This book was excellent for learning Perl and CGI starting from complete ground zero.Within hours I was creating and testing scripts and actually wrote one to do what I needed done. I also downloaded another script that would not work and was able to troubleshoot and fix it to do what I needed. An excellent book that walks you through the steps one item at a time it was easy to understand and work through.One of the things that this book contained that I did not see in other books was instructions on how to download, install and setup a personal server so that you can test the scripts you write as you learn. This information alone makes this book superior to most others. There is no better learning environment than being able to actually write and test the scripts.Some HTML knowledge is assumed, however it is very little. Picking up a basic HTML book allows you to quickly come up to speed with the knowledge assumed. On the other hand, the required HTML knowledge is easily obtained from various sites on the Internet.I could not recommend this book highly enough for anyone who needs to learn Perl and CGI basics and needs to get up to speed as soon as possible."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I have read several other books in an attempt to learn Perl, but they were either too technical or too boring to even hold my interest. This book is the polar opposite. It is the first Perl manual I've read that actually explains Perl line by line, in a language that even an old dog novice like myself can understand. Instead of filling the pages with line after line of obscure Perl code without the slightest hint of explanation, the code here is explained beautifully. My questions were answered almost before they came to mind. That is why this book was so effective.I was writing simple cgi's even before finishing the book. This afternoon, I wrote a cgi that takes input from a lengthy form, prints a confirmation/thank you html page to let the user know that their input was received, sends the parsed and formatted form data via email to the receiving party, and generates an include file that automatically updates an online html log that everyone in the company can see and track. Two weeks ago I couldn't have possibly done this. Honestly, I wouldn't even have known where to start.No, this is not a complete Perl training manual, nor is it meant to be. But if you need to use Perl/CGI on the web to process forms and information, there is no better book on the market. I use it everyday and highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This is a very basic CGI book-- perhaps a little too basic.I really like the format of the Visual Quickstart books. The books are easy to follow, and it's simple to open to book to any section, read the page and close the book. Unlike other Perl books, there are no long, drawn out diatribes.Here's the big problem with this book-- The author only covers a single part of Perl's CGI capabilities-- she covers the param() function, but little else.It would be enormously helpful if the book covered other basic perl topics --- the header() function to create the HTML header, the print_head(\\"This is the title\\") function to start the HTML page, the p(\\"Hello World!\\") function to print a paragraph, etc.It's fine that the book doesn't cover object-oriented programming, but it's silly that the book doesn't cover other basic HTML functions.Some other minor downsides:- The book uses many CGI examples which need a HTML form and a CGI script. The book doesn't contain the text for the HTML forms, and it's hard to follow the examples if you don't have the HTML in front of you.- The book is dated, and discusses out-of-date HTML. Most sites have been running XHTML (or something close) for several years, but this book uses bad HTML4.0 examples.- If the examples would be much easier to read if the author used proper indenting for the Perl code."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"Many educational books lead you along a plodding path, and if you skip ahead, you find yourself lost in the woods.My motivation to learn anything is that I already have a practical application in mind and I want to gain enough knowledge to write it. If I don't have more applications on the back burner, I may well forget half of what I learned once the application is written, but I accept that about myself.The organization of this book was such that it was easy to jump back and forth through the chapters, getting a handle on the bits I needed to write my script.When I paused a few months, forgot a lot, then had another bright idea for a script, it was easy to dive right back in, using this book to refresh my knowledge and expand it a bit.On the other hand, if you're coming in as a stark beginner, you can go through it chapter by chapter while you build up the confidence to start bouncing around.It is mainly a survey of different concepts, without going too deeply into any. That's why it's called a &quot;quickstart&quot; guide. It's supposed to help you get out of the gate quickly and it does so excellently.You may find that once you go beyond simple scripting, you'll need a more advanced book to help you dig down into the guts of Perl, but once you get to that point, you'll find that the [ahhhem] dollars you spent on this book were a heck of an investment, because you'll be able to plow into those more advanced tomes and not feel lost."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book is clearly geared towards the non-programmer or beginning programmer.

If you like step-by-step explanations of what to do, this is the book for you.If you're a programmer, I'd recommend one of the O'Reilly Perl books, an HTML book, and the &quot;perldoc CGI&quot; documentation that comes free with perl. You might want to borrow this book, as I did, to pick up some tips on forms and cookies.If you don't know much about programming, you'll want to investigate books on Java Servlets and JSP as well. Perl and Java are two very different programming languages, and most people will strongly prefer one language over the other.One especially weak section of the book is the chapter on debugging. The author explains how to check the syntax of a Perl script without running it, but doesn't explain that you can actually run a Perl CGI script from the command line. She also makes the horrendous mistake of not recommending &quot;use strict&quot; and the &quot;-w&quot; switch! There's also no mention of how to use the perl debugger, or the GUI debugger from ActiveState. I can't imagine trying to debug my Perl CGI programs using her rudimentary techniques."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I have purchased numerous books on CGI and Perl and most of them were scholarly and complete, but none did what this book did, and that is actually get my problems solved. The term &quot;Quickstart&quot; is acurate, the book dove right in to building forms and processing them with Perl and I have made more progress with this one book than I have with the other 3 combined. I would buy any book written by this author."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I have read several &quot;Visual Quickstart Guides&quot; and this is one of the best. It is extremely accessible to beginning programmers and useful for the novice. Elizabeth Casto put a great deal of time and effort into making sure that her instructions were detailed and consistent. If you have little experience with programming and want to jump into CGI Scripts and PERL this book is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I found both the layout and the text of this book difficult to learn from. With its small visual chunks, my eyes had to jump around the page excessively in order to take in the information presented. The font size and colors didn't help readability.Also, it seemed like important points were glossed over while trivial details were belabored. For example, I couldn't find explanations of some of the perl syntax used in examples, yet anchor tags were explained step by step, where the first step was to 'type an opening angle bracket &lt;', then 'type a href= ' ...and so on. This just seemed absurd to me, but I guess some readers aren't bothered by the uneven levels of coverage.I have since switched to &quot;Learning Perl&quot; by Randal Schwartz and &quot;CGI 101&quot; by Jacqueline Hamilton, and am much happier with these books."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I'm a teacher at a community college. One of my classes is &quot;Introduction to Perl Programming.&quot; I have read many, many books on Perl for both beginners and advanced programmers.This book is definitely geared toward the beginner. The author says that the book is suitable for someone who has never even programmed before. It starts from the beginning, explaining how to type your program into a text editor, how to save it, how to run your program, etc., all in excruciating detail. As the book progresses, it takes on a &quot;problem-solving, how-to&quot; approach. Every page contains a problem (for example, &quot;splitting a value into pieces&quot; or &quot;modifying all the members of an array&quot;) and an exact solution to that problem, also spelled out in excruciating, step-by-step detail.It is this elaborate detail that I believe detracts from the value of the book to the beginner. It gives the reader rote, cookie-cutter solutions to small problems. I feel this is a disservice to the beginning programmer because it is more important to know _why_ you are doing something than it is to know _how_. What good is knowing how to split a value into pieces if you don't know why you'd need to do it? More importantly, if the beginning programmer doesn't know what problem he's trying to solve, how can he look up the answer?This book claims to be for someone who has never programmed, and yet does nothing to teach the reader about programming. Rather, it focuses on the syntax of Perl which, as an experienced programmer will tell you, is not the hard part of learning to program.If you are a beginning programmer looking for guidance on your first language, this is not it. If you are an intermediate or advanced programmer, this book is way, way above your level."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I purchased this book a few days ago. Since then I have finished the book and I can effectively grasp the concept of Perl programming. I would have been really satisfied if the author spent more time explaining some more Unix basics. She spent most of her time assuming that you used an ISP Web Provider that gives you UNIX shell access and allows Perl/CGI scripts.All I want is to install a quick Linux workstation onto my LAN at home and create a sort of personal Intranet so I can practice Perl scripts without needing an ISP yet. I'd really appreciate it if someone knew of something SIMPLE (like this book) but explained in detail how to set up UNIX (preferably Linux--it's free) on a workstation and how to install Perl. There were a few errors in this book, but nothing that I can really say is worth crying over. I started reading this book saying to myself that I won't understand any of it and I'm happy to report that I understood it rather well. The visual pictures of the HTML and Perl scripts helped a lot.My recommendation: If you want to know how to use CGI scripts with Perl but have no idea where to start, then I suggest buying this book. Where to go after that, however, is still a mystery..."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"I bought this book as a reference to learn how to start programming in Perl & CGI - but have just found this book ill written and simply hard to follow.

This book leaves no guesswork for the reader and provides everything you need to know in using CGI today! The best part of Elizabeth's books is that she provides a website for Q&A, updates, and revisions as supplemental material. She is truely one of the few authors who takes care and effort in trying to maximize a reader's understanding of the material. Yes this is a newbie book, nothing is glossed over or left to the imagination. I'm actually a fan of the 1st edition of this book and would recommend it instead. However, the 2nd edition is the result of suggestions and input from readers of the 1st edition as well as providing information on how to set up a desktop web-server to test your scripts. If your test platform is Linux then everything you'll need comes standard. If it's Windows then you'll have some choices to make and install (don't worry it's all free).

The language is simple and as you read on you begin to think if if Perl is really this simple (well ... not quite so simple) .You get almost all the basic cgi stuff (HTML output, I/O, handling permissions, etc.) you can do without needing any prior knowledge of the language or even programming (id you know C it will help you a lot).This is simply the best book for beginners but probably too simple for intermediate and advanced programmers.Ruben Badar&oacute;"},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This Book is an excellent start for the reader that has little to no background in programming in general and wants to make things happen in a short period of time.I went into this book very skeptical and came out very pleasantly surprised. One key factor in reading this book is that it is very visual. Reading the column of formatted text is sufficient to learn, but reading the descriptions of illustrations hold real information gems.

I thought I already wrote a review but it evidently wasn't posted, and that's good because I'm up-grading it. At first I had reservations, because it's a little uneven, particularly in a few later chapters. I had a lot of problems with file handling particularly, which seems written backwards in priorities. I got into server path problems, partly because of that. But, I find that it was quite good enough to get me started selecting and using on-line scripts, and tailoring them for my needs, which was my objective in buying the book. Also, I find myself using it more and more as I go along, cookies and all. In a bit, I'll need a more thorough text, but the on-line documentation seems more than adequate for that.

Her HTML 4 book was done in the same format and was also very good. One hint to the disappointed reader who thought that there were too many pictures -- this is intended for visual learners, hence the name &quot;Visual Quickstart Guide.&quot; A picture is worth a thousand words.Elizabeth deserves credit for being unafraid to get technical where it's necessary, at the same time getting right to the point. This book isn't supposed to show you how to use Perl for ivory tower programming projects -- it's just a useful guide to providing basic interactive links between your web pages and information on the server. On that level, it succeeds beautifully."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This is a terrific book, and I would recomend it to anyone that wants to learn about Perl and CGI programming.

This book has given me a strong grasp Perl &amp; CGI. If you want strong grasp of what perl is and what it can do, read this book BEFORE reading Learning Perl from O'reilly.

Great. Quit your job, stay home for a year learning it all, and get up a few thousand bucks for some intensive language courses. Or, grab this book and in a couple of days you'll be able to generate some decent scripts that can handle common tasks.Yes, there are some errors (try writing an Internet book that has none!). If you really wanna be a guru with a language whose design is as dumb and convoluted as PERL's, you'll need half a dozen other manuals just to get started. PERL was designed by a group of engineers to ensure their own job security -- the language is totally unlearnable, even for experienced programmers. At least this book can quickly help you out of some serious CGI-related jams. On that basis, it gets at least 4 stars."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book goes beyond simplistic. Perhaps for most who buy this book, that's fine. For me, it was extremely disappointing once I started reading it.I have a habit of reading every word on every page of my books. I read highly technical books. This book is the negation of them, and in fact doesn't even begin working with code until page 83 (chapter 7) of a 314-pages-of-content book. Once it does, it's rather idiot-like: \\"Create a password box this way.\\" Chapter 10 starts on variables. Chapter 11 is about looping constructs. Half-way through the book we finally get to subroutines.The earlier chapters really are fluff. If I wanted to know how to set up my own web server, I'd find one first and read documentation. After all, the best way to learn about the software you use is to RTFM, where \\"F\\" obviously stands for \\"friendly.\\" If the manual isn't sufficient, I can look elsewhere or get a web server that I can understand because it is either more intuitive or has better documentation. I should not see three chapters on configuring web servers for Windows, Mac, and UNIX and its derivatives. Nor should I see chapters on how to use FTP, for example.Once I got through the fluff, the examples were incredulous: \\"1) Type &lt;this>. 2) Type &lt;that>. 3) Type &lt;that other thing>.\\" Please, I know how to type. Tell me how things work. I was really expecting some meaningful, thorough, well-coded and well-styled code. If you are teaching beginners, teach good coding style. It's not here, not in this book.To the beginners, or the ones who've bought this book and it's the right book for them: Good, I'm glad you got something useful out of it. For me, this book was misleading from the cover page and I wouldn't have bought it if I had known what I know now. Take it as a given that this book barely scratches at the depth of computer programming, and doesn't touch the art of computer science at all. If you use this book as a first jumping point to real coding, real design, or something real, again, great. If you are using this book and you will never program again, wonderful. If you are looking to score big on a career in web design or Perl expertise or CGI, or you are anything above beginner steps, you will need much more than what this book has to offer.I think you should skip it anyway. Understanding why we do what we do is more important than understanding how to do it. Once it's time to do what we want to do, do it right. Do it as well as it can be done. This book doesn't do that."},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"This book looked brand new inside.I was really pleased.I got it very fast also.

The actors who played the characters (Rod Taylor as Mitch Brenner, Tippi Hendren as Melanie Daniels and Jessica Tandy as Lydia Brenner and many more) did a fine job of acting for their time, however if the movie were based in today's time they would probably not have been as well recognized for this particular movie.The setting is in Bodega Bay and San Francisco which are located in California. There they were brutally attacked by several different types of birds all trying to do one thing get some sort of revenge. During these attacks many people were killed because of the crazy stages these birds were going through. It leaves you hanging the whole time to try to figure out why the birds want to commit such hideous crimes. What could possibly cause them to do such horrible things?I thought the movie was well thought out but after reading the short story \\"The Birds\\" it makes you wander what similarities there were between the two, I can answer that question none. If the movie had been more like the book it would not have been as exciting.

So I got the visual quickstart guide and teach yourself perl in 21 days and I am reading them both together. I think these two books are the place to start since they give you bite sized pieces of code that are thoroughly explained. Now after reading 150 pages from both of those books I am modifying scripts to do what I need. I can see why the quickstart guide is the #1 seller at amazon.com. Not to say that cgi 101 or teach yourself cgi with perl 5 are bad though, I am going to read those books and the cgi cookbook because I dont think you are going to learn perl as a beginner by just reading one book.

Well, about two weeks ago I found the O'reilly book on Perl at the store and bought it. (wait for it...) Earlier this week I was trying to do something simple in Perl... understand I mean simple for someone who KNOWs Perl... but a real pain for me who just knows languages in general... and none of them real great. So anyway... I'm searching through my $50 O'reilly book... beating my head out trying to find the answer for getting info from an array or hash using variables for the cell locations (I know they're not called that, but can't remember what they ARE called). Nothing... I look and look... and not a thing in the book is making sense. Enter... this book. In desperation I pull it back out (not out of hiding just out of secondary status) and BAM! there's the answer. Plain and simple English (well Ok, Perl not English but still...)

I read it practically cover to cover, and was writing CGI programs immediately. If you have less experience than me, it might be a bit harder, but still very accessible. With more experience, but not with Perl/CGI, this book will be an excellent starter. The only way I don't see it being very useful is if you're already an experienced Perl/CGI programmer. It's biggest downfall is that the coding examples aren't really all that practical. You will definitely need a more advanced book to start writing robust CGI applications, but at ANY price, not just this book's comparatively low price, this book is definitely worth the money if you want to get a good basic grasp of this topic"},{"Title":"Perl and CGI for the World Wide Web (Visual QuickStart Guide)","review":"(I have the spanish version of this book.)

Since he is a professional violinist and critic with tremendous experience, many of his viewpoints are insightful and edifying. For instance, he convinced me that Paganini, as well as all the legendary violinists of the 19th century, probably didn't play as well as we imagined. A violin student can learn a lot from reading this book, e.g. he can try to emulate and assimilate all the merits of each great violinist.Yet, because the thrust of this book is his evaluation of the violinists' playing, he cannot avoid being subjective. For example, his ears are hypnotized by the tone and vibrato of Heifetz and Kreisler. He thinks that one should use vibrato for every note in a lyrical passage, and he believes that a white vibrato-less note has absolutely no expressive power. Therefore, he criticizes many violinists, including Oistrakh, for using vibrato in an &quot;on-and-off&quot; manner.After reading this book, I had the IMPRESSION that Mr. Roth's list of the greatest violinists ever PROBABLY goes something like this:=1. Heifetz =1. Kreisler 3. Oistrakh 4. Szeryng 5. Perlman 6. KoganHe also greatly admires Szigeti, Grumiaux, as well as Menuhin and Elman (in their youth).Among today's younger generation of violinists, he probably thinks Joshua Bell, Gil Shaham, Maxim Vengerov, Sarah Chang, and Leila Josefowicz are the most promising.I wrote the above assumption to give you an idea of Mr. Roth's taste. But even if you disagree with him, this book is still worth reading. It provides much valuable information you'll not find elsewhere, including opinions expressed by the greats themselves and a vast survey of the violinists' discography. Though Roth's comments are inevitably subjective, his professional observations can be taken as a reference, especially when you've got to understand his tastes. Of course, if you dislike Heifetz, you can pretty much ignore most of his adulations."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"It is, of course, admirable that Roth takes great effort to write articles of so many violinists. It can be used as a reference to dates and such information. But still, the book could have been more rightly named &quot;WHAT ROTH THINKS ABOUT VIOLINIST from Paganini to the 21st century&quot;. As Mr Perng writes in the above customer review, Roth seriously does have biases. If you agree with Roth, good. If you disagree, that's when the trouble starts.For instance, also as Mr Perng has pointed out, Roth worships Heifetz. Being strong admirer of Milstein (I cannot say I hate Heifetz though), I must say this. Roth writes to say why Heifetz was more famous (or played better,as Roth strongly suggested) that Milstein. But those points were exactly those which made Milstein renowned for! They are Milstein's straightforward musical approach, aristocratic tone, &quot;more people seem to want to play like Heifetz than Milstein&quot;, and most of all, Milstein's refusal to play music that was popular (or that &quot;sell&quot;) which happened to be what he didn't like. How many artistes will stand up for such a belief these days? These reasons were those that made people like me, and especially the Viennese (who by the way, hate Heifetz)admire him! With such comments, Roth can frustrate the reader.But with superb pictures and select discography (careful of his comments - use them only as a guide), I found it still all right to buy the book."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"Roth's book is an incredible survey of many of the greatest violinists, including some who are becoming forgotten by my generation.It is true that his opinions are sprinkled throughout, including his irritating comments about on-off vibrato.In case readers haven't noticed, it's a crime that he has lumped all women violinists together into a short section and essentially belittled their contributions. Kyung-Wha Chung and Anne-Sophie Mutter both offer more than, say, Pinchas Zukerman will ever amount to.To his great credit, he helps to introduce some wonderful insights into the playing of Henryk Szereng, Leonid Kogan, and Arthur Grumiaux (along with several others). This book is a must for every violin lover in an effort to remember and preserve the memories of these great musicians. Roth also is relaying a message to the next generation of violinists: help preserve the art of violin performance, but remember that musicianship and honest communication are of the utmost importance."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"Having read more than a few books on violinists, I can honestly say that this book is in a class by itself. It is far more insightful and analytical than any other book of its genre. While it is indeed colored by the subject evaluations (some of which I disagree with) it is a provocative work that that depicts many of the subtle details that most other commentators do not illuminate(ex:impulse vibrato)As for the reviewer who disputed the author's claims-I agree that Michael Rabin's recording of the Paginini 24 caprices has been surpassed by others, notably the early recording by Ossy Renardy, and more recently by Shlomo Mintz(yes, it's even BETTER than Midori's!) As for the Dvorak concerto, Midori's may be better than the well known recording made by Milstein in the 1960's, when he was still great-but past his prime. Listen to his first recording(unfortunately in mono) to hear the greatest performance of this work you will ever hear. And as for Gil Shaham- he is truly a great violinist, but not quite a great musician. Perlman is both, although Shaham may have a slight edge in technique. Moreover, Perlman's superiority is predicated on his charisma, which surpasses Shaham and just about all other violinists around. While Perlman is somewhat overrated and isn't my favorite player, it is safe to say that Shaham will never achieve the popularity and renown of Perlman, or possess the same degree of individuality. I admire Shaham, but he will never be the best player on the planet."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"No other person might be more suited to write this book than Mr. Roth, professional violinist, pedagogue and music critic, who has attended innumerable concerts featuring from Kreisler and the 12-year-old Menuhin to young modern violinists such as Josefowicz, including many relatively obscure Soviet violinists. He has also been acquainted with many great violinists, thus providing more invaluable information. And from reading his book, one may conjecture that the author owns thousands of violin CDs--but missed several superlative discs, which will be mentioned later.One must credit Mr. Roth for his encyclopedic survey of the violin playing of hundreds of violinists, in which he assesses their merits, demerits and style, major recordings, as well as their backgrounds and lives. He apparently puts great emphasis on slides, position changes, and vibrato, which he analyzes and depicts microscopically. Printed examples of Ysaye's unique bowings and fingerings--he had studied under an Ysaye pupil--and Kreisler's expressive devices are especially priceless. And one can be sure that he is not a worshipper of Toscanini, for he stresses individuality.Yet one must be reminded that despite his massive experience, these writings are still 100% subjective opinions, not facts. It is palpable that he is a fanatical partisan of Kreisler and Heifetz, but perhaps only one violinist was portrayed utterly flawless--Josef Gingold, the author's friend who wrote the foreword (&quot;There can be no higher goal to which a young violinist can aspire than to pattern his or her life and career in the image of Josef Gingold&quot; (226)[.]). And apart from many contentious issues, he had, for all his erudition, made some glaring mistakes.Example 1: He apparently doesn't know an iota about Baroque bows: &quot;[Szeryng's] organ-like triple-stops and chordal playing sound almost as if he were performing with a Baroque bow.&quot; (183) Szeryng's stupendous ability to play chords simultaneously and gorgeously would have been useless were he holding a Baroque bow, which can only play two strings at a time. Mr. Roth need only listen to Sigiswald Kuijken's recording of Bach with Baroque instruments (Deutsche Harmonia Mundi) to instantly realize his error.Example 2: He states that Stern has never recorded the complete Beethoven sonata cycle (193). This is clearly wrong. Stern had recorded them in the late 60s and early 80s, and the complete cycle was released by Sony in 1996 (the book was published in 1997).A few of his many highly controversial (or ignorant) remarks:Rabin's Paganini caprices: &quot;impeccable . . . collectively are fully equal to, or even possibly surpass any recorded before or since&quot; (277)[.] Milstein's Dvorak concerto: &quot;a perennial favourite among professional violinists&quot; (135)[.]Perlman's Korngold concerto: &quot;I do not know of any living violinist who can perform this work as effectively as heard on this CD.&quot; (225)Perlman's Wieniawski concerto No.1: &quot;bristles with awesome finger and bow command; only Rabin's is comparable.&quot; (225)To me, it is inconceivable that anyone, after meticulously comparing Midori's recording of the Paganini caprices (released in 1989) with that of Rabin, would not say Midori's is much superior technically, tonally, and artistically. The same can be said of Midori's Dvorak concerto (1989), compared with Milstein's, as well as Shaham's Korngold (1994) and Wieniawski (1991) concertos, compared with those of Perlman.I was even more outraged when I read the following:it can be said without fear of contradiction that Heifetz had far fewer off-nights than any other violinist. Because his basic standards were so high, even below par he was closer to perfection than any of his colleagues in live unedited performance. (108)andthese pieces [Brahms's Hungarian Dance No.5, Dvorak's Humoresque, Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, Gershwin's Bess, You Is My Woman Now, Schubert's Ave Maria, etc.] essentially belong to Heifetz and are best passed over by other violinists. (193)The proofreading of this book gave ample evidence that it was the first edition. For instance, toward the end of the ninth paragraph on p.147, some words were obviously missing. One can pinpoint other annoying occasions wherein brackets were dropped, word sequences reversed, and ridiculous things such as &quot;etc..&quot; appeared.The above criticism notwithstanding, this book, with over 330 pages of text and photos, written by an extraordinary man--whose English writing (or boasting)skill is no less impressive than his violinistic experience--is still a precious reference for violinists and violin lovers."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"This book is essential to anyone who seriously listens to contemporary and historical classical violin recordings. Essential not because it is complete (far from it) or because it presents incontrovertible information, but because there is nothing as up-to-date and comprehensive that provides both essential biographical and historical information about so many important violinists and critical evaluative surveys of their performance and recorded legacies.Obviously, the book has its biases, both as to the comparative importance and historical standing of the great and near-great violinists and as to the performing styles on which such judgments are based. Roth clearly considers Heifetz head and shoulders above any violinist since Ysae; quite a few aficionados prefer other modern performers to Heifetz because of his fast tempi and perceived emphasis on technique over emotional expression. But biases are in the nature of such criticism. After all, what is this book, if not musical criticism?The book's strengths, beyond the obvious factual information, lie in three areas.First, in Roth the critic's in-person observations from attending concerts and recitals of the performers, either from well-preserved notes taken over much of a lifetime or from a remarkable memory (I don't recall Roth saying which basis the criticisms rely on).Second Roth's evaluations (subjective, obviously) of many of the recorded performances of the violinists he covers are invaluable, if not always indisputable. Exhaustive research would be needed to pull together critical evaluations of as many recordings as Roth comments upon.Third, it brings to mind many performers who have by now either been more or less been forgotten or are almost unknown in the west because their careers were behind the Iron Curtain and who thus get overlooked in the discussion of violin performance at a high level. (If Benno Rabinof and Julia Krasko were on your radar screen before reading this, you deserve a medal for achievement in violin performance history trivia!) More importantly, he occasionally touches on a truly master fiddler and musician, such as Bronisl'aw Gimpel, who never achieved the recognition he deserved, but gets it from Roth. (If you doubt this, seek out the CD that contains Gimpel's performances of the Bruch, Dvor'ak and Goldmark violin concerti and see if you don't think he belongs among the greats.) Without Roth, it would never have occurred to me to hunt for evidence of Gimpel's worthiness.The book's weaknesses are not trivial. Some slights are inexplicable. Two of the great violinists of the Twentieth Century, the Frenchman, Christian Ferras, and the Israeli, Ivry Gitlis, get a mere single mention in passing. It is hard for me to imagine any list of the greats from that era that excludes Ferras, and a good argument can be made for Gitlis. Similarly, though he evaluates at some length a number of worthy major orchestra concertmasters who also had significant careers as soloists and recitalists (Tossy Spivakovsky is an excellent example), he does not even mention two - Gerhard Taschner of the Berlin Philharmonic during most of WW II and Wolfgang Schneiderhan, leader of the Vienna Philharmonic for 14 years and the Vienna Symphony Orchestra before that - who left some wonderful recorded evidence of their high merit as soloists. (He does mention, unfavorably, Schneiderhan's cadenza to the Beethoven concerto, but not the man as a performer).Perhaps there are valid reasons for some of this. Possibly, Roth never heard Ferras, Gitlis, Taschner or Schneiderhan in person, thus could not afford them the same treatment he gave his primary and secondary subjects. Perhaps he simply ran out of time or space to cover every deserving violinist. Perhaps his method of limitation was to focus primarily on American and Soviet performers. But the omission of Ferras as a primary subject is hard to fathom. The knowledgeable reader may find these shortcomings frustrating. I certainly did. The same shortcoming extends to contemporary performers. For instance, the fine German violinist, Isabelle Faust, was far enough along in her young career by the time this book was finalized to have merited at least as much mention as the many Asian and Asian-American prodigies that Roth mentions as watch-worthy.Other criticisms could be made. The point about female violinists made by two of the previous reviewers is a serious one. On that subject, Erica Morini and possibly Gioconda deVito deserved inclusion with the twenty chose for primary biographies. And one can differ from Roth on many points. For instance, Guila Bustabo, the American woman violinist, was far more than a temperamental artist. She left ample recorded evidence of genius.Shortcomings aside, however, nothing else approaches the Roth volume. It leaves Margaret Campbell's volume \\"The Great Violinists\\" in the dust with its approach to evaluating violin performers. Any violin aficionado who acquires this book will keep it next to his or her collection of fiddle recordings and refer to it often - I guarantee it."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"Violin personalities come to life -- with variousstyles individually discussed, and alsocompared/contrasted.As if the greats all performed last night, andHenry Roth writes a review for today's newspaper.A book of wonderful &quot;short stories&quot; than can beread in a series of short sessions."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"Violin personalities come to life -- with variousstyles individually discussed, and alsocompared/contrasted.As if the greats all performed last night, andHenry Roth writes a review for today's newspaper.A book of wonderful &quot;short stories&quot; than can beread in a series of short sessions."},{"Title":"Violin Virtuosos: From Paganini to the 21st Century","review":"The longer I own this book, the more angry it makes me.

All Tyndale OT commentaries are listed as \\"2008\\" for some reason (possibly reflecting the most recent printing with new cover styles?).I read this commentary in its entirety about 20 years ago, and over the years have used it as a reference. It is a fine, helpful, though short (by today's standards) commentary from a conservative perspective.The reason I write this review, however, is to provide an alternative perspective to the January 5, 2005 review of this commentary above that states:\\"Though this volume is in the Tyndale series, don't mistake it for a conservative commentary. It has all the signs of liberal conclusions drawn by rationalist scholarship.\\"This is a most unfortunate assessment, and it is not accurate. Cole's commentary is quite consistent with the rest of the Tyndale series. He accepts the historicity of the events of the Book of Exodus, and pretty much only conservative scholars do that. The Jan 2005 reviewer must not be aware that conservative scholars recognize that dating the Exodus (either about 1440 BC or about 1250 BC) is a very tricky and uncertain endeavor. Conservative scholars are divided on this issue, and few would state their case with any certainty. I suspect this reviewer takes issue with the fact that 1 Kings 6:1 refers to the time from the Exodus to the building of the temple as 480 years. But even conservatives recognize that this could be either a precise date or a rounded figure representing 12 generations. The Bible uses rounding, just like other literature - that's how language often works. We must be careful not to decide ahead of time what kind of language conventions the Bible can or cannot use. Such an ahead-of-time restriction on the Bible would itself be rationalistic. One of the stalwart defenders of the reliability of the OT, R. K. Harrison, argues for the 1250ish date of the Exodus. By contrast, Gleason Archer argues for a 1445 date, but takes the other date seriously and builds his argument on data and evidence and not on considering those holding the other view as \\"rationalistic.\\"It is also most unfortunate that the Jan 2005 reviewer misrepresented Cole in order to support his belief that Cole's commentary is not \\"conservative.\\" He says: \\"Furthermore, he [Cole] thinks that the \\"sea of reeds\\" the children of Israel crossed was dried overnight by an east wind, thus being only a few inches deep (see pp. 121-122). Of course, he fails to mention how the Egyptians could have drowned in a few inches of water.\\"The problem with this is: 1) the Bible, not Cole, claims that the Sea of Reeds dried overnight via a strong East wind (Exodus 14:21). This reviewer is taking issue with the Bible, not with Cole; 2) When he says \\"thus being only a few inches deep,\\" he's not quoting the Bible nor Cole. I have no idea where the reviewer got this \\"a few inches deep\\" part. He certainly did not get it from Cole's commentary, but he presents it as if Cole said or implied this, which he did not. The reviewer concludes this with, \\"Of course, he [Cole] fails to to mention how the Egyptians could have drowned in a few inches of water.\\" Of course Cole fails to mention it because the reviewer made that part up! How could Cole possibly respond to that?I don't mean to disrespect this reviewer as I'm sure he is concerned with commentators who misrepresent the Scriptures. However, in his zeal, he completely misrepresented this commentary. Like it or not, Cole's commentary on Exodus is quite conservative and accepts the historical reality of the events portrayed in Exodus.I just felt that I could not allow this misrepresentation of this fine commentary to affect potential buyers or readers."},{"Title":"Exodus (The Tyndale Old Testament Commentary Series)","review":"Though this volume is in the Tyndale series, don't mistake it for a conservative commentary. It has all the signs of liberal conclusions drawn by rationalist scholarship. Though Cole admits the numbers in the Bible lead to 1446 as the date of the Exodus, he rejects this date and opts for the reign of Raamses II (1290-1224) (see p. 42). Furthermore, he thinks that the \\"sea of reeds\\" the children of Israel crossed was dried overnight by an east wind, thus being only a few inches deep (see pp. 121-122). Of course, he fails to mention how the Egyptians could have drowned in a few inches of water.In the above-mentioned instances, the commentary is more an exposition of Cole's preconcieved notions than of the text of Scripture. Perhaps other parts are better, but the commentary's primary value lies in its presentation of alternate views, and thus it provides discernment practice."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book was one of my favorite reads in my high school English Class. Blanche Dubois is one of my favorite characters in literature. DESPERATION. The theme of this book is definately desperation. Stella and Stanley live in a low-grade apartment that emminates heat, sweat, and an almost claustophobic effect. The tension between the two is evident from the beginning. Stanley feels Stella is rich. He accuses her of leaving home and &quot;settling&quot; for him....greasy, grimy HIM. Stella just puts up with the verbal abuse, (which she is obviously not accustomed to) and his raunchy friends, puts on a &quot;happy&quot; face, and floats around like a satisfied butterfly. Then Blanche Dubois enters and the book metaphorically speaking, &quot;catches on fire&quot;. Blanche is the airheaded and supposedly wealthy sister of Stella. She arrives for a &quot;visit&quot; to see her sister, and how she's doing. Stanley's distaste for old wealth becomes even more apparent when Blanche arrives. You see, Blanche loathes the way Stella is living. The apartment is dirty, stark and unforgiving. Blanche fears the stark light..she incessently bathes, puts scarves and paper lamps over the lights to feel clean, even younger. She does everything possible to feel she is not living amongst the dirt and grime. Her behavior annoys Stanley to no end. He thinks she's a washed up &quot;beauty queen&quot; type who doesn't know what the word &quot;struggle&quot; means. Blanche admits to Stella she's lost their home and there is no money left, nothing to their former life. Hearing this news, Stanley is even more annoyed with the way Blanche continues to &quot;put on airs&quot; , behaving wealthy, when the wealth is gone. Stanley and Blanche can no longer stand each other and a stuggle ensues. Blanche seems to &quot;lose it&quot; gradually, slowly realizing that her looks, her dress, her fathom wealth really do no longer exist. She crumbles. In the movie, Vivian Leigh (who was Scarlett O'Hara) plays Blanche Dubois. The performance is undeniably amazing. Just for those interested, I think it might have been a difficult, but easy role for Ms. Leigh to understand, because in her real life she suffered from Manic Depression. Her own life, health, and romance were suffering in a way very similar to that of her famous character, Blanche Dubois. I strongly suggest reading this book first. It exlores aspects of the characters that the movie stuggles to reveal. Besides, a Fabulous book, followed by the movie and popcorn is always a treat!

After all, we have come far, have we not, from the south in those backwards years? Or have we? This was one of the works that we read in my AP English class this year and I was surprised how well a group of 11th graders were able to identify with the sexual tension, the deceptions, the characters and the plot. Blanche's hopeless situation is still quite poignant and Stanley's animal magnetism is something all of them could relate to. After reading the play countless times (and seeing various performances), I can say that this short play packs quite a wallop. Williams fits in a myriad of human emotions into this one short play. If for some reason you missed this one, read it and then rent the movie with Marlon Brando. With memorable characters like Stanley, Stella, Blanch and Mitch who have made their way into our everyday vocubulary, and a sizzling dialogue, it's a lasting work.

Fact.Secondly: To all of the readers who gave 3 stars and stated 'I must have missed something, yes, you did miss something. In fact you missed allot. A comparison would be a gargantuan 5-ton snowball sitting on your car and you missing it.Williams uses symbolism and fast moving dramatic text to propel his play at a speedily rate through the tragic history of the plays protagonist, the aging southern beauty Blanche Dubois while comparing to her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.Williams was an effeminate homosexual finding difficulty in expressing his art in a mainly homophobic world. The character of Blanche is meant to represent his psychotic alcoholic sister, Rose, while Stanley represents his crude and abusive father.The idea of reality not being able to live up-to the expectations of fantasy, and thus retreating into fantasy via alcohol and facade is explored in the plays. Williams uses excellent symbolism, such as water, lighting and music to covey to us the progress (or lack of) of Blanche.You will enjoy this play, it is a great read, however you must read it carefully!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire is an intricate play written by Tennessee Williams. It is easy to see that his work was carefully thought of and developed by the irony and symbolism throughout the play. I believe this can be used positively and lessons can be learned through Tennessee's writing. Although good lessons can be learned, I do feel that the play was lacking morally.I believe Williams's reason for writing this play was to show his opinion on some matters that were faced in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams wrote very closely to how he himself was. He let himself be portrayed through his writing. I believe that Williams made the main character, Blanche, somewhat psycho because that's what his sister had faced. He portrays Blanche in a way that brings on a sense of pity and sorrow for the reader. He also brings up the issue close to his life of homosexuality. Blanche had married a \\"boy\\" in her younger days and he tragically killed himself when she found out he was a homosexual. Williams also put a lot of irony into the play. Stella, Blanches sister, moved to a run down part of town and is living with her husband Stanley. Oddly, Williams named the place, Elysian Fields. In Greek mythology Elysian Fields is a type of heaven to them. So to put a run down part of New Orleans and name it Elysian Fields is showing part of Williams and his life. I see two perspectives in this. One is that Williams wants to show the irony of calling a crumby place heaven. Or two, Williams considered it to be his heaven and was showing that through his writing again.I believe another reason Williams wrote this was to show life in the 50s. In our society we are very repulsive to the things that Stanley, Stella's husband does. Stanley is a very rough man. He is disrespectful to women, he gets angry quickly, beats his wife at times, and ends up raping Blanche. When Blanche talks to Stella after the night Stanley hit her, Blanche, not used to the circumstances, says that Stella should leave Stanley. Stella replied with \\"...I am not in anything that I have a desire to get out of...people have to tolerate each others habits, I guess.\\" I think that here Williams shows that in New Orleans during the 1950s life was expected to be this hard. Williams writes to show emotion of something. He portrays that life was hard and that it really did have many down parts that left you in the dumps and sometimes, like Blanche, it left you going insane. Williams shows a harsh realism to the way life was in his story, and perhaps for him.I have personally learned that life is going to be hard. And although life is hard we need to find a way to deal with it. In A Streetcar Named Desire you can see Blanch pushing away her responsibilities and not facing them. She makes up a world that revolves around lies because she doesn't know how to handle the truth and pain she's surrounded by. By observing the play I have learned the importance of facing the things that come at me, and not only facing them but also being prepared to deal with them. I have learned the best way for me to deal with problems is to go to God. God can offer all the wisdom and strength to get through all circumstances.I recommend this play if you are interested in learning about the author as well as ironic things intertwined in the play. It is tragic and if taken seriously, a thought provoker. The characterization is incredible and very well done. Be discerning because the morals are not high but nothing terribly described. Otherwise this is a very interesting and good play to read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I recently read Tennessee WIlliams's play entitled \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" and overwhelmed at its greatness in its depth, sophistication, and style. Its a fascinating piece that is sure to be enjoyed by many people in times to come. However, the play is a little too inappropriate for younger persons due to the mature subject content.The play basically is about a southern belle named Blanche Dubois and her stay in New Orleans and experiences with her sister Stella (who is pregnant) and her barbaric and \\"animal-like\\" Polish husband, Stanley. Due to Blanche and Stella's aristocratic upbringings, still apparent in Blanche, Stanley almost immediately develops a grudge against her and is determined to make things worse for her. Meanwhile, Blanche acts in an overly charming and high-strung manner to conceal her rather notorious past in her home town of Laurel, MS. Blanche falls in love with Stanley's friend, another \\"common\\" fellow but has a striking gentleman quality that she admires, only to lose him in the end for which Stanley is responsible for. Stanley continues to cause her downfall in various ways. In the end, Blanche loses her grasp on reality and ultimately suffers her demise.It is a truely moving story and very, very nicely written. It is an example of true classic American literature that can be appreciated by all cultures of the world. I recommend this play to those who are looking for an easy-to-understand (yet lyrical) play with a unique and thoughtprovoking story line.I will include a few details of the book itself. There are 8 pages of pictures, several taken from the Broadway play and several taken from the Oscar-winning movie. However, the text seems a little too small for my taste and the edition needs to be updated (its from 1973)."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The play shows us that what we have always dreamed is not always what we are. More importantly, it shows us that we cannot escape who we are, lest we devolve into a state of fantasy, living a beautiful dream when the world around us is a nightmare. Williams is one of the premier playwrights of our time. And yet he is seriously underrated in modern courses in literature and on the modern stage. His themes are universal and ageless in that they center upon the fall from innocence that all human beings suffer upon learning that humanity is not beautiful. It is brute and desirous and akin to the raunchy yet realistic world of Stanley Kowalski. Blanche Dubois cannot live without embracing desire, embracing Stanley. And yet, she can never accept that she must desire. For that reason, she descends into madness, more content with the illusion that life is a beautiful dream, a belle reve, instead of an imperfect lesson in death and loss."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Born in Columbus, Mississippi, Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) endured a difficult childhood and adolescence before suddenly exploding to national and then international fame with the 1944 play THE GLASS MENAGERIE. He would go on to create a dozen or so more that were equally famous--but he is perhaps best recalled for the 1947 drama A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, which he drew from a number of personal sources and the time he spent in the New Orleans' French Quarter, in which the play is set.Like many of Williams' plays, the story is remarkably sordid. Blanche DuBois is aging \\"Southern Belle\\" who arrives to visit her sister Stella and is shocked to find Stella married to a bruitish Stanley and living in squalid conditions. Her social pretensions anger Stanley, who chips away with them without remorse or pity until Blanche's facade begins to crack and an ugly series of truths about her past emerge: a scandalous suicide, an equally scandalous series of affairs. Blanche is unable to confront either past or present realities and so spins into psychosis while most of those around her remain largely indifferent to her plight.But if the material is sordid, Williams juxtaposes it with tremendous delicacy, even poetry. Blanche acquires the tragedy of a frightened, hunted animal who has sought safety only to find herself inside the very trap she had sought to escape, increasingly fearful, increasingly alone, and ultimately pitable in her inability to fend off her tormentors. It is a vivid portrait, and many regard the role of Blanche as one of the tests of a great actress.The original 1947 New York play starred Jessica Tandy as Blanche, Marlon Brando as Stanley, Kim Hunter as Stella, and Karl Malden as Blanche's would-be suitor Mitch. A slightly later English production starring Vivien Leigh, however, ran into significantly greater censorship issues in London--and when Leigh replaced Tandy to film STREETCAR with Brando, Hunter, and Malden the material ran afoul of movie censors, who forced numerous changes and cuts. Consequently, if your idea of STREETCAR arises from the celebrated film, you may be somewhat surprised: the play goes quite a bit further than the film ever dared.Williams is frequently accused of being sordid for the sake of sordiness, and there is some truth to this accusation; as the years passed he was less and less able to balance the sexually charged nature of his stories with the same degree of insight he brought to his earlier works. But this not true of A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE, a remarkably complex piece with meticulously expressed ideas, images, and thematic choices. There is a reason it remains celebrated fifty years after it first appeared on the stage: it is indeed a masterwork, utterly unlike anything that had gone before and distinctly superior to everything which borrowed from it after it proved success. A great work by a great artist.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"There is one question about \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" that must be answered in the beginning. Does it make any sense reading this play if you already know intimately the 1951 movie version directed by Elia Kazan? Well, not much. Unless you have a special predilection for reading plays on paper, as opposed to seeing them on the stage or the screen - as you might guess, I have this defect of character - you don't really need to read Tennessee's original if you have seen this particular screen adaptation. It is as close to definitive version as possible. And there are formidable reasons why this should be so.First of all, it was Tennessee Williams himself who adapted his own play for the screen. It shows. The screenplay contains virtually the complete play. There are very few cuts, most probably made to satisfy the prudish requirements of Hollywood at the time. Reportedly, the movie was once badly cut by the censors - even such innocent lines like Stanley's ''You know, if I didn't know that you was my wife's sister, I would get ideas about you'' were cut - but in modern DVD editions all omissions are restored. Even in the boldest version of the movie some passages of the original had to be toned done, but none of them is of critical importance. For example, in the play Blanche had many ''meetings'' with strangers, while in the play these are ''intimacies''. You do get the point either way, don't you?Also, of course, there is nothing mentioned on the screen about her husband being homosexual (under the code name ''degenerate'' as well as Blanche's direct evidence as given in Scene 6). But this is not crucial either. Much too much has been made out it. Probably it was a shock for Blanche to discover her husband in the bed with another man, but surely the greater problem was that Allen proceeded to drive to the Moon Lake casino and blow his brains out. Another essential part of that tragedy is the fact that Blanche not only worshipped him, but it was she, unable to restrain herself, who precipitated the suicide by revealing that she knew the truth.The only other notable moment that's missing even in the fully restored version of the movie is the rape in Scene 10. Of course there is nothing explicit in the play, but Stanley does take Blanche to the bed - and you can figure out the rest, can you? The alternative in the movie is more elusive but wonderfully shot: after a short struggle we have the reflection of the unconscious Blanche in the broken mirror.There are several small additional scenes in the movie - the arrival of Blanche, her meeting with Stella at the bowling arena, the quarrel between Stanley and Mitch at work - but none of these is of any great importance. More importantly, the first scene between Blanche and Mitch is transferred from the Kowalski's flat to the romantically lit waterfront. The setting is more evocative and thus the advantages of cinema over stage are explored to the full.But on the whole the screenplay is very close to the original play. The dialogue is nearly word for word the same in both mediums, including many unforgettable lines:\\"Stanley [bottle in hand]: Have a shot?Blanche: No, I - I rarely touch it.Stanley: Some people rarely touch it, but it touches them often.\\"\\"Stanley: I never met a woman that didn't know if she was good-looking or not without being told, and some of them that give themselves credit for more than they've got.\\"\\"Blanche: Whoever you are - I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\"\\"Blanche: Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable. It is the only unforgivable thing in my opinion and it is the one thing of which I have never, never been guilty.\\"\\"Blanche: They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at - Elysian Fields!\\"\\"Blanche: No, I have the misfortune of being an English instructor. I attempt to instil a bunch of bobby-soxers and drug-store Romeos with reverence for Hawthorne an Whitman and Poe!\\"[I don't know why but I think there is something really sweet in the word ''bobby-soxer''.]The rumour has it that Tennessee was unhappy with the alternative ending in the movie, apparently having supplied it under external pressure. I don't see why this should be. It's an improvement. In the play Stanley tries to console the crying Stella after Blanche is taken away. But in the movie Stella takes their child, mutters resolutely that she's never going back and runs the stairs to the neighbours above; the movie ends with an offstage version of Stanley's trademark shout: ''STELA-A-A-A''. Now this is a most tantalising ending. You know that Stella, despite her words, will come back to Stanley. But you somehow feel that their marriage will never be the same again. The ''Blanche episode'' has marked it for good.Then there is the visual side of the movie, perfectly conveying the sweaty and oppressive atmosphere of the play. One component of the latter largely missing in the former is the constant musical accompaniment, meticulously described in the stage directions and every bit as maddening as the heat, but there is an ample compensation on the screen. The sets and the costumes are superb. They marvellously capture what Tennessee calls the ''raffish charm'' of the poor quarter of New Orleans where the action takes place.Then there is the director Elia Kazan. He not only had a priceless experience with the play on Broadway, but he apparently had a special gift for the screen as well. Despite the additional scenes, most of the action is concentrated in the small and squalid apartment of the Kowalskis. Yet the movie never feels static. Kazan makes a superb use of different visual angles, constant camera movement and, above all, imaginative lightning; the last one is particularly important since Blanche, as you know, is quite a bit preoccupied with light. Last but not least, the numerous perfectly placed close-ups give you an ample opportunity to appreciate some of the greatest acting ever captured on film.The cast in the movie I at least cannot imagine that it will ever be surpassed. Again, there are very good reasons for that. The Penguin edition, for some obscure reason (British arrogance perhaps?), prints only the cast from the first London production. This is unforgivable. The original Broadway cast must be given as well. The reason for this is that it was ripped off almost complete for the movie. The only difference is the title role. But Vivien Leigh was not just a star and a beauty: she came from West End where she had played Blanche quite a few times under the direction of her husband. That's why the acting in the movie is superlative and will probably remain unsurpassed: because all four principals came on the set with intimate knowledge of their parts from the stage.There are those - like Karl Malden, for one - who rather object that Jessica Tandy was dumped on the way to Hollywood; but even Mr Malden realises that had she remained, he and Kim Hunter would probably have been discarded. Quite apart from the fact - for which I don't really care anyway - that Vivien Leigh was necessary to pull off the star status of the picture, I cannot possibly imagine a better interpretation of Blanche DuBois. The ambiguous relationship with Stella, alternating between affection and accusations, the coquettish flirtations with Mitch, the mighty clash with Stanley; her incredible vanity, her manner that ''suggests moth'' (as beautifully put by Tennessee), her intellectual superiority, her emotional breakdown, her dreams, her delusions, her pathos: Vivien is excellent on all fronts. This is a tour de force for the ages.One of the chief glories of the movie is that Blanche DuBois is fully matched by Stanley Kowalski. Today it is difficult to imagine time when Marlon Brando was all but completely unknown. When he came to portray Stanley on the screen - after a great run on Broadway, let us remember - he was but 27 years old, starring in just his second movie. Small wonder that he was catapulted to fame by A Streetcar Named Desire. To the everlasting shame of the Academy he didn't win an Oscar for his incandescent performance. But it must be admitted that Humphrey Bogart in The African Queen is a serious competition.In his stage directions, Tennessee has described Stanley in a most unforgettable way. Such stage directions, superb character sketches really, are one the major reasons why I love reading plays:\\"Animal joy in his being is implicit in all his movements and attitudes. Since earliest manhood the centre of his life has been pleasure with women, the giving and taking of it, not with weak indulgence, dependently, but with the power and pride of a richly feathered male bird among hens. Branching out from this complete and satisfying centre are all auxiliary channels of his life, such as his heartiness with men, his appreciation of rough humour, his love of good drink and food and games, his car, his radio, everything that is his, that bears his emblem of the gaudy seed-bearer. He sizes women up at a glance, with sexual classifications, crude images flashing into his mind and determining the way he smiles at them.\\"Can you imagine a more perfect Stanley Kowalski than Marlon Brando? If you can, let me know about him. I am almost tempted to believe that Tennessee wrote the part with Brando in mind - but historical evidence refutes this tantalising speculation. However that may be, Marlon brings to Stanley Kowalski an astonishing vitality and intensity, an explosive, apocalyptic energy that fits the character perfectly and make for a mind-blowing screen experience. Just remember his throwing the radio through the window or his fit of rage at super - Blanche's birthday, no less - with the two sisters sitting with their eyes glued to their plates. Brando once said he detested the character; I wonder if this is why he was able to infuse it with such elemental fury.It is important to stress that even Stanley is not entirely without redeeming qualities. I don't, of course, mean his bogus morality, as when he refuses to kiss his wife in front of her presumably promiscuous sister, nor his equally sham pretension of being well-versed in legal matters: ''In the state of Louisiana we have the Napoleonic code according to which what belongs to the wife belongs to the husband and vice versa. [...] It looks to me like you have been swindled, baby, and when you're swindled under the Napoleonic code I'm swindled too. And I don't like to be swindled.'' All right, Stanley, we got the point. However, he is not stupid, though he is shrewd rather than intelligent, his sense of humour is very funny if not exactly subtle, and his anger at Blanche's snobbishness, however unseemly its expression, is a justified one. And he is certainly not indifferent to Stella, despite the social gulf between them of which he is also aware:\\"When we first met, me and you, you thought I was common. How right you was, baby. I was common as dirt. You showed me snapshot of the place with the columns. I pulled you down off them columns and how you loved it, having them coloured lights going! And wasn't we happy together, wasn't it all okay till she showed here?\\"That said, it is devilishly difficult to like Stanley Kowalski. Although the violent behaviour is the least of his shortcomings, raping your sister-in-law is not quite the most wonderful thing you can do while your wife is in hospital giving birth to your child. What's worse about Stanley is that he is the ultimate incarnation of the practical man; for him ''imagination'' is a dirty word. He has his feet firmly on the ground and he is excessively proud of that. I think this total indifference to anything spiritual is the primary reason for his callous attitude to Blanche, although it is certainly aggravated by his temperament and her flirtations. But it's news to me that only likeable characters make for great reading. Rather to the contrary: bad guys are far more fascinating. Stanley Kowalski is definitely among the most compelling ones ever created.Coming back to Marlon Brando's performance - ''you can't take your eyes off him'', as Karl Malden accurately put it - there is, of course, his justly legendary sex appeal to convey Tennessee's revolutionary message. Again, one needs a huge dose of historical imagination to appreciate the shock at the time. Gore Vidal has described it beautifully:\\"Finally, when Tennessee wrote A Streetcar Named Desire, he inadvertently smashed one of our society's most powerful taboos. He showed the male not only as sexually attractive in the flesh but as an object for something never before entirely acknowledged, the lust of women. In the age of Calvin Klein's steaming hunks, it must be hard for those under forty to realise that there was ever a time when a man was nothing but a suit of clothes, a shirt and tie, shined leather shoes and a gray felt hat. If thought attractive, it was because he had a nice smile and a twinkle in his eye. Marlon Brando's appearance of stage, as Stanley, in a torn sweaty T-shirt, was an earthquake; and the male as sex object is still at our culture's center stage and will so remain until the likes of Boy George redress, as it were, the balance. Yet, ironically, Tennessee's auctorial sympathies were not with Stanley but with his ''victim'' Blanche.\\"[Introduction to Collected Stories by Tennessee Williams, New Directions, 1985, pp. xxiii-xxiv.]The last sentence from the above passage is telling, and I am not sure the quotation marks are really necessary. It is certainly true, however, that Blanche's mental degradation is sensitively and compassionately depicted. One of the many pivotal questions of the play, as I see it, is whether Blanche would have ended in the same way if she had met with more understanding from Stanley and less prudishness by Mitch. Perhaps yes; she is already on her way down when the play begins. But it is just conceivable, if not very likely, that she might have recovered her wits had she been treated otherwise. That's what makes her a real tragic character. As Stella, in response to Stanley's doubtless ironic ''Delicate piece she is'', memorably puts it:\\"She is. She was. You didn't know Blanche as a girl. Nobody, nobody, was tender and trusting as she was. But people like you abused her, and forced her to change.\\"Yet this may be too idealistic a treatment. The clash of cultures is far too harsh for a happy end. It is amazing that Blanche and Stella are supposed to have more or less the same background: they have drifted apart through the years until they have come to occupy the opposite sides of the same equation. Perhaps the chief reason for this is that desire, purely sexual desire, is enough for Stella to bear Stanley's boorish stunts without any ill feeling. Blanche is by no means a saint; her vast store of knowledge does include the carnal one. But her make-up is altogether different and she would never be able to reconcile herself to such things like ''apes'' playing a noisy game of poker or physical violence that easily lends itself to animate objects. There is something noble and moving in Blanche's attempts, however unsuccessful, to supplement physical desire with spiritual richness.If you can combine the best features of Blanche and Stanley in one human being, you will get more or the less the best combination that so imperfect a material as human nature allows.The only drawback of characters like Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski - especially when played so magnificently by Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando - is that they tend to obscure supporting roles like those of Stella and Mitch (both wonderfully acted in the movie by Kim Hunter and Karl Malden, respectively). The neglect is unjust. Both Stella and Mitch are essential for the play. Indeed, the whole thing makes sense only with the complete quartet. It is significant that both Stella and Mitch have their share in Blanche's destruction, yet both retain some affection for her until the end: Stella is inconsolable; Mitch even challenges Stanley to a fight. Of course it is too late. Stella's inability to oppose Stanley and Mitch's moral horror at Blanche's past had already taken their toll.Before leaving this endlessly fascinating play, two further notes about two misconceptions that often find their way in reviews.One is the preposterous notion about Mitch and Oedipal complex. This is simply nonsense. Karl Malden was right on target when he remarked that his character hates his mother. Isaac Asimov's words about Hamlet may well be applied, in a less intense way, to Mitch as well: it is \\"not unconscious love that explains his actions, but a very conscious and reasonable hate.\\" It may be argued that Mitch's hate is not conscious, but nor is there any indication on his part about love or sexual desire for his mother. He makes few comments about her and they never suggest anything but the attitude of a man who is submissive son and not an insensitive human being. Also, it should not be forgotten, as demonstrated by his cigarette case and the story connected with it that he tells Blanche (Scene 3), that Mitch has already escaped once from the tyranny of his mother, or at least he would have if the girl in question hadn't died.The second misconception is to disparage the character of Stella because she endures Stanley's brutishness without any complain, let alone resistance. Leaving aside her lack of physical strength to resist and the uselessness of verbal arguments with somebody as cocksure as Stanley, Stella has her own, if purely sexual, justification: ''But there are things that happen between a man and a woman in the dark - that sort of make everything else seem - unimportant.'' If this too is offensive to the more fastidious readers, who are well advised to skip reading the works of this particular playwright, it is worth mentioning that what Stella has to cope with is by no means a rarity. This is clearly demonstrated by the scene between Eunice and Steve Hubbel. It's a very minor incident between very minor characters, but a consummate dramatist like Tennessee Williams would never have introduced it unless he wanted to show that domestic violence in New Orleans from the late 1940s is common. Whether this really was the case is of course absolutely irrelevant.The clich&eacute; goes that nobody lives on an island. I believe this to be an illusion. The truth, it seems to me, is exactly the opposite: nearly everybody lives on an island. Most people just manage to build bridges. Some of these are rickety rope affairs, others are as mighty as the Golden Gate, so the quality of communication varies greatly. Very few are fortunate enough to build whole isthmuses between the islands, thus enjoying the most perfect merging of personalities (or souls, if you like) in so imperfect and appallingly material a world. But there are also those who never manage to build even the most miserable bridge. They have to be satisfied with glimpses of other lands; distant or not, blurred by clouds and mists or not, but inaccessible all the same.So, in the end, don't we all, in one degree or another, depend on the kindness of strangers?Never mind all the above. It's a great play and a great movie. Somehow I can't quite separate them; even Blanche's confused way of talking is uncannily well-matched by Tennessee's masterful use of the art of punctuation, dashes and commas especially. Despite quite a few topical references that have become dated, the major themes of Streetcar are every bit as relevant today as they were when the play opened on Broadway nearly 55 years ago. This will remain so as long as people want to be together and maintain meaningful relationships on a long-term basis."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"First play I enjoyed reading. Tennessee Williams' incredibly detailed stage directions were effective in conveying to the reader a sense of how this play would unfold live. The characters, despite their flaws, are easy to sympathize with. One can simultaneously feel Stanley's distaste, Blanche's desperation in holding onto her illusions, and Stella being torn between the two. Normally I'd feel disgust for the kinds of character weaknesses, but Blanche's shrill fragility (Williams described her as a 'moth' at some point, a particularly apt metaphor), her process of falling apart by the seams, is rather saddening."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"When I lived in Munich, Germany a friend of mine gave me a pocket sized book of Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, written by Tennessee Williams. I was taking the train back to the Michaelibahn U-bahn, but I held on tightly to the pole, as he had cast his spell on me.Gore Vidal, a close friend and companion of his, wrote a preface to an anthology of short stories and started with his favorite, The Man in the Overstuffed Chair. Tennessee had just been fired from his contract in Hollywood after 6 months, and was going to stay a short while with his family.It was a story about his father, who worked as an executive, was an alcoholic, had his ear bitten off in a drunken brawl and was always in a foul mood. But this old chair they had acquired through moving was the only sense of comfort his father had; Tennessee never spoke with his father too much. But he said he was much like his father.Many of his earlier works would base characters on family or friends. In the Man in the Overstuffed Chair, his father, mother, grandparents and his lobotomized sister, were in the mix. Moving onto the Glass Menagerie, Tennessee, his mother, and his sister, the one who collected the glass figurines, were the substance for his play.But the Streetcar Named Desire brought out something audiences had not seen before - the sexuality of the character played by Marlon Brando as Stanley. Sexuality was intense in this play. Blanch Dubois, Stella's sister, is a weak, tired woman; she is tired of trying to fight her past from following her, hiding her age so she can be eligible for marriage, becoming an alcoholic for her nerves and Stanley trying to pull her weak facade down.In Streetcar as in Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, there is an underlying hint of a man being a homosexual; in Streetcar, Blanche says that her husband was gay.Some people hypothesized that Tennessee wrote the best roles for women, as he was writing them for himself; Gore Vidal vehemently denied this attitude. He was definitely a man.I do not want to give the story away. It is intense, quick and full of emotion. I would recommend reading the play and seeing the film. The original title was, I think, had something about A Night at the Poker Table. Elia Kazan changed it to a Streetcar Named Desire.I read the plays first then watch the movies. I would definitely recommend buying the book. There are directions in the book that may be missing in the play. Plus, Williams always writes the best Prefaces in his works."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" was the first book we read in our 10th grade english class and my favorite out of all of the ones we read. In this book, Blanche DuBois, a self-declared \\"Southern Belle\\", goes in to live with her sister Stella Kowalski and her husband Stanley Kowalski. Unfortunately, Blanche and Stanley don't get along. This negatively affects the relationship between Stella and Stanley. The main reason why I enjoyed reading this book was because there wasn't a point in the book that there wasn't anything interesting going on, whether it was Blanche confessing the real reason why she moved to New Orleans or Stanley yelling \\"Steeeeeeela\\" on the top of his lungs. Tennessee Williams was able to capture the emotion of the book without using any complicated and long words or as I like it \\"pretentious\\" language. I also liked that many times throughout the book I found myself not knowing who was the the \\"good\\" one and who was the \\"bad\\" one. At times, I thought Stanley was down-to-earth;others I found him extremely brutish. The same thing with Blanche. Stella was one of the only few characters which I agreed throughout the whole book.

The XXI century and the changes in culture throughout the years haven't changed the way people approach and see Blanche DuBois' drama. As a matter of fact, she has become an archetypical character, just like those created by the early Greek dramatists centuries ago.\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" can be seen/read as a play about the battle between the subtlety and the violence. These are the two opposite poles to which and from which the characters navigate. Blanche and her brother-in-law Stanley Kowalski can represent both forces in different times, hence their attraction and repudiation during the play.Williams is a master of characterization. People who inhabit his plays are alive, look like real persons and not just characters created for allegorical or dramatic effect. Even the supporting roles have human dimension, like Stella, Blanche's sister, and their friends Mitch and Eunice.Reading \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is not a hard task. The images flow easily and the play writer also leaves room for one's imagination with time jumps and ellipses. The dialogues are second to none in Williams' work. He can simply write the way people speak making his play lively and interesting.Blache's story of love and madness has become one of the most important works in the contemporary theater. It has aged very, very well. Actually it hasn't aged.

The melodrama of the lives of the three main characters barely redeems the pointless plot. The story can be compared to the whinings of a \\"Jerry Springer Show\\" guest; over the top and barely believable. A Streetcar Named Desire gives a perverted glimpse into the life of Blanche, a natural victim who marries a gay boy. Her confused life-partner ends up killing himself, which sends Blanche into a vortex of self-pity and phoniness. You later find that her sister, Stella isn't any stronger as she subjects herself to her abusive husband. As if these weak female characters weren't offensive enough, the character of Stella's husband is stereotypically portrayed as a drunk \\"Pollack.\\" A Streetcar Named Desire is nothing but a sad story about hopeless characters.

I was amazed that Stella returns, and that she still stays with him after what he does to Blanche near the end of the play.

And it thankfully took Marlon Brando to heights that the cinema history has never seen or will never see again. Having written both, it's extremely difficult for me to separate both from each other. The play was made for Marlon Brando, and Marlon Brando was made for the play. When he became Stanley Kowalski, acting was never the same again. What the people thought of Jimmy Cagney is radically changed, and the standards of excellence when it comes to acting changed. The play A Streetcar Named Desire presents to me a very odd story because I am using the thinking of today and transporting it to back then, the way things were. Blanche DuBois, another household name and for comedic purpose (see EdTV), seems to be an alcoholic from the outset who happens to be a sex offender too. So, the conventional thinking is that she needs treatment to take care of her problems. But in the play, the author lets Stanley Kowalski to suggest the admittance to mental hospital for her. But why? At that point, it still doesn't make any sense. Another scene, at the end of scene ten, Blanche DuBois accepts sex from her male counterpart. It was really an implied moment, but in certain ways, some have viewed it as \\"rape.\\" Even the movie makes a pretense of that. I thought that it also was a very odd moment. Putting the two odd moments together, A Streetcar Named Desire is indeed a strange play to view when applied with today's thinking. However, it is a great play because of the language, the mood, the atmosphere, and the feeling. There is a clash of two cultures: the old and the new as evidenced in Vivien Leigh of Gone with the Wind and Marlon Brando. If you think about how Vivien Leigh used to act as Scarlett O'Hara and apply the idea to A Streetcar Named Desire, it's easy to understand how the rules of acting have changed, and at the same time, the changing of guard had taken place. When you take a look at Marlon Brando's performance in A Streetcar Named Desire and On the Waterfront and compare them to today's movies, there is no comparison, and I honestly don't think there was ever a changing of the guard again. Anyway, Stanley Kowalski and Blanche DuBois are immortalized in this play, and their legacies will always live on forever. Just make sure that you take a special notice of the many implicit messages throughout the play because missing them will cause you to judge the play differently for the wrong reasons."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This was a very passiont film from the south drenched with liquior, romance, and confrontation. By far the best actress in the movie was blanch. She showed every possible emotion a human can have while acting in this play. She sold the movie for me from the second she started speaking. She goes though her up and her downs throughout the whole play. She tries to keep cool and calm throught the whole fil but battles to be considered sane but stanley pushes her over the edge in many parts of this film. From what i have known about this culture and this time the play was played out just the way the times have been presented to me. The male domination with the drinking problem who hits his wife and she comes back and loves him every time. Then you have that one woman who defies everyone and acts like a male almost. This film was very well presented and blanch dubois sold me. This was the beginning of an era in film making."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\"Blanche's final decree before being taken away to the insane asylum is an ironic remark which Tennessee Williams uses to harshly criticize the promiscuous lifestyle of Miss DuBois in his classic \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\" Moreover, it is a testimony to how Blanche sets herself up for disaster.Blanche DuBois is the southern belle whom the play revolves around, and she is certainly a character to be remembered for the ages. She escapes her deeply immoral past by fleeing to her sister Stella's homely apartment in New Orleans, only to discover that it is a complete cultural departure. A high-maintenance chauvinist upon arrival, Blanche is critical of everything in Stella's life, from her husband to her living arrangements. Blanche is dishonest about her past, lies about her alcoholism and covers up affairs with students--the complete opposite of moral perfection. Her constant affairs with unknown men back in Laurel caused Blanche to be kicked out of a two-bit hotel, and her affair with a teenage boy lost Blanche her job, illustrating Blanche as a wanton woman.So where is this \\"kindness of strangers\\" that Blanche so respects? The irony lies in that Blanche has not always been treated well by strangers, and that her relationships with these sorts of people often fare poorly, and so the fact that she relies on them for the welfare of her life is paradoxical. Williams condemns Blanche of her loose lifestyle, sleeping around with various men whom she does not know, and ultimately sentences her to the insane asylum, demonstrating that those with lifestyles like that of Blanche will merit the same fate. The southern belle image which Blanche allegedly epitomizes soon fades, and Williams takes this fact and emphasizes it to the audience. All of this adds up to a cornucopia of shameful aspects which Blanche attempts to hide from by deluding herself in fantastical images. Blanche has always differentiated herself as being more idealistic than realistic, and so her retreat into her fantasies is no surprise--she needs to escape the harshness of the real world. She herself is fading, and so her mentality follows.It is an important lesson which Williams teaches us about distinctions between reality and unlikely fantasies. Despite the fact that the real world may bring obstacles and roadblocks, as shown through the relationship between Stanley and Stella (which I won't delve into as my focus is on Blanche), living in reality is always a better idea than drowning yourself in fantasies. Blanche carries with her a whole plethora of stigmas and taboos that Williams deems necessary for her loose character, so that he may, in turn, teach lessons of morality to the audience. Blanche is a complex character that we can all learn from, and Williams makes that clear through the intricate development of Blanche. \\"Streetcar\\" is certainly one of the most interesting plays that I have ever read, and it is definitely a necessary component to the shelf of American classics."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire is an excellent tragic play focused on the pathetic lifestyle of the play's protagonist, Blanche DuBois. Blanche is annoyed and obnoxious on all levels; but the way she demeans herself and essentially destroys her own dignity demands the readers' sympathy.Blanche is forced to travel to New Orleans to stay at her sister's house ever since her plantation Belle Reve (beautiful dream in French) was lost. The name is important, as Blanche completely submerges herself in these beautiful dreams and freely throws away any ounce of reality she refuses to see. Once we see her sister Stella, we immediately know that they are extremely different as Stella is the realistic sister who moved on from a turbulent past. Personalities collide when Stella introduces Blanche to her husband, the infamous Stanley Kowalski. Yes, his is blunt, brutal, and barbaric. But his personality adds complexity to the novel as he is the foil of Blanche, which ends in some major tragedies.Marlon Brando fans will probably revere the way he acts out Stanley in the film adaptation. I prefer reading the book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The play as a whole representing the trials and tribulations of reinventing oneself is a caveat to those that attempt to achieve this remarkable goal as the characters in A Street Car Named Desire are shown as incapable of fixing their own lives. This is shown none more than in the protagonist, Blanche DuBois, who struggles continually with the battles of her past actions, signifying the decline of the American Dream that she had previously believed to be attainable.America was once thought of as a place where anything could be achieved with ease, no matter how severe the obstacle; but Tennessee Williams proves this idea wrong as no matter how far Blanche goes to start over in life, her past always haunts her. Blanche has made some brutal mistakes in her life and tries throughout the entire play to escape from them. She leaves her hometown after being forced out and decides to start anew by living with Stella in New Orleans. Once there, she lies about her mistakes to try and escape from them. She is able to do this for a while, but her secrets are soon discovered. Once Stanley confronts her with the truth, Blanche realizes that this dream, this American dream she had had is unattainable. She cannot run away from her past no matter how hard she tries.What Blanche does not realize, however is that maybe she cannot rely on the American Dream to save her, but she could have decided to change by recognizing her mistakes and moving on from there. Many people make the mistake of thinking that by coming to America, things will just work out in their favor. They do not realize that this takes much work to do. In this sense, the traditional American Dream has died, leaving many people helpless in the world, just like Blanche. The reason that this fails though is that Blanche's one method of starting over is to simply lie. She does not change herself so she is bound to make those same mistakes again, as she eventually does.Blanche's actions are intended to warn those against simply trusting it to faith that they will be able to start over in life. Not everything can be forgotten because sometimes one's actions affect others around them. It is not just their own lives that they are gambling with but also anyone's who is in close contact with them. It is not enough to rely on the idea of an American Dream to save oneself. Actions must be taken to benefit lives. A sense of apathy will go nowhere in life. Ultimately, change brings about change, so that is what it needed."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I found the play, \\"A Streetcar named Desire,\\" not as enjoyable as I expected. I feel that the plot was not well formed and the actors were too unrealistic for my liking. I feel that the reason that Tennessee Williams had for writing this play was to inform the audience of the sinful nature that humans have. Throughout the play you see various characters go through their everyday routines and not once think twice about the sin in their lives. For example take Blanche. The first time that she was talking to Mitch she lied about her past, and she lied about her job right to his face. Some might say that Blanche was a little mentally unstable so I'll give another example. Stanley's life was of no means perfect. He would talk bad to women, gossip about people behind their backs, beat his wife, and even rape Blanche then lie about it to Stella. Now even though the reader can see that Stanley is doing all of these bad things, I believe that Stanley is unaware of how bad his actions truly are, all he really cares about is making Blanches life worse. Which leads me back to my original point, I believe Williams wrote this to help show the reader that no one is perfect, but before you start to point out someone else's faults you need to examine the sin in your own life.From reading this play I have been able to stop looking so much at other's mistakes and I have started to try and fix the mistakes in my life. For example when reading the play I really was not fond of Blanche. I did not like the way she would lie to people and try to fool them into falling in love with her. Because of this I started to like Stanley because he was basically Blanche's enemy. Truthfully, I have done that in real life as well. When I don't like someone I sometimes, unconsciously, think I wouldn't mind if something bad would happen to them. What I need to do is stop focusing so much on other people and the things that they do, especially the bad things they do. I also need to reevaluate my life and try to fix some of the problems I have. Judge not, or you will be judged is what the Bible says, and maybe Williams wasn't too far away from the same idea.I personally would recommend this play. I believe that this play can be looked at from a variety of ways and many things can be learned from reading it. I did not enjoy reading the play but I think the lessons that can be learned from it makes it worth the read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Elysian Fields in New Orleans, sweaty, sultry, and steaming, embodies the perfect setting for A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams, a play centering on the themes of desire, domination, and destruction. Blanche DuBois epitomized the fading Southern belle, so obsessed with her aging beauty that she refuses to be seen in the glaring light and invents a &quot;make-believe world&quot; where her values endure. Stanley Kowalski represents the brutish, ape-like animal who thrives on women, alcohol, poker, and bowling. Stella Kowalski portrays the gentle sister and wife, torn between her worship of her husband and her loyalty to her fragile sister, Blanche. The action begins as Blanche arrives unexpectedly at the Kowalski's apartment. Immediately, the reader can observe the sexual tension between Blanche and Stanley. The play focuses on the conflict between these two characters, symbolizing the struggle between the gentility of the old Southern values and the brute force of the new, Northern values and also the battle between the nonconformist and conventional society. These themes so often surfaced in Williams's life that before perusing the play, the reader should scan a biography of Tennessee. The reader would be amazed at the incredible similarity between the family and acquaintances of Williams and the characters in his plays. Also, after finshing the play, the reader should rent the 1951 film version, which won the Best Picture Oscar and showcased vibrant, memorable performances by Marlon Brando and Vivien Leigh, offering a different, more happy ending to the drama. I highly recommend this play not only for its beautiful prose, but for its lasting presence in written classics and its creation of unforgettable characters to which all can relate. This drama would attract the reader who enjoys the local color of New Orleans, violence, biting comedy, insanity, and suspence, for the play constantly keeps the reader guessing at the real reason that Blanche arrived at Elysian Fields and at what will finally happen between Stanley and Blanche.

Williams conveys Stella Dubois as a model of southern elegance. She graces everyone she meets and brings a sense of nostalgic southern values to her Louisiana friends and acquaintances. Blanche, a fallen southern bell, as well as Stella's wealthy sister, comes to live with Stella and her husband. She isn't accustomed to the blue collar life that Stella's husband, Stanley Kowalski is providing. She points out many \`flaws\\" in their economic situation which displays the socioeconomic differences in our society. Williams brilliantly crafted Stanley Kowalski as the blue collared, coarse, and barbaric \\"man's man\\" He displays no remorse for any of his insensitive words or actions. This starkly contrasts with Stella who is vary affable and sensitive towards everyone. Throughout this novel, Williams displays these themes successfully through the characters and situations they confront."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I choose this book because it seemed very interesting, also I had never read a play before.

Tennessee Williams brings together Stella, Stanley - her brutish husband- and Blanche Dubois, Stella's sister. Blanche comes to live with Stella and Stanley after she is kicked out of a different town for being a flirt. Stella who is in denial about this tries her best to be a good host and comfort Blanche. Stanley is more wise than Stella and does research. Through a whirlwind of the blue piano that plays by their street, and poker nights, Blanche realizes she is no longer the sophisticated southern Belle she made herself out to be. Basically, Blanche goes crazy and was \\"forced\\" to deal with Stanley the way Stella has for the while they've been together.I love this book because it's like nothing I've ever read before."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This play takes place in New Orleans, where most of the homes are decribed as \\"white\\" and \\"rickety,\\" a place where many different \\"types of people,\\" dwell. It is the month of May, and Blanche Dubois has come without warning to her sister, Stella's, flat, expecting to stay. Stanley, Stella's egotistical husband, has become suspicious of Blanche and their personalities cause a powerful conflict.Generally speaking, Blanch Dubois is a woman near the age of thirty who has lived at Belle Reve, which can be translated to \\"beautiful dreams,\\" in the country. Much of this play relies heavily on symbolism, most of the time very subtle, and always elegant. She had grown up a debutante in Laurel, admired by men, and became a femme fatale. Somewhere along the way, she fell in love with a young man who she percieved to be wonderful and talented.After finding that he was, in fact, gay, she felt like her heart had been stepped on. Blanche wanted her young husband to feel the despair which encompassed her and issued creul words his way in retaliation. She criticized him for his homosexuality, which led to his suicide. This incident changed something within the character, hit a nerve, caused her to behave strangely with men, espeacially those similar to her late husband in age. Her name, Blanche, which means white, reflects the emptiness of her despair, the lack of substance in her character following this tradgedy. The event has damaged her psychologically, caused her to break down emotionally and mentally.Blanche began involving herself with man after man, going from one to the other, attempting to convince herself that she could move on, that nothing was wrong. By doing this she could run away from the grief and hide in the \\"magic,\\" the illusion that she was happy and stable. Blanche was particularly interested in young men because they represented, to her, a reincarnation of her late husband. Through them, she could mayhap redeem herself for her previous cruelty. But, even through this, she was still immersing herself in the illusion.In contrast, Stanley is a proud man, egotistical, and unreserved. He does not have time for illusions and likes to be in control. When he is under the influence of alcohol, he beats his wife merely because she had the radio on, which he feels is a form of rebelliousness. He has pride in his supposedly superior male gender. His partner, Stella (which means star), sees this as a part of her romance, and cares more for her relationship with Stan than for the welfare of herself and her child.When these three characters come together is when the fireworks really start happenning. Each character is so complex, so deep and well-thought out, that it is easy to fall in love with the story. I loved the symbols behind everything; it made the subject so much more powerful through association. It was a true delight to experience."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams' 1947 masterpiece A STREETCAR NAMED DESIRE features one of the most infamous characters in modern drama, Stanley Kowalski (created on Broadway by Marlon Brando). Stanley caricatures the masculine: he is loud, rough, crude, and handsome in a rugged way; he would also guard at all costs those things which belong to him -- including his gentle wife, Stella. But, like a stereotypical male, Stanley has no sensitivity, being concerned only with hard facts and given to violent behavior - even lashing out at Stella - when he cannot have what he wants. Stanley's animalistic qualities are summed up in his famous, primal cries of \\"Stella! Stella!\\" Blanche du Bois, Stella's sister who shares her and Stanley's New Orleans flat after losing her job as a high school English teacher in Laurel, Mississippi, is Stanley's polar opposite. Blanche is soft-spoken and pretty in a fair, delicate way; she is a romantic and given to illusions. Thus, when she and Stanley find themselves living together in close quarters, passions become heated and it eventually becomes clear that the fragile Blanche must be destroyed by the brutal Stanley, as their world views are directly opposed to each other and cannot coexist. In the play's later scenes, Williams dramatizes unforgettably the destruction of Blanche.An additional, important fact about STREETCAR's dramaturgy is that it influenced both Williams' contemporaries and his successors. For example, Arthur Miller was so struck by STREETCAR's expressionism - its visual demonstration of the fevered workings of Blanche's mind, as in the \\"shadows and lurid reflections\\" of the scene leading up to the climactic rape - that he emulated it to brilliant effect in his DEATH OF A SALESMAN (1949), while Neil Simon subtly alluded to STREETCAR's male camaraderie in his hit 1965 comedy THE ODD COUPLE."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is probably the most famous piece of literature from the US that I hadn'd read yet, until now. Nor watched as a play or movie. And still I seemed to know everything about it.Having just read Gore Vidal's memoirs, where he calls TW the 'glorious bird', I was motivated to finally get acquainted with the streetcar. What fun. It is Gone with the Wind updated for the 20th century. It is the downsizing of rural gentry. It shows downward social mobility in a narrative framework of Southern Gothic. It is powerfully vulgar and perceptive. It is so politically not correct. ('Polacks are like Irish, only less highbrow.')But with all the mad fun, let's be clear about this: despite the popular use of the term 'tragic' for the descent of Ms. Blanche into madness, this is not really a tragedy in the full sense of the word. Being a piece of stage writing makes it one only in the sense of not being a comedy. What it is, it is a really great melodrama.A word about the genius casting for the movie: Marlon Brando dominated it more than the text justifies. Gore Vidal says in his memoirs that Kazan actually destroyed the play by pushing the Blanche character into 2nd row. He says that TW did not mind, since it made him famous."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is an intense play, with poetic dialogue. If you can't comprehend marginal characters, you're going to just be turned off by the characters in this play. But they are desperate characters, and unforgettable characters. Tennesee Williams' big flaw for me, was that he wasn't really able to comprehend affection in romantic relationships, but only lust. When Stanley talks about getting &quot;them colored lights going&quot; again when Blanche moves out, Williams reveals that he can't comprehend three-dimensional romances. But that is the only flaw in the play, and the rest of it is truly brilliant. You do need an attention span to read this, since plays are basically made up of long speeches. I once rented the Brando-film video to watch with a friend, and he looked at me like I'd forced him to eat sawdust. His idea of drama was a Jon Claude Van Damme film. So, if your idea of entertainment is mainly dopey action films and MTV, stay away. But if you have patience, and a love of intense literature, you'll take an emotional journey when you experience this play. (The Brando movie has a relatively happy ending, but the written play, that Brando starred in on Broadway, has an unhappy ending. They both have their strengths, so I'd recommend you see/read both endings)."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"finally, a play that doesn't put me to sleep at the sight of the cover. The inside is no disppointment either, with a compelling story about one woman's secret past of love affairs and her new quest for her latest victim, all while hiding her age using paper lanterns and candlelight. Not bad for starters, huh? it only gets better.The primary theme of this play is that women are too dependent on men in society, as can be shown through the DeBois sisters, Stella and Blanche. Stella puts up with her husband Stanley, a buff guy with an erratic temper, even though she is miserable, all because she would be unable to support herself financially or emotionally otherwise. While Blanche criticizes her sister for putting up with Stanley, inside she wants the same, only her notorious past has all but kicked her out of her hometown, forcing her to smooch off of Stanley's alcohol and Stella's pity. This clearly outlines the gender roles of the post war era. From the founding of America, the men have been portrayed as \\"the moneymaker\\" and the women the \\"homemakers\\", which is still true to some extent today. However,this story emphasizes that depiction to a whole new level-women don't just marry men, they NEED men to keep them sane and alive.The dialouge of this play is excellet, filled with overly dramatic statements from Blanche and enough humor and wit to keep you busy. The story is a fast read, partially due to it being a play, but also because it is just all around well written and eloquent, without sounding too stiffy, if you know what i mean."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a play where worlds collide. It is a play about sibling rivalry and sibling compassion. It has tender moments and harsh moments that brilliantly capture human emotion in its myriad dimensions. At the end of reading it, I was nearly in tears.This is a play about the death of the old south and the illusion and dellusion of domestic Post World War II. \\"Desire\\" in this play is defined as the opposite of \\"death.\\" Blanche is running from death and seeking a new life but drowns in the sea of chaos that surrounds her. She is a displaced person, a vestige of the old south, forced to fight an uphill battle for survival against poverty and madness.Blanche embodies the struggles of the south, a place which has been portrayed time and again by authors such as Faulkner and, more recently, David Hill as never seeming to have recovered from the blight of the Civil War. The antebellum prosperity of slavery is alive in Blanche -- e.g., her refined manner, her white clothes signifying purity -- but the claws of madness and disorder tear her in every dirrection.A modern reading of this work might try to focus on the fact that it is set in New Orleans, and apply the themes stated above to the before and after effect of Hurricane Katrina."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is the first play I have read by Tennessee Williams. The skill with which the story unfolds makes it very obvious why Williams is regarded as a great American playwright along the lines of Arthur Miller.\\"Streetcar\\" tells the story of a woman's fall from grace after living on her charm and sexuality for most of her life. Much in the same way \\"Death of a Salesman\\" shows the slow and painful death of a family man, \\"Streetcar\\" shows a Blanche being unable to accept that time has passed her by and a reputation of being fast has destroyed her. When Blanche comes to visit her sister Stella and her husband, only Stanley senses something peculiar about Blanche. It is only when Stanley begins to research into Blanche's past that he begins to see through her web of lies. Confronted with her lies, the only thing she has left to hold on to, Blanche's sanity escapes her.In a sad reality, women who live their lives dependent on their looks and exploiting men will eventually find that their game will eventually exhaust its momentum. Readers who sympathize with Blanche's demise may have trouble identifying with a gruff character like Stanley. It is difficult to identify with a man who beats his wife as a hero. Despite his flaws, Stanley is the hero in this sad story. Much like reality, few heroes are as perfect as superman.\\"Streetcar\\" is an honest story that ranks high on the totem pole of American theater. In terms of its reach, no well read American can call themselves \\"well-read\\" without \\"Streetcar\\" on their \\"to read list\\"."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Firstly: A Streetcar Named Desire is perhaps one of the best plays ever written. Fact.Secondly: To all of the readers who gave 3 stars and stated 'I must have missed something, yes, you did miss something. In fact you missed allot. A comparison would be a gargantuan 5-ton snowball sitting on your car and you missing it.Williams uses symbolism and fast moving dramatic text to propel his play at a speedily rate through the tragic history of the plays protagonist, the aging southern beauty Blanche Dubois while comparing to her brutish brother-in-law, Stanley.Williams was an effeminate homosexual finding difficulty in expressing his art in a mainly homophobic world. The character of Blanche is meant to represent his psychotic alcoholic sister, Rose, while Stanley represents his crude and abusive father.The idea of reality not being able to live up-to the expectations of fantasy, and thus retreating into fantasy via alcohol and facade is explored in the plays. Williams uses excellent symbolism, such as water, lighting and music to covey to us the progress (or lack of) of Blanche.You will enjoy this play, it is a great read, however you must read it carefully!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire is an intricate play written by Tennessee Williams. It is easy to see that his work was carefully thought of and developed by the irony and symbolism throughout the play. I believe this can be used positively and lessons can be learned through Tennessee's writing. Although good lessons can be learned, I do feel that the play was lacking morally.I believe Williams's reason for writing this play was to show his opinion on some matters that were faced in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams wrote very closely to how he himself was. He let himself be portrayed through his writing. I believe that Williams made the main character, Blanche, somewhat psycho because that's what his sister had faced. He portrays Blanche in a way that brings on a sense of pity and sorrow for the reader. He also brings up the issue close to his life of homosexuality. Blanche had married a \\"boy\\" in her younger days and he tragically killed himself when she found out he was a homosexual. Williams also put a lot of irony into the play. Stella, Blanches sister, moved to a run down part of town and is living with her husband Stanley. Oddly, Williams named the place, Elysian Fields. In Greek mythology Elysian Fields is a type of heaven to them. So to put a run down part of New Orleans and name it Elysian Fields is showing part of Williams and his life. I see two perspectives in this. One is that Williams wants to show the irony of calling a crumby place heaven. Or two, Williams considered it to be his heaven and was showing that through his writing again.I believe another reason Williams wrote this was to show life in the 50s. In our society we are very repulsive to the things that Stanley, Stella's husband does. Stanley is a very rough man. He is disrespectful to women, he gets angry quickly, beats his wife at times, and ends up raping Blanche. When Blanche talks to Stella after the night Stanley hit her, Blanche, not used to the circumstances, says that Stella should leave Stanley. Stella replied with \\"...I am not in anything that I have a desire to get out of...people have to tolerate each others habits, I guess.\\" I think that here Williams shows that in New Orleans during the 1950s life was expected to be this hard. Williams writes to show emotion of something. He portrays that life was hard and that it really did have many down parts that left you in the dumps and sometimes, like Blanche, it left you going insane. Williams shows a harsh realism to the way life was in his story, and perhaps for him.I have personally learned that life is going to be hard. And although life is hard we need to find a way to deal with it. In A Streetcar Named Desire you can see Blanch pushing away her responsibilities and not facing them. She makes up a world that revolves around lies because she doesn't know how to handle the truth and pain she's surrounded by. By observing the play I have learned the importance of facing the things that come at me, and not only facing them but also being prepared to deal with them. I have learned the best way for me to deal with problems is to go to God. God can offer all the wisdom and strength to get through all circumstances.I recommend this play if you are interested in learning about the author as well as ironic things intertwined in the play. It is tragic and if taken seriously, a thought provoker. The characterization is incredible and very well done. Be discerning because the morals are not high but nothing terribly described. Otherwise this is a very interesting and good play to read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I usually do not like to read plays because I find it much easier to watch the charaters act it out on the screen, so when I read a Streetcar Named Desire for class I was a little skeptical at first, but by the time I finshed it became one of my all time favorite books.

It is a work that brings us to a deeper understanding of ourselves: what we think of Blanche's character, Stanely's nature and Stella's metamorphosis speaks directly to our own character and ideals. William's view that Blanche, for all her errors, retains her dignity and her concept of a &quot;lady&quot;, never deliberately harming a soul, is an important reminder to us all: we are no one's judge. Streetcar is a story of survivors, of dimensions and of immortal personalities.

Tennesse Williams writes a simple, poignant, and very provocative play about how life fails us in so many ways. From Bel Reve to the Elysian Fields is a terrifying path to demise. While, Stella can survive devolution maintaining societal respect Blanche in her desperation must break all societal norms to survive. The end of the play was brilliant in exploring the very concept of insanity. Perhaps insanity is simply survival outside of the dictates of society. Stan represents the resptraints, the judgements society places on individuals though he is not above this cycle of judgement.

I think what Williams was trying to do was to show that there is rarely a perfect individual and often enough it is the combination that mixes best. Another underlying theme that it often comes to mind is the basic instinct of survival, if civilization and modern gadgets are taken away from us we will be reduced to the one common law that is always constant... The Law of Survival... those who adapt the fastest survive as in the Darwinian theory of evolution.

The characters are very different and that's the most important point in that play. It's clear to realize the pessimistic character of the author in that play like in The Glassmenagerie. The person I was not able to explore was Stanley, he is a man with self-security and force, but also in a way like a brutal animal, which can not control his instincts. The play shows the way how to try or find the reality in the world. It is very hard for the reader to accept the fact that Blanche should go with a jacket, even though we will know: Now she won against reality, illusion confirms her life. At the end the reader has to imagine the future of all those persons, he has to fill the opened. Tennessee Williams was able to show the contrast of reality and illusion and shows us a part of a pessimistic world we often won't accept!!!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This book is excellent. It is, in essence, a play, which makes it more interesting to read than other books. You don't get to see how the characters feel inside, but you can understand it through their words and actions. The book is about two sisters and one husband, and it is how a rich sister comes to live with her poorer sister and husband because the rich one lost all of the family money. It is about how they live together in close quarters and how all the secrets come out. Read it, and a clearer understanding of the human psyche will come to you."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I recently reread \\"Streetcar\\" and found it to be as good as ever. Williams does a great job of describing the scene. You feel like you're down in the Quarter. I know he's the villain but I love Stanley Kowalski. He's the kind of man who steps up when the politicians get us into a war. He does the fighting. He's no effeminate Tennessee Williams. Stanley keeps his woman (Stella) satisfied. She loves it and goes crazy when he travels. Gotta love it. He's the king of his house. No wimp in Stanley. Stanley brings home the meat, he's hard drinking, hard playing (cards, bowling, sex). A man of action, a man who just might get somewhere. He sees right thru Blanche. Blanche is Tennessee (a weak woman). Stanley has friends. He knows what's up. Where are all the Stanleys in our wussified world? Turned to metro-sexuals I guess. Can't you just envision Stanley and Stella working long and hard on their night moves in the heat of a New Orleans summer night with the sounds and smells of the street right outside their bedroom window.

I enjoyed the story, however it all seemed a little too unrealistic for it to be considered a naturalistic piece of literature. The characters were very interesting, but exaggerated. However, the themes of the play were very real. Williams' attention to the treatment of women was particularly interesting. This was played out in Stella's abusive relationship with Stanley Kowalski. He could treat her like dirt, but she always took him back. Also, intriguing was Williams' play on romanticism through the character of Blanche DuBois. In a sense, I feel he is commenting on the slowly dying theme of romanticism along with the Old Southern \\"plantation fantasy\\" and \\"Southern Belle.\\" His use of symbolism was powerful and can be seen in the title itself. Blanche rode a streetcar named Desire, connected to Cemetaries and arrives at the neighborhood of Elysian Fields. Blanche was full of desire -to start a new life, to portray the image of a rich Southern belle, to deceive people of her age. She came to Elysian Fields, which is the land of the dead in Greek mythology, and met the end of her game. Overall, the play was well developed and logical in order. If you like stories with realistic themes and powerful, yet contrasting, characters, I would recommend reading A Streetcar Named Desire."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"this book is my favorite,I've watched the video and thought I must read the book.the book and video are wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"stanley and stella are going to have a baby soon and so their little two room apartment will be too crowded for Blanch to stay.

The poem speaks of Crane's efforts to capture the fire of the imagination and the gift of love in the course of an unhappy life. With his passionate romanticism and his lyricism, Crane was a deep and lifelong influence on Williams.It helped to think about the importance of Crane's lines when I revisited \\"Streetcar\\". They capture something of the way we are to understand Blanche DuBois The unhappy heroine of Williams's play did indeed live in a \\"broken world\\" of sundered dreams. She lost the remnants of Belle Reve, the family plantation in Mississippi, together with her self-respect. On her fateful visit to her sister Stella and her husband, the coarse, brutal Stanley Kowalski in New Orleans where the play takes place, Stella's world becomes broken again when she loses her last chance at love and her sanity.All Blanche has are her dreams and her attempt to find \\"the visionary company of love.\\" She is a woman of illusions who attempts to hide the sordid details of her own past, including the suicide of her young husband, her attendant nymphomania, and her alcoholism from herself and from others. Her illusions cannot survive realistic scrutiny, particularly when they are exposed to Stanley. Blanche is unable to hold on to her last \\"desperate choice\\", similarly to the speaker in Crane's poem. As his own life progressed, Williams came increasingly to identify himself with Blanche DuBois, and perhaps these lines from Hart Crane apply to Williams view of himself as well.With its lurid, pulpy, and melodramatic story, Streetcar has always been a tempting target for critics. But in beautifully poetic language, the play raises certain timeless themes, including the search for love, the powerful and destructive force of sexuality, and the centrality of romance and imagination to give life meaning in a world of brute fact. In a short introduction he wrote to the play called \\"A Streetcar named Success\\" Williams suggested, following William Saroyan, that the theme of the play was that \\"purity of the heart is the one success worth having. \`In the time of your life -live!'\\" The play and Blanche come to a sad end. But capturing Blanche's story in art gives the reader or viewer of the play a power to persevere, similar to the power given to art and love in Hart Crane's \\"The Broken Tower.\\"Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams rightfully takes his place as one of the premier playwrights in the history of the American theater. The relentless turning out of high quality pieces (and other short literary expositions) on subjects that in an earlier day before the 1950's would have not found nearly so receptive an audience.I saw the movie version of Streetcar long before I read the original play so that, of necessity, the role of Stanley on the page evokes the powerfully strong, sexual and primitive role performed by Marlon Brando and the equally powerful performance by Vivian Leigh as the coquettish down on her heels Blanche Dubois. There are however, important differences between the story line presented in the movie and in the original play version. Some of the more explicit graphically sexual scenes and latent homosexual allusions did not pass muster with the censors of the times. For one familiar with the story from the stage or theater it is well worth going back and reading the original play to get a feel for the tensions that remain unexplored in the other media.A reading of the play also makes clear something is missing from the productions and that is the sense that the characters are sleepwalking through life with their own private illusions that prevent them each, in the final analysis, from having more than a surface understanding of the others in the claustrophobic little home they inhabit. Blanche will pay, and pay dearly, for not understanding Stanley better as she tries to live the illusion of a fallen, aging Southern Belle. In any case, whether on stage on the screen or on the page this is a great American classic."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"It amazes me how few people young people have actually read through &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;. Tennessee Williams is certainly one of America's trademark playwrites of the past century, along with Arthur Miller. His stories are timeless and his characters are unforgettable.The immortal character of Blanche DuBois is a classic icon, a woman who's lost not only her material wealth but her virtue. In her last attempt to hold onto some shred of happiness, she goes to stay with her sister, Stella, and Stella's working class husband, Stanley Kowalski. Blanche's fortune has been lost, but she attempts to maintain her dignity and stature as a debutant. Stanley however, is repulsed by the fallen woman, convinced she is not only snobby, but hiding Stella's share of the family fortune. What he discovers is that Blanche has created quite a reputation by having numerous affairs with random men in the surrounding communities. To spite her, he ruins her last chance at getting married and pushes her into the realm of insanity.A Streetcar Named Desire is a blunt look at the violence of lower class life and how it clashes with the upperclass. Everyone should read this American classic once, if not for the historical benefit, but for amazing dialogues that have been quoted over the years. At this point, pretty everyone knows the phrase, &quot;I have always depended on the kindness of strangers&quot;, but few realize its origin or the context in which it was spoken. I think its about time everyone knew.Happy Reading!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The new society portrayed through Stanley challenges Blanche and her Old Southern ways. Both of these characters are stubborn in keeping their own traditions, and Williams does a magnificent job of keeping tension between them from beginning to end. The two characters have many confrontations, and usually another conflict arises before resolving the previous one. The building up of these conflicts leads to many bursts of heated arguments and violence until it reaches one large explosion in the end followed by the sudden collapse of everything in the loser's world. The reader feels compassion for Blanche and her mental disintegration. The symbolism of the polka music escalating in her mind shows rise to her pain and sorrow, which assist in her moving towards insanity. Although many readers finish the book hating the brutish Stanley, I believe that one truly needs to appreciate the artwork Williams uses in creating him. Stanley Kowalski was meant to be written the way he was: a physical and sexual character who did not understand anything besides how to pride himself in his masculinity. He responds to situations he dislikes by throwing objects and yelling, and it the few times he does seem happy is when he reminisces on his capabilities to have sex however he pleased before Blanche's arrival. The play may seem offensive, but the issues of lust, promiscuity, and homosexuality are all present today. Perhaps readers become offended because a certain discomfort arises when Williams assigns the issues personalities and names. I believe that was his intention. By labeling these issues with characters, the reader feels sympathy for Blanche and her traditions, disgust towards Stanley and his primitive ways, and even confusion for Stella and her being trapped in the middle. Despite all the technicalities meticulously woven in this novel, I enjoyed the simplicity of how the characters relate to everyday people. At first, I found it difficult to read about such extreme characters. After NOT thinking about it, I realized that Blanche is just a woman who wants to be happy, but she is trapping herself with her own ideals of the perfect lady. And Stanley although crude in many ways, does have a caring side for Stella that he is not always able to express. His hostility towards Blanche is provoked by her constant criticism of his stupidity. Williams's characters can be identified in very particular ways and also very universal ways. His intense plot drives through the play, and even though this was an English project, I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Definitely one of the most important plays of our time.

They are all just people trying to survive, and sometimes they don't always follow the rules..."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams is a play about class and gender, and how they interact in a specific time period and place, much more than it is about individual characters. The main characters embody some of the most stereotypical characteristics of all time. Stanley Kowalski - the male lead - is a working class man who uses strength to succeed in his job and his marriage. His wife, Stella, demurely accepts Stanley's verbal and physical abuse because she loves him. Their world is a perfect balance of male/ female, active/ passive, love/ fear, and rough/gentle, until Stella's sister comes to visit. Blanche is much more rounded character, but she is stereotypically a southern belle and a snob, to the point where she lies about her age and how much she drinks because it is the ladylike thing to do. The play unfolds rather fascinatingly, and it quite well written - dramatic but with enough humor to make it bearable. There are an abundance of very obvious symbols, which might tire the reader after awhile. Desire covers a lot of themes, including, as I said before, class and gender, desire and the south, which may be too much for one play, but Williams pulls it off well. The reader comes away with a good sense of the New Orleans working class after the war. A good play, but probably a better performance than read, as befits a play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This story is great and moving.

In the story of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire,\\" the plot follows one particular character, Blanche, who is constantly struggling to accept the conditions of her current, impoverished conditions. Even after becoming homeless and being forced to move into her sister Stella's home in order to re-invent her life after her troubled past, she continues to lie to cover up her past's secrets and ironically ruins her chances of ever starting anew. Throughout the story, a reader can witness how her lies cause her to lose a potential husband and all in all, lose her sanity. Because of her reluctance to inform even her sister of a shameful past, she causes distrust amongst her peers which leads her to be unable to lead a normal relationship with society. Her distrustful nature even causes her peers and even her sister to become suspicious of the stories she desperately tells to cover up the failures of her life. Follow the pitiful character, Blanche, as she deals with the struggles of her life, her family and her peers. Thus, the author illustrates that by understanding your mistakes, circumstances and the need for change, you could always change your destiny, Can Blanche ever come to her senses? I highly recommend \\"Streetcar Named Desire\\" because anyone can draw an important lesson from the mistakes of Blanche and the simple message of reality over fantasy can easily be seen in this book."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"... Opines the delusional / disillusioned Blanche DuBois, the fading Southern belle at the epicenter of Tennessee Williams' masterpiece of a play. In the course of \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" the thin frame that makes up Blanche's fantasy world will come crashing down after years of degradation comes to a head thanks to her sister's brutish husband, Stanley Kowalski. The epic clash between the two characters -- Blanche the 'virtuous' and cultured antithesis of Stanley's overt sensuality and primal behavior -- has made \\"Streetcar\\" one of Broadway's most beloved classics, and has infiltrated pop culture in numerous ways. Just try not to let Stanley's bellowing of \\"STELL-LAHHHHH!\\", or Blanche's haunting finale (\\"Whoever you are -- I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.\\") get under your skin. They give you the chills, which is undoubtedly why both lines have become classics in and of themselves.When Blanche first arrives at her sister's apartment in New Orleans it is a culture clash of epic proportions -- figuratively and literally in the way that different races intermingle in the city's limits. Blanche is a hopeless fish out of water -- desperately clinging to the old southern way of life even as it slips through her fingers. She plays at modesty and gentility, but it proves to be an affectation -- a ruse that she is putting on in an attempt to blind others, but mostly herself, to the true nature of her situation. You can't help but feel for her; Blanche is a delicate flower adrift in a world that is desperate to crush her, and while she may not be as innocent as she would have you believe, there is beauty in her lies. \\"I don't want realism. I want magic!,\\" she declares in a moment of desperation. \\"I try to give that to people. I misrepresent things to them. I don't tell the truth, I tell what OUGHT to be the truth. And if that is sinful, then let me be damned for it!\\"All, of course, leading to the play's shattering conclusion. Williams is one of the finest playwrights America has to offer, and \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is perhaps his finest hour. And with a career that gave us such greats as \\"Cat on a Hot Tin Roof\\" and \\"The Glass Menagerie\\", that truly is saying something."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is yet another highly overrated so called \\"Classic \\" by Tennessee Williams. In this play we see Blanche who arrives (uninvited ) to her sister Stella and her husband Stanley's house and stays for a few months. Blanche then uses up all of the hot water, drinks all of Stanley's alcohol , teases the guy she is dating and in no way contributes to the weekly income of her family.Blanche relies heavily on the \\"kindness of strangers\\" which is a polite way of saying she is like a homeless beggar on the street rattling her tin cup. In other words she is a parasite and leech on Stella and Stanley's hospitality and generosity.Stanley's freeloading overstaying house guest is severely limiting his sexual fulfillment and no doubt if this play was set in modern times Blanche would be running to the nearest Plastic Surgeon for a face lift. Obviously Blanche has never heard the Old Chinese Proverb that \\"Houseguests are like fish. After three days they start to stink\\" .In this play we have the usual tedious and hysterical outbursts which were sadly a signature of many of Tennessee William's works. I read an interview with Tennessee Williams in which he said that he based Blanche's character upon himself which can only lead one to the sad conclusion that he was a very nuerotic, pathetic, hysterical, attention seeking man and it comes as no surprise that he sought solace in alcohol and barbituates. I must say that his demise from this \\"mortal coil\\" was also quite unique.I give this book 5 stars because I have dated some women similar to Blanche's character (or lack thereof) but I was smart enough to never let them stay at my house for months on end and I never married any of them.I also agree with another reviewer that Stanley is one of the very few intelligent people in this play.He is the only person smart enough to see through Blanche's lies and her attempts at modest , respectable sexual behaviour."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Reading this Pulitzer Prize winning play set in New Orleans (1947) is like watching a movie. Tennessee Williams provides ample narratives and complete stage directions. Excellent detailed descriptions makes us visualize the characters and the settings. We can even hear the music as it wails in the background. We know every move of the characters and their personal feelings are revealed. There aren't too many lengthy monologues and the play moves quickly.It's easy to see why this book was turned into a movie.Blanche is an aging Southern belle and an alcoholic who lives between illusion and reality. Darkness is her comfort and light is her enemy, as it will expose the truth behind the illusion. She makes conscious effort to avoid the light. After losing the family estate, her job, unable to remain in other locations, she comes to stay with her sister Stella, who is married to tough guy Stanley.Feeling that he and Stella got swindled out of the estate, Stanley is wise to Blanche.

Tennesse Williams did an awesome job,the points that he was trying to get is the fact that we all have desires but, soon we wont have those desires for long, because they will soon fade away and die, there are always going to be new desires and some dont last very long. Blanche had this big desire of living in this fake world but, eventually it took her to the point where, everyone found out about her life, that desire was gone she couldnt have that desire anymore no matter how bad she wanted it.I learned that you can go through life having as many desires as you want but, they wont last long and you cant hold on to desire just like you cant hold on to a person when they die, no matter how bad you want to. They book shows you all the characters desires and feelings and how they didnt want to let go of those no matter how hard they tired to keep them they would just die and new desires would come up again. I would recommand this book because it shows you that you need to let go at some point and that we cant just live in a fake life, because sooner are later we will be found out. I think Tennesse Williams also did a great job with kinda showing that some people can be a Blanche, Stanely, Stella, Mitch, Eunice, and other characters that were mentioned."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tenneesee Williams' play, A Streetcar Named Desire, has been continuously named one of the greatest dramatic plays ever written, and rightfully so. The play's raw honesty of the late 1940s' lifestyle is compelling, and Williams'refusal to \\"gloss over\\" the hard truth is as refreshing as it is shocking. His well-developed use of foreshadow also brings depth and interest to the plot line.Though many moral lessons can be learned from A Streetcar Named Desire, I do not necessarily believe that it was Williams' intent to focus on a particular way to convey a certain morality statement. He simply used his play as a means to display the truth of life: that sometimes it's good, sometimes it's bad, and there are many things about it that we cannot change. Williams portrays the characters as they are, with no attempt at hiding their faults or virtues. Stanley Kowalski is a prime example. He's a hard laborer who takes what he wants in any given situation and doesn't care who he steps on to get it at that moment in time. However, he is not without his good qualities. Though he is somewhat of a brute, his love for Stella is true, and his devotion to his friend Mitch is honorable.The character of Blanche displays the fact that life and past experiences cannot be escaped or erased, and attempting to do so only produces the opposite effect. Blanche's efforts to modify her past and hide her age lead not only to her psycological death but ultimately her physical as well.Williams' life and personal experiences are also incorporated into the play, communicating a honesty and realism that was, and still is, rare on stage. The heavy reliance on alchohol and the presence of physical abuse were both very real in Williams' life from childhood until his death. The character of Blanche suffers from psychological problems, just as his own sister Rose did, and Williams' homosexual lifestyle is even incorporated through Blanche's homosexual husband.To put it simply, Williams shows how life is life, and very rarely can it be changed. Yet, without the \\"bad things\\" in life that we have to go through, we would never appreciate the good ones as much as we do now.During a class discussion, the question was raised of whether or not Stella was right in returning to Stanley after he hit her. At first, I was certain that, if I had been in that situation, I would not have returned; at least not without some sort of counseling and certainly not by myself that same night. However, as the discussion went on, I became more and more doubtful of my answer. Throughout the play, it is obvious that Stella loves Stanley, and she herself admits that he is basically irresistible for her. I wondered that if I truly felt that way about someone, if I would really be able to stay away when \\"Stanley\\" is calling me back.This caused me to realize that it is very difficult to assert what you yourself would do in a situation before you have actually lived through it and been faced with the problem of choosing what path to take. Of course, speculation and discussion are all very important beforehand, but, when it comes down to it, those speculations are just that: speculations. We never really know for sure how we will respond until we actually have to do so. Perhaps Stella felt as I did before Stanley had ever hit her; that she wouldn't go back to a man that abused her in such a way. However, when she was first faced with going back or not, she decided to return. Her original speculations were left behind and she made a choice to move on without them.I would highly recommend the reading of this play. The story is different because it's true and not watered down at all, and its difference makes it great. The foreshadow and amazing use of stage directions cause the reader to think and form opinions or predictions, which, in turn, keep the reader interested. Aside from the literary elements, the play is terrific because it captures what life was really like for many people in the late 1940s, and shows how they dealt with it differently. It is no exaggeration when Tenneesee Williams is attributed with writing a one-of-a-kind classic."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This play was written by a very troubled man. In order to fully understand why Tennessee Williams writes the way he does read up on him. This play is quite depressing at some parts but it is a magnificent play.I think Tennessee Williams was trying to bring a few points across to readers and viewers. One of those I believe is the point of a lot of modern artists and writers. Life is hard and it can beat you up a lot of the time. I mean for Blanche she lost a lot in her life. But a lot of it is her fault. She got into some things that she shouldn't have. She slept with different men in her old town and like any where in the entire world things get around and things got around to Stanley and he freaked.Some things that went wrong for Stella were most of all, taking in Blanche. After she did that her life kind of got screwed up. Blanche invaded Stella's entire life. Blanche hit on Stanley from day one and Stella should have seen it coming. She invaded her home. She was always bathing in Stella's tub and making Stella do things for her. If I had been Stella I would've smacked Blanche long before.I think the only person who didn't lose completely was Stanley. He got to send Blanche away after he raped her. He got a son. He also got to keep his wife. I hate it when bad guys win.One thing I learned from Stella from this play is to never ever judge a person by how they act. Or as some people say, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover.\\" If you judge people by the way that they act or the way that they dress you can miss some really great things about people. Or in Stella's case I could look over the flaws of people. In some cases that's a good thing to do but in the case of the play it was bad. Stella was so blinded by love for her sister that she would believe whatever she would say. I have to give Stanley respect for seeing through Blanche and doing his homework on Blanche.I learned an important lesson from a character that wasn't a \\"main character.\\" Mitch showed a very compassionate side in the play. He cared a lot about Blanche. He tried not to think about what Blanche had done. I guess that he figured that she'd fess up eventually. But she didn't and he finally came to her and to talk about it. He found out that she lied and he \\"cut all ties\\" with her. I would have done the same thing if I had been Mitch in that situation.If you are a fan of very descriptive plays, please read this play. It one of the most well written plays I've ever written. Tennessee does a great job of describing all of the characters and all of the situations in every scene. This play is a must read."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I really liked A Street Car Named Desire. I thought the reading was very positive. It was much easier to understand the wording and content then the past plays we have read. Though a tragedy, it was still a good play. Some parts were a bit disturbing and emotional, but some were enjoyable. This play definitely keeps you interested and wanting to read more to see what happens next. I enjoyed this play very much.I honestly don't think Tennessee Williams had a main point in this play. I believe this play was about his life and childhood. Before we read the play, we watched and biography on Tennessee to prepare us for the book. He wasn't the greatest person, nor did he have a great life. As a young child, his mom was beaten by his father, who was a drunk. In the play, Stanley beats his wife Stella and Stanley has a severe drinking problem. Tennessee's sister, Rose, is sent to a mental institution, like Blanche was sent to one in the play. Tennessee also had a drinking problem and a drug addiction. Tennessee turned to alcohol and drugs when he was having a rough time in life. In the play, Blanche did the same thing. My point is Tennessee wrote this play to share with us how people in New Orleans lived back then. I also think he wrote this play to share about his life in the form of plays. Since his life was such a tragedy, he wrote tragedies, maybe to let out his feelings. He lived such a tragedy, which makes me feel sorry for the guy. He had such a talent in creating plays, but he wasted some of that talent in alcohol and drugs.Honestly, I really didn't learn a life lesson throughout this play. The past plays my class have read, I have learned these amazing lessons that can help me throughout the rest of my life. One thing I learned about is how people lived back then in Tennessee William's time of writing this play. It makes me feel very thankful that my parents would never treat me the way his dad treated them. I really don't know if he knew his parents loved him, but I know my parents love me. I'm thankful my parents aren't alcoholics or drug addicts. I'm glad my dad respects my mom enough to love her and not beat her. He treats her and me the way a woman should be treated. This play has taught me Tennessee's way of writing. If I never read this play, I probably wouldn't have realized I take so much for granted. There are some kids, like Tennessee once was that don't know that their parents love them. From now on, I'm going to thank God for giving me loving parents. I'm really glad I read this play.I recommend this play if you can take a very sad, tragic play, but if not don't read it. This play really makes you feel thankful that I don't experience some of the things in this play. If you decide to read this play, I definitely recommend you watch the biography on Tennessee Williams. It prepares you for the play, so you are not as shocked as you read. After watching the biography, you understand his point of view on writing plays. Tennessee has a very unique way of writing. If you are looking for a tragedy, I recommend this book. I just warn you to be prepared for the shocking and disturbing actions of the characters. There are many foreshadows in the play. These parts keep you interested for the disappointing and surprising past of one of the characters. A Street Car Named Desire is a great play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Compared to many other plays I've read in the past, A Streetcar Named Desire was one of the most enjoyable. It was realistic and, although at times disturbing, made you think. Tennessee Williams went through a lot of struggles in his life, as well as the main character Blanche. This play might have been his way of telling others about the problems he dealt with in his own life. He was around an abusive father growing up and a mother who knew that staying with him would be bad, but did it anyway. This is the same situation in A Streetcar Named Desire. Stella is Blanches sister, and is married to Stanley. When Blanche comes to visit the two, she realizes that Stanley has a very manly, abusive side to him and although he has hit Stella quite a few times, she repeatedly comes back to him. Williams also had a sister named Rose who was considered to be crazy. Her family sent her to a doctor who performed a lobotomy; which made the old Rose Williams knew disappear. Blanche in the play was also considered \`crazy'. She went through a lot of struggles in her life, and they all caught up to her at the end. One of Williams's main purposes in writing A Streetcar Named Desire was to express his own problems.You can draw many life lessons out from anything you read, you just have to have an open mind when you read it. In this play, Blanche went through many years of difficulty, and as much as she tried to change her past, it just wasn't possible. She created this dream life of her own, where she imagined herself having lots of fancy things and rich friends, hides from the truth, and tells people lies to impress them. At the end, her sister and Stanley believed that she was crazy and sent her away to an asylum. A life lesson that can be learned from this reading is you can't run from your past. Blanche was caught in a lie when Stanley and his friends learned the truth about her past, and as much as she tried to convince them what they heard wasn't true, there was no changing them. She imagined she was someone she really wasn't to hide from the past, but it only made things worse.This play, although disturbing at times, has a good lesson behind it. Not only can you learn from reading, but you also find entertainment out of it. The play is very down to earth and shows what happens in people's lives that you may not know about. It keeps your attention and makes you not want to put the book down. I would recommend this play for a mature reader. One who doesn't mind the \`worldly' things that happen in life and can read it maturely!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I thought it was quite amazing. The way he related everything to his life. I didn't like Stanley. I like how he related Elyasian Fields New Orleans. It is a myth. It is about the lfe of a girl named Blanche who stays with her sister and brother-in-law. Stanley, brother-in-law, doesn;t like Blanche. Stella, sister, tries to be a servant unto Blanche to make her feel at home. Blanche takes a lot of bathes. Blanche takes a lot of bathes to clean herself of her past. Blanche ahd a boyfriend who shot himself because Blanche found out he was a homosectual. Mitch likes Blanche. Blanche likes Mitch. Blanche is raped and sent to the insane asylum. Stella has a baby. I recommend it to people who love twist and turns. It is a play written book based on Tenneessee Willams life. Blanche was is sister. Stanley was his father and Stella was his mother. Some of the other characters: Mitch, Pablo, and Eunice were made up characters. Tenneessee Williams, Stella, and Stanley all like New Orleans but Blanche and others don't. It looks like a dirty but you know the saying: One mans treasure is another mans trash . . . or vise versa."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"The play is extremely well written, so well so that you feel a certain hate or love about them. Tennessee Williams, the author, describes so much of his personal life in the story that you will sometimes feel like your being twisted around on a reality flip unreality rollercoaster. One minute you climbing to \\"Elysian Field\\"(heaven) and the next second you dive straight down to darkness and despair.Unlike other plays, this on has more than one conflict. Sometimes, even more than one at a time. Just as a warning, you cannot read this play and not feel some emotions about the \\"interesting\\" characters. So do not read it thinking it is an \\"easy read\\", cause its not. Some parts are hard and somewhat weird in a sense because it is coming from a homosexual author and he portrays his life in his plays.Before reading this play, I would recommend that the reader study the life of Tennessee Williams and his unstable family. If you can somewhat understand, the conflict in his life as a child, teen, and adult, the play will be much more understandable. Another helper to understanding the story is to READ THE STAGE DIRECTIONS!!!!!! So much hidden information is placed in them that you will be lost and left behind without them."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Despite frustration and disagreement with characters choices A Streetcar Named Desire by Tennessee Williams was a good read of Modern American Theater at its prime. This play manages to capture the attention of the reader and keep the reader interested through the development of the characters and of the story. This play is one of the greatest postmarks in modern American Theater.I believe that Tennessee Williams is trying to get his audience to remember the things that are real and not wish on things that are quite possibly unattainable. I can see this theme through the actions and words of Blanche Dubois. It is especially evident in her line, \\"I don't want realism I want magic.\\" This line shows how Blanche is looking forward to things that are hard to reach because no relationship in the world is going to be pure magic.Along with this theme Williams gives the reader a warning in the writing. He warns the reader about what will happen if the audience loses touch with reality to the point of creating a new reality. While in the process of creating her own new reality she lies and lies just to get people into the reality. However because of her lies once she is found out then no one wants to be associated with her. That in turn leads to death for Miss Dubois. While Miss Dubois does not actually die physically in the script her being separated from others is just as bad for her personally. That I believe is the message that Tennessee Williams is trying to convey to his audience. Of course there is the possibility that he just wanted to show people that this was his life. An abusive, drunken father, a sister that was mentally unstable and ultimately a household that was not good for a young child.Personally this reading of A Streetcar Named Desire moved me to become a better person. I say this because I see what happens to people when they get themselves so wrapped up in lies and deceit that they cannot see the truth. If I wrap myself up in lies and things like that then I might end up like the tragic Blanche Dubois. Mentally instable, never getting a look at the real world, and shunned by everyone around me because of my lies. In relation to this thought, the change from fantasy to reality has to be sudden. One cannot gradually go into telling the truth while telling lies on the way because the lies eventually will catch up to one and one will be in the same problem one was in before. The change has to be sudden and instantaneous for one to have a chance at surviving in the truth.It might have been possible for Blanche to change but she tried to ease back into telling the truth. Obviously that attempt failed because she went to a mental hospital to get treated for her problems. Another tactic that Blanche tried to use was the saying I never lied in my heart. The problem with that is that people do not know a persons heart and for all they know that phrase could be a lie to. On a final concluding note one has to be serious about wanting to change because if one is not they may still end up like Blanche. I say this because at one point in the play Blanche says to herself that she'll change and right in the next scene she lies again and blew the entire plan out of the water. I would defiantly recommend this play because it probably will make many people think about their lives and who knows it may even produce a change for the good. It sure has in me."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" is one of Tennessee Williams' signature plays that has propelled his reputation and made him into a household name. The play deals with a culture clash between two iconic characters, Blanche DuBois, a fading relic of the Old South, and Stanley Kowalski, a rising member of the industrial, urban working class. Their gender and ethnic differences also feature prominently, and are a source of lot of tension throughout the play. Setting the play in New Orleans adds to the colorfulness of characters and situations, and the title of the play is a reference to a particular tram line in that city. All of the characters in this play are very developed, and their oversized passions and outbursts are extremely entertaining to follow. The play has a quality of a train wreck, and we are simultaneously attracted to the scenes and appalled by their over-the-top shenanigans. The play appears as fresh as when it was originally written over sixty years ago, and reading or watching it is a pleasure."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" by Tennessee Williams is one of the most poignant and psychologically warped plays in creation, tackling harsh realities of life we like to tuck into the back of our minds and neglect--these kinds of themes include delusion, shattered dreams, aging and the seemingly impossible search for both love and self-acceptance in a world built upon brute facts.Set in 1947, the play commences just as Blanche DuBois, an English high school teacher from Mississippi, arrives at her sister Stella's apartment in New Orleans. Blanche confesses that she lost their ancestral home Belle Reve and must live with Stella for quite some time. This single act launches several plots instantaneously. We learn about the major characters throughout the play simply by how they react to the mental deterioration of Blanche and her struggle to find happiness. Her endeavor is ultimately destroyed by Stella's brutish and shrewd husband Stanley, whose already exasperated disposition is worsened as he lives with Blanche.Even though the intensity, action and violent scenes render this play so popular,\\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" ought to be read--and reread for that matter--so that people become aware of metaphors and themes they don't register while watching the play. This isn't to be done solely for learning's sake, though; these components solidify the play and leave readers with a greater appreciation for Williams's masterpiece.Whether you enjoy riveting plot or walking away from a book or play with a fresh, new perception of life or with a wisp of knowledge, you're bound to love \\"A Streetcar Named Desire.\\""},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This classic play by Tennessee Williams (1911-1983) is relentless and compelling. Few readers are un-affected by these pages, even more so than with The Glass Menagerie. The story concerns a Blanche, a troubled former southern belle who moves in with her married sister Stella in New Orleans. Blanch lives off pretensions and delusions, and we quickly sense she's headed for a fall. Her sister Stella doesn't see Blanche clearly, and worries that Blanche's presence will cause trouble with her abusive-but-loving husband. That husband is Stanley, a loud brute who's dominating persona both attracts and repulses us. Stanley is also a realist, and he easily sees through Blanche's pretensions. Readers sense the two are headed for a collision, with little doubt as to who is likely to win. Perhaps Mitch, Stanley's kind-hearted friend who likes the still-pretty Blanche can save the day, but has he the strength?This relentless drama carries quickly to the bitter conclusion from the strength of its characters. Some find this play depressing, but most find it fascinating. The superb 1951 film starring Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando is equally (some say more) compelling."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams conveys the true spirit of 1940's New Orleans in A Streetcar Named Desire. Williams has captivated a large audience through his provocative plays, showing the tragic lives of character such as Blanche Dubois. He enhances the magnificent play with ingenious foreshadowing and symbolisms.Tennessee emphasizes the importance of our desires and the effects they have on our lives. Blanche says \\"The opposite of death is desire\\", she fills her life with desires to keep her from death but they ultimately destroy her. Blanche moves in with her sister Stella and brother in law Stanley because her life was a miserable wreck in her former residence. \\"They told me to take a streetcar named Desire, and then transfer to one called Cemeteries and ride six blocks and get off at Elysian Fields\\". During the journey, from her old home to the Elysian Fields, Blanche takes \\"Desire\\" which then leads to \\"cemetery\\" or death. This foreshadows how Blanches fantasy's lead to self-destruction.Blanche admits, at one point in the story, that \\"after the death of Allan (her husband) intimacies with strangers were all I seemed able to fill my empty heart with\\". She had sexual relations with anyone who would agree to it in order to satisfy her loneliness. Sex is her most obvious weakness and desire, Stanley uses that against her and rapes her. After he has sex with her, she is taken away to a psychiatric hospital. Which again starts the cycle, \\"Desire\\" has sent her off to \\"Cemeteries\\".This play has taught me the importance of choosing the right dreams to pursue, and keeping them in perspective. Life is not always beautiful and poetic but is often dirty and uncouth. To create a balance would be ideal, embracing the good along with the bad aspects of life. Blanche failed to see the reality of life and was unable to feel successful unless she achieved all she dreamed.Streetcar is a play unlike any other, highly respected by many audiences for its unusual story line and beautiful use of literary elements. The characters are riveting and controversial, allowing the audience to discuss the characters actions and personality. I highly recommend this play; it covers many issues that are still relevant today."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"After recently finishing the reading of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, I was profoundly struck by the massive amount of information packed into such a small play. Williams has packed the reading full of all kinds of subtle undertones, foreshadows, and various allusions to his own lives or the lives of those around him in this dramatic piece of literature. Williams' style is unmistakable and immediately recognizable, giving the reader a clear understanding of his artistic vision with deep detailed descriptions of his scenes, as well as giving obvious representation of his characters mindsets and personal mental states.While reading A Streetcar Named Desire, the main point I felt that Tennessee was trying to convey to the reader was a sad one, one that reflected his own life very deeply. As Blanche Dubois flees her troubled past to her sister's home, she climbs aboard a streetcar named Desire. After a time, she gets off and switches to another streetcar, this one named Cemetery. Finally, she reaches her destination, the place of his sister's living, an apartment complex style building known as the Elysian Fields. This trip is repeated several times throughout the play, sticking its emphasis in the reader's mind to consider. I saw Williams pointing out that if you follow your desires, you will be under the impression that you will be heading for \\"heaven\\", or at least peace and enjoyment, just as Blanche thought she was. However, your fleshly desires, the wants of this world's pleasures, will lead to death, maybe not the physical death, but to the death of your soul, your mind, your emotional stability, or maybe someone around you's death. And then, just when you think you've escaped it, gotten away from Cemetery, and you are at your Elysian Fields, you will discover not what you thought would be there at all, not a heaven, not a pleasant resting place, but a set of dingy, dirty, run-down apartments, not heaven at all, but actually closer to hell itself. I believe that Williams found this in his own life, and this play was his specific way of conveying that message out to his readers.In my reading of Streetcar, I found myself waffling between having a preference for Stanley Kowalski and hating Blanche Dubois, and abhoring Stanley and feeling pity for Blanche. This reminded me that there is not always black and white, not always right and wrong, not always a good and an evil, plain and simple, in every situation. There are circumstances, there are things that change, and there are opinions in every fight. Judging too quickly may not always be the best thing, and you can never judge and be done, your opinion of a situation or even a person may be constantly changing.This play was a moral dilemma for everyone who I know who read it. It made me think, and it made me ponder some of the issues raised. I would recommend this as a good read, not for a feel-good read, but for a read that may make a person take stock of their own life, may make them think twice about the way they live, the way they treat others, or the way they act."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"A Street Car Nmed Desire is a weird play, that has a hidden theme. the play is about a lady named Blanche, who goes to live with her pregnant sister, Stella, and her husband, Stanley. To get to her sisters house Blanche takes two streetcars one named Desire and the other named Cemetary. The name of the house where her sister lives is Elysian Fields. Elysian Fields is the name of a Greek Heaven where the Greeks believe you went when you died.Stanley is a hard working man, he is a Master Sargeant in the Engineering Corps. He provides for Stella and Blanche, but he does not care much for Blanche because she is so demanding of Stella. Stella does things like draw baths, get her drinks and other stuff she asks for. Stanley does not like Blanche because he can not do anything with is wife when she is around. It also does not help that Blanche calls him names like Brute and Animal, and that Blanche is always trying to Stella to leave him.Stanley has a poker game, one night at his house. Blanche causes one of Stanley's friends, Mitch, to leave to take her out on a date. This makes Stanley very angry and inspires him to do some research about Blanche. Stanley finds out that at her previous residence Blanche slept with a lot of men and a 17 year old boy. Stanley lets Mitch know about Blanches past and he breaks up with her. Stanley is really happy that Blanche is devastated.However, Stella got very angry that Stanley exploited her sisters past to cause her grief. Just as they are about to have a large argument about this, Stella goes into labor. While she is at the hospital, Stanley and Blanche got into a big fight and Stanley rapes Blanche. This causes Blanche to go really crazy. A doctor takes Blanche to an insane asylum. Stella ends up staying with Stanley because she never finds out that he raped Blanche.Tennessee Willams is a man who uses his past experiences and feelings to create his plays. This play is pretty twisted. But you are seeing a genius at work. It is very hard to interpret his work the first time you see it. You need to read it numerous times to understand his plays and the numerous twists and turns the characters go through.I found myself loving certain characters at certain times and as the plot develops I started to dislike those characters. That is what Tennessee wanted you to do. His book goes on to tell you if you are obsessed with what you want, you will probably die before you get it and when you die you will go somewhere, hell or heaven. I do not know who you are or why you will die for your desire, but in my opinion, Tennessee's hidden plot is to get you to think about your motives before you run into your desires and end up somewhere you will regret.My conclusion to this play is that it is a good play that is worth reading or seeing more than once."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is a play that has stood the test of time.

Its meager 142 page spine is no indication of the complexity and significance that Williams achieves in his remarkable work. A strong aspect of the play is Williams's amazingly vivid portrayal of desperate and forsaken characters who symbolize and presumably resolve his battles between extremes. He created and immortal woman in the character of Blanche DuBois, the haggard and fragile southern beauty whose pathetic last grasp at happiness is cruelly destroyed. She represents fantasy for her many outrageous attempts to elude herself, and she likewise represents the Old South with only her manners and pretentions remaining after the foreclosure of her family's estate. The movie version of A Streetcar Named Desire shot Marlon Brando to fame as Stanley Kowalski, a sweat-shirted barbarian and crudely sensual brother-in-law who precipitated Blanche's tragedy. He symbolizes unrestrained desire with the recurring animal motif that follows him throughout the play. A third major character, Stella Kowalski, acts as mediator between her constantly conflicting husband and older sister. She magnifies the New South in her renounce of the Old pretentions by marrying a blue collar immigrant. Conflicts between these and other vividly colorful characters always in light of the cultural New Orleans backdrop provide a reader with a lasting impression and an awe for Williams's impeccable style and intense dialogue."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is another classic from my high school days that seems wasted on youth.

It is entirely centered on a woman who flees from Mississippi to New Orleans to live, for a while, with her married sister. The two sisters were born in the Southern aristocracy that got bankrupt by not being able, or even refusing, to get into the new flow of time. One went away and married a working class immigrant who is in many ways uncultured and rough, even violent at times. But desire is stronger than that violence and love survives a row from time to time, provided truthfulness and some sensual sincerity exist. But that is only the secondary theme to which Blanche, the other sister, is confronted and this brings back her real drama that is burried in her memory. She married very young. Her husband was also very young and a poet. But she discovered that he also was gay and she could not accept it due to her southern aristocratic principles. He was an abomination and she told him so one night and he went out and killed himself. She never overcame her guilt and she delved into a more and more dissolute life with any man that could come along, till she went back to a substitute of her dead husband, a 17 year old boy. The family protested and she was expelled from the school system (she was a teacher) and from the city. Confronted to the life of her sister and husband, she regresses into southern sophistication. She comes across a man, Mitch, who could and even would like to marry her. But her sister's husband, wanting to get rid of her, exposes her lies about her past to his friend Mitch and his wife. He destroys the dream and Blanche sinks into some psychotic nightmare that becomes a complete breakdown when her brother in law, on the very night when his son was born, rapes her. The end is a lesson about the savage and wild world in which we live and in which life must go on, or, as actors say, the show must go on. Her sister has to come to terms with this sad event, accept it or rather negate it not to be broken up by the event, and sister and husband have to get rid of Blanche. Only one solution : to have her institutionalized. The play is an extremely strong exposure of that simple fact that one has to follow the trend and change along with the world, no matter how hard it may be to adapt, to survive and remain balanced and sane in an insane and completely incomprehensible world. It also exposes that one is in a way one's own victim when one is not able to accept the world the way it is and imposes rules from the past onto it. This is probably the worst crime because it leads other people into suffering or even death, and you into guilt. So what is the desire that is at stake on such a play ? Sexual desire ? Maybe. Sentimental desire ? Maybe. But first of all the desire to survive by paying the price you have to pay for it. It thus becomes the exposure of a society in which feelings, sentiments, sexual impulses are nothing but secondary emotions and pleasures that can gratify your life if you are able to adapt to the world and survive in it. This world is inhumane, dehumanized, extremely savage. Men and women are like animals who can only aim at surviving or satisfying their animal impulses. Culture, civilization, principles, ethics, everything really human becomes a trauma in such a world. At the time of the play the only outcome could be the sacrifice of those who cannot adapt. Has it really changed ?Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Perpignan"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This is the play that became the movie that forever changed American film. And it's easy to see why: Streetcar is a gritty and at times depressing look at realism. The main point of the play is the battle between two worlds, the real world and the ideal one.We have the two main characters, Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski, foils of each other. Blanche wants to live in a la-la magical world of gentleman callers and fancy clothes, while Stanley wants to, uh, play poker and bed his wimpy wife. His world is harsh and he is definitely a cruel bastard, but his is the world in which we live in. Like my old high school history teacher taught me, you must make the distinction between what's real and what's only a dream. Blanche can't make that distinction, but doesn't realize it (not to mention has a dark life of her own), and in truth her destruction is caused in part by herself. We can all learn a lesson from this masterpiece: You have to stop living in Dream World before you are destroyed by the Real World."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams' play &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; came to Broadway in 1947, won the Pulitzer Prize for drama, and was made into an award-winning film. But you don't have to wait to see a stage or video version of the play. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is one of those theatrical triumphs which also succeeds in book form as a compelling read.Taking place in New Orleans, &quot;Streetcar&quot; tells the painful story of aging southern belle Blanche DuBois, her sister Stella, Stella's brutish husband Stanley, and the circle of people who frequent Stella's home. Williams creates an incisive examination of human sexuality and socioeconomic difference. His characters come to life with powerful dialogue; this play is a heartbreaking read.A compelling companion text for &quot;Streetcar&quot; would be Eugene O'Neill's classic play &quot;Anna Christie,&quot; which won the Pulitzer for the 1921-22 theater season. Like &quot;Streetcar,&quot; &quot;Anna&quot; deals with male expectations of female sexuality in a powerful way.Willams' Blanche is truly one of the most memorable female characters in United States literature. &quot;Streetcar&quot; is an unforgettable tapestry of desire, shame, and disturbing revelations. An essential text for anybody with an interest in 20th century drama."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams creates a strong sense of reality in A Streetcar Named Desire through the complexity of his characters; none emerge as truly good or truly bad, leaving only the contrast of strong and weak. For example, Blanche, the closest character to a heroine, literally falls apart through the course of the play, her weaknesses intensified by desire and exploited by Stanley. Although one may feel moved to pity Blanche, her collapse counters a basic character flaw of not being able to cope with reality, of preferring &quot;a moonlight swim at the old rock quarry&quot; to the dark house on Elysian Fields where all her problems dwell. Thus it is inevitable that Blanche should meet with tragedy. For some, it is also a just end: Blanche has led a life not deserving of much admiration, tempting young and sexually inexperienced boys, conducting notorious affairs (&quot;everybody else in the town of Laurel knows all about her&quot;), and at the same time still maintaining her pretensions and self-superiority. Equally complex and opposing Blanche on all fronts is Stanley, who represents the raw, survivalist animal Williams saw in people. The honest man Stanley, a poor Pole simply trying to make ends meet to support his wife and new family, senses the weakness and dependence in Blanche and recognizes it as a force completely in contrast with his own brute strength. Stanley scorns her frailties and simultaneously scorns her claims that she has been &quot;the strong one,&quot; upholding her duty to the family by caring for her dying relatives, whereas her sister Stella fled to New Orleans with her husband. The honest man Stanley, who beats his wife almost recreationally and brings about the final destruction of Blanche, represents, then, not a true villain, but an archetype: Stanley is the survivor, the top dog in a dog-eat-dog world, stopping at nothing to preserve his own interests. His tremendous strength both complements and counters his brutality as he maneuvers (to his liking) the streetcar named Desire, whose course, for all but the uncannily strong, ends in ultimate destruction. Lastly, one must consider Stella, somewhat of a foil to Blanche, and also the least clear-cut of the main characters. For the most part, the audience knows little of Stella; most of what one can say about her is deduced. She is the closest to virtuous out of the three; she accepts her duty first as wife, hoping that her duty as sister will not interfere. Until around scene eight, she always gives those she loves the benefit of the doubt. Thus a conflict exists within her, a conflict unlike that within Stanley and Blanche. Rather than the desire versus destruction dichotomy, Stella suffers from being torn between her husband and her sister. And there is such a thing as being too trusting. In the end, Stella makes her decision not so much based on her sense of morality or even ethics, but instead on the blind faith she instills in the person closest her. Stella's greatest fault lies in her inability to trust herself and in her complete willingness to submit to those forces greater than her without the slightest hint of a fight. The final image of the play, in fact, leaves Stella weeping in her brutal husband's arms, &quot;in [a] complete surrender to crying.&quot; Stella gives up. Her strength, though somewhat greater than Blanche's, fails her in Stanley's shadow, and certainly does not serve as a particular virtue. Rather, it keeps her going just long enough to thrust her little world into an inescapable mess. Had she been as weak as Blanche, the conflict between the doomed Blanche and the destructive Stanley would have been resolved much sooner, and with less incident. Had she been as strong as Stanley, the conflict may not have existed on such a level. Thus Stella represents a final human pattern: the regret for what might have been. Williams's characters simply reflect the different types of people he observed in what he believed was a grim life. In writing so much of these universal paradigms into his work, he lends to it a sense of reality unmatched by those seeking to portray the melodramatic conflict of good versus evil."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams utilizes sounds and music throughout A Streetcar Named Desire to change the mood, to foreshadow the future events, and to reveal the inner workings of the character's minds. The use of music, especially the use of polka music, dictates the mood of the play. The rushed, pounding polka inspires a sense of insanity in the reader, and even more so from a person watching the play. The reader can tell that Blanche is slowly going insane just because of the powerful polka music. The music even shows what could have been, such as when, in the beginning of scene nine, Mitch saves Blanche from the tortuous polka. This symbolizes that Mitch could have saved Blanche from her ultimate insanity. The other major music in the book is the &quot;Blue Piano.&quot; This music is often in the background when Stanley and Stella are acting like they are in love. This music almost seems to entice the two lovers into an even deeper state of loving each other. In the first scene, the &quot;Blue piano&quot; plays, and the married couple are flirting and having a good time with each other. This musical symbol is very powerful and important, enough so to be the subject of the final stage direction in the play. The play's &quot;happily ever after&quot; ending is characterized by &quot;the swelling of the 'blue piano' and the muted trumpet.&quot; Without this symbolism, Stanley and Stella's love for each other would not be as evident, and scenes like the end of scene three would be much more confusing if the music was not being played. These two major pieces of music serve as translators for the reader and film patron; the music foreshadows, interprets character's thoughts and emotions, and changes the mood of the play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Deception seems to be one of the most salient themes. As Goleman writes, \\"We are piloted in part by an ingenious capacity to deceive ourselves, whereby we sink in obliviousness rather than face threatening facts.\\"Blanche buries her devious past with a new start in New Orleans and skirts questions with a swift wit in conversation. She waters down the pains and frustrations of the past with concealed drinking and shrouds her aging face from gentleman callers in a soft light. She delusionally and openly believes that a fictional Texas oil magnate will arrive to whisk her away from yet another prison she finds herself in.Blanche maintains a very interesting relationship with Stanley, the bane of her existence in the French Quarter. While Stanley is ostensibly boorish and untamed, Blanche poorly masks these same latent characteristics in her own personality with a ladylike charm, frequent bathing, and heavy perfume. Her attacks on Stanley are actually projections, effectively assaults on the qualities she hates most about herself. Her outward disdain for her sister's husband is likely an aggressive reaction to what is better known as jealousy.What's more, this behavior runs in the family (another universal Williams theme). Stella convinces herself that an abusive relationship is fit to raise a child in. And at one point, the sisters recall their mother's refusal to accept her own mortality and her imploration to her young daughters to participate in this shared collusion.In the final scenes of the story, as Stella is giving birth to their son, Stanley finishes what he started, defeating Blanche completely in a territorial act of rape. When Blanche finally does choose to embrace honesty and come clean with Stella about the crime, her sister refuses to believe her and locks her away with the truth in an asylum, in step with what we'd expect from the DuBois family.The play was originally to be named \\"The Poker Night,\\" and like \\"The Glass Menagerie,\\" this image is an appropriate symbol to help unify the piece. As Williams writes it, poker, a game of deception, is not just played by the men in this play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I would like to stress that the reader from the US who stipulated in April of last year that this play was 'Dull... very dull', obviously has no serious interest whatsoever in modern literature, or indeed, quite possibly, serious literature of any kind. I am not arrogant, and I am more than happy to accept other people's opinions, but for them to say that they couldn't even specify three themes within the play is plain ridicuous. How can you study any kind of literature without being able to acknowledge the merits and even the structure of books that you don't like? I do not particulary care for Chaucer, but I can still see that it has some kind of literary basis. For you to dismiss one of the greatest &amp; most acclaimed works of this century as 'dull' is beyond belief. I can identify more than 3 themes wiithout even thinking about it too hard. What about Blanche's ongoing descent into madness, the way in which she has problems distinuishing between truth &amp; illusion, the way in which she consistently aggrovates Stanley &amp; his marriage, the class distinctions, the distinctions between culture &amp; so called 'neandertahlism', the distinctions between the old &amp; the new, for example, the old streetcar &amp; the new, more powerful locomotive, and, most notably, the theme of love? Blanche obviously needs security in the arms of a mutual love, and this is clearly portrayed throughout the whole novel. Perhaps you should take another read of the play so that you can make a more informed opinion. A Steetcar Named Desire is by no means 'dull', but one of the most interesting and enjoyable works from a great playwrite."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"Tennessee Williams' Pulitzer Prize winning masterpiece has been the source of controversy since it was written five decades ago. It is the story of the fallen Southern belle Blance Dubois, whose desperate illusions of grandeur are rent to shreds by her earthy and realistic brother-in-law, Stanley Kowalski. Touching on issues of prejudice, sexual codependence, mental breakdown, and rape, A Streetcar Named Desire is at times disturbing in its brutal honesty. Readings of this sultry play have found it to be anything from a critique of the conflict between the North and South in post Civil War America, to a subtle commentary on the struggles of Williams' life as a homosexual. The image of Stanley bellowing drunkenly to his wife Stella, as well as lines such as Blanche telling how she has \\"always depended on the kindness of strangers\\" have become so much a part of the American consciousness that they are recognizable even to those who are unfamiliar with Williams' work itself."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"This phenomenal american play called A Streetcar named desire be Tennessee Williams is an exquisite classic with a shocking plot and mysterious characters. There is a surprise and a twist around every corner in this wonderful piece of American literature. This masterpiece tells of a woman named Blanche who goes to visit her sister Stella and her new husband Stanley, who is a bit of a thug. Blanche struggles to remai sane, but finds it difficult because Stanley slowly causes her to lose her mind and slip into the realm of insanity. There is a shocking ending to the story, which unveils love, tragety, horror, and drama. This production also contains the classic quote of Stanley screaming, \\"STELLAH!!!\\" This line has been remembered all throughout American literature. I would deffinately give this play 5 stars and recomend it ages 13 and up due to thematic elements and slight horror. Although it is very old, life still burns withen this tale of love, despair, and, last but not least, desire."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"South and brought upon changes that broke up the mystique that the south had. For example you saw how New Orleans was becoming a city of many cultures instead of the domination by the Creole society and in the main character Blanche you started to see the death of the southern belle. Blanche seemed to be caught in the life of appearing to be the daughter of a rich southern aristocrat and when her family lost the plantation she grew up on, she began to lose her esteem, which was all she valued in life. The story really focuses on the characters and lets you see them for who they are and not from the perspective of the narrator (since there is not one in this play). Also the scenery does not is not very important in the play because it is all about the characters and how they interact with each other and their conversations.

Blanch immerses herself into a fantasy world with a \\"paper moon\\", not coming to terms with her diminishing looks.

Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did.

It is a play full of eye opening scenes. The Play is something that everyone can read if they are mature enough. If you are looking for a lesson or moral in the play then be prepared to search. At first the only lesson you may end up learning is life stinks according to this play, but you have to look deeper then the surface.I think Tennessee Williams main point in writing was to show his audiences that life doesn't always go your way. Something or someone could always come up to make your life harder. Maybe it is something from the past or your present but you never know what is going to happen until it happens. You can see this in the play when Blanches past comes to get the better of her, and when her future becomes unpleasant.From this play, I have personally learned to stay away from your desires because they will only lead you to the cemetery. The cemetery will only take you to Elysian Fields, which is the Greek word for a place like heaven. If you get on the Streetcar named Desire and follow the line until the end, your last stop will only mean death.Another lesson that I learned is not to judge anyone by their outer appearance. Instead, get to know who they really are on the inside. You never know, the most beautiful people could have the ugliest hearts. Take in example, Blanche. She looked elegant, beautiful on the outside but on the inside was an old, ugly, liar. Also Stanley, on the outside he was muscular, handsome, a military man, but on the inside he was a mean, over controlling, abusive caveman.In conclusion, this play was not, in my opinion, the best play to read. There has to be a certain maturity level to fully comprehend and understand this play. To anyone who feels up to a challenge and has a certain higher level of maturity, have at it!"},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I did not like A Streetcar Named Desire because threw out the entire play there was arguing and fighting. I did not like the ending either because nothing really got resolved. I believe that Tennessee Williams's main purpose in writing this play was to tell people not to judge people right away.The reason I believe this was his purpose for writing the play is because in the very beginning of the play I thought Blanche was a good person and Stanley was not. But after I found out that Blanche was lying about so many things I started to hate Blanche and side with Stanley. Then at the end of the play I hated both of them because Stanley raped Blanche and Blanch was mental and lied. Though I felt pity for Blanche it was no excuse for lying about her past and her future Stanley had an anger management problem which caused him to do some really bad things and Blanche wanted every thing her way and lied a lot.Another thing I believe was Tennessee Williams's purpose in writing the play was to show you how life was around him. In this play Stanley drinks, plays poker and rapes his wife's sister. Also Blanche is mental and lies a lot.One lesson I leaned from reading A Streetcar Named desire is that if you do not tell the truth you will get found out. Also not telling the truth may not only hurt you but other people's lives as well. Blanche lied a whole lot to everyone. She did not like the way her life was so she thought she would tell people what she thought ought to be true. Then finally everyone found out she was a liar. It not only hurt her but it hurt other people too.I also learned that you should not be afraid about what other people think of you. If someone loves you only because you are rich or look good then you should not be with him/her. I believe this because Mitch would have liked Blanche if she told him the truth about her age and her past and if she said she was sorry for what she did. She also should have said she would never do that again. I don't think Mitch really cared about how old she was either, and I don't think he liked Blanche always being in the dark.The last thing I learned is you should always tell the truth no matter if it is good or bad. It is easier to forgive someone if they told the truth then if they lied about it. Blanche told lies thinking it would get her out of trouble when actually it got her into worse trouble.I would not recommend this play to you because nothing in my opinion gets resolved in the end. I would recommend this play to you if you don't care about the ending. The reason I think this is because other wise it is a interesting play."},{"Title":"A Streetcar Named Desire (Turtleback School & Library Binding Edition)","review":"I need a quite long essay about Blanche's character;how she is at the beginning,how she got crazier by time(the forces acting on her and how she responds),and finally the defeat and spiritual death of her.(By using examples) Please Heeelllppp!

Actually, the English translation of the title is somewhat misleading. This work (which is a collection of essays) deals not only with methodological issues but broader questions of economic theory.Von Mises wrote in the rationalist tradition. According to him, the laws of economics (which are part of the more general laws of human action) are a priori. \\"Human action always confronts experience as a complex phenomenon that first must be analyzed by a theory before it can even be set in the context of the hypothesis that could be proved or disproved.\\" [p. 30.] Statistics therefore have a limited role in economics, and cannot prove (or disprove) any theory. As von Mises notes, it is not surprising that many of the great economists were also logicians.This work can be a bit tough to get through. Von Mises writing is clear as always, but some of the pieces deal with certain disputes of the day and contain discussions of thinkers who aren't widely studied today. For example, the names of Othmar Spann, Max Weber, Friedrich Wieser and Werner Sombart are discussed extensively. Fortunately, this edition (produced by the Ludwig von Mises Institute) contains an excellent introduction by Jorg Guido Hulsmann. Dr. George Reisman, author of CAPITALISM, translated the book into English in 1960."},{"Title":"Epistemological Problems of Economics","review":"This edition has a superb introduction by Guido Hulsmann, biographer of Mises, explaining the reason why Mises turned to epistemology and why he took it so seriously.Up to the 1930s it seemed that the Austrian insights were firmly embedded in the mainstream of neoclassical economics, although Wicksell sounded an alarm in correspondence with Marshall when he deplored the drift from Menger's ideas in successive editions of Marshall's \\"Principles of Economics\\". Then the calculation debate with the socialists in the 1920s, followed by the Keynesian diversion and the rise of positivism in the philosophy of science signalled that there were deep problems and issues in epistemology and methodology that called for further investigation and resolution.Hayek turned towards the function of dispersed knowledge in society and the \\"abuse of reason\\" project, while Mises revisited the major themes and thinkers after the marginal revolution to eliminate some errors from the legacy of Menger, Bohm Bawerk, Weber and others of less note. This book contains a series of papers, most written in the 1920s, on the key areas of value theory and epistemology.Later, when \\"Human Action\\" fell like a stone in the profession, he concluded that the decisive battleground for the future of economics lay in the basic principles and methods of the discipline. He wrote two more books to sustain his defence of subjectivism and the a priori approach, against historicism and positivism. These are \\"Theory and History (1957) and \\"The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science\\" (1962).While Mises was working in Europe, scholars on two other continents were moving along lines that converged with Misian praxeology. In the US Talcott Parsons under the influence of Marshall, Pareto, Durkheim and Weber developed the \\"action frame of reference\\" (\\"The Structure of Social Action\\", 1937) and Karl Popper in Australasia sketched \\"situational analysis\\" (\\"The Poverty of Historicism\\", which appeared as articles in 1943/44 and the book in 1957, also \\"The Open Society and its Enemies\\" 1945 ). That was not the ideal time for collaboration between German and English speaking people and the opportunity for a merging of forces was lost. After \\"The Structure\\" Parsons embarked on general systems theory, inspired by the model of classical mechanics and Popper, mostly engrossed with physics and biology, never engaged fully with the social sciences or the Austrian school, despite his friendship with Hayek.While Mises is conceivably the leading economist of the 20th century, his epistemological project has not helped to convince scholars in the mainstream of the strengths of the Austrian program. Maybe the program needs to be made more Austrian by injection of selected ideas from Karl Popper. This has the potential to deliver a nuanced version of methodological monism that does justice to the differences between the natural and the human sciences. The first step is to see how the quest for justified true beliefs (justificationism) has created insoluble problems and misplaced efforts to identify the sources or grounds of such beliefs and the methods required to reveal them. In brief, all attempt to conclusively justify universal propositions lead to an infinite regress.Methodological dualism is generally based on the assumption that the natural and biological sciences find and justify universal laws by some process (possibly induction), based on observations. In contast the human sciences find and justify their universal laws by some other process of reason or intellectualisation or apprehension of essential tendencies that influence what happens in human affairs without being capable of derivation from observations.The Popperian replies that the universal laws of the natural sciences (as we know them) are conjectures (more or less freely invented) that have stood up to tests, regardless of their origins which may well be in myths, superstitions and metaphysics. They are never justified (in the strong sense demanded by justificationists) and they are not tested directly but only by their capacity to account for observed events, in conjunction with ancillary hypothesis and statements of initial conditions. Quite likely the same applies to the universal laws of praxeology which can be used (and tested) to anticipate (or explain in historical retrospect) tendencies (pattern predictions) in the world. Of course the actual laws are quite different in different domains, as are the problems to be solved, the events explained and the observations and experiments that are employed. Explanations of events in the human sciences will need to take account of another kind of regularity in addition to the universal laws, these are the values, norms and \\"rules of the game\\", ranging from local customs to the laws of the land, including the written and unwritten rules of interpretation and application of more general principles.On this account the laws of praxeology do not need to be grounded in the \\"justificationist\\" sense, they need to be tested by their capacity to explain events, to provide insight and understanding of processes, to stand up to criticism, to point the way to deeper problems, to integrate different field of study and to generate fruitful research programs.

Maybe I just wanted to start from the beginning.It's a good thing that Jill had introduced me to some later Gould, because this, while genuinely entertaining, and definately intellectually stimulating, is a rougher mix. Gould has grown as a writer (and probably as a scientist) since originally starting his column.This isn't a book to try to read at one sitting (I think it's been at my bedside for the last year) because it is thick and meaty.

However, it does provide a great insight into the mind of one of the most vocal proponents of the study of evolution - the late Stephen J. Gould. The most interesting is Gould's discussion of the spread of misinformation about evolution in the media. Gould talks about being angry when Punctuated Equilibrium (Gould's hypothesis that evolution happens in quick spurts of dramatic change, followed by long periods of stasis, rather than the gradual change predicted by Darwin) was misrepresented in a newspaper article as the cause of the downfall of evolution. Gould's hypothesis was later abducted by religious fundamentalists who misquoted Gould's criticism of gradual evolution in an effort to tear down the whole of evolutionary biology and replace it with religious fundamentalism in public schools. Interestingly, Creationists and Intelligent Design proponents continue to misquote Gould to this day.I recommend this book to anyone who has seen Gould's quotes being used by religious fundamentalists to attack evolution, and wants to read Gould's own defense of evolution for him or herself."},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"Although I have not read any other of Gould's books, Ever Since Darwinhas succeeded in whetting my appetite for more of his works.This is a thought-provoking, fine piece of work.

These are organized into 8 sections which cover everything from the basics of Darwin's theory through applications of that theory to the evolution of humans, through the history of life on Earth and the view and role of science in society. All in all there are 33 essays included on a diversity of sub-topics involving the theory of evolution, though certainly some points are repeated as one would expect when dealing with individual essays on a related subject.Stephen Jay Gould's writing is easy to read, and these essays are targeted to people interested in science, but you don't have to be a scientist to understand them by any means. Gould also makes the reading more entertaining by including interesting bits of trivia, such as covering who was the naturalist aboard the Beagle, correcting many bits of misinformation regarding Darwin and his theory, and discussing why Darwin waited so long before publishing. Unlike many more recent books (this book was originally published in 1977), Gould avoids getting drawn into the name calling which goes on between creationists and Darwinists.Gould's enthusiasm for the subject comes through in his writing, and his passing in 2002 from cancer was a great loss to science, as well as to the public discussion of science to which he offered a thoughtful and insightful voice. That is not to say that Gould was never the focus of controversy, as he forced evolutionary biologists to rethink some of their ideas due to his ability to view things from a different angle. Some have claimed that his theories, such as punctuated equilibrium which he developed with Niles Eldredge, were never more than what was already contained in the theory of evolution, but I still see the echoes of his approach in many recent articles about evolution.I have heard some people claim that Gould later decided that \\"Ever Since Darwin\\" was his worst book, though I have never been able to verify this claim. It wouldn't surprise me if that were true, as many authors cringe when looking back on their earliest works. That being said, I think the essays in this book still offer a wonderful place for those who are interested in the subject to get a good understanding of the subject and the theory. Of course, given that it was published in 1977 there is so much more that has been discovered that this should not be the only resource that one uses, especially if you want to understand the current state of the theory."},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"An egregious loss, Stephen Jay Gould's passing at age 61 in 2002, because the man wrote about science in a compelling, easy to follow, highly engaging and educational manner.

Each of the 33 articles containts gems of insight and pleasing turns of phrases (p.14 - \\"...not unmindful...that yesterdays paper wraps todays garbage\\"), fun facts (p.28 - Darwin was NOT the official naturalist of the HMS Beagle), whimsical but useful anecdotes for living life lightly (p.49 - \\"life is too short to occupy oneself with the slaying of the slain more than once\\") and shedding concision on why human babies gestate more briefly than other mammals and then take many more years to develop into mature adults (p.75 - 'human brains are so large that gestation...barring some radical redesign of the female pelvis...birth must occur when the brain is only one-fourth its size'). This is science writing that every science teacher across the globe should embrace as the best teacher's aid short of having Gould, Darwin, Einstein, Newton or one of the other immortals pop up from the grave.

Without exaggeration, this book will change your worldview. The discussions are so profound and detailed, yet so readable and approachable, I can guarantee that you won't look at the natural world or humanity's role in it the same way after working through this collection. Gould touches on so many topics that I can't really do it justice in a short Amazon review, but I'll mention a few items that struck me as particularly compelling. First, this book is a good intro into the theory of evolution and natural selection. If you want to learn more about these two topics, I would recommend this book. One thing that emphasizes about natural selection that is commonly miscontrued by the public is that the evolution of species does not imply that the subsequent evolved generations are and better or superior, they only changed as a result of specific stimuli. If the stimuli were different, the population would have evolved differently. There is this notion that man in particular rests atop some pedestal as the 'ultimate' in evolution. This view is incorrect though, at least through the perspective of Darwinian evolution and natural selection. Second, Gould explains our relationship to the other primates and how we may have evolved. He also elaborates on this idea of a 'missing link', that is a direct fossil link between our pre-human primate ancestors and modern man. He states that our family tree is more of a bush, not a tree, with many branches. Evolution and natural selection generally only occurs in small sub-populations of larger, relatively stable populations that become isolated and undergo some stress. The fossil record comes from the large, stable population, we only learn about the population that has evolved once it become large (large enough for it to become probably that we would find fossils) and stable. Many of the evolutionary branches lead nowhere and we don't ever know they existed because they didn't become large enough to create a stable population. Third, Gould discusses the role that plate tectonics played in the development of life on Earth. The collision and separation of the continental land masses played a key role in bringing together and separating various species. Additionally, the expansion and contraction of the continental coastal zones (the continental shelves) where many species lives may have been responsible for the mass extinction event roughly 200 Myrs ago. This event dwarfs the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 Myrs ago based on numbers of species which became extinct. The final chapters of the book discuss race and IQ tests. In particular, Gould pans the late 18th/early 19th century notions that simple physiological features can be used to demonstrate that whites are superior to blacks. He also shows that the arguments used to demonstrate that IQ is largely racially based are totally fallacious. I don't think that all of Gould's conclusions are agreed upon in the paleontology/evolutionary biology community, but that shouldn't cause you to hesitate to buy this book and read it.The bottom line is that if you have any interest in evolution and want to learn more, buy this book (you'll want it as part of your collection) and read it. There is so much information packed in this thin book, but it is so well written and readable that anyone can go through this book and enjoy it. You don't need to have a Ph.D. in evolutionary biology to appreciate this book, only a desire to learn more about the natural world. I would give this 6 stars if I could - outstanding and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"I read this book while traveling around the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador where Darwin made his collections to support On the Origin of Species.

How better to teach writing than to use the masterful essays of an accomplished prose stylist who is respected in both among scientists and educated general readers? After all, Gould's books were best sellers when published. My sons read them as high school students.I am concerned about the poor quality of science teaching in the United States. I also recognize that there is scientific and mathematical intelligence and there is literary intelligence. While high school English departments are mistakenly abandoning the teaching of fiction, replacing it with essays, perhaps, at the college level, essays written by a scientist are appropriate.Gould's book, his first to be presented as a separate volume, is challenging reading. However, it provides an over view of both Darwin's findings and the history of the hornet nest he stirred. I feel this book is valuable as a source to help readers wade through the challenge of ID proponents.Unfortunately, those who selected the book found it too challenging.*Others included Nineteen Eighty-Four; Brave New World; the Ramona Quimby novels of Beverly Cleary; Twelfth Night; the short stories of Eudora Welty; The Narrative of Frederick A.

Some of his favorite subjects are the purposeless, non-progressive nature of evolution (and why we like to deny this fact), the unconscious reflection of social and political ideas in scientific theories, the explanatory power of Darwin's theory, and the peculiar details of the history of science (for example, why Darwin was NOT the naturalist on board of the H.M.S. Beagle). Gould's essays are always full of surprising details, telling anecdotes and witty asides. He would have made an excellent Enlightenment philosopher because he reminds his readers again and again that reason and the scientific method are powerful instruments - if one is aware of their limitations (for example, the &quot;anthropocentric bias&quot;, the belief in human &quot;specialness&quot;). Throughout, Gould highlights the human side of science, and the human creativity involved. For him, science is not a &quot;mechanical collection of facts and induction of theories, but a complex process involving intuition, bias, and insight from other fields&quot;. Gould has a gentle humor, and an infectious enthusiasm; he likes to play with words (one essay is titled &quot;Is the Cambrian Explosion a Sigmoid Fraud?&quot;), asks interesting questions, never shys away from the odd detail, and takes particular pleasure in theories that contradict common sense. Reading Gould, I get the feeling that his way of arguing could well have been the way Socrates once talked to anyone you cared to listen: ask before you accept anything as &quot;fact&quot;, and be aware of your limits. Or to put it in Gould's words: &quot;I will rejoice in the multifariousness of nature and leave the chimera of certainty to politicians and preachers&quot;."},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"This was a wonderful reading experience. Dr. Gould is a truely gifted writer with a wonderful wit and colorful style. He has a broad range of interests and knowledge and an interesting circle of friends and collegues upon whose wisdom he also draws (Astronomer Sagan, Geologists Press and Siever, were among those with whose work I was familiar). He also manages to approach &quot;accepted&quot; theories from unusual directions, sometimes with novel and provokative results! The collection of essays includes an interesting work on the effects of the personality of the Captain of the Beagle on the formulation of Darwin's theories; a subject that had certainly never occurred to me. There is also an interesting discussion of the human baby as an unfinished embryo, with interesting implications for the upper limit on brain size and for human evolution as a whole. The effect of size on intellectual potential of the brains of different species, for instance ants vs humans, is the topic under discussion in the Sizing up of Human Intelligence. The interaction of planetary size and surface area and the concommitant implications for development of life is the subject of another article. The effect of social millieu on the development and acceptance of scientific theories is also discussed as is the hindsight criticism of &quot;wrong&quot; theories and their proponents. Probably most interesting, and certainly most urgently in need of repetition even now, is the tendency to use scientific &quot;fact&quot; or verbal slight of hand to support social status quo or even abuse by those with a political agenda. Many of the essays could be well used in high school classes to teach and encourage critical thinking and novel approaches to what is commonly held as &quot;fact.&quot; I would not just recommend the book to you, I would encourage you to read it cover to cover!"},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"This book offers a dazzling tour of Darwiniana, often as straight history but always in the form of essays for (Natural History Magazine) that are digestible in one sitting.

I have studied his writing style for years: it is elegant, spare yet sensual, and continually reformulates ideas is new ways, that is, rarely repetitive. Unlike his later essays, which covered quirkier details in increasingly lugubrious attempts to get at the broader notions he cherished, these essays are fresh and light, in my view amoung the best of the entire series.As an introducer of popular notions and as a scientist, I believe that Gould will be remembered as a genius.

Not to mention the history of the conflicts between religious beliefs and the evolutionary theory, many people today still have trouble accepting it, no matter how all the evidences appear to favor the theory.Ever Since Darwin by Stephen Jay Gould, however, is not a mere collection of praise songs for the triumph of science. In his essays, Darwinian interpretations of evolutionary biology are illuminated in light of the (enjoyable, at least for us) struggles of those thinkers of conflicting theories. Through citing rich evidences in the history of evolutionary biology, Gould emphasizes the inevitability of having human bias in scientific process.This is a kind of book that I strongly recommend to students who tend to develop a misconception that science exists only to make their academic experience at school painful. Textbooks do not teach science as much as Gould's essays do. Why?Science often tends to be seen as the culmination of the infallible facts and evidences deriving from perfectly logical thinking by a few great minds. Gould provides numerous examples to show this is not really the case. In fact, you learn that scientists, who are supposed to thrive for objectivity, suffer quite often from their own agenda and intellectual bias. It is as much a creative, human activity as art and literature, and Gould's excellent essays illuminate that endeavor, not just the bits of accepted facts to regurgitate. All this is done via the discussions of various interesting topics from a baby fly eating its own mother to the dubious attempts to link biological findings to justify racial inequality.The only thing I fear about this great work is that it will inevitably be dated, having written during 1970s. Nevertheless, the essence of Gould's writing should not be tarnished by newer discoveries. After all, Gould's point is to illuminate science as a dynamic activity."},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"All of Stephen Jay Gould's admirable traits as a splendid scientist, fine historian of science and gifted writer are prominently on display in this elegant collection of essays; the first of many he published from his celebrated essay column &quot;This View Of Life&quot;, which was published for over twenty five years in Natural History, the popular journal of the American Museum of Natural History. Gould brilliantly illustrates the explanatory power of Darwin's theory of evolution via natural selection, discusses some of the most fascinating discoveries from a fresh, more mathematically rigorous, approach to paleontology to which he, himself, contributed, and ruminates on the sociology of science in one exceptional essay after another. He does this in engaging, often lyrical, prose, in which he draws analogies from literature, film and baseball to make his cogent points.

It clearly discusses a lot of evolutionary topics. I loved this book, as well his numerous other collections of essays(By the way, I have read some reviews calling Gould a betrayer of Darwin, which is downright silly, considering that theories evolve over time. Other people have saud he gets out of controversy by labelling himself a Darwin devotee, which is equally silly, considering his numerous departures from central Darwinian theory in later works, and a complete restructuring of the characteristics of evolution purported by Darwin.)"},{"Title":"Ever Since Darwin: Reflections in Natural History","review":"When it comes to popular writings on Evolution, the two names I most often hear are Dawkins and Gould.

Overall the essays vary in quality but for the most part they're good, although some are a little dated (which happens with any science books published 35-40 years ago). My favorite ones were the first section over Darwin and a section which looks at odd organisms. In this later section, you get some interesting essays such as one over the Irish Elk and my favorite essay about the lampsilis mussel, which makes itself look like a swimming fish in order to get attacked by larger fish, then it shoots spores into the larger fish.

It is easily accessible for the general reader and covers a range of topics related to Darwin's big idea. Interesting topics include:- The history of Charles Darwin's life while developing his theory (however, not a lot of details about the findings that made him question creationism).- The theory of human neoteny (humans retain juvenile ape features into adulthood and evolved by slowing down ontogenic development).- Human infants as embryos. Other mammals are at a level of development when they are born that human infants don't reach until 6-12 months after birth.- The history of geologic theories and the vindication of plate tectonics.- An argument that preformation (the outmoded theory that zygotes were tiny fully formed humans that developed in utero by simply growing larger) was a reasonable scientific theory at the time when it was popular based on what was known then.- A refutation of the simplistic view of science as objective data collection and theorizing based strictly on the facts. Scientists work within a theoretical framework and are inevitably biased by prevailing social and political attitudes.- A discussion of genetic determinism vs. potentialityI am generally averse to books that are made up of a series of independent short articles because they typically fail to reach great depths or reveal great revelations on any one topic, and instead tend to skim the surface of many assorted subjects. This book is no exception to that rule. In addition, it's been over 30 years since it was written and it makes me wonder what new information and theories are necessarily omitted as a result. On the other hand, there is a fair amount of material about the history of scientific theories that is certainly not in danger of becoming obsolete.There is a little repetition of material between chapters since they were originally written to be read independently, but it is not terribly bothersome. Since I've already read almost all of Richard Dawkins' books, some sections discussed material I was already pretty familiar with. I guess that is inevitable since the information is not newly discovered, this book is written for a general audience, and I've already read quite a bit on the subject of evolution.This is my first Stephen Jay Gould book, so I can't say how it compares to his others."},{"Title":"Egyptian Hieroglyphic Grammar: With Vocabularies, Exercises, Chrestomathy (A First-Reader, Sign-List&Glossary;)","review":"As an Egyptologist I add to my library regularly and I am always looking for a good hieroglyph workbook to improve my translation skills. This one is based upon extracts from Wallis Budge's work and was actually assembled in 1927. Since that time the approach in transliterating and translating hieroglyphs has evolved considerably and I would not recommend this publication for anyone especially a beginner since they will be sent off on the wrong track from the very beginning. Budge's work was seminal to be sure but is now very dated. An alternate excellent publication would be &quot;How to read Egyptian Hieroglyphics&quot; by Mark Colier augmented with other publications to enlarge the sign resources. Collier's book will set you to translating immediately in the style now taught."},{"Title":"Egyptian Hieroglyphic Grammar: With Vocabularies, Exercises, Chrestomathy (A First-Reader, Sign-List&Glossary;)","review":"There is no other source I know of that has so many glyphs PLUS THEIR MEANING. I have used this and the other volume that goes with it for myriads of translation problems."},{"Title":"Egyptian Hieroglyphic Grammar: With Vocabularies, Exercises, Chrestomathy (A First-Reader, Sign-List&Glossary;)","review":"I gathered from the book's description that this might finally be the one to offer easy lessons for learning hieroglyphics quickly-- such a thing is impossible, but I don't stop looking. It is a good book for easy reference for the major signs and their meanings, though it is far from complete. The lessons, in my opinion, are not good, and other sources must often be used to translate the exercises at the end of each lesson. The basic pronunciation key in front is not only inacurate so far as naming the objects depicted in the hieroglyphs, but Mercer seems to expect the reader to learn Hebrew and Arabic in order to properly pronounce them. (I also disagree with his writing of hieroglyphs in shorthand, but that's beside the point.) On the up side, there are some nice brain-busting exercises at the end of the book where the reader must decipher actual Egyptian texts, though I don't see how one could using only this book's instruction. It's value is not lost, though, as it does make a handy and convenient guide (184 pgs) for the more experienced student."},{"Title":"Egyptian Hieroglyphic Grammar: With Vocabularies, Exercises, Chrestomathy (A First-Reader, Sign-List&Glossary;)","review":"Be aware that this text is exactly what its title says it is: a grammar. The text is terse and to the point - out of the book's 184 pages, only the first 86 actually contain English text. The rest are the selection of Egyptian readings (or \\"Chrestomathy\\" as he calls it) and the sign list.Furthermore, the copies printed by Ares are exact duplicates of the original edition (1926, London). When this was written, it was still a fairly safe assumption that anyone reading it had already studied Latin and probably Greek. As a result, you will find this rough going if you're not already familiar with grammatical terms. I had some Latin and Anglo-Saxon before I was assigned this book as an introductory text. Most of my classmates did not have that background. I learned a good deal from this book; they, mostly, did not.In short, if you don't know what a \\"dual pronoun\\" is, you need a newer, friendlier book. I have some recommendations.For a comprehensive introductory textbook aimed at those with a serious interest in mastering Middle Egyptian, try \\"Middle Egyptian: an introduction to the language and culture of hieroglyphs\\" by James P. Allen. If your interest is more casual, you may find \\"How To Read Egyptian Hieroglyphs\\" by Mark Collier and Bill Manley helpful. Both base their examples on texts found in museum pieces.Alan Gardiner's \\"Egyptian Grammar\\" is still fairly comprehensive, but decidedly dated. Avoid anything by E.A.W. Budge - he published prolifically, but also sloppily. There are a great many errors in Budge's work, which will cause you no end of headaches if you try and use his texts as study guides.Lastly, for a good dictionary try \\"A Concise Dictionary of Middle English\\" by Raymond Faulkner. Note that this book is handwritten lecture notes in published form, so it can be hard to read. The English index was published as a separate volume, the \\"English-Egyptian index of Faulkner's Concise dictionary of Middle Egyptian\\" by David Shennum. These two are expensive; refer to them at a library if you can."},{"Title":"Egyptian Hieroglyphic Grammar: With Vocabularies, Exercises, Chrestomathy (A First-Reader, Sign-List&Glossary;)","review":"This is a very good book with a lot of excercises in it.

It is my favorite fashion reference book and I would find it a deal at $65. It is divided into 7 different catagories (ie. The Founders, The Purists, The Entertainers etc.) and covers 61 designers from Worth to Armani. It is full of wonderful B&amp;W and color photographs of models and movie stars wearing designer masterpieces.I would like to see the updated version- does it cover other designers like Mizrahi,Sander,Versace etc. That would be a welcome addition. I will enjoy my book regardless... Have fun reading the bios and looking at the beautiful clothes!!"},{"Title":"Couture : The Great Designers","review":"I found this in the library. Totally great. It has the most beautiful fashion photography. I stood there for about half an hour just flipping through. It was written in 1985 so the 'modern' part has a bit of a retro feel, but that definitely works in the context. Some very gorgeous pictures from the thirties, fifties, etc.I will try to get my hands on this definitely! A coffee table book that I would definitely read (over&over;) :)"},{"Title":"Couture : The Great Designers","review":"Well-written review of the 20th century's great designers, discussing the evolution of style.

I work in the field of biology and bioinformatics, but have spent the last 8 years working as a web and database Internet developer. And, I own practically every O'Reilly Perl book ever published (not that I necessarily think they're all worth buying). So, now that you know where I'm coming from...If you are preparing to do a serious amount of XML development, and you're in the process of determining a) which Perl XML modules on CPAN you want to use, and b) how to use them; and, you don't have a whole lot of time to spend tracking down the sometimes-hard-to-find documentation on these modules; then buying this book is a no-brainer. It covers all the major XML modules, how to use then and really helps you figure out when to use the different modules.Even if you're not new to XML and Perl, this book would serve as an excellent refresher course on what XML tools are available out there for you... Maybe you haven't looked at your code in awhile, or want to update it to use a newer module from CPAN? Or, maybe you're looking for a better way to do it? Then, this book would definitely help you out.While a fan of O'Reilly books in general, I'll be the first to admit some of them are more useful than others. I have to give this book a very solid rating, as it's actually useful, comprehensive and very well presented. I find myself cracking it open all the time, especially as my utilization of XML has grown more complicated. It has definitely earned its place in my Aqua Perl book collection."},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"I liked the way this book was structured - it was a quick read over a thanksgiving family visit, and it gave a good overview of what XML is and what XML isn't, and what tools are available already in Perl to use it. I particularly liked the middle of the book, and how it dealt with trees and event streams. First there was in short intro chapter on why you'd want to parse XML as an event stream, and some simple modules that give back event streams. Then the next chapter would be a longer one on SAX - the definitive way to do event streams. Same thing with trees and DOM. It ends with some examples of real-life XML processing, such as consuming and producing RSS feeds. The book also has the best description of Unicode I've ever read, and did it with just a few pages.What ticked me off about this book were the egregious errors in the sampe code. The very first piece of code they show in chapter 3 is a 100-line XML parser that doesn't need any support modules. The problem is that it doesn't recognize any XML because the regular expressions are wrong, which was pretty confusing for me (I'm relatively new to Perl, so I figured they were just \\"another way of doing it\\" that I didn't understand). I downloaded the examples frm the O'Reily website, and they're wrong there too - so it's not just a printing error. Worse, the example XML file I tried to test the parser on was also from the tarfile I downloaded - but it was invalid XML! (example 3.4). So I was trying to learn XML with a sample parser that didn't work, on invalid XML! This is not the quality I am expecting from O'Reilly!(In fairness, both of these errors were in the online errata, but I'm not sure if they were corrected in the 7/04 reprint)There are other errors in the code too - so be sure and check back with the errata page if you're going to seriously use the code. If they'd run their sample code before printing, I'd probably give this book a better rating."},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"I have wanted to learn about XML, but I found the pure XML books dry and too theoretical. However, putting XML in the context of something familiar, i.e. Perl, made it much more accessible. This book gives a nice overview of XML parsing using event based and tree based parsers that are available as Perl modules. The book presents SAX and DOM standards compliant modules as well as modules with more Perlish interfaces, e.g. XML::Grove and XML::Twig. It discusses the pros and cons of event vs. tree parsing of XML as well as a few advanced technologies such as database integration and SOAP. The only knock I have on the book is that the examples are a bit contrived and do not show how to solve meaningful problems."},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"XML has begun to appear everywhere. XML has long served in hidden roles on servers and in configuration files. Microsoft Word 2003 for Windows now supports reading and writing XML to in it's wordprocessingML format. Unlike MS Word's horrible \\"Save As Web Page\\" feature, wordprocessingML, or wordML for short, is a clean usable format. The adoption of XML in a user space as common as MS Word in an accessible format means that developers have a rich opportunity in XML.The book Perl and XML focuses on the where Perl and XML meet. In asking the questions \\"Why Perl?\\", the authors Erik Ray and Jason McIntosh point to Perl's ability to handle text, strings, and regular expressions. The authors also point out in a clear and concise manner the strengths of XML as a means for structuring data.The book focuses on working with XML using Perl. Tutorials of the basics of either language are best found in another book. The author of the book recommends Learning Perl for those people starting out in Perl. The book does not assume much knowledge of XML, so it's really an XML book for Perl programmers. If you'd like a more in depth discussion of XML, you might check out Erik Ray's Learning XML.Surveying many conventional XML tools and applications, the book addresses big picture items such as tree processing and streams as well as specific items such as RSS and SOAP. Approaching XML from both a practical point of view and strategic point of view, the author provides detailed examples and observes which strategies work well for handling XML in Perl.Originally, I picked up Perl and XML to address a couple of small projects where I had to deal with XML. The examples in Perl and XML were well written and provided the information I needed to try out common Perl tools for handling XML. Unfortunately, I found that XML processing in Perl was unacceptably slow for the two projects I had at hand. In a short amount of time, I hacked together a faster solution without relying on an XML parser. That said, I gleaned a great deal from Perl and XML which I imagine I will be putting to use soon.If you're not currently working with XML, you may find yourself working sooner than you think. I couldn't more highly recommend Perl and XML for thorough treatment of the subject even if you end up hacking your own solution."},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"This is the sort of book that put O'Reilly on the map. Concise, practical, step-by-step, the kind of book that allows you to get significant amounts of actual work done by the time you finish the third chapter or so. The introduction to XML in chapter two is one of the best I've ever seen, and I've often recommended it for people as an XML Executive Summary, even those who will never write a line of Perl.Like that late 2006 early 2007 meme says: \\"It does just what it says on the tin.\\""},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"I read the first review of this book, and I think it's great. In addition, however, I feel compelled to let people know what they are missing.Specifically, for those of us that do not have a connection to the internet and/or cannot readily download software onto their pc's, this book is only a primer for what resources you will need with XML. I have yet to find a resource that will provide me with a summary of all of the perl modules and library files that are needed by the individual modules mentioned within this book.For instance, the book provides an example on how to use XML::LibXML and XML::LibXSLT. Unfortunately, the book does not let you know that XML::LibXSLT can only be used if you have XML::LibXML. And the requirements for XML::LibXML include downloading and installing a Gnome library - which may give you trouble on a windows platform. I realize this gripe may be a bit environment specific, but with so many Windows users out there along with an inability to just download anything off CPAN and/or Gnome, I know that I will still have quite a bit of trouble getting the book's examples to 'work'.Although this book does provide examples for every module covered, it typically only provides a single example. So those of you who are hacker/leaners may be disappointed to find that not many examples are presented for cannabalization."},{"Title":"Perl and XML","review":"I have found this book very helpful with my Perl coding. At work, we have been using more and more XML. This book provided excellent examples and explanations of the pros and cons of the various methods.

There are absolutely no useful code examples in the book. Yes, as an experienced engineer, I can substitute my own code where the book prints to the screen or searches for monkeys, but hey, I paid for my ticket, sometimes I'd like to be told exactly what to do.

The behavior of the needle gave a deep and lasting impression on young Einstein. Then the author describes ten facts about the magnetic force in earlier chapters. Using these facts, he gives detailed explanations on the workings of various magnetic devices and the modern technologies of magnets in plain words. The topics covered includes superconducting magnets, magnets in motors, speakers, TVs, toys, fiction, magic and weapons, magnetic recording, magnets in medicine, biomagnetism, and so on, namely everything about magnets. The book is also interspersed with humorous comments. In the last chapter the author goes back again to young Einstein's wondering at a compass needle. The reader notices here that the title of the book has the triple meaning. This is one of the most educational and well written books I have ever read in the genre of science for laypersons."},{"Title":"Driving Force: The Natural Magic of Magnets","review":"This is the best book I have ever read on the subject of magnets and magnetism. It is very up to date and includes current technology of magnets and many applications that most people take for granted. Also, the manner in which this book is written makes it suitable for a wide range of age groups. For the most part it is not real technical or mathematical and can be enjoyed by all. If you have an ounce of curiosity about magnets, magnetism or science you will love this book. I am on my third reading and it won't be my last.One of the most interesting chapters in this book explained the connection between magnets and Einstein's theory of relativity. This is explained very simply and easy to understand and even has a one page cartoon to illustrate this.Also explains dozens of applications of magnets in our lives, our homes, our cars, our hospitals, our defense systems etc. I thought I was pretty aware of most applications of magnets and magetism but this book was a real and amazing eye opener.Read it and enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Driving Force: The Natural Magic of Magnets","review":"Did you know that Einstein got his start in science from a fascination with the compass? Did you know that Columbus' magnetic compass was his most prized possession on his transatlantic voyages?

Did you know that the geographic north pole of the earth is actually a magnetic south pole? Did you know that the most celebrated innovation presented at the Paris Exposition of 1900 was a crude magnetic recording device utilizing a steel wire as the recording medium? Did you know that the black ink used in printing US currency is faintly attracted to strong magnets? Did you know that magnetic rocks hold the key to charting continetal drift? Did you know that water possesses a property that causes it to repel a strong magnetic field with enough force to levitate a live frog?James Livingston's book is loaded with fascinating bits of information about a technology that pervades virtually all of modern technology. In fact, modern life as we know it would come to a screeching halt if not for the weird properties of magnets.Written in a lively, non-technical style, Driving Force covers the history, tremendous range of technical uses, and the fun, entertaining side of magnets. This highly readable book will not enable you to design motors, MRIs, or maglev trains, but it might just make you better on trivia tests, lead to a great science fair project, or help you educate or entertain the children in your life.

So in addition to academic credentials, the author has lived the life he describes so well in this book.While this is not a travelogue for those wishing a tour of Amish Country, it would be a very good thing to read before you go to Lancaster, PA or any of the other Amish-settled areas in the US and Canada. Dr. Hostetler describes attitudes to &quot;the English World&quot;, the religious and daily life, and how the Amish merge with their secular neighbors.The book also describes a bit of the struggle the Amish faced in the 60's when they sought permission to have their own schools and end formal educatiion for their children at grade 8. While he says little about it, Hostetler's own life must have been affected by this attitude to what is required in education; he left the community to become a university professor, and subsequently lived with the Hutterites, another religious society in Canada and Europe.This is an enjoyable and realistic book with no sentimentality or gloss. If you want to know more about the Amish, this is definitely the book to read."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I purchased the book Amish Society at Lapp's farm in Lancaster County. A book that even the Amish feel is good enough to sell themselves -- worked for me. I didn't read it until I got home from Lancaster Co., PA but it certainly explained a lot of things to me like why I saw cars in the yards of some of the Amish homes, why I saw Amish teenage boys smoking cigarettes, and how Amish sects differ.As a grand-daughter of a related sect of plain people, The Hutterities, it was interesting to see how the Amish were similar to the Hutterites and how they differ. In a way it seemed like voyeurism to discover what the private lives of these very private people are like.This is highly recommended anyone visiting the Amish or wanting ot learn more about them."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"This is a superb, comprehensive book covering most facets of interest in Amish life. Concentrating on the Old Order Amish, it also provides history and perspective on most of the major Amish schisms, touches on the Mennonites by way of their relationships to the Amish, and gives a good overview of Anabaptist history to boot.The text is very readable and organized by topic. A first time reader would do well to read cover-to-cover, but it can be browsed by chapter once the major terminology and concepts have been learned.Hostetler grew up Amish. The book is a sociological study, written sympathetically. It would be a slight distortion to say it was written from the Amish point of view, but it does succeed in conveying that point of view. It does so accurately with sufficient examples and documentation to be conclusive.Not a coffee table book, not a picture book, this is a readable reference work that you will use again. Quoted and used by many others writing about the Amish, the author is a highly respected authority on the subject."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"Clearly one of the leading authorities on the Amish, Hostetler's book is a well-researched and well-written look at a group of people struggling to maintain their traditional ways in our modern society. This is an excellent introduction to the Amish."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I have many books on the Amish, but this volume is the keystone of the collection. Nothing will advance your understanding of the Amish more than reading this book - nothing. Written by a college professor born into an Old-Order Amish community (the most conservative), the author doesn't just describe the Amish and how they live, but explains why they live as they do and how they think and make decisions about modern life and technology. Along the way he destroys the notion that the Amish are rooted in the past. In fact, they are firmly in the here and now - but deliberately disconnected from the non-Amish world. They use power, motors, machinery, electronics and computers, modern transportation, and more, but in ways that ensure separation.Amish Society gives perspective on how the Amish developed from their Anabaptist roots and where they fit in the modern Anabaptist spectrum. He describes how individuals and families move from one \\"level\\" to another and why. The fine distinctions among Amish communities are fascinating. The author gives an example, using Mifflin County, PA, showing 13 levels of Amish and Anabaptist \\"committment\\" (for lack of a better word). Starting at the center with the Old Order Amish, it proceeds to Old School, Byler Church, Peachey Amish, New Amish, Beachy Amish, Beth-El Mennonite, Holdeman Mennonite, Allensville Mennonite, Locust Grove Mennonite, Bretheren in Christ, Maple Grove Mennonite, and finally Protestant. All are instantly distinguishable to an Amish person by things as subtle as the width of a hat brim.The most unfamiliar content for anyone not familiar with Amish life will be on religious ceremony and practice. Topics such as meetings, hymn singing (absolutely unique), sermons, choosing clergy, weddings, funeral practices, and so on are described in detail you won't find anywhere else.On the personal end, the author describes the kinds of things that an Amish person thinks about, worries about, gives comfort or threatens, and how they view the outside world. In fact, this book is as much a look at the Amish from within as it is an examination of them from without.Again, the best single volume on the Amish by a long shot. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"Growing up near some scattered Amish church districts in Northwestern Pennsylvania and Western New York, I have always been interested in learning more about the Amish going way back to my childhood. Hostetler's book is my first attempt at this and I managed to pick a very good starting point.I disagree with some reviewers about this being a good book to read before a visit to Amish country--its too in-depth and scholarly, I believe, for an average traveler with perhaps only a passing interest in the culture.For someone else, like myself, who wants to learn much more, this book is excellent. Mine was a fourth edition (1993) and the book, with all its revisions, seems just a tad dated at times but this does not detract from the effectiveness of the discussion. Further, it has heightened my interest to learn more, and I will not pass an Amish buggy or household (a monthly occurance) without applying what I learned in this book!"},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"This book is so informative, but at some points it is slow moving. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are divided so you can skip chapters you don't think you would be interested in. It is a great book to buy if you are interested or wanting to learn more about the amish community. It covers everything from funerals to marriage. A great read!"},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"This was the most informative book on the Amish lifestyle that I have found. The author opens up the life of the amish to his readers. It is easy to understand. He takes you through the history, culture and beliefs. I have a deeper respect for the amish and understanding of their customs since purchasing this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who would like a look into a different way of life. This book opened my eyes and my heart to respecting the amish lifestyle and their privacy."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"After reading Brad Igou's \\"The Amish: In Their Own Words\\" I then came to this book by Hostettler - and am glad I did. This book \\"fills in\\" the portrait of the Amish by providing a very clear, readable, though factual history of the Amish \\"progression\\", if you will. With the Amish existence being much more fragmented than many people think as they lump them all under the term \\"Amish\\", this book really brings about an enlightened understanding of the range of the sects and their relation to each other and \\"the outside World\\" over the course of their development. It also offers the reader a very gracious, very real portrayal of the Amish that, thankfully, dispels many of the traditional misconceptions about these kind and earnest people."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I have studied Amish culture and mores for some time out of both interest, admiration, and other motivations. And nowhere have I found a better resource than this book. That the author was himself raised Amish only lends to the credible nature of this book. But more importantly is the concise and thorough manner in which this book presents its truths and dispells rumors and myths. It served to take many of many of the half truths that I had known of the amish and complete them as no other resource has yet done. I heartily recommend this book. And it was a rather easy read, not bogged down by language. I finished it in a few days."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"For such a long book, it was a decent read. I little boring sometimes, but did provide a wealth of knowledge and history to someone when needing it. I got an A+ on my research paper and have suggested the read to others."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"Mr.Hosteler has written one of the best informative books on the Amish.I have read this sevral years ago as a young teen and have now re-pershased it and am greatful to have it back on my shelves."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"It's a good book, but any adjective stronger than that would overstate it. The first chapter is nothing but sociological bombast that does not advance the reader's understanding of Amish society. The book improves after that, but Hostetler relapses into sociological jargon every several pages."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I'm interested in the Amish and had to get this book as it was supposed to be \\"the\\" definitive nonfiction book about their way of life. I have absolutely no doubt that if I were reviewing it in 1993 when it was first published, that I would be giving it a 5-star review. However, the last 18 years have made a big difference in the Amish way of life, especially in the Lancaster settlement. There's a lot more dependency on tourism and the outside world for income and less involvement in farming. I hope it will be updated in a new edition that focuses more on the impact these changes are having on the Amish. This is, however, still a worthwhile book to those interested in the Amish."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I'm not Amish, nor do I know anyone Amish, but I like reading about other people and they've sparked my curiosity! I've read other books on the Amish but this one is by far the most interesting and well written of all of them so far! Once you start reading it, it's hard to put it down. They take you into the Amish life and you learn so many things about their way of life. There are many pictures! This book is well worth buying!"},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"A very interesting and informative look into the history of the Amish religion. Their trials and tribulations to acheive the simple life. The way they were treated in their native country and the way that they were accepted here in America. Their fight to keep what they believe in as a way of life is awe inspiring. The way they have been treated and they can still be non- conformist and non- violent is a tribute to their religious upbringing. A very good read and an eye opener to these \\"plain people\\"."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I purchased this book to educate myself for an upcoming vacation to Pennsylvania Dutch country. I had a basic understanding of Amish beliefs and cultures, but was totally astounded at the differences between the sects. Mr. Hostetler provides first-hand knowledge that no one else has in any other book I've read pertaining to the Amish & Mennonites."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"excellent concise book on the mennonite/amish culture..easily understandable and very readable..since the author was once amish he is able to provide personal examples...."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I grew up not far from Amish and Mennonite communities, where Amish carriages were a common sight. A farmer who was my Dad's best friend had his dairy barn built by the Amish. Many of my own ancestors were Pennsylvania Dutch, though they were French Huguenots who had escaped to Switzerland and Alsatian Lutherans instead of Amish and Mennonites. There were Mennonite girls with their white muslin caps on my school bus. Not long before I was born people still spoke Pennsylvania Dutch just a mile from where I grew up. Our family used Pennsylvania Dutch expressions like \\"outen the lights\\" and my mother cooked scrapple and called cottage cheese \\"smearcase\\".This books describes the Amish as I imagined them--hardworking, religious, and keeping to themselves. This book tells of how the Amish began in Alsace, and how they came to be different and remain different. I was interested to learn that many Amish do not wear clothes with buttons because in the 17th and 18th centuries buttons were primarily found as part of military uniforms, so naturally the Amish would not want any part of that. The author speaks of the Amish way as one deeply rooted in symbolism--a symbolism that informs each Amish man and woman that he is separate from the outside world. It would seem that Amish clothes and work practices define them as certainly as their language and religion."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"Very informative book. Definitely not a light read but will leave you with a good understanding of the Amish. Without doubt, it is the first book to read when starting your study of these fascinating people."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"Amish Society was purchased for an American Culture class in order to learn how wealthy the Amish are, which rather surprises and shocks us considering their lifestyle. Are they wealthy because the have less expenses, or are smarter with money...or both? Hard to say. All in all a good read. Not what you expect."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"I used this in a class about studying Amish. Enjoyed every bit of the information that the writer provided. Its a good read for those who want to know more about the Amish."},{"Title":"Amish society,","review":"The author knows by experience what he is writing about. He does not have a &#34;bone to pick&#34; with the Amish. He just is seeking to info."},{"Title":"Family Practice Guidelines","review":"I am a family nurse practitioner and a nurse practitioner educator. I found this book to be an excellent resource for primary care providers. The format is logical and easy to follow - it includes pathogenesis as well as physical findings, differential diagnosis, diagnostic tests and management. I especially liked the patient education material included with each entry. The guidebook has appendices on special diets, procedures, EKG interpretation etc. and the pharmaceutical information is up to date. We are planning to use Family Practice Guidelines as the protocol resource in our office."},{"Title":"Family Practice Guidelines","review":"I found this book to be an excellent resource for nurse practitioners. It is very complete and nicely formatted for quick reference. Each condition includes a reproducable patient teaching sheet and there are appendixes for diets and procedures.

I will also recommend it to my family nurse practitioner students."},{"Title":"Family Practice Guidelines","review":"The authors must have been reading my mind! I have spent hundreds of dollars on reference books (large and small) trying to find just one that would &quot;work&quot; for me. This reference is well organized, concise and exactly what I have needed -- Thank you!"},{"Title":"Family Practice Guidelines","review":"I bought the spiral bound edition for ease of copying the patient eduction materials. However the binding is too flimsy for the weight of the book and was torn upon delivery. I returned the book. The guidelines are too basic for practical use for an experienced practitioner. Possibly helpful for a beginning family nurse practitioner student. Book does not include the most current, critical evidenced based guidelines for advanced or complex care. Half of the guidelines are for pediatric well child care."},{"Title":"The Hide-And-Seek Prince: 2 Kings 11:1-12:16 (Joash) (Hear Me Read. Level 2)","review":"Mary Manz Simon is wonderful! My son has all of these books and they are his favorite. The easier level he could read easily in first grade and the second level he could easily read in second grade. I think he likes them for several reasons: they are fun, easy, repetitive, rhyming and familiar Bible stories. These books are great for building reader confidence. When we got the 8 level two books he read them all in 2 days, and asked for more!!!! HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!!"},{"Title":"Sarahs Idea","review":"This book gives a priceless opportunity for learning what the San Jose, CA area was like in the 1930's when it was still all prune orchards. The book is set in the country, at an intersection which is now the meeting place of two busy streets, almost in downtown San Jose. The story is about a little girl whose doctor father buys back a prune ranch that was formerly owned by Sarah's grandfather. He keeps Sarah out of school for a year to let her recover from an illness (never named). Living on a ranch instead of in a city gives Sarah hope that she'll be able to fulfill her year-long dream of getting a donkey. She enlists her little sister's help, and they eventually find a creative way of financing the acquisition of a donkey. More than that, it's the same donkey that Sarah had seen the year before - the very one she wanted. A lovely book! Deserves to be back in print."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"Take this book with you on your next trip. Devote an hour to reading it, accept the simple rules, and you will never again look at the night sky in the same way. For thousands of years people examined the night sky with nothing but their eyes, their minds, their hopes and fears. Over time, they learned a remarkable amount about the near heaven. Using this book, you can regain a profound skill that helped our ancestors onto the rocky of civilization. You can learn to see the skies, to understand how space is arrayed. This can be a pleasure in itself or it can be the foundation for a plunge into astronomy. This book offers you a grand chance. After you read the first part, take a blanket, go outside, lie comfortably on the ground, and join our ancestors in the first step into the universe. And there is a bonus: you can learn how to use the sky to orient yourself in your own backyard. This book offers a glimmer of what school should be like."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"I read this book, then a month later I went out beyond the lights of the city, and I was able to easily identify stars and constellations. awesome! And it only took me about 30 minutes to read each half, and the payoff was huge. I've read several Guide Books before, but it's usually in one ear and out the other."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"If you have an interest in the skies above... but don't know where to begin...THIS IS THE BOOK FOR YOU!!I am a complete novice about our stary nights here on earth...and within 30 minutes \\"Stikky Night Skies\\" has provided a basis for me to begin a new adventure and hobby.If you are searching for a family hobby that can be enjoyed by one and all...this book works for a child and beyond.My husband's special interest is in quantum science. I asked him if he wanted to have some fun, so I gave him the book. After 30 minutes he looked at me and said..\\"I'm hooked !! When is the next clear night?\\".We are hooked on the night skies thanks to \\"Stikky Night Skies\\"!"},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"After all the reviews I read here I expected a lot more. Before I cover the content of this book let me tell you that the binding of this book is pittyful - it fell apart after the first indoor use. The printing quality appears to me like a cheap black and white newspaper print (no pictures or decent draws), just that the paper is somewhat thicker. The book consists only of black pages with wihte dots on it resembling stars. In one or two easy sentences on each page you are supposed to figure constellations. It works and in an hour you are about to find 5 or 6 constellations in the book.But for whom is this book made for???Little kids?- No, nothing is explained about stars, solar system, universe etc. Just to find a few constellations won't hold up a kids interest for very long.The newbie astronomer? - NO. There is no explanation given to nothing. So it is not only that you know nothing about the basics of astronomy, it also fails to live up to it's own expectations. Most people will be surprised that they don't find the constellations they found so easily in the book. Thats because they've been told nothing about the seasonal constallations, the difference between the northern/southern hemisphere, no directions given where to find stuff, nothing about the rotation...So here comes my personal guess what this book is good for:If you wanna impress your girlfrind with your newly acquired skills and you want to take no effort... this is it. You just have to be lucky to be in the right place at the right time of the year ... and most importantly, she shouldn't ask any question like \\"What is this bright misty arc overhead?\\" , \\"Is a shooting star a fallen star?\\". Those questions will embarrasse you to nature, because you couldn't answer them from the content of this book.Honestly again, get yourself T. Dickinson's \\"Nightwatch\\" and you will find all constallations easily and constantly at any time of the year. You will know the answers to all the questions an interested rookie might ask himself."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"This is far and away the most outstanding book on amateur astronomy I've ever seen. If you've ever had a teacher who explained things in such a way that they stikk to your mind forever, this book will let you relive that experience. In fact, my seven year old son can already identify many constellations. After you read this book, leave the telescope behind, just walk out into the night sky and enjoy the thrill of knowing your way around it."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"Impress your friends, your date, your children! There's something magical about reading the night sky, and, if you're not already an astronomer, this book will change the way you view the heavens.Yes, my brain is full, and I don't have time to learn anything new. But the folks who created this book are on to something - it's catchy, it's sticky, uh, Stikky. Each page and each chapter builds and reinforces your knowledge. You really do have to read this book one page at a time, though - no skimming!Definitely buy this book before your next plane trip. You'll have some fun and gain some knowledge to share at your next cocktail party. It would also make a nice gift - maybe when you're done with it?!Reading &quot;Stikky Night Skies&quot; is like playing a game, and I'll bet that kids - perhaps as young as 10 or 12 - would have a great time with it, too."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"A simple but effective approach, &quot;Stikky Night Skies&quot; teaches the reader how to recognize six constellations, 4 major stars, a planet, and how to always determine north in the night sky. Besides showing the constellation pattern and describing how to recognize it the book contains multiple pages of actually night skies to practice on. After completing the book it is fairly simple to locate each of the constellations mentioned.I did have one problem with the book. The gluing method used to attach the cover on my copy was of such poor quality that the cover came off with just one reading. Of course it can just be glued back on with good quality hot glue, but you would expect it to be of better quality from the beginning.Other than this one caveat, if you want to know how to recognize a handful of constellations that you can use as a base to learn other ones, you can't go wrong with &quot;Stikky Night Skies&quot;."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"This book at first seemed too simple. Then after buying and reading it, I realized that it was perfect. The book starts slowly, teaching you how to find one star and constellation and then builds on that information. By the end of the book the reader can find several constellations, stars, etc. This information is also presented in such a way that I feel I'll retain the knowledge for life. All-in-all a good book that effectively conveys the information."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"A great book that allows you to immediately learn how to identify stars. I never understood the creatures that people could see in the sky (like Orion) but now my kids and I are standing in the backyard at night looking for the different constellations. GREAT BOOK. Easy to use. The repetition and specific information is great for all ages. Everyone should get this one."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"After reading this book and learning at least one thing from it you'll become acquainted with the night sky enough to help you feel at home anywhere in the world as long as you've got the stars to keep you company at night. It definitely felt that way for me when I was traveling this past month through Morocco and looked up to observe the stars in a completely different world. There's nothing like \\"trivial\\" knowledge that can make you feel wonderfully small in such a big diverse world that shares the same sky!It's written very simply and effectively with full page spreads of images of the night sky at different rotations and visibility of the stars. The book encourages readers to take a break and let each chapter be absorbed before continuing on and to learn more practically by taking a step outside to learn directly from the night sky. It's a light book that is a delightful and exciting read because of the ease of involvement and instant sense of achievement from when you first correctly identify a constellation or which way is north.I recommend this to anyone and everyone! I've already purchased a few copies as gifts for people I've met along the way of my travels."},{"Title":"Stikky Night Skies","review":"I was introduced to this book while on vacation in Tortolla.

The details and complexities held my interest to the last page, as a mystery should.The situation is set up quickly, and the reader is perplexed along with Gerald Ricketts, the main character, when he finds himself in prison! As the events transpired, I experienced surprise, frustration, wonder, panic, and puzzlement.The term \\"formula\\" is used in the review title because the author, Geoff Nelder, is a high school math teacher. \\"Escaping Reality\\" is a neat piece of writing.

And it's so cool to find a book that doesn't relegate librarians to dour sad wimps shushing readers all day.

More sex in the sequel, Geoff please."},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"ESCAPING REALITY - GEOFF NELDERIf you like your prison escape stories written with ironic humour, your international jewel theft books full of quirky musicians and your librarians sexy, this is the book for you. If you're never considered any of these apparently jarring concepts, now's your chance. Ostensibly a straightforward \\"I've been framed and I'll prove it\\" novel, Escaping Reality itself escapes reality and turns into a tour-de-force of plot-twisting, fell-walking, identity-hiding computer-hacking riotous turmoil. As a stiff-necked literary critic might say, it also underlines the existential meretriciousness of solipcism. The rest of us might say that it reaffirms the fact that we are all, ultimately, on our own. But don't let that get you down - the protagonist (he's no hero!) triumphs, gets his own back to some extent and even manages to have a surprising amount of naughty stuff on the way.The book reads as if it has two parts - the opening mystery/who-dun-it set-up during which you think \\"That's couldn't have happened\\" and \\"That's just unlikely\\" and the second half - more of a thriller - in which you see that \\"Ah! THAT'S how it happened\\" and \\"Of course, that makes sense\\", all laced with quips, humour and an acceptance that bicycles sometimes have minds of their own. The action takes in prison life, what it's like to be a jobbing musician, good cops, bad cops and atmospheric, detail-drenched settings in Cumbria and non-tourist Amsterdam. Any more would give it away, and the plot deserves to be discovered as you read (and re-read, because you just won't get all the darker and complex undertones first time around).Comparisons are invidious - and there's no other book to compare it to, anyway - but imagine an Alistair Maclean novel written by Robert Rankin after looking at too many Salvador Dali paintings on a rollercoaster. Or something like that. Better still, buy it and read it - you won't be disappointed.But you might wish all librarians were a bit more like Wendy."},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"There are few books which have really grasped my attention over the past year, but Geoff Nelder's 'Escaping Reality' is a real page turner, in the digital sense. Once I started reading, I really didn't want to stop and only heavy eyelids got in the way of enjoying the novel in one session.Geoff's writing is engaging and witty, but not at the loss of atmosphere in the many tense and adrenaline-pumping situations which protagonist Gerry Ricketts finds himself in. Like real life, there are smiles even in challenging times, and this solid thriller is all the stronger for Geoff Nelder's sense of humour.Great writing from a great writer!"},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"This is a sneaky book, Geoff Nelder. It masquerades as an escapist adventure book, a boy's own story with a dash of sex; like that Liverpool reader says like a road book that should be a movie.

Women, don't be put off by the macho cover art, this book is for us too."},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"If you like a book that is a good \\"out-loud\\" read to your Significant Other, this is it. From motorcycles in the living room, sleeping under troughs, camping out in a old boat, wallowing in bubble wrap or decorating Christmas trees, it's a hilarious read. Never know what will happen next to our so-called \\"innocent\\" hero but still it all flows together. Not for the young but definitely for the young at heart!"},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"Geoff Nelder's Escaping Reality opens with the main character, Ricketts, finding himself in a truly precarious situation. When a professional musician is charged with theft and manslaughter, the next stop isn't his usual booking at a local nightclub, it's a place called Stonelodge Prison. Unlucky Ricketts is given a choice-patiently await the outcome of a slow moving appeal, or take matters into his own inexperienced hands. From the title alone, any reasonable person can guess which option the character opts to select. In hopes of finding adequate evidence to prove his innocence, Ricketts trades fear for hopes of clearing his name and embarks upon an action-packed journey that proves to be much more than he may have bargained for.Although Ricketts illustrates that his fair logic begins to dip and waiver, he manages to concoct various ambitious plans to escape his most recent reality as a convict. A sexy siren named Wendy proves to be his enabler to move forward toward his chosen path of escape-a bridge to assist him making his first major move, and many other that soon follow. Although trouble finds the man on the run at mostly every turn, occasional sizzling sex scenes lighten his troubling load, while also feeding his carnal desires. From camping excursions and bike rides, to living in an abandoned home, and hiding out on a houseboat, the plot continues to advance with many more adventurous activities. Staying committed to fighting his personal fight, Ricketts manages to secure a job, map out routes, and dodges a close call with Asian exotics. The man on the run proves there is no rest for a weary, wanted man. His stamina, nerve, and ability to progress as far as he does without being captured sometimes proves to be on the edge of unimaginable, but these items simultaneously allow for resolution to build to a boiling point, in the last third portion of the book.The author allows Ricketts to encounter a character named Grootebroek, who coyly parts with many pieces to the puzzle. The thing is, when they begin to assemble during a discrete meeting, Ricketts hits a brick wall in his \\"detective act.\\" A sudden twist complicates a long journey and causes it to become a bit longer. At this point, the man in the spotlight is forced to explain some of his behavior to Sergeant Cuyphoven and Detective Hals, of the Amsterdam Police. The pressure the pair adds to an already intense situation that will either ultimately lead Ricketts to earn his freedom, or accept that his ship has sunken for good, only with a host of added criminal charges.Nestled in between of the pages of Mr. Nelder's novel, all of the answers await those who enjoy original reads speckled with mystery, complex hypothetical situations, and mind-boggling riddles. The author obviously took great care in inserting international destinations that can appeal to readers who enjoy details of this nature. Indulge in this journey if you dare to escape reality. Then and only then will you find out if becoming a man on the run proved to be worth all of one man's very ambitious efforts.Reviewed By: Andrea Blackstone, Black Butterfly Review"},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"Escaping Reality By Geoff NelderAs soon as I read the dedication in this book, I had a feeling I'd like it. It says: \\"To Tibor Fischer for his inspirational novels.\\" Now, first off, I thought, \\"This guy knows Tibor Fischer! Damn, what a lucky guy!\\" That thought, was followed by, \\"Oh, dummy, maybe he just really loves Fischer's work.\\" And, after reading the book, I suspect that Mr. Fischer did indeed inspire Mr. Nelder.If you'd like to play with words, become a better punster, and toy with phrases just to hear how they roll around in your mouth (remember the \\"bowl with a soul\\" in the Collector's Collector?), then this book is for you.If you'd like to learn about Cumbrian villages, pubs and the upcountry of the UK, garden spot of the winter-worn moors, and the place most likely to freeze your tootsies off as you're running like hell after escaping from prison after being convicted for something you didn't do, then this book is for you.If you like naughty bits about sex on bubble-wrap with a librarian who helps a wrongfully convicted prisoner escape, or being tied up on a bed and in various other exotic positions and locales, then this book is for you.If you want dull and boring, this book is NOT for you.If you want any genre, other than adventure/suspense/thriller/humor, this book is NOT for you.If you want to use this for a book report for school, this book and this review is NOT for you."},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"This book is outstanding. I thoroughly recommend reading it. It's authentic, raw and honest. Has a very unpretentious feel to it and is chocked full of subtle British humor. I haven't been so amused reading a book since I picked up my first Bill Bryson book."},{"Title":"Escaping Reality","review":"The title says it all. Geoff Nelder's &lt;cite>Escaping Reality&lt;/cite> is a lighthearted romp which will drag the reader away from any mundane reality into the slapstick pleasure of his saxophonist protagonist Gerry Rickett's world. Although the coyish self-deprecating Ricketts accuses himself of being gormless, he manages to survive a range of boys-own adventures on his way from the bottom up with \\"jack-the-lad\\" cunning. The story puts the reader in the picture immediately as the book opens with Rickett's arrest for jewellery theft and murder.As the novel is written in first person, the reader is immediately sympathetic to the cocky Ricketts, whose innocence is accepted by the reader without question. His dawning sense of the unreliability of those around him, along with the odd but effective combination of humorous sarcasm mingled with incredulity makes Ricketts an excellent protagonist, keeping the reader involved through the force of his personality. Ricketts refuses to feel sorry for himself, and hatches a plan to break out of prison and clear his name. Bubble wrap sex, a computer virus, and a white van are all part of the serendipity as Rickett's works his way out of prison and away from his Dickensian fellow prisoners, who steal his phone cards and lumpy porridge.At times the plot does strain credulity, and Ricketts' sexual exploits, however well drawn, are about as likely as his eventual victory over bureaucracy, a drug cartel, and to a lesser extent, the forces of ennui. He almost makes being on the run sound easy, although there are plenty of cold, wet nights, brakeless cycle rides, smelly sheds, and a little farmhouse nookie. Because this is such a fun story, and Rickett's such a compelling character, verisimilitude is the least important thing about Escaping Reality. Nelder builds suspense well, using foreshadowing, pacing and rhythm to speed up the book where necessary.Never do we doubt Rickett's story, since the first person narrative places us on the road with him. The reader wants and expects Ricketts to find the real criminal and get his compensation. Rickett's crimes are small (stealing a prized motorbike, humiliating his girlfriend and putting his friends in danger), especially in comparison to the real bad guys, and he never intends to do any harm. Like his friend Preston, whose name he uses while on the run, his mal-used wife, and his (reasonably mal-used) moll (who has a few secrets of her own), the reader is prepared to not only forgive, but support Gerry Ricketts, making this a very satisfying read.The unlikely heroism is also bolstered by an authentic and well drawn setting. Nelder's prison avoids clich&eacute;, as it focuses, with great humour, on the day to day details of life.Nelder's description of Amsterdam is rich with detail, taking us around the docks and deep into the heart of Westerdok. The mystery reveals itself bit by bit through a number of straight and crooked policemen, along with a few cases of Glod beer, plenty of camaraderie, and another continental shift. Well written, clever and full of black wit. Escaping Reality is a hard to put down, stylish romp. There are laugh outloud moments, in prison, on the run, and back in prison again, plenty of twists, a compelling cast, an evocative setting, and heartbeating drama. This is the kind of book you can read in a few days or less, and then pick up again for another round, solely for the pleasure of it.Magdalena Ball is the author of Sleep Before Evening\\"There is so much beautiful writing here, soaring passages.\\" Ruhama Veltfort, author of The Promised Land"},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"A heart warming book that allows us to connect with our own humanity with examples from real life heroes. When we feel stress we can look to the people in Dr. Seaward's book who have lived life with courage, hope, and humor. The book is filled with powerful teachers from across the world that help us keep perspective and balance. Dr. Seaward's writing is direct yet inspiring. He leaves us with hope in every case !"},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"I am a big fan of Dr. Seaward's popular book, &quot;Stand Like Mountain, Flow Like Water,&quot; and was very pleased find &quot;Desserts&quot; to be another excellent resource for coping with all of life's stresses. I recommend it enthusiastically--it's one of the most well written and inspiring books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"It's very difficult to find the words to describe the books written by Brian Luke Seaward. If a book is over 150 pages, it must have something about it to hold my attention.. Stressed is Desserts spelled backwards is a book that you don't want to end. It's one of the rare books that I'm able to read in one sitting, and at the same time go back and read parts of it again and again. Different stories and antecdotes within this book resonate within a person at different phases in his or her life and it's so easy to relate to the truths the author speaks of with times in your life or the lives of loved ones. I love to travel and explore the world, and as I do so I also explore the inner depths from within..... With a copy of this book and the Alchemist I am ready to begin my journey, both inner and outer."},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"After reading this book, I hold firmly to my belief that we all experience many of the same feelings, and that a mentality of separateness is the cause of many of societal ills. I applaud Dr. Searward for revealing a personal side of stress in what I believe is an effort to heal many through the exposure of one's struggles in life and the resultant successes. I am reminded of Lance Armstrong as I get caught up in my self-created daily worries. Attitude is everything and Dr. Seaward certainly shows that with the right attitude, the blessing in every situation will be revealed. I have also read &quot;Stand Like Mountain, Flow Like Water&quot; and feel that this book is excellent follow-on reading. I think that this book helps remind us of the big picture of life, and will hopefully help many people get out the petty details that fritter life away and open our hearts."},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"&quot;Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backward&quot; is a book of that's full of inspiration! I like this book because you can open it to almost any page, start reading and find a valuable bit of information wrapped in a wonderful story. It's like a reference book on stress written in short story form! It also includes practical suggestions for dealing with rough times and for calming the mind, body and spirit. Brian Luke Seaward, PH.D., has a knack for writing as though he were talking to you in person. His other books &quot;Stand Like Mountain, Flow like Water&quot; and &quot;The Art of Calm&quot;, just to name a few are also wonderful spirit-filled works that encourage you to embrace life and all that comes with it from a centered, enlightened, inspired perspective."},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"I picked this book up at Barnes &amp; noble because I thought the title was clever.As it turns out this book is ingenious!

It has two - three page true stories relating to huge or small accumulative challenges modern every day people deal with. I am tired of being told to reduce stress and calm down, I needed ways and means to do just that, and this book gave me some realistic methods. So much of our adult lives feel out of controll and we need every day heroes to help us understand we can all get &quot;through it.&quot;I look forward to the next book by this author and plan to read others. He writes clearly and mainstream with a hopeful theme."},{"Title":"Stressed is Desserts Spelled Backwards: Rising Above Life's Challenges with Humor, Hope and Courage","review":"I got this book as a gift. I am not particularly stressed, but you don't have to be to read this collection of inspiring stories. Collectively, they remind me of the Hero's path by Joseph Campbell.

The book allows for the reader to touch not only the human emotions but the divine spirit, the source from which we all draw our strength and courage. I found myself crying and laughing and I think this is the brilliance of Dr. Seaward's writing. The main course maybe chopped liver and you cry all the way through it but you know following is your favorite dessert, Creme Brulee."},{"Title":"O Christmas Tree (Sing-It!)","review":"This book is beautiful in its simplicity. The story and art is warm and charming and will capture a young imagination during the holiday season. I gave this to a young nephew this year and his eyes lit up with delight. Looking through the book with him, I saw the wonder of Christmas reflecting in his eyes and I remembered...remembered what it felt like to be a child around home and hearth, drinking hot chocolate, singing carols, lying under an enormous tree, smelling the pine sap, staring up at hundreds of colored lights and ornaments and daydreaming.Debbie Trafton O'Neal's story is basically the search for and enjoyment of that tree, told behind the well-known and loved Christmas carol. Ande Cook's paintings are sweet and her sense of color remarkable. You only need look at the cover of animals surrounding a tree under a star filled sky to see the magic that awaits within. As I watched my nephew pouring over it and beginning his own Christmas memories, I was lost in memories of my own \\"Christmases long, long ago\\". And this, to me, is what it's all about."},{"Title":"Striking Illustrations in Christianity: Bringing Back that \\"Old Time Religion\\" with Fundamental Thoughts","review":"This book is full of dangerous ideas, especially if you're a church-goer. The religion being taught nowadays is not the same one you'll find in this book. What happened from then to now? Maybe greed got the best of what used to be a pious and moral people. I feel that the brand of religion in this book, untainted as it is, as comprehnsive and logical as it is, in it's purest and actual form, is an improvement on the one you may be indoctrinated with by misinformation feeding preachers. Oh yeah, the illustrations are breathtaking, too.

Industry professionals, chief executive officers, and medical students use a different language than rap musicians and drug dealers. Those with the few minutes required to easily reference this book while writing will far exceed the minimalist expectations of modern education and, no doubt, far exceed the annual income level of their post graduate classmates. Neither race nor economic class is as great a social divide as language abuse and misuse.Not only has this book remained in print for quite some time, but it is one of the few books from high school I refuse to discard. Reading this book from cover to cover, although personally encouraged, is not absolutely necessary. Organized more akin to a dictionary, this guide is ridiculously simple to navigate within its many tips and tricks.Although I held a great jealously towards my senior-year, male English teacher who managed to steal the attention of the few young women in our class through the rhyme and reason of old poetry, he did our class a great justice through the forced purchase of this book.

It encourages children to organize and think about what they want to say in their written communication. It has a conversational tone that draws children in so they will maintain their interest. It is very well organized, once you understand the simple but unusual method. It has mini lessons throughout to aid the teacher with ideas for lessons. There used to be an actual teacher's guide to go with it. I'm not sure if that is still available. I highly recommend this book for anyone with a student in the grades mentioned above.

Item is new, clean and great quality. The interior has exactly what I was looking for."},{"Title":"Writers Inc GT Writin (1990 publication)","review":"This is the writing resource that I wish I had been introduced to back in high school when writing essays and term papers. It is accessible for high school students but can also provide guidance for those out of school.With writing becoming increasingly important in high school (the SAT is about to add a writing section), this is an invaluable pedagogical resource for the teacher and student. High school and college student with superior writing skills will always differentiate themselves from their peers. By using this book, the student will improve organization and construction of essays and term papers as well as improve analytical reasoning and thinking. There is even a section of appropriate language for business writing. Teachers will find the most improvement in student's revising skills, a step that most high school students skip over in the writing process.It is more useful as a writing resource than as an authority on grammar. For a grammar resource, I recommend Dianne Hacker's Writer's Reference. Another useful writing resource for those out of school is Peter Elbow's Writing Without Teachers. Elbow's book is quoted several times in Writer's Inc. for providing suggestions for lifelong improvement of writing out of school. Another perennial favorite is E.B. White's Elements of Style.More parents, students, and educators should be made aware of this book. It is a good investment."},{"Title":"Writers Inc GT Writin (1990 publication)","review":"This book served me well through high school, college, my first job as a newspaper reporter, and also as a content writer for an Internet integrator. Highly recommended. I believe all schools should do what my high school did with this book: but a copy for every student to keep forever. It is an invaluable resource, with the right approach, and a little attitude.Fun, witty, smart, direct, and simply the best reference book I've ever owned, Writer's Inc. is exceptional not only for its utility, but also its content. Writer's Inc. is not only a grammar guide and reference, but addresses the THINKING and LEARNING processes in a way that most schools fail to do directly.Read this book. Keep it on your shelf all through school, college, a career, and the rest of your life after this and you will have a richer mind for it."},{"Title":"Writers Inc GT Writin (1990 publication)","review":"We are using Writers Inc in homeschooling our 10 and 12 year olds. It provides clear, concise explanations of grammar that even 4th graders can understand. We've used it for teaching sentence construction, grammar, speech, and book report and research paper writing.

The definitions and examples are clear enough for young writers, while the topics are detailed enough to handle most writing and English questions for college students and beyond. The only thing that I can imagine anyone complaining about is the way the index lists item numbers instead of pages.

He explains how to set up and configure an FTP server via the GUI. I don't use the gui and wish he would give step by step instructions on how to do this. An integral part of setting up an FTP server is to show how to add users, this guys doesn't even come close to even thinking about how to set up users.Bottom line--If you want a little bit of information on practically all opics this is your book, if you want detailed information as to how to do something, well look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux 7.2: The Complete Reference, Second Edition","review":"I found The Complete Reference not very complete.

Even though I had installed Red Hat 7.3, this book on 7.2 SEEMED to be the best of the lot. Now after several weeks of observing the author going aimlessly 'round in circles trying to explain concepts, I've had enough and must shell out MORE bucks trying to find a decent Red Hat book, as this one is destined for the trash bin. The book is very poorly organized and the author never focuses on one topic long enough to fully explain it. The final straw came when, in the chapter \\"Setting Up a Local Area Network...\\", section titled \\"Internet Access by Local Hosts\\", he explains how to set up the gateway host for IP masquerading but never even touches the topic of how to set up the host to connect to the Internet through the gateway. I was, and still am, absolutely livid. Since he stopped halfway through the explanation, can I have half of my money back?? Isn't there SOMEONE out there with thorough knowledge of Linux who has the ability to effectively convey that knowledge in type????"},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux 7.2: The Complete Reference, Second Edition","review":"I am tired of all the books that have the audacity label themselves as &quot;complete reference&quot;. I have used linux for several years and this book is very much lacking in details. Security is coverly too lightly. The author focuses on the gui front ends for system administration, which may be fine for a home user toying around for the first time, but a serious administrator needs more information about what goes on behind the scenes. As a previous reviewer stated, this book covers a lot but doesn't cover anything in depth.This book is a good introduction to someone who know little about linux but I would not recommend it to anyone who plans to use a linux machine as a serious production server."},{"Title":"Red Hat Linux 7.2: The Complete Reference, Second Edition","review":"I found this book to be the most up to date Red Hat book in its class, covering the recent Red Hat innovations like the new network and system administration tools (something missing from many other Red Hat books). Though accommodating to the beginner, it provides professional level discussions of server, system, and network administration. Security coverage is very extensive including topics like latest encryption tools, integrity checks, and firewall configuration. Claims that the book overemphasizes GUIs are completely wrong. For example, the book spends almost 40 pages detailing configuration of Linux FTP servers (for which there is no GUI tool). Unix features such as shells, scripts, and regular expressions are covered in far more detail than any other book in its class. As far as GUIs are concerned, Gnome and KDE are here to stay and have become an integral part of most software projects in the Linux community.

She was meddlesome, selfish, but amazingly down-to-earth, sturdy as the Rock of Gibraltar, the symbol of integrity and the heart of the British Empire. She crowned an era with her name. Victoria. There has never been anyone like her and she's irresistible.This beautifully illustrated journey into Victoria's court will titillate, amuse and fascinate you. Luckily for us, Victoria's Master of the Household- Lord Edward Pelham-Clinton- had kept an incredible scrapbook of the Victorian years and it is this memorabilia that illustrates this remarkable book.The running narrative for the book is Victoria's own journal, almost seventy years of astute, opinionated observations, the horse's mouth if there ever was one. You'll look over Victoria's shoulder as she writes in her diary- in her frank way- of everything. (The Queen simply could not prevaricate and she said it as she saw it). She didn't like Wagner's face, loathed poor Gladstone but adored Benjamin Disraeli, agonized over the deaths of Prince Eddy and so many others in her family, including two of her own sons. She bemoaned her own physical weaknesses (but without self-pity) as her life drew to a close.There are marvelous reproductions of beautifully engraved dinner menus, wedding announcements, even train schedules that'll take you right to the scene and make you part of it. The photographs are rare and wonderful: little Beatrice with her long fair hair, the arrogant Kaiser Wilhelm II, Dickens and Robert Browning and Oscar Wilde. There are gorgeous full color reproductions of paintings such as the wedding of Bertie Prince of Wales and of Sir Edwin Landseer sculpting the lions for Trafalgar.Victoria had a charming talent for drawing and you'll see many sketches she did of her own children as well as an interesting one of Lehzen, her old governess.\\"Life at the Court of Queen Victoria\\" is a wonderful potpourri, very, very satisfying to the Queen Victoria buff! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Life at the Court of Queen Victoria","review":"This books is an absolute treasure - filled with all kinds of wonderful details such as the seating plan at Queen Victoria's Jubilee dinner, and lots of beautiful illustrations of menu cards and entertainments.

I love it!!Most Beautiful Princess"},{"Title":"Life at the Court of Queen Victoria","review":"A very excellent book for those interested into the aspects of Queen Victoria's court life. A definite must read. This is a rare jewel of a find."},{"Title":"A Samuel Beckett Reader","review":"Norman Mailer once said about the work of Beckett that ' we are not all impotent'. For the man- of - would - be action Mailer Beckett's focusing on the end game, on the sloth of it all, of our not being able to be more than our poor bodies let us seep- seemed a poor caricature of the human condition. But Beckett saw a fundamental truth of human life of the human situation in a way no other writer did before. Old Age and disability, breakdown and failure were Beckett's true home.He reacted to his great master and teacher Joyce who seemed to want to reword the universe with his own mysterious new names, with a profound understanding of how few words could make the silences even deeper. Calder here is a good critic and friend, and provides little introductions to Beckett's Early Fiction( Dante and the Lobster, Murphy, Watt) and then his Post- War French Works (Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable, Waiting for Godot, Endgame) for the Poetry (Cascando, Four Poems) and for the later works( How it is, Imagination Dead Imagine) Calder even finds at the end of darkness and desperation a playful sliver of hope.What is unquestionable is Beckett's strategic brilliance his wise reaction to Joyce and his making for himself a voice which speaks to the heart of mankind in its own definite way.Let us hear it a bit and wonder why we seem to understand it and not.At the end of the end , the final section of 'How it is\\" Beckett writes-\\"silence and more longer and longer silences vast tracts of time we at a loss more and more he for answers I for questions sick of life in the light one question how often no more figures no more time vast figure vast stretch of time in his life in the dark the mud before me mainly curiosity was he still alive YOUR LIFE HERE BEFORE ME utter confusion"},{"Title":"Jimmy's Blues: Selected Poems","review":"I never read poetry, but I've read 19 of his other books, so I ordered this one.

We also purchased a special-order sofa and loveseat at just over half the cost at a local retail store based on the author's suggestion.

Luckily, most manufacturers have web sites where you can view their collections, get product information and get the item numbers that you need before you call for a quote.A note about old information: I do not consider this to be a defect of the book. I have the 1999 edition, which I have been using all week to look for a bedroom set. Many of the companies I called were listed in the book as carrying the Stanley line. Many of the stores I called no longer carry Stanley. After a few of the same responses, I finally asked why many stores no longer carry that line. The answer was simple-- Stanley asked for more room in the showrooms and if the showrooms didn't enlarge the Stanley line within their companies, Stanley pulled the line from that store. Since many companies didn't have the extra room (plus they didn't agree with Stanley's practices) they were no longer able to carry Stanley. How is that a problem with the book? I don't hold the author of the book responsible for the politics that go on within the furniture industry. I do believe that the information was correct at the printing of the book and that if the information has changed, it will be reflected in newer editions.Since I have to buy furniture for every room in my house, I also have ordered Ms. Causey's other book \\"The Insider's Guide to Buying Home Furnishings\\".I am saving about ...including freight on the queen bed, dresser, mirror and nightstand that I plan to buy. ...x a house full of furniture is a lot of money and I am grateful a book like this exists to help me find the best deals!My friend and I plan to visit High Point and Hickory next year and we do plan to call companies first to verify they still exist and if they carry a particular line I want.

As most of the books that are in this area, I expected this to be another lousy book that wasn't very interesting at all. I'm honestly not a Science Fiction fan, but this book was a lot better than expected. I would assume that getting your hands on this book in person would be extremely hard since I wouldn't doubt that it's first edition printing (as you are told on the cover) is the only edition ever made. Luckily my copy is still in good enough condition.The plot was interesting, and I'm grateful that this is straight to the point. I will admit, there were many points in time that I had no idea what Fox was talking about, using large science terms that have to be looked up. I was very entertained reading this book, and the way that it ends seems to simple, that it's almost wrong to have ended in such a way. I would recommend this book to someone who's interested in reading, but I warn, there are printing mistakes and either missing or extra words. There are also points in the book that don't make any sense, such as Olan Prentz appearing at the end to testify that Glynna and Kevin helped him and his friends out but destroying the Alatars in the past. And yet, if they destroyed the Alatars in the past, wouldn't that mean they wouldn't have appeared later in the future? But I have seen this happen in other places, such as the game \\"Chrono Trigger\\" and it's ending.I did not like how the end left you wondering what happened next other than the marriage, and that Glynna wasn't to be killed. What about Chan Dahl's memories? Do they reside in Kevin for ever? Maybe Fox didn't want to write any more, or maybe he would have rather left any remaining questions for the reader to solve themselves.All the talk about time travel became almost...sickening at the end. This book made me realize that we as humans really shouldn't be able to travel about all these years and experiment like the Chronomads did. Also, it made me sad to think that so far in the future, all the nature of the world was scientifically altered. Nothing was truly natural. This doesn't take away from the book, but if I were Kevin Cord, I could not deal with such instances. If it were up to me, I would have stayed in my own time period to begin with, or, after being carried to the future and going through the motions he did, I would have saved the universe then went to my own time.I wondered at points through out the book, why he never talked about his family. Not once. No say about parents, siblings, or anything. In fact, we go through the entire story not even knowing how old he is. But I would assume that Kevin is about 30 in the book.In the end, I praise this book. I can say that this was a good read, but I simply did not understand certain parts of it. The scientific jargon was too much for me and I didn't bother to learn more about what the hell Cord was talking about at times. The typos made this book seem like it was either rushed, or humanly typed. Which I must add that there were pages who were closer to the spine than others. Had to stretch my book at times to read. Good, but I didn't get that feeling like I finished something big, or got that sense of slight sadness that the journey was over."},{"Title":"The Hunter Out of Time","review":"Revisiting the books one read in one's youth is important, not merely for nostalgia, but because they show -- more than photo albums, scrapbooks, or report cards -- how one's adult tastes, opinions and very personality were formed. During my adolescence, all geeky boys read science fiction, and it's a shame that the cheap, paperback science fiction novel, passed between friends until it fell apart, has been replaced as a common medium of social networking.Reading these books one final time brings to mind one word -- *quaint.* It may be that their only value today is to instill a sense of smugness in the modern reader. Smugness over how such learned men as Gardner F. Fox (1911-1986) could get the future so wrong. The same type of amusement can be had from books such asThe Experts Speak : The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformationin which howlingly bad predictions (\\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.\\"--President of Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977) are cataloged. We like to laugh at such fools, because it's always fun to see some pompous ass get his comeuppance (if only belatedly), but it's sort of sad when the same thing happens to a personal favorite. Gardner Fox, however, for all the groaners in this book, had some amazing flashes of insight. (Fox, a former attorney, was said to have written over 100 books as well as the stories of many comic books.)William Gibson has famously said, \\"The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed.\\" That's also true of this 1965 novel published by Ace (a successful house which publishedJunkie,the first book by Wm. S. Burroughs and also the first novels ofPhilip K. DickandUrsula K. Le Guin). The year is 121,345, and the time-traveling protagonist is taught the language of the future and given a new personality by being hooked-up to a machine, but this marvelous device (and all other computers) is still huge (the integrated circuit was already commonplace in 1965, but miniaturization hadn't occurred to the author) and it operates with punch cards.There are vehicles which travel through time, but the fleet needs mechanics to maintain them, as the idea of self-diagnosis and repair apparently hadn't occurred either. Perhaps for the unimaginative reader's benefit, time travel here is always combined with motion in the other three dimensions. Instead of just sitting there as the time changes, the Timeler zooms off in some direction in space.Time travel has been perfected and distant galaxies have been colonized, but human aging has not been prevented. Voices and information (there, thankfully, is no mention of the music of the future) are still recorded on magnetic tape, and people read newspapers.

Heinlein) often used humor in their books, but this, despite its frequent absurdity, is an action thriller, so it's dreadfully serious. Typically, people in the year 121, 345 don't use contractions or slang. They're very formal, all dress in uniforms and have good posture.

There has been a Red Line in science fiction writing, too.

During my adolescence, all geeky boys read science fiction, and it's a shame that the cheap, paperback, science fiction novel, passed between friends until it fell apart, has been replaced as a common medium of social networking.Reading these books one final time brings to mind one word -- *quaint.* It may be that their only value today is to instill a sense of smugness in the modern reader. Smugness over how such learned men as Gardner F. Fox (1911-1986) could get the future so wrong. The same type of amusement can be had from books such asThe Experts Speak : The Definitive Compendium of Authoritative Misinformationin which howlingly bad predictions (\\"There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in their home.\\"--President of Digital Equipment Corporation, 1977) are cataloged. We like to laugh at such fools, because it's always fun to see some pompous ass get his comeuppance (if only belatedly), but it's sort of sad when the same thing happens to a personal favorite. Gardner Fox, however, for all the groaners in this book, had some amazing flashes of insight. (Fox, a former attorney, was said to have written over 100 books as well as the stories of many comic books.)William Gibson has famously said, \\"The future is already here - it's just not evenly distributed.\\" That's also true of this 1965 novel published by Ace (a successful house which publishedJunkie,the first book by Wm. S. Burroughs and also the first novels ofPhilip K. DickandUrsula K. Le Guin). The year is 121,345, and the time-traveling protagonist is taught the language of the future and given a new personality by being hooked-up to a machine, but this marvelous device (and all other computers) is still huge (the integrated circuit was already commonplace in 1965, but miniaturization hadn't occurred to the author) and it operates with punch cards.There are vehicles which travel through time, but the fleet needs mechanics to maintain them, as the idea of self-diagnosis and repair apparently hadn't occurred either. Perhaps for the unimaginative reader's benefit, time travel here is always combined with motion in the other three dimensions. Instead of just sitting there as the time changes, the Timeler zooms off in some direction in space.Time travel has been perfected and distant galaxies have been colonized, but human aging has not been prevented. Voices and information (there, thankfully, is no mention of the music of the future) are still recorded on magnetic tape, and people read newspapers. The hero asks his love interest (and the only female mentioned in the book) for a photograph of herself, and she produces a snapshot (of her in a bikini, naturally), but she won't give it to him, because she doesn't have the negative.Fox's contemporary prognosticators (especially Isaac Asimov and Robert A. Heinlein) often used humor in their books, but this, despite its frequent absurdity, is an action thriller, so it's dreadfully serious. Typically, people in the year 121, 345 don't use contractions or slang. They're very formal, all dress in uniforms and have good posture. Despite that the book is only 126 pages, it begins to pall, and one longs for a scene when someone might start telling, *A xenomorph, a cyclosome and a rabbi walk into a temularium, and the . . .* (Then again, we might not get a joke from the future -- for a while at least.)But wait! I'm telling you, this guy's really great!Fox may miss the minor details of future life, but he's spot on when it comes to the big things. For instance, Global Warming -- it will happen, and it's only 20 pages away! The polar ice caps melt, and the entire earth is submerged. Now, that's important, isn't it? So what are we supposed to do about this impending disaster? Not a problem, as humans simply move to huge artificial-terrain space stations floating in the sky and on the moon. The earth eventually returns to another ice age, after which it's safe to return. The message from the year 121,345 to us primitives seems to be, *Vote for Gingrich in 2012*!Furthermore, despite universal peace and harmony (because everyone speaks the same tongue), everyone wears sidearms. See? The NRA is right! An armed society *is* a polite society! (That maxim, of course, was originally fromBeyond This Horizon,a science-fiction novel by Robert A. Heinlein.) Use of the death penalty also keeps people in line.In some aspects, the utopia of the year 121,345 doesn't sound very appealing. Casual sex is prohibited: \\"In the past, men were governed in their actions by their animal natures. Reason had not yet come into its own. There were wars. Personal slayings. Violence of one sort or another. And indiscriminate matings.\\" But in 121,345, \\"When a man and a woman marry, each must pass a physical and psychological test. it is very severe. Each must compliment the other . . .\\" Uh-oh. It's another of thoseBrave New Worldscenarios. What's worse, \\"Our people are so used to obeying the World Federation Council Law that any opposition to its regulations is unthinkable. From babyhood, we've been indoctrinated to its universal good . . .\\"Do you know what this means? It means that Ayn Rand was right all along! Here we laugh at her strident polemics masquerading as novels, and we should've listened to her message! And we should've listened to the geeky guys with pocket protectors in their shirts and big keychains who were trying to get us to readNone Dare Call It Treason.(Those guys are all congressmen now.) The U.N.(World Federation Council) will take away all our individual freedom! What fools we've been!> SPOILER ALERT! &lt;(Meh. It's not much of a spoiler, as the things are depicted on the cover.)The novel's crisis is giant bedbugs taking over New York (the name of which has become Nyaller in the tongue of 121,345)! Wake up, people! Hasn't this already begun to happen? How much more specific a prediction can you expect? The bedbugs may be taking over your mind as you read this! You can have your Nostradamus with his vague generalities; Gardner Fox tells it like it will be!Yes, yes; I'm being disingenuous. Most paperback science fiction (and science fiction movies) have similar scenarios, and Fox is not some right-wing ideologue. (He tells of the means of time travel being developed in around 51,000 by a Zulu chieftain in his African laboratory . . . which is nice, I guess.) You could likewise make cheap fun of all the best sci-fi authors, but now here's something from the book that's genuinely deep. What other writer predicted a threat from Osama bin Laden and the Islamic Brotherhood?It's true! On page 46 of this novel, terrorists hijack the hero's spaceship. Dressed in black, they kill the crew and take him hostage. They are, \\"A band of men who call themselves the Brotherhood. We are the outgrowth of a religious sect which had its formation many centuries ago. . . . As an aftermath of war, a burst of religious fervor swept over Earth . . .\\" These terrorists are led by a mastermind (i.e., bin Laden), \\"Who gifted them with wealth and new weapons with which to carry on the fight.\\"Read it and believe it! Who else in 1965 saw that soming?In \\"The Hunter Out of Time\\" there is something called The Red Line, beyond which time travelers may not pass. There has been a Red Line in science fiction writing, too. Books written on one side of this line envision a future utopia in which common human problems have been solved, there are scientific advances which seem miraculous to us primitives, and the only threat to this peace and serenity is external - - an invasion of giant bedbugs and the like.On the other side of the line are more recent works of science fiction which predict a future *dystopia.* The traveler to this future does not meet a beautiful \\"Glynna\\" (as in this novel) in a beautiful space port on a distant planet, but instead an overweight LaShondra who is living in an abandoned house, hiding from roving bands of thugs and scavengers who roam the ruined cities.

(along with John Owen's Sin and Temptation)have to be two of the finest examples of detailed Puritan exposition on how to overcome temptation."},{"Title":"Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices","review":"I recommend this book to nay person wishing to improve their understanding of both the Bible and their their own life.

Having done my doctoral work on a Puritan, I am very familiar with their writings. This particular version of \\"Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices\\" by Thomas Brooks, is a great blessing. The difficult words, no longer or rarely used today, and some of the archaic sentence structure have been modernized without removing the beautiful prose and original flavor of author. This particular Kindle version is much more accessible to readers who find it difficult to read Elizabethan English. Thomas Brooks, along with Thomas Watson, are the two most readable puritans and this particular version makes Brooks even more accessible to readers today. The puritans were students of their own hearts and they wrote out of their own self examination. Brooks knows how to apply God's Word in a clear, direct, and encouraging way. I highly recommend this book for anyone wanting to grow in Christ likeness!"},{"Title":"Precious Remedies Against Satan's Devices","review":"Regarding the content of this book, I agree with those who have given it five stars.

She attempted to decide whether to be &quot;a woman helping men&quot; or &quot;a creative artist competing with men.&quot; Torn between obligations and freedom she shifted her focus back and forth from male to female and from self to other. Acknowledging Nin as an important Modernist and Feminist writer who created an authentic feminine approach to art, author Richard-Allerdyce focuses on how Nin healed herself with writing and psychoanalysis. This in-depth study of Nin's work using the four unexpurgated diaries, has a title by title approach making the book more accessible to readers. Nin's sensitivity changed the nature of life and art and the media-conditioned response to both. Nin wanted to live an active life with no one telling hr what to do. \` The later volumes of the diary showed Nin moving away from polarization of others and self, of fiction and diary, of live and death. Richard-Allerdyce shows how Nin came to understand that opposites are merely fuctions of each other, how the personal deeply lived becomes the univeral Modernism and Feminism helped Anais Nin remake herslf. She showed that women can get over society's programing, education and taboos. She focused on the bond between all women. Her writing was therapy not only for herself but for her readers.

The book is chock full of examples, stories and insights on the matter (hence the size) which a well informed Landry uses to picture the bigger and positive image without being pushy about anything, although the 'being creative' gets a bit repeative after a while.

Some of the cast lists reflect stereotyping that would be considered unacceptable by today's standards --for example, there are characters described as a \\"typical stage darky\\" (who speaks in a sterotyped dialect) and \\"typical stage Jew\\" (with a complete description of what the typical stage Jew dresses like)."},{"Title":"Knight and the Squire","review":"My 8-year old son received this book as a Christmas present from his god-parents (who live in Toronto). Having read all four Harry Potter books to him over the past year, we looked forward to a fresh style and new hero - and we certainly found one in Tom (the hero of this book). The main reason I am writing this review (notwithstanding the fact that this is a wonderful story) is the number of times I found my son laughing out loud at the adventures of Tom and his sidekick Alan. While Rowling's Harry Potter series is a truly unique adventure, and while we anxiously await the fifth book, Rowling does not offer as much original and creative humor as Terry Jones (a refreshing change of pace). My guess is that anyone who enjoyed Harry Potter, will enjoy The Knight and the Squire as much (if not more so).

This thing is non stop bloody violence, beginning to end. War is glorified, men are measured by how many they have killed, heads are split in half (this seems to be the favorite method), guts spilled, villages burned and sacked, entire cities starve to death under Arthur's sieges, gruesome suicides by several women who just couldn't live without their man, countless incidents of, \\"I don't like your words so I'm going to kill you!\\" etc, etc, etc. Every conflict between two people, or countries, is solved through terrible, gory violence. Through all this Arthur and his men are the heros because they kill more men than anyone else in all the world.Maybe I'm too modern, maybe I'm being a bit too politicly correct, but I don't believe this is good for children. Young adults, sure. After a child is old enough, after they understand enough about history, war, and have a definite grasp on what is real and what is simply a story. I bought this for my children and I always read things first, both so I will be able to discus it with them, and to be sure it is okay for them to read. I have decided that this book is not appropriate for children.I hope this will help anyone who is considering buying this book for a child as a gift, thinking it to be a bit of a fairy tale, a legend, and nothing more. Do you want to give these ideas to your kids: When someone makes us angry it is right and glorious to attack them with weapons; if a woman loses her lover it is normal for her to be so grieved and incapable of caring for herself that she would commit suicide; that countries who disagree have a right to slay civilians as a method of getting their way; that the more people a man is able to overpower through brute force the better a man he is; and most of all, that God not only approves of these things but actually adores and rewards violence in His name?This is interesting and even humorous reading for an adult, or a mature teenager. The humor coming in the form of the violence being so over done that visions of Monty Python dance in your head. The language is eloquent and a challenge to read. If antiquated language is what you are looking for I would suggest \\"The Merry Adventures of Robin Hood\\" by Howard Pyle, a book with its own share of violence, but unglorified, and with a lesson, a moral."},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? In this book you meet them all &#65533; including the magician Merlin, and the brave knights Sir Lancelot, Sir Gareth, Sir Tristam, Sir Bors, Sir Key, and Sir Galahad. All the old favorites are included &#65533; Arthur drawing the sword out of the stone, Arthur receiving the sword Excalibur from the Lady of the Lake, Arthur becoming emperor, and Arthur&#65533;s marriage to Guinevere. These events are recounted with surprising little drama. But don&#65533;t give up too soon &#65533; the best comes with all the quests and adventures of the knights that follow, including the Quest for the Holy Grail. This book is chock-full of entertaining adventures involving knights in shining armour, damsels in distress, fierce jousting and sword fights to the death, battles against hoards of enemies and giants, tournaments and miracles. Accompanying the text of this hard-cover, are ornate black and white pictures and images that contribute splendidly to the atmosphere evoked by the text.The medieval setting is painted in a rather idealized fashion, limited to the nobility and figures of the court, who embrace all that is beautiful, brave and noble. These virtues are sometimes portrayed rather simplistically, as unknown knights engage in mortal combat, and only after they have virtually killed each other do the introductions begin: &#65533;What is your name?&#65533; Behind this medieval mayhem is a heightened sense of chivalry more reflective of legend than fact, where knights battle to the death for the sake of a woman - even one they have only just met. But isn&#65533;t that what the Arthurian legends are all about? Nobody is under the illusion that they are to be taken too seriously. Journeying to Arthur&#65533;s Camelot is a form of escapism - suspend your sense of disbelief, watch the flashing swords and fearful battles, and enjoy.That&#65533;s not to say that the Arthurian tales do not reflect any reality. Arthur&#65533;s world is in many respects a real medieval world. Medieval beliefs in paganism and Christianity are evident throughout. Witchcraft and enchantment is presented as alive and deadly, and conversely the true religion &#65533; in this case the beliefs of the medieval Catholic church &#65533; is evident throughout as knights commend themselves to God in prayer, thank him for his help, and even repent from their sins. The whole notion of the Holy Grail is of course a very Christian tradition &#65533; although a tradition that represents more fiction than fact. And the moral virtues of justice, truth and right for which the honorable knights fight are still noble ideals of virtue today. Arthur&#65533;s kingdom is presented as a kingdom blessed by the grace of God, a beacon of light symbolizing all that is good and true and right, and a worthy model for kingdoms in today&#65533;s world because it revolves around timeless virtues. Tales that promote dignity, courtesy, courage, respect for right, respect for female dignity and purity are as ennobling as they are entertaining.How much truth there is behind the Arthurian tales will always be the subject of debate. The fact remains that there is an extensive and confusing body of legend to wade through. In this 1923 work, Knowles has essentially followed Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur.&#65533; Even his language is antiquated and tedious, but persevere because you will soon find that this an enjoyable and essential addition that heightens the heroic atmosphere of the story and gives the legend a fittingly majestic touch. But it is doubtful that Malory or Knowles have been successful in making a great deal of sense out of the confusing mass of legend, because it is not unified in a plausible manner. Those looking for a more readable or easier introduction to king Arthur would be better served by the works by Roger Lancelyn Green or Howard Pyle.In the end these tales of King Arthur and his knights remains a hodgepodge of anecdotes with different styles that is sometimes hard to wade through. But that doesn&#65533;t matter. This collection is primarily of historical value, in giving a true picture of the original legends as they have been transmitted across hundreds of years. Even if it&#65533;s not always easy to read, it cannot be denied that Knowles has produced a very comprehensive collection of the Arthurian tales, and the unbelievable exploits of knights in shining armour will continue to entertain in the future just as they have done in the past. Along with the tales of Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced. This is the stuff of legend, and it&#65533;s worth a read."},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"This book has the most thrilling example of medieval life than any other book that I have seen,or heard of!When I read this book,after only reading a few pages,I got hooked on it,and just couldn't seem to put it down!I hope other people will enjoy this book as much as I have.The book's descriptions of kings,knights,battles ,damsels,Lancelot,Guinevere, and most of all Arthur were wonderful!Even though I am only 12,I recomend this book to young readers everywhere!(this next part of my review was written at a later date)This was the first review I ever posted on amazon, and it seems rather odd now, going back and looking over it...because I'm seventeen, five years have passed, and I still love this book. I suppose that's why I've read it twenty-eight times; I fell in love with it as a child and it stayed with me. And so, I still recommend it! If you're young, enjoy adventure, with a healthy splash of fantasy and faith, then you will enjoy this. That's my recommendation; maybe in another five years, I'll come back and add to it."},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"This book was about how King Arthur's life supposedly was. He was born after King Uther tricked an enemy duke's wife into thinking that Uther was her husband. That child was given to Merlin, and he was un-christened, and was given to Sir Ector. He became a squire at his new home and had a bigger stepbrother to help. When the sword in the stone appeared, all the knights and noblemen around England appeared to try and pull it out, since the person who pulls out the sword in the stone is supposedly the king of all England. Throughout his life he encountered many people like Sir Lancelot of the Lake, who fell in love with his beloved wife, Guinevere, and also gave birth to a child with his half-sister when she disguised herself. He would later become a legend for all the things he had done during his life.I read this book because I watched the movie from Disney called \\"The Sword in the Stone.\\" It sparked my interest of knights and I was fascinated with the Middle Ages ever since. Then when I went to the library, this book was the only one about King Arthur that wasn't checked out, so I read this wonderful recount of the amazing life of Arthur.I recommend this book to everyone above the age of 9. There are some \\"not so good for children parts\\" in this book. If you are a child who wants to read about King Arthur, then you should choose this book. If you want something that is easier, I suggest you not to select this book since it is kind of a hard book."},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"This book has the most thrilling example of medieval life than any other book that I have seen,or heard of!When I read this book,after only reading a few pages,I got hooked on it,and just couldn't seem to put it down!I hope other people will enjoy this book as much as I have.The book's descriptions of kings,knights,battles ,damsels,Lancelot,Guinevere, and most of all Arthur were wonderful!Even though I am only 12,I recomend this book to young readers everywhere!"},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"This book is a bargain, but make sure your reader is ready for it.

Not only are the timeless legends told ineasily under-standable language, but the print is LARGE, and the pages DECORATED with lovely Anglo-Saxon and Celtic designs, and many drawings, both black and white and in colour. This book was first printed in 1926, and the stories are retold by an English Lord, Sir James Knowles, and illustrated by Caitiyn Matthews, and Louis Rhead, in Art Deco's most grand and deliately beautiful manner, so appropriate to a book of this callibre. Arthurian Legends truly come alive in this book! Absolutely first-rate on all accounts! The stories take you back to the Days of King Arthur, the printing style to the 1920s...which, in many ways, and in so many areas of earth, were still -- despite many modern conveniences -- full of the mindset of the middle-ages, (perhaps especially in the country-side of England, and in many third-world countries.) I have tried, by my beginning decorations to this review, to convey, however awkwardly, the beautiful design, typeface, and illustrations of this book. But do see it for yourself. It brings the Authurian Age, and it's \\"sister-age\\", the 1920s, vividly to life, in story and in design, as no paperback, (even karger, trade-paperback) ever could!It is truly, \\"History In Your Hands\\" !"},{"Title":"King Arthur and His Knights","review":"This is an excellent book for any child (or even an adult).

This story begins with Sara Stanley adjusting to life in Avonlea and being tormented by her cousins. She meets Jasper Dale, the Avonlea recluse and persuades him to hold the Avonlea Magic-Lantern Show! But when Sally Potts and Jane Spry set a fire off at the town hall and blame it on poor Jasper, what can Sara Stanley---the Story Girl do now? I loved this story because it makes you think and laugh and it's good soul food because of it's heartwarming theme. These stories are very heartwarming and set at the turn of the century in the town of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island, Canada."},{"Title":"Analysing Identity: Cross-Cultural, Societal and Clinical Contexts","review":"This groundbreaking book presents a conceptually sophisticated and empirically grounded method to understand the complexities of cultural identity. The first section begins with a brilliant summary of the pertinent literature written in an accessible style with helpful major definitions and concepts clearly demarcated. It leads to an empirical method that combines both universal and local constructs of identity that can be customized by the individual. It was just simply thrilling and breathtaking how the writer conveyed the reality of identity as multiple aspects of identity as one's self-construal moving in flux/process vs. a single fixed objective entity. The second section on cultural issues further elaborated on the first section. The chapter on understanding the identity of a Palestinian Christian Arab adolescent with Israeli citizenship elegantly demonstrated the value of the empirical method described in the first section; beyond the complexity of the objective categories lay the range of self-construal possibilities from a fragmented, conflicted identity to a more integrated one. The third section deals with social issues and focuses on gender. The final section presents three clinical applications involving psychotherapy, anorexia nervosa and trauma. As someone who has taught psychiatric residents and other mental health professionals in this area for many years, I highly recommend it for clinicians as well as researchers. You will never see identity the same again!"},{"Title":"The Transitive Vampire: a Handbook of Grammar for the Innocent, the Eager, and the Doomed","review":"Working as a tutor in my college's writing center, this book is not only fun, but very practical.

He is quite sympathetic to Barth's thinking, and gives a balanced assessment of its major themes and arguments, pin-pointing several of the 'problematic' areas raised by Barth's doctrines of election and eschatology. The later chapters where he critiques Barth are weaker than the others, because his approach is to fall back on affirming antinomic teachings in Scripture without trying to resolve or explore them as Barth has. Thus in the end this book feels like a conservative reaction rather than a fruitful engagement and furthering of the discussion. Berkouwer invokes the phantom character of 'the theology of the Reformation' (Whose theology? Which Reformation?) a bit too often. This is a helpful book for those who do not have the time to digest the immense volume of Barth's work, and are looking for a clear and thorough explanation and evaluation of his theology."},{"Title":"Madison Square: The Park and Its Celebrated Landmarks","review":"Why would a southerner ever be fascinated by an \\"obscure\\" New York park?

And his way to school is exciting - they all go on a rollercoaster. Now that's what I call creativity.

Norbert is confident that even his mom would choose the others, because they are better and more skilled than he could ever be. But, he's wrong.The author reminds us that we can bless our children through touch and the words we express to our children. The concept is based on the Old Testament blessing.God has blessed parents with children. It's only natural that we continue the tradition by blessing our own children.The story is a great reminder how we often compare ourselves to others. The grass looks greener on the other side. If we hop on over, we'd be stung by bees, the grass would itch, and dirt would become evident.God didn't make a mistake. By thinking that He did, it's actually an insult to Him.

Typically, a biography concerning Jesus is presented with a fundamentalist Christian bias or with a blatantly anti-Christian bias. Buying this book in the secular section I fully expected the latter. Books and movements purportedly exposing Jesus as a myth are fairly popular.I was surprised at what I found. As I read through the book I was unable to determine if Duquesne is personally a Christian or not. If Duquesne is a Christian, he definitely is not of the &quot;The Bible says it, I believe it, that settles it&quot; mold. Duquesne points out the various historical and theological inconsistencies that are present throughout the Gospels. However, Duquesne writing gives the reader a sense of the wonder and significance of Jesus. He does not write as an atheist out to debunk or mock the Christian faith.Duquesne beautiful prose takes the reader back to that ancient land. Duquesne explains many of the Jewish customs and beliefs that allow a Christian reader to make better historical sense of the Gospels.I found some of the ancient Jewish customs to be quite bizarre. In describing the Wedding at Cana, Duquesne illustrated the Jewish wedding ceremony and associated customs. The Jewish wedding ceremony was a party that lasted for days. The wedding ceremony was a time of much eating and drinking. After the marriage was consummated, the groom would wave the blood stained sheet, proving the bride's virginity to the cheering guests. This is the type of culture education that you will typically not find in your local Bible class.Duquesne does not claim that the miracles were impossible. Duquesne also makes the case that the greatest miracle of all, the resurrection, was possible. Atheists to this day have some troubles explaining the empty tomb. Why would all the apostles be willing to die for claiming they had seen the resurrected Jesus if they knew such a claim was false? This is the sort of question that Duquesne analyzes is a logical, yet sensitive manner.Christian readers may be troubled by Duquesne's illustrating the inconsistencies in the Gospel accounts. Non believers may become uncomfortable with Duquesne's non-repudiation of the miracles and the resurrection. Any book that is able to trouble both camps is a must read. I found this book to be entertaining, enlightening, troubling, comforting and, in a sense, spiritual. I give this book my highest recommendation"},{"Title":"Jesus: An Unconventional Biography","review":"I found Jacques Duquesne's \\"Jesus: An Unconventional Biography\\" not long ago in a second hand book store, and I have to say that it is a real shame that a silly book like Bruce Chilton's \\"Rabbi Jesus: An Intimate Biography\\" could have made such a splash, when this thoughtful book is virtually unknown.It will be hard for some to believe that any book about Jesus could be appreciated by everyone from the fundamentalist Christian to the atheist, but I believe this could be the case here. Anyone who takes Jesus of Nazareth seriously as a teacher, force in human history, or as the Messiah I think will appreciate it. Through his powerful and concise prose, his comprehensive familiarity with ancient Jewish life, and his incisive insights into the significance of the Christian story, Duquesne allows readers of his book to gain a vivid sense of what it would be like to walk next to Jesus and his disciples through the dusty towns of Galilee and Judea, and brings a distant, foreign world and the enigmatic figure of Jesus of Nazareth richly to life. I have a large library and read a lot, but this is unique in that respect.This book is that rarest of literary gems, a profound, moving, enlightening, popular yet fairly scholarly book that is still a pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Jesus: An Unconventional Biography","review":"I found a review about &quot;Jesus&quot; from Jacques Duquesne.I have just read &quot;Le Dieu de Jesus&quot;, which is kind of a continuation. I am not Christian, that means that I am not sure about any choice. Nevertheless, if I were, I would agree with J. Duquesne about God. The God that he presents is the one that I would like to refer to. He shows us a very different God than the one I used to know, throughtout the Bible studies that I attempted. He seems more &quot;accurate&quot;. The picture J. Duquesne gives us about God is wonderfully bright picture. If you have the opportunity to find a translation of that book, go ahead and read it.

His &quot;Creating 3D Comix&quot; book is really a broad overview of the process of 3D comic creation, and includes numerous references to various software applications one may find useful beyond Poser, Bryce, a paint program and 3D modeler. If you're totally new to 3D comics this might help give you an idea of what's involved, but for more in-depth instruction you'll still have to refer to the documentation for whatever software you decide to use.
