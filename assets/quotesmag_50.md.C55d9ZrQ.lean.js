In fact, On the day of his execution, scores of his fellow students at all the Irish Universities joined the Irish Republican Army (IRA).I listened to the song \\"Grace\\" with tears in my eyes as her tragic story was revealed. As the fianc&eacute;e of Joseph Mary Plunkett, a member of the IRA and one of the heroes of the 1916 Irish Rising, she married him just hours before he was executed. I couldn't get the haunting melody and lyrics out of my mind. The chorus goes, \\"Grace, just hold me in your arms and let this moment linger, For they take me out at dawn and I will die. With all my love, I place this wedding ring upon your finger, we won't have time to share our love for we must say goodbye.\\" I had tears streaming down my face by the time the song was over.When I returned to Washington state, I couldn't wait to find out more about Grace. I was so glad to find this book of Marie O'Neill's which tells Grace's story. It's a short book, but packed full of details of Grace's life. It's illustrated with Grace's own cartoons. O'Neill interviewed people who had known Grace including nieces who shared many personal stories of their aunt.This book is recommended for anyone who would like more details of the 1916 Rising, told in a very personal way."},{"Title":"Grace Gifford Plunkett and Irish Freedom: Tragic Bride of 1916 (Women in Irish History Series)","review":"By the light of two guttering candles in Kilmainham Gaol's Roman Catholic chapel, Grace Gifford married her fiance Joseph Mary Plunkett hours before his execution by firing squad. In doing so, Grace became forever linked with Ireland's struggle for independence, because her husband was one of the signatories of the Proclamation of Independence. So begins Marie O'Neill's biography of the woman who \\"became a powerful symbolic figure of the republican ideal for which her husband had given his life.\\"Twenty-eight-year old Grace, the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, was second youngest in a family of twelve children. Born into a prosperous home, Grace and her siblings were surrounded with comforts, a wide circle of friends, and educational opportunities. Grace, a gifted artist, chose to study at the Dublin Metropolitan School of Art, then continued her studies in London, and finally returning to Dublin to begin a career as a caricaturist. A chance meeting with an Irish journalist in London introduced grace and her sisters to a broadening circle of friends, including the poet and painter known as AE, William Butler Yeats, Constance Markievicz, and Maude Gonne. The opening of St. Enda's brought them in contact with the future leaders of 1916.Raised a Protestant, Grace's increasing interest in her father's faith also led to a deepening friendship with Joseph Plunkett, whom she met at St. Enda's in late 1914 or early 1915. By winter 1915, the couple was secretly engaged and planned an Easter wedding following Grace's baptism into the Catholic faith. Through the War of Independence and the Civil War, Grace barely made ends meet. A lifelong Republican, Grace was never a member of Cumann na mBan, the women's auxiliary organization that worked to support the Volunteers. Still, she was arrested and served time in Kilmainham Gaol, along with other Republican women. After her release, Grace, who remained a widow for the rest of her life, struggled to make a living from her art. Many times she was reduced to poverty, and life only became easier after Eamon deValera and his party came into power and she received a civil list pension.Grace continued to draw, and her cartoons showed an incisive wit. Quiet and moody, she remained in Dublin, working until her health began to fail. She died in 1955, presumably from heart failure. She was accorded a funeral with full military honors.O'Neill's biography is a sensitive portrayal of a little known woman in a generation of extraordinary Irish men and women. Her history is important so the world can remember Grace Gifford Plunkett, a quiet woman whose immense talent and charm make her more than simply the \\"tragic bride of 1916.\\""},{"Title":"Grace Gifford Plunkett and Irish Freedom: Tragic Bride of 1916 (Women in Irish History Series)","review":"Being a bit of a romantic, I was very curious about a woman who would marry a man the night before his execution. I wanted a number of questions answered: Why did she do it? Did she ever re-marry? What was life like for her after his death?The author does an excellent job of reporting the facts and offering opinions on how events in Grace Gifford Plunkett's life shaped who she was. After reading the book, I could answer all three questions, and the book satisfies at that level. Ms. O'Neill puts her subject in the context of the times, and she explains what is going on in Ireland at the time the events occur. In other words, the reader does not need to be intimately familiar with 20th century Irish history to enjoy this book. Grace Plunkett supported herself as an artist, and the author has the good sense to include these drawings in an attempt for the reader to understand the subject.Again, I am a bit of a romantic. The love story of Joseph Mary Plunkett and Grace Gifford never came alive to me during the book. Their story inspired the beautiful Irish ballad, &quot;Grace,&quot; about that fateful night of the execution. Ms. O'Neill quotes from their love letters, and one sensed she could not get some important sources about this aspect of Grace Gifford Plunkett's life. After all, his death did occur 84 years ago.Nevertheless, the book is a good read, and it would probably make a decent, watchable movie."},{"Title":"The Strength of Poetry","review":"While some published reviews on this book (which began as a series of lectures) are cautiously mixed, presumably on account of the book's lack of a philosophical perspective on modernism, my own is a rave (simply look elsewhere for a philosophical perspective--anyway, such books are easier to find) . For anyone who loves poetry, especially poetry in its more sophisticated forms (as opposed to the all-too usual sloppiness of slam poetry), this book offers the opportunity to have a dialogue with a brilliant poet and critic. For anyone who approaches poetry with trepidation, this book may be enough to convert you. Fenton's ability to excel at both poetry and criticism is all too rare in today's climate of popular culture; moreover, he writes for a broad audience. Just as he did in Leonardo's Nephew, he brings the characters he discusses vividly to life (reminding me, always, of the best hagiographers), always taking a broad approach which never attempts to separate the poet from his/her work, and always working hands-on with the poetry itself. Sometimes, this leads him to extremely provocative territory (as with Plath). His is a captive audience. In summary, this is an engaging, witty book rich with insight.If you enjoy this book, or are interested in it, I would also recommend reading Bruce Bawer's Prophets and Professors."},{"Title":"Operation Heartbreak","review":"This is a fantastic tale whereby the body of a young man was used to deceive the German high command during WW2 into believing a forthcoming Allied offensive would be centred in one European country and not the real target. Given the somewhat inappropriate codename of \`Operation Mincemeat, the body of a young man was dressed in the uniform of a major in the Royal Marines and furnished with a complete set of false papers. The minute detail which went into those papers included two used cinema ticket stubs plus a photograph and letters from a fictional girlfriend. Handcuffed to his wrist was a briefcase inside which were copies of a supposed invasion plan. His body was then set adrift so that it would be washed up on the coast of Spain in the certain knowledge that all those papers would be handed over to the German authorities in that country.Perhaps one might be forgiven for thinking that obtaining a suitable dead body during WW2 would have been relatively easy but not so. The human body could not be kept in storage for too long before assuming a certain state of unnatural decomposition which would have alerted German doctors that all was not as it seemed. It was also imperative that the body was washed ashore in the right place. After all, it could hardly be parachuted into Berlin!!!Eventually, a man of the right size, condition and age to suit the false persona of Major Martin Royal Marines was found dead in the streets of London and his body used to completely deceive the Germans. The full account of this amazing tale is retold by the person who was placed in charge of the deception. When first published, this book became a best seller.It was intended for the identity of the deceased to have remained a secret forever. It was not until 1996 (or thereabouts) that the true identity of the person was revealed by an amateur historian who discovered him to have been a down-and-out who survived by begging on the streets of London. Unfortunately, he also suffered from some form of mental illness and was found dead shortly after having been turned down for military service. The cause of death was recorded as having died from ingesting rat poison. In Spain, however, that same man got a very different death certificate before being buried in a local graveyard.Av truly remarkable, almost fanciful, tale from WW2.NM"},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"There are many stories and sagas which tell how the Hero or king will return again if needed, but this story is surprisingly good. The returning Norse heros have no trouble with modern technology, they just equate it with old norse magical effects and abilities! With the help of an archeologist (Grave Robber) the old norse king returns to fight the evil sorcerer (Computer Magnate) whom he has vowed to defeat. The fun starts as the boatload of heros has to deal with being an archological find, and continues as they sort out all the technological wonders of the 20th century including television, modern warfare, and computers! After reading &quot;Expecting Someone Taller&quot; I looked for other titles by Tom Holt and was not disappointed by this outrageous romp. Highly reccommended!"},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"Hilary Frderickssen is a young American archaeologist with a passion for Vikings. A Viking ship burial is discovered on the site she is excavating in northern Scotland. When Hildy investigates, she gets a shock when she discovers that the Vikings on board the ship are still very much alive. King Hrolf of Caithness and his followers have been awoken from their thousand-year sleep to fight the evil Sorcerer King who rules his evil empire from an office block in London. Hildy has the daunting task of providing the Vikings with food, clothing, and transport, and helping them get to London to find the Sorcerer-King. There are some very funny incidents as she introduces them to the delights of fish and chips and Marks and Spencers suits. While Hildy accompanies the King and some of the Vikings to London, the ones remaining behind in Caithness kidnap Danny Baker, a hapless TV producer, and hold him hostage.This is a very funny book, with a clever plot and lots of amusing incidents and characters. The Vikings are a delightful bunch, especially Starkadd the Berserker (&quot;like honey, thick and sweet&quot;)and Hildy is an engaging heroine. There are also two cthonic spirits, Zerxx and Perxx, who live off energy and are involved in playing a mysterious and complex game called Goblin's Teeth, which seems to be a blending of chess, scrabble, monopoly, snakes and ladders and any other game you can think of. I have read lots of Tom Holt's other books, but I don't like any of them nearly as much as this one."},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"The first thing that strikes me is that I find the plot similar to &quot;Flying Dutch&quot;, but while I continue toread this comic viking-tale, I change opinion. In Caithness, an old grave is uncovered, and thevikings are awaken.

To their help they have the archeologist Hildy Fredriksen, who had thepleasure(?) to bump into them. The adventure starts and consists of several amusing incidents;Hildy's more or less fortunate attempts to keep the vikings from attacking the natives, Chthonicsprits getting drunk on high-voltage electricity, and more... I like this book a lot, the vikings fightingspirit never cease to exist, they are always happy when there is an opportunity to get involved in abattlement (beware SAS!). The book isn't that 'complciated' that I found 'Ye Gods!', can be thefact that I don't know to much about mythology (which is very much involved in 'Ye Gods!') thatmake me prefer 'Whos Afraid of Beowulf' If you found 'Flying Dutch' amusing, then I promise youthat you will like this one as well, if you havn't read Flying Dutch, I would recommend that youread this one first, that way you'll have fun reading 'Whos afraid...' and even more fun reading'Flying Dutch' (that's still one of my favorites)."},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf? Sure, it's a catchy title, but I'm afraid that it is misleading. Beowulf is not a character in the story, but he's mentioned about 3 times. Despite Beowulf's absence, this book is still pretty good. Tom Holt treats us to an interesting cast of characters that drive or walk around London or Caithness. There's the cameraman, who keeps saying, &quot;This is like that time in (name of place) where such and such happened.&quot; There are two electron-like entities called Prexz and Zxerp, who have nothing better to do than play board games. Then there's the Vikings that Hildy Fredericks-daughter discovers. And together they vow to rid the world of a sorcerer that has managed to stay alive for several hundred years. This is a pretty decent parody on Vikings and fantasy. It's not so much that Tom Holt has funny scenes, but he has interesting characters, that make this book enjoyable. Unlike some parodies I've read, the end of this book is very satisfying and won't leave you hanging."},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"Vikings, magic, dry British humor, wizards, dire wolves, magic vans, and roasted seagull; what else do you need from a book?"},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"I was quite surprised with Tom Holt's \\"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?\\" Not for any deep literary reason. But, simply because Beowulf isn't in the book. Outside of the fact that the main characters originate at about the same time and area as Beowulf (and that he's mentioned two or three times in the story), there's no Beowulf here at all. This is entirely different from Holt's modus operandi in hisThe First Tom Holt Omnibus: Flying Dutch & Faust Among Equals (Tom Holt Omnibus)where, in \\"Flying Dutch,\\" the story revolves around the Flying Dutchman, and in \\"Faust Among Equals,\\" it's all about Faust. Regardless of that, the story is well done and interesting. The characters are good, the plot is sound, the modern and historical references are amusing. But, it just lacks the spark or brightness of Holt's other \\"good\\" works. I'd actually like to rate this at 3-1/2 stars. But, since I'm forced to go with integers, I'll give it the benefit of the doubt and rate it at a Very Good 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"A fun Sci-Fi rompt combining the sensibility of a modern day archeologist who unwittingly finds herself helping a band of Vikings roused from a 1,000 year sleep."},{"Title":"Who's Afraid of Beowulf?","review":"Archaeologist Hildy Frederiksen has always wanted to make a major discovery and an intact Viking ship burial certainly fits the bill. She most definitely does *not* expect the dead Vikings to come back to life and is understandably rattled when they do. It seems a thousand years ago King Rolf Earthstar of Caithness, ('God forsaken place but it is my Kingdom') and his band of heroes fought a dreadful battle with the evil Sorceror King, won the battle but lost track of their enemy and so found it necessary to do a 'King Arthur' that is put themselves into an enchanted sleep to wake when they are needed to destroy the Sorceror King once and for all. Thus Hildy finds herself the dazed and bewildered guide to an unflappable King Rolf and his bickering band of heroes as they make their way southward to confront the Enemy in his new stronghold, London. Absolutely hilarious."},{"Title":"Out and about at the Public Library (Field Trips (Picture Window Hardcover))","review":"A (young, hip) teacher is taking his class on a field trip to the library today!

I am reluctant to call it a novel as it feels more a fictionalized memoir than a story and the narrative arc is not it's strong point. But I was very happy to be lead on a meandering tour of the author's mind with lyrical detours for various tirades because, well, he writes so damn well. Immensely entertaining, wise in the ways of gay life in the Big City, squirm-inducing in the ways he gets the humiliations of adolescence so accurate, set piece follows set piece and you are left wondering, how did he get it all so right?"},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Tom is a gay professor at a college in New York City.

Simply, a yawn."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Some lively writing (both in his fiction and his responses).THat being said, is there anything more pathetic than a narcissistic author responding to negative reviews of his work? I'm certain Mr. Weir will come up with a \\"snarky\\" answer to that very question, chock full of golden-era movie references, which coincidentally takes up the loin's share of his work. Enough already. Reference a Jim Varney flick, and maybe I'd be impressed. Then proceeding to explain the motives of both the author AND the characters? Sad. Creative Writing 101: Show, don't tell.Perhaps if the author concentrated on writing original engaging fiction, rather that cattily responding to negative reviews and drawing parallels to Ether Williams (see, name-dropping's easy), he's be able to crank out more than one novel every sixteen years."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"If you like neat, spare, tidy novels where no one ever breaks wind, where the characters exercise sentimental hygiene and you leave the book feeling...vaguely...disturbed, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. This is the real thing--honesty, messy and raw emotion, unsparing insights. It's the kind of book where the narrator tells you he wishes his friend was dead because his death will be \\"more beautiful than anything we have together in life.\\" Plus, it's funny. If you don't like it, I'm not sure I trust you as a critic and I'm sure I don't want you as a friend. Can't take it? Go find something by Anita Brookner instead.

That should suffice."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"I'm afraid I'll have to agree with Publishers Weekly on this one. It's a chattering, clattering mess that fails to obscure the complete lack of a novel underneath the noise. Perhaps Mr. Weir should try a memoir?"},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Maybe it's a problem with first person narratives that are dangerously close to memoir, but I find novels like this tend to have under-developed or under-examined narrators. Maybe the author understands the narrator so well in his own mind, he forgets to convey that understanding clearly to the reader. Or he doesn't see himself clearly enough, warts and all, because he hasn't wrestled with his own demons?I found the character of Tom rather nebulous. He always seemed to react to others rather than be the agent of action. Apart from his effeminate demeanor ad tortured alienation as a bullied gay teenager, I never got a sense of what the Tom was really like, especially as an adult (besides being fat, balding, a late sleeper, and possessing an annoying penchant for associating every event or scene with a pop culture or highbrow literary allusion). As a reader, I wanted to get a better sense of how Tom conducted his life as an adult, how his unexplained relationship with his mother affected him (she abandoned him after his utter humiliation at the school play to go attend a dog show???), what he did with his time besides teach, who his friends were, etc.. Was he still lonely at this point? Or did all of his gay friends die from AIDS? What were his quirks, his dreams, his peeves? Besides his obsession with trying to make sense of Zack's death and its meaning for him, he's kind of inscrutable.On the other hand, Weir fleshes out the rest of the characters in his novel with great skill, from the protective charmer Richie, to acerbic narcissist Zack, socially adroit free-spirit Ava, and the guileless poet-in-thug's-clothing Justin. The dialogue is wonderful when these characters are in conversation. Weir has a great ear for catching the speech habits that make the characters come alive and seem distinct.As far as plot is concerned, I agree with those (including the author in his letter of defense) who realize that a whole lifetime of memories and fears and regrets can play out in a person's mind over the course of a single day, or even in a few minutes if the right triggers are there. Think of Virginia Woolf's writing. There's nothing wrong with such internal narratives. I think many people are hung up on plot because they're too used to the narrative flow of films and television. Literary novels have the advantage of capturing timeless or atemporal reality in ways those media do not.Lastly, I loved the author's wise insights and witty reflections throughout the novel. Usually I don't mark up a novel as I read it, but I had to highlight several passages in this one."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"I found Weir's second novel to be a painful, almost hypnotic read. I loved it and can't wait to give it a second read. So many levels! So much to ponder. Wow.\\"What I Did Wrong\\" is about many things, but what most stood out to be was the portrait of a character who is paralyzed by grief, and unexpressed rage, and sadness about missed chances for living in the moment without analysis, or pre-prepared speeches, or narration.It's something that many of us who are gay can understand, especially those of us who have lost friends and loved ones to AIDS.Tom is a traumatized man who feels completely uncomfortable in his body and only responds to humiliation, getting it confused time and again with love. He still hasn't quite felt the horrible death of his \\"virtual lover,\\" the novelist Zack, five years earlier.Zack's sarcastic sense of humor, sharpened as he gets closer to death, maims Tom; his childhood is one grand humiliation in many separate scenes; and drawn back to the scene of the crime(s), he finds himself teaching the same types of kids who beat him up when he was younger.But now they look up to him, because he's a teacher, leaving Tom confused and unsure as the landscape of Queens surrounding him.There was much I wasn't able to snythesize in a first read, about what he was doing with F. Scott Fitzgerald and The Great Gatsby, for instance. I get the sense he was updating Fitzgerald's view of Queens and Manhattan and heaping on it the devastation of AIDS. But I've been wrong before...A thrilling, terrific read."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"At the center of John Weir's mournfully devastating, devastatingly sardonic, sardonically hopeful second novel is his Roth-like alter ego, Tom, a writer and professor who stumbles to the end of the millennium haunted by the death six years earlier of his best friend. Living as a \\"hermit crab\\" in a Manhattan apartment filled with icons \\"that refer ironically to seventies TV,\\" he teaches writing in Queens to college students, \\"some of whom looked like the thugs who hassled me in high school.\\"The whirring center of the first half of the novel is Tom's fellow writer Zack, \\"diagnosed with AIDS in 1989,\\" who \\"was orchestrating his death from the minute we meant.\\" The novel's most bittersweet scenes depict the irreversible decline of Zack, whose illness causes him to condense \\"thirty-seven years of rage\\" and direct it primarily at Tom. Zack's fury and his writing are, not coincidentally, dutifully reminiscent of the mordant fiction of the late David Feinberg, while Tom's anguish is a study in grief--a grief based on the rage and pain he shares intimately with Zack and on the remorse he undergoes privately as a survivor. (Is it purely a coincidence that Weir's novel and Andrew Holleran's \\"Grief,\\" perhaps the two best novels in recent memory on the theme of survivor's guilt, were published the same year?)Such a summary probably sounds like a recipe for a literary pity party, but even the gloomiest scenes are relieved by the author's (and Zack's) stinging, catty, even campy wit and by the presence of Tom's friends. Their emotional and sexual entanglements and insecurities reminded me of the befuddled and forlorn characters in James Baldwin's \\"Another Country.\\" There's Ava, Tom's \\"first gay love,\\" whose \\"Sapphic\\" gender-defying butchiness contrasts with her tender \\"romantic faith in wounded men [that she got] from Sylvia Plath.\\" There's Richie, Tom's best friend from high school, who seems to resurface during his life at the least expected and least convenient (and most necessary) moments.And then there's Justin, a student with whom Tom is confusedly smitten and whose precocious confidence and ease are alternately infuriating and endearing. The \\"twin adventures\\" of AIDS and coming out, along with two decades, separate this unlikely pair, but Justin offers his mentor a glimpse of the future rather than a mirror of his past. Indeed, all of Tom's students make him feel young again, as if they were offering him a second chance; they show him \\"how to get over\\" himself. If the themes of the first part of Weir's novel are suffering and death, the second half offers up the hopefulness represented by this extraordinary generation gap--a lesson this teacher can only learn from his student."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"This book, among many other magical things, is about survival. The survival of the terrors and bigotry of youth (is there any place on earth more full of hate and fear than a typical American high school?). The survival of the scourge of AIDS, especially AIDS in New York City in the 80's and 90's. The survival of never having self-esteem but creating a life in spite and because of this. The survival of loving people who are not wholy available; spiritually, sexually, psychologically.As another great writer named Joni Mitchell has said, \\"Lesson in Survival, Spinning out on turns, That gets you tough, Guru books---the Bible, Only a reminder, That you're just not good enough . . . \\"The main character of What I Did Wrong tells us what he sees in the world around him: lost skinny boys becoming poets, found muscle gay boys digging their heals in to avoid death but not avoiding death.This book at times feels like a balloon that is floating up out of reach, what the hell is this story about? It can be exasperating. This book contains---hands down---some of the most gorgeous prose of the last decade but it is seemingly wasted on characters who are insufferable in their lack of direction. But that is the point, yes?All survivors are smarter than where they land. They are bigger and brighter and more full of screaming feelings that no one hears until a wonderful writer like John Weir comes along.The main character of What I Did Wrong, Tom, is a survivor. A gay survivor. An AIDS survivor, though he is not infected. He is affected, as they say. That being affected is the soul and spine of this great book.Thousands of beautiful, hopeful, scarred young men were drawn to New York City in the late 70's and 80's because it was a place to be free to be. And yet so many died before their freedom blossomed into real self-actualization. And each death of each Zach affected a Tom, who lives on with a head and heart full of stories, moments, once were's and might have beens.John Weir is the real deal. I don't want to wait 10 more years for writing that is this astonishing. Astonishing because it is true.One thousand bravos."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"After reading John Weir's debut novel, \\"the irreversible decline of eddie socket\\", my first reaction was: meh. Been there, read that. To be absolutely honest, I found it a little pretentious and hysterical, with the overblown pathos often leading to nervous laughter rather than a sense of profound loss, which I assume Prof Weir wasn't aiming at.Fortunately, his second novel, \\"What I Did Wrong\\", is rescued from sharing a similar fate by one character who, like Plath's Lady Lazarus, rises from the ashes of the AIDS G&ouml;tterd&auml;mmerung to consume both other characters and the readers like \\"air\\". Zack is one of those fictional(!) characters who completely dominate the narrative, even sections where he does not appear. His presence, or the lack thereof, rises out of every page of this book like the angry miasma that Tom imagines emanating from his AIDS-ravaged body. Funny, campy, iconoclastic, confused, hysterical, angry, irrational, and ultimately capable of inspiring great devotion, Zack is the Madwoman who refuses to stay in the attic of Tom's memory as Tom carries on an insipid intercourse with the dual Jane Eyres of this novel: the oh-so-trendy Justin, and the look-ma-i-am-a-breeder Richie.Like Atticus Finch, Elizabeth Bennett, Holden Caulfield, and Jay Gatsby, Zack is one of the most memorable 'fictional' characters I have ever met, and I can safely say that the only thing Prof. Weir did wrong was to dilute the taut narrative of Zack's irreverent life and harrowing death with the bland subplots about Justin and Richie, not to mention Justin's puerile attempts at writing \\"poetry\\", which we are invited to find intriguing, since the narrator has taken the trouble to reproduce several of them in the book. Other than Zack and Tom, Ava remains the other interesting character whose presence makes the last one-third of the book bearable.So, should you buy this book? You bet you should! Maybe, if it gets sold out edition after edition, Prof Weir will take the hint, and write the book that we all want to read: the story of that enigmatic \\"some sort of a man\\", Zack."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"_Eddie Socket_ was a once-in-a-career book, in no small part because it appeared at a time when a fictional response to AIDS (and a literary reflection on the lives of urban gay men living through what felt very much like a war) was coalescing, and writers were still chafing under Andrew Holleran's pronouncement that \\"no one will ever be able to write a novel about AIDS\\" (a dictate that he, himself, has repeatedly violated). With _Eddie Socket_, John Weir expressed in print what none or few had managed; it isn't a great book solely because of its Zeitgeist, but it can't be ignored that Weir said something perfect about an era and managed to do it that era was still going on. That's no mean feat._What I Did Wrong_ doesn't have the impeccable timing of _Eddie Socket_, and it doesn't have the same sense of being an immediate, vital, and inevitable response to its age. If it's a bit unfocused, and it is, perhaps it's solely because the times we live in are unfocused: identity, desire, right, wrong, good, evil. As the deconstructionists said (and said and said and said), all of that was going to pass through the industrial grinder of the 1990s and come out on the other end looking more or less unrecognizable.And that's what _What I Did Wrong_ wants to (forgive the word) foreground: the way things (d)evolved, the way surviving AIDS turned out to be simply what happened next for a lot of gay men of Weir's (and my) generation. The gay \\"community\\" many of us thought we belonged to because of the activism and immediacy that attended AIDS (or simply because of the respite that caring for sick and dying friends gave us from thinking about the larger implications of what was going on around us) moved on: my own 23-year-old queer nephew finds \\"all that AIDS stuff\\" as distant as I find accounts of living through the blitz of London.And, in the meantime, \\"gay\\" changed as well, and one of the most fascinating things about _What I Did Wrong_ is the way Weir's characters are rummaging around in heterosexuality as much as they are in homosexuality, trying to figure out where or if the boundaries are--or, more to the point, *when* they are. In fact, what Weir has to say, and very plainly, about masculinity and the nature of being male has more truth in it than fifty articles in _Feminist Review._Anyone who's alive in America today, especially young people, knows that Weir got this detail exactly right: We live a confusing reality in which every repressive, homophobic, closeted, retrograde, and funky response to queers and to being queer exists smack alongside levels of unprecedented openness, visibility, and cultural amalgamation and assimilation that were literally unforeseeable twenty years ago, in the long, lurid twilight of Reagan. It's the queer decade; it's the homophobe decade. You can hardly watch an hour of prime time TV today without seeing happy hordes of well adjusted homos; you can hardly watch an hour of news without learning that, somewhere in the world, queers are being fired, excommunicated, beat up, or executed. We're the Pope's favorite target for damnation; what's more, we're big box office and, at the same time, no big deal.It's all very confusing; and Weir manages to work that sense of disorientation into _What I Did Wrong_ -- not as an intellectual question, but as the highly pragmatic quandary of a man in his 40s who lives in a New York--not to say an America--that is barely recognizable.It's true: _What I Did Wrong_ is a bit short on plot - or, better said, it's got the kind of postmodern plot that \\"regards\\" plot and comments on it. You're either OK with that or you aren't; that is, you're either satisfied with following Tom through his often-present-tense descriptions of the \\"new,\\" \\"post-AIDS\\" world, or you're looking for someone to tell you an entirely made-up story. There's less \\"story\\" here, in that sense, than there is a semi-autobiographical account of \\"what happened\\" (whether it's literally autobiographical, I couldn't say, but it is written that way: it's Tom's autobiography). But that doesn't mean the novel doesn't take you for a ride. And it's true: John Weir is sometimes too arch for his own good--in the novel for sure, but also in his response here to critics. (For the latter, I hardly blame him: the downside of Amazon's \\"citizen reviews\\" is that people who couldn't write a grocery list post hateful and/or stupid and/or ignorant drivel, and at a certain point in life you feel like you've stood quietly by and let enough stupidity go unchallenged.)In short, _What I Did Wrong_ is a book for people who \\"get it.\\" If you don't know what Weir is talking about or you just don't care, look elsewhere. If survival, in all permutations of the word, is as troubling a business to you as it ought to be, _What I Did Wrong_ -- for all its gritty urban ambiance and its millennial, \\"I'm so over it\\" sarcasm - is an exploration of being, an existential question mark, a riff on a cultural memory that too few of us still bear."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"i'm not going to recap the plot; that has been done. nor am i going to defend weir; he's done that. the review which i thought most interesting was the one in which allen barnett's 'the body and its dangers'was referenced. the first time--and each subequent time--i read that book, i was moved by the power of the words, and the loss which we suffered by barnett's early death. weir, fortunately, has survived. i hope he will have time, in the midst of his teaching, to write more, and publish more often. its been a long time since i read a queer book i thought was so wonderful, that i didn't read too quickly, b/c i didn't want it to end.

Unfortunately, \\"What I Did Wrong\\" is more than just a title, but could be a self-evaluation on the part of the author, since this one doesn't have anywhere near the charisma and genuine emotion as that quirky but rewarding original work. In fact, its rambling style is devoid of any real plot, with the closest thing to it being an ongoing series of disjointed flashbacks to hand-wringing remembrances of a friend lost to AIDS ten years earlier.The book's narrator is Tom, a forty-something gay English professor at Queens College in New York City. His sad, dysfunctional childhood seems to have evolved into a sad, dysfunctional adulthood, as he proves incapable of forming any kind of real relationship other than co-dependent ones with heterosexual acquaintances, including a boyhood buddy who helped him get through high school, a woman with whom he had a ill-conceived fling, and one of his poetry students who was also the drummer in a punk rock band.Then there is (was) his \\"virtual boyfriend,\\" Zach, a gay man he had a platonic friendship with before the man died from complications of AIDS in 1995. Almost every scene in the book dissolves into flashbacks of time spent with Zack during his long illness and the final days before his death, and Tom's bemoaning that he wished he had the power to do something to prevent it from happening. I assume that the author was trying to make the point that Tom only pursues friendships that are doomed to failure, perhaps to punnish himself for not saving Zach, or perhaps because he feared that otherwise the object of his affection would leave him eventually, as Zach did. Whatever the message, it is lost in this mishmash of a story, the only enjoyment of which I found in mentions of NYC/Queens locations I remember from my own boyhood there.The book is generally well-written, and the characters well developed. They just seem to have nothing to do, and nowhere to go, at least not worth telling or reading."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Spending 243 pages with a compulsive guy (the professor) who needs to tell you everything he knows was not that enjoyabe for me. Sure, the author created a \\"real\\" person---but isn't such a character someone you try to avoid? Wier lets his other characters comment on the professor's tendency to \\"kill the moment,\\" but the fact that the author may have intended to create a bore, did not improve the reading experience. Further, the professor's cataloguing tendency extends to the author. Page 112 is a prime example of this. While a student is taking ONE step into his office we are asked to believe that the professor is able to conjure up Henry James' father, characters from Hemingway and Williams, and Kerouac's broken leg, received in a college football game. Really? The story is held together by several improbable coincidental meetings and padded with literary references and gay history---none of which seemed all that organic to me."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"I read on its publication THE IRREVERSIBLE DECLINE OF EDDIE SOCKET and remember nothing about it except that I liked it tremendously. I ran across quite by accident Mr. Weir's own review that is basically about other Amazon reviewers, after having read his latest novel, and have reread his review four or fives times now.Certainly a novel does not have to have a plot in the traditional sense to be successful. On the other hand, not a lot happens in WHAT I DID WRONG. For example, Zack indeed does die, but we know that from the moment we first meet him. Neither does a reader have to identify with the characters to like a novel, three of which immediately come to mind: THE SOUND AND THE FURY, PERFUME and LOLITA. Although I am neither an idiot, someone with no sense of smell nor a pedophile, these three novels fascinate me.Perhaps some readers may not like this novel because they actually sees too much of themselves in the narrator Tom and are uncomfortable with that. He is a gay man, after all, in his early forties who still has crushes on straight men (sound familiar?), and in the words of his friend Ava, hasn't changed much in all the time that she has known him. Another problem for Mr. Weir-- said to say--- is that many of his gay readers I suspect (me included) have read far too many novels about the horrors of dying of AIDS before the cocktail became available in the mid-90's and would like to forget not our friends but the unspeakable suffering associated with their deaths. Furthermore, Zack is one of the most unsympathetic characters (yep, it is hard to like him or identify with him) that I have encountered in a long time. Far too many of my friends, both close and casual, died of AIDS in the 1980's. While most of them may have been frightened and angry and did not go gentle into that good night, none of them acted at all like Zack.But enough snarking. There are a lot of reasons to read this novel. Tom is a fine instructor who cares about his students. He and other characters make witty and profound statements about a lot of things: His straight friend Richie he describes as like a lapsed Catholic in a Graham Greene novel who knows that people are \\"worthless scum, but he can't get over the possibility of grace.\\" A rule about being in hospitals is that \\"the longer you stay, the longer you stay.\\" Zack's definition of being married (something I have said for years) is together all the time with no sex. Jack's comment, \\"if you think playground bullies are mean to fags, you should go to a gay bar\\" hits home. When Zack says, after finding out that his T-cell count is lower than his IQ, that if he were Dan Quayle, he would already be dead, should make the most jaded reader smile. How about Richie's definition of a date as \\"buying drinks for someone you don't intend to call\\"? Or Tom's comment on why he is not a bisexual since it doubles one's chances of being rejected? It is a little like a witty comment by a friend of mine when he grew a beard. He opined that he got rejected now, when he went to bars, by a much better class of people.Finally in what is the most brilliant passage in this novel we have Tom on his irrevocably straight student Justin: Well, I'm a gay man writing fiction. If I were Dennis Cooper, I'd cut him up, but tenderly. If I were Edmund White, I'd rhapsodize about his ass. If I were Genet, we'd be in prison. If I were John Rechy, talking to Justin would cost me fifty bucks. Gore Vidal would make me kill him. Mary Renault would pretend he's Greek, and we'd be headed across the Peloponnese in golden chain mail. In Proust, he's a girl; in Tennessee Williams, I'm the girl; in Colette, we're both girls. Gertrude Stein would turn him into a verb phrase. Virinia Woolf would give him a sex change. Oscar Wilde would have him sit for his portrait. . .\\" This passage alone makes this novel worth reading.WHAT I DID WRONG is also a novel about New York City. Reading it made me want to visit this great city again."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Weir is such a good writer it's a shame I didn't like this very much. He has a great eye for detail and a way with a descriptive phrase and a metaphor, but that's the problem. Way too much description. Every house on every block, every street he travels, an entire paragraph describing a car -- the endless details cover up the fact that there's not much in the way of plot, and for a non-New Yorker, a lot of the geography means nothing. And the material doesn't seem new -- a catalog of friends dying horrible slow deaths from AIDS, a best girlfriend, a hard time at school, an improbable crush on a straight kid -- I feel this has all been covered before. Zach, the dead friend who still haunts Tom, was angry and bitter and even Tom admits he didn't much like him towards the end. So why should the reader like him in the flashbacks, without knowing why they were such great friends? The straight kid is a cypher who happens to write poetry. In fact, there isn't much to Tom, either, so I really couldn't care about all the bad decisions he made, and toward the end I was committing the ultimate sign of boredom -- I started skimming. There were some funny moments and some witty dialog, but I really wanted to just shake Tom and tell him to stop living in the past and get get a life. If you relish the beauty of a well-crafted sentence, you'll enjoy this book. If you expect a novel to have a story that involves you, I wouldn't recommend it."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"I'm not sure how anyone could feel the form of Weir's novel is problematic - it's discursive structure perfectly suits this tender and acerbically witty work. The narrator, Tom, (a subtle nod to Tennessee Williams, perhaps?) wrestles with the arc of his life and his choices - a neat, condensed story with a linear time frame would not only miss the point, but be a damn sight less entertaining as well. There's not a page that goes by without at least one genuine laugh, insight and heart rending insight - often all at once. Leave aside its rather prodigious poignance and intelligence (both of which steadily stream from the pages), Weir can flat out write with a command and relish few can match."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Yo, it's me John Weir. I wrote this book! It's true. My mother told me never to respond to critics - she meant my 6th grade gym class - but, whatever, I can't stop myself, and so I just want to ask: What's all this about my novel, *What I Did Wrong*, not having a plot? Or \\"much of a plot?\\" For one thing, it has a lot of plots. Somebody dies, somebody has sex in a doorway, somebody gets a job in Queens, somebody boxes naked with his high school best friend: Is that not enough action for you?Second of all, who says plots have to be all about physical action in the world? Can't plots also have to do with a character reflecting on his or her life and seeing connections between and among events - learning what her or his life has been about, in other words? Does it always have to be, like, \\"And in the end it turned out that Rosebud was his sled?\\" Or, you know, \\"Guess what? Bruce Willis is dead!\\" Alfred Hitchcock himself admitted that a plot was a kind of giant false lead that mattered very little in terms of the overall arc of the story. Ever see Hitchcock's *The 39 Steps*? The big mystery is, Who killed the overdressed German lady who picks up Robert Donat at a magic show? That's the ostensible plot. And: What are the 39 steps? Watching the movie, though, you realize pretty quickly that Hitchcock couldn't really care less about murderers and mysteries. Mostly, he wants to show you how a man and a woman who hate each other get handcuffed together and end up sharing a bed and then falling in love. It's kind of a (very) soft-core porno film in the middle of this supposed mystery. Really, it's Hitchcock's wet dream - being handcuffed to a pretty blonde! What does big old Alfred care about \\"plot?\\" It's a device put there in order to let us have our sex guilt-free, a roll-in-the-hay in the guise of a \\"plot.\\"And, I mean, \\"plot?\\" There must be a *plot?* What about the whole history of 20th century art? Ever see a movie by Michelangelo Antonioni? *L'Avventura*! A bunch of rich Italians get on a boat and lie around in early '60s swimwear until one of them disappears. They dock alongside a craggy island and search for her for a while, but, whatever, sooner or later they sort of give up, they never find her, and, in any case, wouldn't you rather watch Monica Vitti wander around Sicily in sleeveless tailored sack dresses than search for someone you hardly know on a cold and rainy island? The movie lets go of its big plot point really early on, just drifts away from it, and then you're free to forget about plot and think about more important stuff, like, \\"Why are these people so unhappy?\\" Or, \\"What's happening under the surface of their everyday ordinary lives?\\" Or, \\"Who knew Sicily had so many big empty town squares?\\" Or, \\"If you were Monica Vitti, would you sleep with *that* guy?\\"Antonioni's movies tease you with plot and then wander away from it. It's deliberate: Once you're denied the traditional conventions of \\"plot,\\" you're forced to re-think the mechanics of cause-effect, and to concentrate instead, and way more acutely than you normally would, on stuff like landscape, and gesture, and image, and the passage of time.\\"Plot,\\" in other words, has been proven long ago to be a variable component of narrative, not a necessary one. The plot of *my* book is hooked to external events, but also to internal ones, and I think the novel's movement is mostly about how people deal with trauma, how trauma disorients us, how it interferes with our own personal day-to-day narratives; how feelings of traumatic loss tend to rupture the linear flow of events; how your whole life can sometimes seem to be happening in an instant. To other people, you appear to be moving through your day, but in fact you're stuck in your head reliving a jumble of moments and events that may or may not add up to who you are right now, or ever were, or want to be.Okay, and here's another question: Who wants to \\"identify\\" with a book? You know, because, I mean, some people are all, \\"I didn't like that book because I couldn't identify with the characters.\\" Or, \\"Well, I just didn't see myself reflected in it anywhere. It was not about me.\\" And, all right, I'm as egotistical as the next guy, but: I like to read books that are not *at all* about me. I would rather *not* identify with a novel's characters. Isn't it more fun when a work of art doesn't reflect your experience in any way? Not that I'm calling my book a work of art. Just: What is this notion that every artwork has to \\"include\\" us? Isn't that kind of limiting? Do we all have to be spoonfed happy images of ourselves in order to enjoy a novel? The novels I cherish most are books that challenge, frustrate, even appall me. I wouldn't like to think I'm anything like aging, raging-and-marauding Mickey Sabbath in Philip Roth's *Sabbath's Theater*, but it's a beautiful book, spectacularly well-written, all the moreso because it shows you an irresistible character who, in real life, you'd maybe spit on, or cross the street to avoid, or turn over to the police.I don't think of novels as self-help manuals. I don't get upset when they show me the landscape of places I have never been, or the personalities of people I hope I will never be. I'm not saying anybody has to like my book, but I sometimes wish people would be more thoughtful about the reasons they maybe *don't* like it.Okay, I'm crabby, Mercury is retrograde, I'll regret writing this in the morning, forgive me, my mother was right, I don't know anything, and, in any case, thanks for buying my book.Very sincerely,John Weir."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Tom, the main protagonist in John Weir's eloquent What I Did Wrong, proves that memory and recollection is a powerful force. Moving through almost thirty years of his life, Tom recounts his often-painful experiences growing up different in suburban Jersey. Picked on by the world around him, Tom was seen as a sissy, pushed and punched for being effeminate, his first public beating coming when he was 11 years old and he never once cried or complained.From an early age, Tom realizes that he will never be able to deliver the masculine ideal, damaged by his own natural inclinations, continuously tortured by school yard bullies, he grows older thinking it was him that did wrong. We first meet Tom at forty-two. He's now working in Queens teaching English literature to undergraduates, and has just fallen in love with Justin, one of his students.It's been six years since his best friend Zack died of AIDS, and finally Tom is able to let someone get inside of him again, \\"past the blood brain barrier.\\" Justin is a sensitive \\"boy poet\\" who tells Tom that he \\"wants to be surrounded by literature just like you,\\" Whilst Tom throws caution to the wind, letting his feelings run away from him, attracted to Justin's broad shoulders and surprisingly small hands.Tom decides to confide all this to his old childhood friend Ritchie. School buddies, they've known each other for more than twenty-five years, sometimes close and sometimes distant, it was Ritche that provided Tom with solace at school during the worst of the harassment, the only person who took the time to address Tom's particular dilemma - how does one become more of a man while growing up in such a mannish and truculent world?Of course, life never works out the way you want it to. Tom grows older, moves to New York, and encounters a city with it's glittering towers and its hard, gold light, and its promises that life consists primarily of losing things. After all, this is the early eighties, and the age of AIDS and as Tom comes out, his rite-of-passage into adult hood is riddled with anxiety.Tom watches Zak orchestrating his death from almost the minute they meet, diagnosed with AIDS in 1989; Zack is Tom's \\"first raging angry queer.\\" A self-proclaimed professional author, Zack \\"takes over the plot\\" and Tom makes him \\"the star of his life,\\" as Tom steadily watches the dying Zak being eating away by this terrible disease.Zak's eventual death is heart wrenching, and while he dies enraged with a form of terrible and special narcissism, Tom is finally cut loose, the fantasy of losing him \\"more beautiful than anything we have done in life.\\" Tom's just an average guy whose friend had died, but nothing he had learned in the last thirty-five years had prepared him for this.Author John Weir has spun is a complicated and intricate morality tale that deals with the important themes of growing up as an outsider and the critical choices that can confront a middle-aged g*y man, tormented by grief and loss and sexual longing. The only way Tom can really be happy and quell his middle-aged rage is by coming to terms with his tormented past.In the drama of Tom's young life, he is vexed to climax by being tortured by the torturing boys, caught in a web of masculinity, \\"in which our dads are twisting our arms, offering love and abuse.\\" In middle age, he's overwhelmed by a passion he can't realistically have, yet his love for Justin continually forces him to confront the men, the manly ghosts of his childhood, the mythical fathers and sons showing off their strength or crying in one another's arms.In beautiful prose, Weir perfectly conveys Tom's confusion and anger and eventual recognition of a condemnatory world in which he must escape. Gradually, Tom does indeed forge a new life for himself in New York, however much of a struggle it may be. It's a life that is a mixture of pain, and tragedy, and the always-present romantic anticipation, that is sometimes serene and even hectic with desire.

That said, I didn't agree with everything he said, nor did I make every revision he suggested. He always judged my writing professionally and honestly, and I wouldn't insult him by doing less.There's not a tremendous reliance on plot in this novel--college professor Tom and various friends and acquaintances spend a strange day together while Tom reminisces about his past.

The one that resonates most strongly for me: The idea that so many of us, approaching middle age or already there, are still trying to figure out what we're doing with our lives; that is, although we're functioning and earning money and doing things that are reasonably productive, we still don't necessarily know why, and it still doesn't necessarily feel good.As you read, take the time to enjoy the descriptions of the various settings, not only the places throughout NYC but the individual apartments and offices and bars. Like so many of the great Southern writers, John has turned these places into supplemental characters, and some of my biggest laughs came from this (I thought the staff at Starbucks was going to call the men in white coats on me a couple of times). You'll definitely laugh more than you'll feel weepy, in large part due to John's ability to infuse even the saddest moments with dry humor--just like real life.All that said, I didn't think this was a perfect novel. My middle-aged attention span had some trouble with the structure and I found myself confused a couple of times during the flashback sequences. If this is a tendency you have as a reader, stopping only at the ends of chapters should take care of it. And I might have spent more time with the relationship between Tom and Justin, and less time at the bar.My conclusion: Buy the book--it's really inexpensive here--and don't expect a beach-read. Do expect a thought-provoking journey."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"fluid and funny and charming -- and smart about who we are and how we get there. I loved this book!the structure felt completely natural to me, like thinking"},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Lyrical in its Whitmanesque trips down the LIE, across Queens; tragic in that the main character carries personal tragedies to every moment he experiences in the single day that the novel comprises; flashback after flashback, but seamless. And somehow, the novel and its narrator have nothing but respect -- and sometimes admiration -- for bridge-and-tunnel kids who think they're writers."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"Since the narrator is a gay creative writing instructor, we can expect him to have witty gay friends, who can chatter like brightly-colored jungle birds and whose witticisms we get to read. But this novel covers the AIDS era, so we also get the deaths of these gay friends, often rendered in harrowing detail. I often cringed when it seemed like he was going to have sex with one of his students, but he does seem to recognize academic boundaries and settles for merely holding the student's penis.Some of the writing is just overwrought. It's as if the teacher had given his students an assignment to write the most bizarre and complicated similes and provided some of his own as examples to follow. And his prose is then larded with these hothouse similes of his that might have been better left in the classroom. (\\"The sun is hauling ass like a Mets fan out of a losing game in the bottom of the eighth, and the plane swoops near enough to drag its livid gut across our cheeks.\\" p. 128. I can see where a creative writing teacher might approve of this, but I as the reader did not.)There are some scenes that go on too long. I didn't enjoy the long passage about being in a bar that was having a rock band contest, but this was soon followed by a brilliant passage about a pilgrimage to Herman Melville's grave. You don't like the past tense? Wait a bit and he'll switch to the present tense.I must stress that the prose often goes beyond purple (\\"...we wander together over the burning marl and stinging shores of flaming lakes, the tender architecture of our paws baked black....\\" p. 129. Again, creative writing class stuff, not necessarily published novel stuff.)I could relate to the narrator and his problems. I could certainly see that the types of friends he had were the types of friends that I had, the ones who died of AIDS but could still deliver lacerating queeny insults to the bitter end. I can recommend this novel, especially if you enjoy a narrative voice that enjoys displaying itself like a peacock in lust."},{"Title":"What I Did Wrong: A Novel","review":"I forget where I'd first heard of \\"What I Did Wrong\\", but it sounded interesting enough to buy from one of the Amazon resellers. The book is basically a stream of consciousness, day in the life of a Queens College English professor (h/t to James Joyce, who receives a passing mention). By revolving around a single day, the story encompasses many years of the narrator's life and his interactions with the other principals. The characters are fairly stock with varying degrees of development and divergence from type. Like many gay lit protagonists, the narrator is a sensitive boy who was called a \\"fag\\" and taunted/beat up by everyone through school. He's also the gay guy who has always fallen for straight guys. Fortunately, his life also has had fairly typical elements for someone who came of age in the 70s and majored in the liberal arts (dope smoking and road trips in high school, underemployment for years after completing a liberal arts degree) and the story doesn't get lost in the usual cliches about sensitive boys. The other characters are past or present obsessions in his life--Richie, his straight friend from high school (the cool best friend who brightened his world then, but is as unevolved as him now and darkens his current life); Justin, the straight student who elicits lust from him now; Zack, his now dead (from AIDS) love of his life, and in a smaller role, Ava, the pan sexual, semi-girlfriend who also had a strong bond with Zack. Richie is a familiar type from life and fiction---the guy who was cool and likable as an adolescent, but unfortunately has kept the same level of emotional development as a 40 year old. The narrator tries to sell Justin to us as the kind of kid who used to beat up on him, but mostly he seems like a downmarket version of a familiar kind of liberal arts major---someone who listens to indie rock, writes poetry, and is involved with girl who annoys everyone around her. DC is full of more privileged version of Justin and I often see them being nagged by their girlfriends or patiently listening as the girlfriend complains about everyone else in their lives. Zack is the angry New Yorker and reminded me of a grad school classmate of mine who was dying of a different deadly disease--he, too, had a sharp tongue and lacerating wit that somehow drew people to him rather than driving them away. Ava is probably the most interesting character because she is a bit less of a type--the narrator sees her as someone who would make a great male friend, a description which seems incomplete. She also seems to lack the pettiness and jealousies that are common to males, gay or straight.It becomes apparent that the narrator avoided AIDS because his sex life has mostly existed in his fantasies. Indeed, his sexuality still seems mostly in his head and probably explains why he hasn't evolved much from his adolescent worship of Richie. Late in the book, it's revealed why he drifted away from Richie and, ironically, it was because Richie tried to get him to move beyond himself. By choosing an academic and a college setting, Wier has picked an environment that rarely sparks excitement and the ruminations of a prof whose stuck in his own head aren't exactly pieces with wide appeal (if anything they particularly lack appeal for some people who happily left world behind). The narrator's ethical shortcomings, if anything, make him less sympathetic even though he acknowledges what is wrong.The book held my interest well enough to see it through, but there was a lot that could have been improved with some assertive editing. . The ending is a bit too predictable and ties things together a bit too neatly. It does this by showing how the narrator fails to \\"grow\\" from his experience, but the same thing could have been accomplished without resorting to an ending that is more neatly constructed than the rest of the book. The prose lapses back in forth from the present day or very recent past to the distant past, and the narrator's relationship with Zack. Often the switches seem arbitrary and the transitions are, at best, a little abstract in their purpose. The book would have benefits from more backstory and development of most of the characters--Richie is too much of a cliche and it would help to have some novel way of explaining how he's remained that way. There are inklings, toward the end, that there is more to him than has met the eye (esp. in the past), but more of this sort of thing would have made him a stringer character. Much the same could be said about Justin, who starts as one stereotype and evolves into another. Certainly not a bad book, but not one to put at the top of your list."},{"Title":"The Undiet: PAINLESS BABY STEPS TO PERMANENT WEIGHT LOSS WITHOUT A DAY ON A DIET","review":"This book contains everything you'll ever need to know about reaching your ideal weight &amp; maintaining it while adding years to your life.

Eat lots of snacks, and you will automatically lose weight.Unfortunately, the human body is not fooled by a few calories denied here and there. Most of these strategies only work in the lab, not when people have the freedom and responsibility to allow their hunger to select for them the foods and quantities thereof they should eat. Like so many diets and the books that push them, the driving assumption in this book is that we can independently cut calories, the body will not notice, and we will just become slender.The few people she uses as examples sound more like isolated exceptions than a large enough in number to support her claims.And the exclamation points after so many sentences get really grating! It must be true! There's at least one exclamation point in every paragraph!Each of us must find our own strategy for making the changes in our lives that will help us lose weight and keep it off. It has taken us a lifetime to learn the bad habits that now unconsciously control our eating, and this book doesn't even address that. Perhaps this series of \\"baby steps\\" worked for the author, but I get the feeling that most of them are not even related to the changes she says caused her to lose weight.I've lost 20 pounds by making changes like those suggested inThe Anderson Method - The Secret to Permanent Weight Loss.If you're looking for a \\"diet\\" system where you are spoon-fed the changes you \\"must make\\", this will save you from having to do any deep thought to figure out what your weaknesses and bad habits are are in order to create strategies that will work for you in the real world.

Black offers a wealth of insights as, for example, the following quotations and remarks:p. 2 \\"Don't worry about what you have already written. Just keep on beginning to think afresh as if nothing at all had happened yet\\" (Notebooks, 30 (6)).p. 3 \\"The baldest summary of Wittgenstein's conception might run as follows: Reality (\`the world') is a mosaic of independent items - the \`atomic facts'; each of these is like a chain in which \`objects' (logical simples) \`hang in one another'; the objects are connected in a network of logical possibilities (\`logical space'); the simplest \`elementary' propositions are pictures of atomic facts, themselves facts in which names are concatenated, and all other propositions are truth-functions of the elementary ones; language is the great mirror in which the logical network is reflected, \`shown', manifested. If we add the notions of names deputizing for objects, of logical propositions as limiting cases of contingent propositions, and the pervasive notions of logical form and of essence, we shall have a serviceable list of Wittgenstein's chief leitmotifs.\\"p. 7 \\"It was one of Wittgenstein's distinctive innovations to consider thoughts only as embodied in what he calls the \`significant proposition' and so to transform the question of the relation of thought to reality...into the more promising question of the relation of language to reality.\\"My thoughts on page 11 - would \\"logical space\\" be something very like Plato's world of ideas?In short, this is a book that serves as a useful and constant companion to the Tractatus. It would certainly be best to read the Tractatus first, perhaps in conjunction with a reading of Monks' book on Wittgenstein, but then the companion certainly functions in magnificent ways to expand an understanding of the Tractatus."},{"Title":"Dangerous Dreamers: The Financial Innovators from Charles Merrill to Michael Milken","review":"While it wasn't quite what I expected, I have to give the book high marks. It is less about innovation and more about how the junk bond market arose from a historical perspective leading from the LBO and greenmail period. The author provided numerous insights connecting Greenmail, Junk Equity, and Junk bonds as well as the major players. He makes a cogent and compelling counter-argument to the Den of Thieves depiction of Mike Milken.It is definitely interest to point out who was tapped to go to jail relative to those that were guilty. It is also interesting to note the timing and potentially political driven characteristics of who went to jail and why.Were the book falls short for Practioners is that it lacks more detailed accounts of innovation and how the innovation occurred. Instead, it is clear that it is attempting to describe the actors and players of innovation. This more true towards the end than the beginning.For example, it was incredibly spot on to note the rise of the Pension fund structure and the consolidation of money pools that did not originate around the elite society. This was new and had significant impact. It was impressive to point out the rise and fall of the equities market, and how this changed the spectrum of return expectations. Possibly linking the funding considerations/return considerations that grew out of this with respect to the Pension funds might have been salient.Similarly, while he from time to time discusses the discount rate, there is only a hint at why the discount rates huge volatility over the period escalated the junk bond market demand as well as sent it crashing.I love that he mentions Mondiglioni's work and that he gives fair voice to the junk bond market innovations as having grown separately from major maturation of the LBO market. He may be one of few that I read that do not just lump these two innovations together. So big thumbs up there.Overall, a great read, since most of the actors in the book are still alive and very important in the financial market today."},{"Title":"Rommel's War In Africa","review":"This is an interesting book mostly because of the viewpoint of the author. The author is a German who does not think Rommel was all that great.

The British were horribly led in the begining (with some notable exceptions) leading to numerous German victories.This is not a \\"must read.\\" But it is worth the time and the unique viewpoint of the author makes it quite informative."},{"Title":"How Old Will You Be in 1984","review":"\\"In more than 250 selections of writings and graphic art from the newest underground-the high school free press-Diane Divoky has provided a portrait of a new and dynamic breed of American youth. These are the people who say, 'As you sit in that drab classroom, as you stare at the teacher who stares back at you from behind his mahogany desk, as you scribble obscenities on your desk, of pine, no doubt you have many times wondered-WHAT THE HELL AM I DOING HERE?' These are people who speak in a new vocabulary and utter inflammatory statements and think critically in ways which would not have occurred to earlier generations.\\"Was high school in 1969 really that bad? Yes, but time heals all. Was the writing in underground newspapers really this bad? Not in my high school, but time also plays tricks on the memory. Our underground newspaper in 1971, if you could get a copy before they were confiscated and weren't afraid of getting suspended if they caught you reading it, had pretty much the same topics as this collection. The dress code, drugs, profanity, education.A lot of the material reprinted here was interesting and outrageous in 1969, but is not as timely now. Still, reading these articles brings back a time when these topics were fresh and exciting. It is worth wading through some less interesting articles to read something like \\"Twas midnight and the FBI Did grope and giggle in the trees..\\" the poem being titled JEDGARHOOVY, or read an article about a new brand of superheroes with lousy personalities that indulge in petty bickering and resent each other. My personal favorite is a five page review of a two word poem. \\"As every English teacher and poetry critic knows, an author's intended meaning is usually irrelevant to the true analysis of the poem...This paper (due to lack of space) will deal only with one type of ambiguities: the extremely subtle, well-hidden type.\\"The book was written against the backdrop of Vietnam, but Vietnam is not mentioned in the book. The draft would not become a lottery until 1971. In our high school, the writers of articles like these were often senior males with uncertain futures who might be drafted soon. The humor is cynical rather than cute; the reader is invited to sneer rather than giggle. The subject of Vietnam was certainly one that tore apart communities at the time.

Callahan refuses to believe that Patti's death is a random robbery and senseless murder, and sets out to find her own suspects and conduct her own investigation. In fact, she's being so mule-headed about the whole thing that she puts her own life in danger.I've enjoyed this series about a former Atlanta police officer who's now owner of the House Mouse cleaning service. Granted, Callahan's mother has always rubbed my fur the wrong way with her methods of getting her daughter to do as she wants, but I could overlook that. Unfortunately, in Homemade Sin there were a few too many things I couldn't overlook.For one thing, I can't help but compare this series to Ann Purser's Lois Meade series centered on a woman running her own house cleaning agency in small town England. Purser's series wins, hands down. It's obvious that Callahan had a career previous to House Mouse, and by the way she's always haring off to do something else, her heart isn't in her current career. On the other hand, Lois keeps a tight rein on her business, takes care of her family and solves crimes.Trocheck's series, set in Atlanta, also has a tendency to limit African American characters to the roles of domestics, gang bangers and project dwellers, which didn't set well with me.But what really got up my nose is the behavior of Callahan herself. At the very beginning of the book, there really isn't any evidence to support Callahan's belief that Patti's murder was planned. I'm sorry, but Callahan's guilt over not talking to or visiting with her cousin as often as she should have in recent years just isn't evidence to me. Our intrepid heroine then proceeds to ride rough-shod over everyone else in the family to pursue her gut feeling. She has no respect for anyone else's feelings or wishes. Then she pouts when family members give her the Silent Cold Shoulder Treatment. Gah!Yes, Callahan was proved right, but I'm still annoyed with her. Hmm... see why I have enjoyed this series?

The problem, which Huxley tumbled into in this brief but eloquent book, is that both disciplines are pathways to understanding the natural world and human feelings rather than definitive guideposts or definitions. The human tragedy, as well as scientfic heresy, is a belief in any \\"final solution\\".The heart of this book is the observation by Lord Acton \\"that liberty under law . . . . . is the end of all political action, all social and economic arrangements.\\" This is the crux of history, the persistent struggle to maximize individual freedom without inhibiting the rights of others. Freedom is not a destination, a Shangri La of the mind; it is a way of living that has been debated since at least the dawn of written accounts.Huxley errs quickly, in his first paragraph, \\"All that is being maintained here is that progressive science is one of the causative factors involved in the progressive decline of liberty and the progressive centralization of power\\". In other words, more knowledge means less freedom. If Huxley is right, the vast increase in science in America since 1945 implies the McCarthy era was freer than today; and the Soviet Union of Stalin was freer than the Russia of Putin.In Russia, scientists such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn were among the first and strongest leaders in the struggle for freedom; in the US, technologists such as Steve Jobs and Bill Gates are among the leaders in expanding freedom. It's those who spread fear and doubt, such as Rush Limbaugh and Pat Robertson, who are the true enemies of freedom.Huxley stumbles across the impact of these nattering nabobs of negativism in his book, but adroitly dances around every obvious misstep in a nimble display of the British ability to cynically expect everything to fail. In brief, the truth is almost the exact opposite of everything he proposes.So what is the arcane value of this book?It is a reminder of the nobility of the human spirit in overcoming setbacks, detours and distractions in the perpetual quest for freedom. Why a perpetual quest? It's simply because the values we call \\"freedom\\" change as our society and our personal attitudes change. It's why freedom, science, and religion, is a way of life and not a destination.In religion, \\"Heaven\\" is a destination beyond this earth for those who live a specific way of life . . . . . as defined by the priesthood. The same applies to the true believers in politics. In science, as in freedom, no one has yet invented \\"heaven\\". It is why deep thinkers are so often disturbed by the vagaries of science, as well as freedom, and yet so certain about religion and politics.It's worth buying for anyone who needs reassurance that the worst of the famed British cynicism never comes true, and people are really much better than they believe. After 'Brave New World' in 1932, it is just the type of self-justification one could expect. The scholarship is delightful, the conclusion abysmal."},{"Title":"Conservatism","review":"This book contains many excellent essays, and is quite good in showing the differences between conservatism and similar right-wing ideologies (i e libertarianism, religious fundamentalism etc). Although a European could view it as a bit free-market biased (Hayek is represented, Disraeli isn't). The introductions to the various political essays are very helpful in placing them in their historical context."},{"Title":"Conservatism","review":"I found my way to this volume after listening to the author's excellent course on capitalism for the Teaching Company. In a little under five hundred pages, Prof. Muller presents an excellent selection of conservative thought in both its pre-capitalist and liberal varieties, with interesting and clarifying expository essays to accompany them. In presenting conservatism as a form of historical utilitarianism, which I believe is correct, he is unable to contest the claim that conservative arguments are simply made in bad faith in order to defend existing power structures. Yet the argument that emancipation and expansion of knowledge and opportunities can actually leave the individual in despair and alienation is well taken if not always convincing. It is telling, for example, that such paternalistic arguments were made for slavery but are not mentioned in the main body of this text (they are in a footnote)."},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","review":"One thing that was always impressive about the X-Men was that it was one of the few superhero comic books where the definitive villain popped up in the first issue. Of course we are talking about Magneto the Mutant Master of Magneticism. The same thing was true for &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; where Marvel essentially restarted the series in contemporary times, reconceptualizing some of the core elements. For example, this time around the original X-Men combine Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Beast and Iceman from the first lineup with Storm and Colossus from the second (with Wolverine being recruited from the dark side so that he can appear on every cover of the trade paperback reprints). The result is a lot of familiar items are condensed into each story arc, which is then collected into a trade paperback.&quot;The Return of the King&quot; is Volume 6 in the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; series and the title, of course, refers to Magneto. In the first volume in the series the X-Men fought Magneto and not only defeated him, but also apparently killed him. However, this turned out to be one of Professor X's mind games; he convinced Magneto that he was Erik Lensheer, unaware of his past life as a mutant terrorist. When the Brotherhood of Mutants discovers Magneto is still alive they find him and remove the mental blocks Xavier had placed in his minds. We are now back to the beginning in many ways, except this time around both Magneto and all the homo sapiens are very wary. In fact, the Bush Administration has Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D. going after all the mutants, including the X-Men. Since they already have Xavier in custody, stopping Magneto is going to be a problem.Actually, stopping Magneto is always a problem. For a long time I have been convinced that Magneto would actually win and the reason I liked the first volume of this series so much was that I thought it recognized this fact by having Professor X and the X-Men going up against Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants go at it just once for all the marbles. In the end Magneto should have been dead because he should be unstoppable in a rematch; indeed, look at what ends up doing in this one, extending his magnetic reach across the entire planet. Besides, if you can explode nuclear reactors, why stop at just one? Magneto is simply the most dangerous super villain in the Marvel (or Ultimate) universe. When they were retooling him they should have ratcheted down his power level a couple of notches (Actually, they should do the same thing for Xavier as well).But since Magneto winning would mean coming up with a new title for the comic book, Magneto has to be defeated. Once again the key is getting his helmet off of his head and while I like the way that happens this time around, I still do not really buy that anybody could get close enough to actually do it. Besides, as is often the case with these Ultimate titles, things end up reflecting the blockbuster movies (e.g., Magneto, living in a plastic cage). Clearly one of the defining elements of the X-Men today is the relationship between Charles Xavier and Erik Lensherr and the first issue of &quot;Return of the King&quot; provides an encapsulated version of their history (as well as a new explanation for how Xavier ended up in his wheelchair). Certainly there is something to be said for the ongoing debate that the pair have been having for over a decade.Collected in &quot;Return of the King&quot; are issues #26-33 of &quot;Ultimate X-Men,&quot; written by Mark Millar, and illustrated by Adam Kubert and David Finch, with Ray and Ben Lai. The most interesting addition to the X-Men mythos this time around is the sub-plot in which Wolverine finds a way to get Cyclops out of the way so that he can make a move on Jean Grey, especially given the intriguing idea that Logan and Scott are Charles and Eric, the next generation. Most of the relationships between the Ultimate X-Men (e.g., Colossus and Wolverine, Beast and Storm) are more interesting as well. Sometimes I think the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; is overloaded with ideas, but for those who remember Marvel's Mery Mutants from the very beginning the changes are always something to think about.Final Question: Since the Ultimate version of Nick Fury is African-American (apparently there were Howlin' Commandos in the Vietnam War), does that explain why Colin Powell was omitted from the White House discussions while Dick Chaney and Donald Rumsfeld were not? Just curious at that rather interesting omission."},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","review":"This TP collection contains the finest story arc yet for The Ultimate X-Men. Magneto is loose. The Ultimates want him after he has massacred hundreds of innocents in bridge collapse, and they figure the best way to get him is through The X-Men. Meanwhile, romantic jealousies lead to tragedy and betrayal as the Wolverine, Scott Summers , Jean Grey triangle goes over the boiling point. This series coincided with The Ultimate War, which you should read as well. Heck, read The Ultimates so you understand what this is all about. Great art, breathtaking plot twists and the great dialogue that only Mark Millar can provide. Don't miss this collection!"},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","review":"First keep in mind that this should be considered an alternate universe version of the X-Men. That way you won't be screaming about the differences from the regular comics. If you've already read through volume 5, \\"Ultimate War\\", the opening does not pick up where that left off. It traces the rise and fall of the partnership between Professor Xavier and Magneto for the first 20 pages or so.Magneto is getting ready to destroy the entire human race, except for a token man and woman. The X-Men are in hiding, although they do make an attempt to rehabilitate their image and track down Magneto. Prof. X has been moved to that detention unit for mutants in Cuba that was threatned in \\"Ultimate War\\". Cyclops is not dead (was anyone expecting he would be?), but he's not in good condition. Of course the X-Men will save the day, Prof. X will escape, and Magneto will be foiled, but there'll be plenty of fighting, explosions, and a threatened nuclear meltdown.Loved the part where Storm meets the Beast's parents, not to mention having my suspicion about Xavier's cat confirmed.The final scene between Xavier and Magneto is my favorite part of the book."},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","review":"Collecting a large volume (Ultimate X-Men # 26-33) there is, surprisingly, not a whole lot going on in this collection and what the main storylines are are frequently chopped up heavily throughout the books. For those (like myself) unfamiliar with the individual prints there are no \\"chapters\\" here wherein they delineate where the last issue separates from the following issue by a placeholder cover (those are at the end and are by no means exceptional artistically or indicative of the storys within the book). Entitled \\"The Return of the King\\" (which ostensibly refers to Magneto, every bit a true villain in this series, but it could just as easily and cleverly refer to Professor X), the main storylines are: a backstory of Xavier and Magneto going off to create their utopia and then having their falling out; Cyclops' supposed death at the hands of Wolverine; and the battle with Mags and his minions. All of this follows volumes 1-4 which were very good (I haven't gotten my mitts on volume 5 yet) but this collection is the least of the volumes so far given its anti-climactic nature of the story and a narrative that is chopped up to follow smaller storylines throughout large portions of this book--these storylines are given two to three pages each before switching back to former storylines and while this is an usual ploy within comics it simply reduces the narrative tension (what there is, that is) here. The denouements of this book's story arcs are equally unsatisfying for a number of reasons which I won't go into in order to avoid spoilers. Suffice to say that if you've seen the X-Men movies (especially 1 & 2) then there's not going to be a lot new to you here and it won't galvanize you to want to read on as the earlier volumes did. The art's fine, not fantastic or anyting, but here's hoping that they give Magneto a long and deserved rest."},{"Title":"Ultimate X-Men Vol. 6: Return of The King","review":"Although not \\"The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King\\" this arc lives up to the name of the Ultimate X-Men! Xavier is in SHIELD custody at Camp X-Factor in Cuba, and Magneto has a large plan to wipe out the human race and make Earth a haven for mutants. Get this: A flying castle that carries a cerebro-like device that can augment Magneto's powers tenfold, and he plans to use it to reverse the Earth's magnetic poles and wipe out humanity! Just the kind of plan you'd expect from Magneto! And no one can stop him except for the X-Men!What I really loved about this volume was the battle between the X-Men and Magneto, how the X-Men must hide from the government, the fact that Wolverine left Cyclops to die in the Savage Land o get Jean Grey for himself (see Vol. 4), the backstory of Xavier's and Magneto's fallout and their conversation in Magneto's plastic prison cell, and especially the artwork by David Finch! Next to Ron Garney, David Finch is the best modern Marvel Comics artist!If you are a true Ultimate X-Men, or even Ultimate Marvel fan, definitely add this volume to your collection!

The title page includes a brief synopsis that should help you understand what's going on if you haven't read the earlier volumes. If you want a roll call, this volume includes the \\"ultimate\\" line versions of Magneto, Professor X, Dr. Moira MacTaggert, Nick Fury, Sabretooth, Multiple Man, Mastermind, Nightcrawler, Forge, the Blob, Iceman, Colossus, Storm, Wolverine, Jean Grey, Cyclops, Shadowcat, Rogue, and a mutant called Detonator whom I have not run across in the regular Marvel X-Men, but I'm still catching up. There's also a cameo by another mutant, but I don't want to spoil the surprise.This book opens by showing us how Magneto and Prof. X worked together, how their friendship deteriorated over several years, and, in more detail, how Magneto crippled Xavier. Then it moves into the present day and Magneto's progress on his refuge for mutants as well as the unpleasant scene where he deals with plans for a satellite mutant tracker. Meanwhile, the X-Men-in-hiding are dealing with Magneto's brotherhood in the hope of rehabilitating their image.Is the rumor that Wolverine deliberately left Cyclops to die in the Savage Land true?In the grand tradition of comic book villains, Magneto tells our heroes something of his frightful plan for eliminating the human-mutant relations problem. The X-Men have only a week to find Magneto's hiding place and save the world. (Let me just say that a machine, different from and much more powerful than the one used in the first X-Men movie, is involved.) The final battle certainly kept my interest.During most of the action, Professor X is being held prisoner in a S.H.I.E.L.D. detention camp for mutants suspected of being terrorists. He refuses to betray his students, of course. I reread his words of encouragement to a fellow prisoner after rereading earlier volumes and those words became a little unnerving near the end. Why?Because of what Prof. X tells Nick Fury and what he tells Magneto when they meet again late in the book. You won't have to have read the earlier volumes to speculate on whether or not Xavier is telling the truth. I'm afraid that he *is* telling the truth. If so, that would explain a couple of his moves in earlier volumes that I found incredibly stupid -- and would make this version of Prof. X a little scary.Ignore the \\"9-12\\" age group recommendation.

He covers the effects of incident electric and magnetic fields to single and paired wires over an image ground plane, lossy wires and shielded cables.

This event had a tremendous impact that endured for the rest of his life and was instrumental in his decision to take up the monastic vocation. 'Elie Lemoine' also worked as an editor of the distinguished traditionalist journal &Eacute;tudes Traditionnelles that was central in making Gu&eacute;non and other traditionalist writings accessible to wider audiences. It was in the discovery of the Ren&eacute; Gu&eacute;non's works that 'Elie Lemoine'--A Monk of the West-- found an integral metaphysical doctrine that was universal in its principles, known in the West as the philosophia perennis--perennial philosophy. The metaphysical 'doctrine of non-dualism' (advaita-vda) is not exclusive to Hinduism (san'tana dharma) alone but is also present in Buddhism, Taoism, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. It is in this universal light that Christianity and the Doctrine of Non-Dualism was articulated.Though this book on 'Christian Ved'nta' is modest in its length, it is dense in its scope and reflection. The book begins with a thorough and insightful Preface by the late perennialist Alvin Moore, Jr. (1923-2005). The work consists of eight chapters and a Forward: 'Philosophical Monism and Non-Dualism', 'I am Brahma', 'In All Things Like Unto Men', 'Without Me You Can Do Nothing', 'Who am I?', 'I am not the Christ', 'East and West' and the Conclusion.In the first chapter the author makes important distinctions that are often confused in our current era: non-dualism is neither pantheism nor monism--\\"The soul is not the Self\\" or again \\"the Self ('tm') is not the human soul (jiv'tm')\\" In the following chapter the author makes it clear that the human individual as an empirical 'ego' or 'I' is not a finality unto itself. It is not until a re-integration (samskarana) with what is Transcendent (supra-individual) that true identity can exist, for \\"there is no true identity save in God, because God alone is Identity.\\" The author continues to clarify this idea in chapter five--'Who AM I?'--when he quotes from a traditional Hindu aphorism, \\"the I is m'y' and the not-I is Brahman\\". Without this total \\"dis- identification\\" from the 'ego' or 'I', writes the author in chapter six, it is impossible for the \\"re-integration\\" with the Self ('tm') to occur, let alone the identification with the Supreme Identity (Tawh'd) or the Supreme Self (Param'tm'). In the same chapter the author clarifies the modern misunderstanding of reincarnation, \\"In reality, the reincarnationist illusion has its root in a confusion of the psychic and the spiritual.\\" This perspective is in accordance with 'di 'ankar'ch'rya's dictum, \\"In truth, there is no other transmigrant but the Lord\\" categorically denying the possibility of the human individual reincarnating per se.In closing we would like to note that there is great merit in this work as a support in facilitating once again the expression of non-dualism (advaita) within the Christian milieu as this doctrine once did in the West. This book could also broaden the current understanding and outlook of the Christian tradition which has become more and more eclipsed in the present era due to modernity and post-modernity's indefinite trend toward \\"progress\\" and secularization that radically contrasts from earlier epochs that were firmly rooted in the sacred. Such a perspective is polarized either to discredit the Christian tradition altogether believing that it has somehow failed the terrestrial masses or to provoke fundamentalism asserting a pseudo monopoly on truth itself--blinded by the assumption that the only authentic religion is Christianity ipso facto negating the possibility of all other spiritual traditions as 'paths that lead to the same summit'. Beyond such polarities the reader will be pleased to find that this book fosters religious pluralism, tolerance, inquiry and dialogue from a non-reductionistic point of view and yet simultaneously acknowledges the transcendent unity of religions."},{"Title":"Christianity and the Doctrine of Non-Dualism","review":"Even coming from a strong interest in Vedanta, I found this book extremely dense, seemingly arguing details of Christian theology in long, complicated sentences full of jargon and untranslated Latin.

This prejudice colors my perception the the text.

So when I saw this interesting sounding book, I scooped it up and checked it out. Because I can't get Twinkies here in Australia, they are one of the first purchases I make when I'm back in the States. On the cover it does mention that it is 'inventive' and 'unexpected'. They are right. It certainly is very inventive. A lady from Baton Rouge has sent in a recipe for Twinkie Sushi. Now although there is no seaweed involved (you use green fruit leather instead), the concept is still quite bizzare and I'm deciding whether I give that one a go or not.Possibly one of the 'grossest' sounding recipe is Pigs in a Twinkie - and this time there is no substitute for the sausage. You DO use sausage along with the twinkies. I'm sorry but that is one I know I won't try.Despite those weird recipes, some in the book sound and look absolutely delicious and I can't wait to give them a go. The Twinkie Burrito looks fabulous (a real burrito wrap, but with chocolate and strawberries and twinkies - how can you go wrong). There is even a wedding cake recipe.Overall, this is a fun recipe book. It is interesting, fattening, yet certainly fun and while you won't probably make everything contained in this book, you will definately be intrigued to try quite a few. Just try not to eat the twinkies before they go in the ingrediant mixture.

The recipes fall into three categories: the predictable (but yummy), the unpredictable but look like they'd be fun to make, and the downright bizarre. Most of the recipes in the book are of the more predictable recipe type, which uses Twinkies and some sort of pudding or ice cream or other binder to make things like trifles and cakes and sundaes, etc. The unpredictable but fun to make recipes include things like Twinkie Sushi, Twinkiehenge, and Twinkie Pancakes. The downright bizarre recipes include Pigs in a Twinkie, Twinkie Milkshake, and Twinkling Turkey (the Twinkie is part of the stuffing).The best part of this book is not so much the recipe collection, but rather the historical journey through Twinkiedom and all the little extra Twinkie factoids they throw in.

Also, country information is limited (ie: the only African country referenced is South Africa). But I like it anyway because of its entry pages and plethora of journal space. There is a lot packed into its slim paperback design. Also, the plastic dust jacket is highly durable and helps protect against dirt and water damage. Finally, sprinkled within the journal pages are traveler's quotes which add fun flavor. All in all, a great journal...I only wish they would update it.

The first quarter of this book, was an excellent introduction to the early spread of Islam from Mohammad's life both prior to and during his revelations of the Koran, as well as the first four Caliph's. However, after that, the book had one quick bit on the spread of Islam from Arabia, throughout N. Africa, into Spain, into the Balkans, and its halt at Vienna and in present day France. However, this portion of the book was very tersely covered, to the point where there was no substantive history there. Then the book spent an inordinant amount of time on Art in Islam, Literary Styles in Islam and other factors that either do not enter into the history of the spread of Islam, or if they do, then they weren't explained in the text. The last section of the book, on more contemporary issues such as Muslims in America were interesting, but again did not shed light on the basic aspect of the spread of Islam. In summary, I'm glad I read this book, but was disappointed overall that it strayed so far from it's apparent target."},{"Title":"The Spread of Islam (Hardcover Edition) (Turning Points in World History)","review":"\\"The spread of Islam\\" is a sort of study guide under the \\"Turning Points on World History\\" collection. The book is a collection of essays by recognized journalists and historians, most of them not embracers of the faith. It is so advised in the foreword, and it is a good way for the reader to measure the degree of impartiality each author has on the subject - or not.What is particularly interesting about a book like this is the insight it provides in what is commonly known as \\"la petite histoire\\". Thus, on page 14 we learn that ...\\" Muhammad's first visitation by an angel terrified and revulsed him. Thinking he had been possessed by the jinn\\"... \\"Shaking, Muhammad crawled on his hands and knees until he reached Khadija (his wife), asking her to cover him and shield him from the presence. She held him in her arms, soothed him and tried to take his fears away, the comfort she offered each time Muhammad saw visions and heard voices.\\" What a beautiful example of a supportive wife.Succeeding articles emphasize the much-preferred westernized notion of Islam as a faith established rather by the sword than by the word. In fact, in a world post-Osama Bin Laden, Islam seems to be a constant target for philosophers, historians and religious leaders alike to be blamed as a belligerent and intolerant faith, although in practice, its principles are openly conducive to peace. The deliverance of a new vision almost always generates controversy. In analizing the value of a doctrine, the general view of the historical context is vital. Prophet Muhammad (SAW) had a message. People could follow it or not; however, it was more than imperative that it be delivered. And it had to be delivered amidst a sociological system of usury and cruelty, where tolerance for different ideas was not only slashed, but it was also resisted to the extreme. What is a prophet to do, should we then ask, when he is not even given the option to be heard? Not only that, but he is prosecuted as a common criminal. The Gospels show us this almost constantly, to the extent that Jesus himself had to admit that \\"a prophet is never accepted in his own country\\". To paraphrase Gandhi (someone else worth listening to) first they hate you, then they laugh at you, then... you win.Central articles expound on the Golden Age of Baghdad from the 7th to the 12th century, during the period of the Abbasids. Those were the times for expansion of the arts on every level within the muslim world, the times that saw the construction of the Taj Majal in India, and the retelling of stories that would then become \\"The Thousand and One Nights\\"The book closes with articles referring to different political viewpoints within Islam, covering the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which deposed the Shah; and the plans for an Islamic Common Market, very much under the lines of the European Economic Community. These are all very scary ideas for the western world, where the typical idea of a muslim is equal almost always to someone born in any of the countries of the Arabian peninsula, who bathes once a week and has their neighbor for dessert. This perception is described on page 184: \\"...author Jack Shaheen provides examples of stereotyping. He notes the tendency to picture the Arab at different times as extremely wealthy, cruel, stupid, oriented toward the use of terror, and generally unattractive. The stereotypic pattern which categorizes whole peoples has thus put the Arab and his religion in the role of villain.\\"The last essay offers a perspective into the daily life of a muslim woman living in America, and an Appendix, which provides further illumination with sides stories about verses of the Holy Qu'ran, poetry about the forbidden pleasures of drinking, a cooking recipe in the form of a poetical stanza, and other curiosities. Last, but not least, we find some very good advice from a long lost Persian King to his son: \\"Rather become known for veracity, so that if ever in an emergency you utter a lie it will be believed.\\" (Page 210)"},{"Title":"Dictionary of Environmental Quotations","review":"The perfect addition to my boyfriends library - Although he probably knows all the quotes anyway!"},{"Title":"History and catalogue of the Fourth Regiment, Wisconsin volunteers: From June, 1861 to March, 1864","review":"It would be interesting to see where this copy came from?"},{"Title":"The Smell of Guava","review":"Here is a real treat for hardcore Marquez fans, it's a booklong, albeit a short book, but a nonetheless booklong interview with the man himself.

Although I found the heroine far too contemporary in thoughts and actions for the Elizabethan time period, I decided to give this second installment a try because I really like both mysteries and historical fiction. To Shield the Queen did a passable job at combining them both. The Doublet Affair did not.First, although I can understand religious differences, especially during this particular era in English history, the author's obvious bias toward the Protestant faith becomes glaringly obvious. The \\"good guys\\" are all Protestant and the \\"bad guys\\" are all Catholic. It seemed improbable to me that all Catholic men and women of the sixteenth century were evil, bumbling idiots, or religious fanatics, while all Protestants were loyal, clever and far more reasonable in their approach to life and religion. Most people are a mixture of many qualities, both good and bad, and I'm sure this held true in the sixteenth century, as well.Secondly, the pace of the plot was excrutiatingly slow. Despite the fact that Ursula was running here, there and everywhere, the plot didn't seem to mature at all as the book went on. I found my mind wandering again and again to the next book on my \\"yet to read\\" pile. Finally, I just skimmed toward the end.Thirdly, Ursula is woefully inadequate at her job. She not only gets caught and outmanuevered for much of the book, she manages to get her servants shot at and captured through her naive and self-centered assumption that only she is a target for retribution.Fourthly, CHOOSE ALREADY! Do you want to be married to the man or not? Her inability to commit to her second marriage is seriously annoying and seems obviously contrived to keep the way open for the next installment in this series.All in all, this is NOT a series I would continue, nor would I recommend it to anyone else."},{"Title":"Doublet Affair (Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)","review":"This is the second entry in the Ursula Blanchard series. In this outing, Ursula, a lady-in-waiting to Elizabeth I, is hired by Robert Cecil to determine whether the Mason family is involved in a plot to overthrow the Queen. She is required to become a sewing and dance tutor to the Mason's unruly children, pick the locks on Mason's desk to read his correspondence, and report back to Cecil.By the middle of the book, the reader no longer cares, if she ever did, whether the Masons are involved in a plot or whether Ursula succeeds one way or the other. The author is incapable of moving the story along at any pace other than a snail's pace leaving the reader's mind to wander to other books waiting to be read. Ursula is not a sympathetic character, rather she is whining, self-centered, and in the wrong business. While she's trying to prove or disprove the Masons' involvement in an attempt to overthrow the Queen, she whines about not being with her husband who is in exile in France for the same offense. Finally, Ursula, it seems, can be placed in any time period and be perfectly happy. The reader, on the other hand, will not be.I really wanted to like this series because I love the Elizabethan period. But even the setting couldn't save this series for me. I was not enthusiastic about the first book in this series, To Shield the Queen, but decided to give the author and Ursula a second chance because I am particularly fond of the Elizabethan period. There will be no third chance."},{"Title":"Doublet Affair (Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)","review":"I quickly bought this second book of Fiona Buckley's after reading the first book, &quot;To Shield the Queen&quot;. Although I didn't find this one quite as intriguing as the first, it was a quick-moving, fun, interesting story. Although it helps if you have read the first novel before reading this one so that you will understand who all the characters and their relationships are, it is not required. This was one that definitely kept me guessing until the end. And again, Ms. Buckley's fictional account of historical events is creative and fun to read."},{"Title":"Doublet Affair (Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)","review":"This is a good book, not great, but good. The main character, Ursula, is a sprited young woman who is a lady in waiting at court, a spy for the queen, a mother of a six year old girl, a widow due to a smallpox outbreak, and wife of a catholic traitor living in exile in France. All of these elments would seem to make her either far-fetched or highly entertaining. Yet, you'd be amazed at how quickly you will tire of her adventures. Her relationship with the queen is an odd mix of distant and inproper intimacy. Her initial assigment in spying is utterly vague to the point of confusion. So often we are wondering just what is she trying to ascertain. So much of the book is Ursula following hunches that the reader is left ignorant of. Subtle witty exchanges lose there fizzle because you don't know the underlying meaning. And regretfully you never will. Many of the characters in the novel are quite charming, though undeveloped, and enter and exit in the strangest and at times grusome ways. Others such as the daughter are never heard from at all ,yet there mere mention is supposed to pull at our heartstrings.The author would have been better served by writing in 3rd person. Then leaving the reader in the dark in so many ways would have so much more excusable. Do not read this book if you are particular about the history in your historical fiction, at times Ursula is very 21st century.

From what I know of English history, it is not only historically accurate but also plausible.It is a story about Ursula Blanchard, a Lady in Waiting to the young Elizabeth I of England. The story is set during the beginning of Elizabeth's reign. Mary, Queen of Scots, Elizabeth's cousin and a Catholic, wants to return to England from France, take over the English throne and return England to the &quot;true religion.&quot; There are plots afoot to discredit Elizabeth and set the stage for Mary's return. Ursula Blanchard is requested to spy on the Leonard family, who are Catholics that she happens to be friends with, resulting in all sorts of unexpected twists and turns in the plot. The man that had been spying on the family previously has been found dead under suspicious circumstances. The thinking is that because she is a woman no one will suspect Ursula of being a spy. However, there are those that apparently know what she is and they are loyal to Mary. Her intense loyalty to the Protestant Queen Elizabeth is also tested by the fact that her husband, a French Catholic that she loves dearly, demands that she join him in France or the marriage is over. The Queen will not let her go until the plot against her is found out and routed. This is court intrigue at it's best, and a pretty good read. I think I'll have to read some other works by this author."},{"Title":"Doublet Affair (Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)","review":"In 1561, Lady Ursula Blanchard is elated that her beloved spouse Matthew is willing to take her back after she left him to perform a duty for Queen Elizabeth I (see TO SHIELD THE QUEEN). Ursula quickly makes up her mind to retire from spying and quietly live with her husband and daughter. However, to leave England for France where her husband resides requires Elizabeth's blessing and her majesty knows that Matthew wants to put Mary on the throne. Instead the Queen rejects Ursula's request and tasks her with an assignment.Ursula accepts a job as companion to the children of Ann and Leonard Mason. The Queen and her advisor Sir William Cecil believe the couple is planning treason against her highness. Elizabeth wants the details and Ursula is her dupe to obtain them even if it places her life in jeopardy.The second novel in the Ursula Blanchard historical mysteries is a great amateur sleuth tale that takes readers inside the political treacheries that swirl throughout the higher echelon of sixteenth century England. The authentic story line is a winner that will please fans of the sub-genre.

She is sent back to the Masons home to help train the girls in the arts of needlework and other gentle arts while looking for a possible plot against the Queen. Along the way, she uses her keen observation skills and her new lock-picking skills to her advantage.

I stumbled upon the audio version of the third book in the Ursula Blanchard series which is Queen's Ransom. I thoroughly enjoyed it, so I started at the beginning with To Shield A Queen (or A Robsart Mystery). It was exciting & intriguing on many levels. I love the Elizabethan era & am a dyed-in-the-wool Anglophile, so I was in my element reading these novels. I love Buckley's descriptions of the clothes, sights, smells, villages, horses, public houses, &, most of all, life as a lady of the presence chamber of Queen Elizabeth I's court. The Doublet Affair was a great read & a true escape from everyday humdrum suburban existence. I looked forward to returning to it when my family was tucked in for the night. I particularly enjoy the fact that Ursula is a widow with a young daughter who has remarried a man she passionately loves, although it is decidedly not a marriage of convenience. She adores her daughter, but must do her duty to herself, her child & her queen by leaving her daughter in foster care so that Ursula can make a good living as a lady-in-waiting to the Queen AND as a spy for Elizabeth, who is dogged by enemies near & far. I find Buckley's writing to be illustrative of the period but at the same time exceedingly accessible. I love Dorothy Dunnett but find her books to be almost projects for me (requiring a companion book so I can attempt to understand her vocabulary & arcane references). Fiona Buckley's books are fun & enthralling, & it's refreshing to read about a feminist protagonist in the mid-16th century. As a postscript, the audiobook reader, Nadia May, is one of my favorites (check out Coming Home by Rosamund Pilcher on audio). She makes the Ursula Blanchard series a real treat that will envelop you & maybe even become an addiction."},{"Title":"Doublet Affair (Mystery at Queen Elizabeth I's Court)","review":"I really tried to love this novel. I enjoy historical murder mysteries, stories with a female sleuth, and the Elizabethan period. So I gave it many, many chances. And I just couldn't bring myself to like it. The heroine's marriage doesn't seem believable, her attitude towards life and the world rings wrong not only for the period but for a woman of any era, and her relationship with Queen Elizabeth I is contrived at best. The secondary characters seem stiff and uni-dimensional and the story felt like a modern tale with a few anachronistic phrases thrown in and the technology taken out.What I did enjoy, however, were the descriptions of places.

It covers every aspect that would interest the diligent Bible scholar. Beginners will find it very tough going! Collins believes that Daniel himself had no hand in writing the book, but that it was the product of the age of the Maccabean struggle. However, he presents all the evidence and arguments fully, being fair to those of a more conservative viewpoint. What you will not find in this book is an attempt to show that Daniel was successfully predicting events in the 20th century or even further in the future."},{"Title":"Daniel Hermeneia Series (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible) (Hermeneia: a Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible)","review":"This is the most complete commentary on this book I've seen. Collins' discussion covers both the Hebrew and Old Greek texts of Daniel as well as the apocryphal additions. Even though the book is quite extensive, the manner in which it is written and organized makes it readibly understandable, even to those just being to look at the book or the attendant areas of apocalypticism or post-exilic Judaism. Collins approaches the text with a balanced historical-critical approach which fairly discusses views upheld by both more conservative and more liberal scholars than himself.

The layout of this commentary is also excellent and worth every penny. There is also comments on the apocryphal portions of Daniel. The only reason this commentary did not get five stars is it comes from a somewhat liberal approach but that is to be expected with the goals of a critical commentary.

And I find such is the case with Collins' treatment of the Book of Daniel. Although the \\"critical\\" view seems to hold the field today, it does in fact undermine the fundamental notion of Daniel's God who is revealed as unchangeably the same and the consummator of the world process.However, from a purely sholastic point of view, Collins' work can not be lightly dismissed. It being, as the preface to the book states; \\"the fruit of more than two decades of research.\\" And as such, I am confident, that all who thoughtfully engage this work will find that their efforts will prove the proverb true; \\"iron sharpens iron.\\"Additionally: Hermeneia should be congratulated on providing one of the clearest and accessable formats to be found in Bible commentaries."},{"Title":"Daniel Hermeneia Series (Hermeneia: A Critical & Historical Commentary on the Bible) (Hermeneia: a Critical and Historical Commentary on the Bible)","review":"This book is recommended for those who are unequivocally taken with the modern historical/critical methodology. A huge effort has obviously been put into the writing of the book. The method has been applied to almost every phrase of Daniel, with like or similar words or circumstances sought in all kinds of ancient literature.Where does this take us? The author concludes (page 123) that, \\"The great achievement of two centuries of historical criticism of the Book of Daniel has been to clarify the genre of the book... Daniel is not a reliable source of factual information about either the past of the future... Its witness, however, is largely the language of legend and myth...\\".The conclusions, based on the countless probabilities and theories about the text, sources, dates and intentions, etc, led me to classify the genre of this commentary: straining at gnats and swallowing camels.I give one star for the historical study, but none for theology, for there is very litte of it. The question, \\"What is God revealing to us in Daniel?\\" seems to be assumed to be irrelevant."},{"Title":"Dry Sterile Thunder","review":"Like Accardi's previous thriller/mystery, Saigon Landing, this book will make you think AND entertain you. LiKe Saigon, it features heroine-lawyer Katie O'Brien and a supporting cast of intersting carachters. And, like Saigon, the plot twists and turns and the ending will surprise you!About the title---I was puzzled by it when I started the book, but it will all make sense in the end.Anothetr great book by Jim Accardi---do yourself a favor and read both thrillers!"},{"Title":"Bottled Spider","review":"Shame on Amazon. I have not been able to find a book I had not read by John Gardner in over five years. I consider him the most outstanding author of thrillers and spy fiction on any continent and had lost track of him when he returned to England after living here in Virginia several years. While many think of John Gardner as a Bond writer, actually much better than Fleming or Benson, that made up only 1/4th of his work and he has created epic characters in epic works. I say shame on Amazon as if you look for Gardner they give you hundreds of listings and not his latest series. Not under his name that is. I had to trace Gardner down in England through friends and found that he had written five I have not read and is on a sixth on now. Fortunately he gave me the names of the books I sought. For the record, he is better than ever.\\"Bottled Spider\\" starts a series that will run through World War Two in London. This first one is in 1940 during the blitz and involves the nastiest seriel killer I have ever read about in fiction. \\"Golly\\" makes Jack the Ripper look like a kindergarten student and his \\"control\\" is equally chilling. While there is a lot of gore, Gardner writes so concisely and so beautifully that you are not repelled by it, The descriptions of England at the time and his development of characters are superb. The lead is a young police officer, Susannah Mountford, and Gardner gets into her head so well that you feel like she is telling the story. You feel what she feels and you know this is someone you would like to know.The plotting is superb in suspense and action.My wife and I have been to England three times now and the places described, most of them, are familiar. The bombings form a sub plot and the history given takes the reader easily back to that time and the places described. Thank you John Gardner for proving what we have always known. You are the best and I will eagerly start the second book in the series as soon as I send this off."},{"Title":"Bottled Spider","review":"Bottled Spider is an exciting tale of a serial killer, the likes of Jack-the-ripper, in 1940 war torn London. John Gardner tells the story in a highly descriptive fashion from the perspective of a young female rookie police officer who finds herself assuming investigative responsibilities normally handled by more senior male officers who are now involved with the war against Hitler. The killer is not pleased that a young women \\"leads\\" the investigation, and is all too happy to include her in his affirmative action plan. It is an interesting blend of murder, romance, and contemporary issues, in a setting few of us have experienced."},{"Title":"Your Emotions, Yourself: A Guide to Your Changing Emotions (Your Body, Your Self Book)","review":"I truly thought this book was wonderful and helpful. I was wondering about so many things and this book helped me figure them all out. I suggest everyone read this book. The emotion I'm feeling for this book is excitement and happy. I honestly love this book."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The story told in THE COLOR OF LOVE involves a Black woman named Leah Downey. She is a beautiful and talented artist for a Manhattan publisher. But she is the lost younger sister, suffering from the effects of being too long in the cold shadow of sassy, assertive, creative and driven fashion designer sister, Gail. Leah is a quietly thoughtful woman, and while she lets her imagination run riot when it comes to her artistic renderings, she longs to bring some of that vibrancy and intensity into her life, especially her love life. Add to that: an unreported mugging and near sexual assault resulting in recurring nightmares, a contentious relationship and too-close-for-comfort living arrangement with her acerbic big sister, a little sexual harassment and a general eschewal of her true value at work and Leah is a normal woman with her share of heavy burdens. A string of ended relationships and the mugging have left Leah feeling unsafe and insecure. And under that fear is a layer of rage that begins to turn inward in a destructive wave of depression after a devastating secret resolves the question of why her sister is acting EXTRA nasty....THE COLOR OF LOVE is a book about one of the most unfair phenomena in this world: those who are the most self-concerned and ruthless seem to be the ones who get what they want; they get catered to. And while those people who use, abuse and manipulate us encourage us to remain confused and constantly searching for an elusive validation, they also resent what kindness they perceive in us. Several characters in THE COLOR OF LOVE displayed this kind of emotional ruthlessness--a sister, to a nameless attacker, to a street kid, to co-workers and even boyfriends. THE COLOR OF LOVE is also about fear: some fear can overtake you, if you don't have a center--that is, if your sense of self comes from without; and sometimes there is just a fear of not being good enough.Leah shows true courage when, after all that she has been through, she fights for a love that seems doomed with one of the most unlikely of men; his name is Jason Horne, and he is handsome and tough. He is White. And he is a cop. Even for this reviewer, a Black woman who has a police officer for a father, the shock and dismay described by Leah at this revelation seemed believable and understandable.Actually, everything about this book felt that way-real and compelling. I felt Leah's fear and doubt and anger like it was my own. Likewise, Jason's story-which felt like a side story to me-will be as painful, hopeful and as frustrating for the reader as it is for him. And the love scenes will grip you all the more, because of the fact that they are made integral to the story and not just thrown in to provoke the reader. That doesn't make them any less electrifying and delightful. I didn't want the book to end, and the only reason I didn't finish it in record time, is because I was trying to draw it out and make it last a little longer.A Keeper."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Sandra Kitt is the very 1st Author i have ever enjoyed and it was so wonderful i'm reading it over and over again."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"First I have to say, I really liked this book!This is the story a Leah Downey and her love for police officer Jason Horn. When Leah first meets Jason, she thinks he is a drunk, a drifter and feels sorry for him, giving him a cup of coffee. Horn returns later to explain himself and their mild conversations turn to friendship and then romance.Leah, who is seeing an attractive popular man, but who finds him emotionally distant is surprisingly attracted to Horn, even though he is... Anglo and a cop. Leah and Jason are beset from all sides as friends and co-workers attitudes change towards them because they are an interracial couple.Can Leah and Jason's love survive the test of a society which seems determined to undermine them at every turn?I really thought this book was great. Leah was a believable character, torn between fear of committing to someone she wasn't sure about, and Jason, no saint, has trouble putting his troubled past behind him.I really liked the book. Can't recommend it enough. (Even if I I did think that Leah was awfully forgiving of her sister towards the end, but heck, she was in love!) Buy yourself a copy!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"&quot;The Color of Love&quot; shouldn't be pigeon holed into the label of &quot;romantic fiction,&quot; because it's just a good story period...and a universal one to boot.This an excellent book and that's coming from someone who's never been a fan of traditional &quot;romance novels.&quot; I saw Sandra Kitt interviewed on a local cable station and decided to check out some of her work. I'm glad I did. Sandra Kitt does an excellent job of weaving an intricate story around a number of sharply defined characters.&quot;The Color of Love&quot; tells the story of Leah Downey, a black graphic artist and her unlikely relationship with Jason Horn, a white cop. A relationship that is vehemently opposed by Leah's older sister Gail, Jason's partner Joe, Leah's co-workers...pretty much everyone but themselves.They ultimately find that the main barrier they must traverse is themselves and worrying about what everyone else thinks. That and the fact that their worlds are so different - Jason's job (working with troubled youth) puts a strain on their relationship and so does Leah's circle of friends.This a very well written book with a fascinating story line. &quot;The Color of Love&quot; is one terrific read!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The book was very, very good. I actually purchased it by accident about 2 years ago, I bought it at a store where Ms. Kitt had been in to autograph some copies apparently because mine has her signature. Well I had no interest in a bi-racial romance until recently when I found myself attacted to a co-worker. I guess it was a book that came in at the right time for my mind set.I read it in about 3 days. I was thoroughly satisfied with the characters. Leah was alot like me. Jason is a great guy who went through some very real tribulations.I thought the writing was superb. I highly recommend it to anyone just a little curious about the other side. Whether you are black or white you will enjoy this love story."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Sandra Kitt is at the forefront of biracial love stories. Her characters are so real, their emotions so poignant, that you feel their joy, their indecision and their heartache. In this book, an unfulfilled Black artist meets a White cop, when he's down and out. After getting to know each other, they like each other, but they have to face family, co-workers and friends who are determined to give them every reason why the relationship won't work. After not dealing with their issues head-on, they agree. It's loneliness without each other that makes them come back together. In the end, they decide, based on their own feelings, the direction they want to go. The supporting cast, whether good or bad, in the book are excellent. THE COLOR OF LOVE is highly recommended as a good, realistic romance and as a way to see around prejudice."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read Close Encounters first. Loved it. I decided I just had to read The Color of Love. Great decision. I don't know which characters I like the most, Close Encounters or Color of Love. These people are so real and down to earth. Sandra Kitt is the reason I just joined the African-American Book Club. Her writing is superb. I'm adding all of her novels to my library. I just send a friend of mine Close Encounters. She's got to read Color of Love next. Sandra, you have so much talent in your little finger. Keep it up."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I enjoyed reading this story because it is a realistic view of the inter-racial romances that happen with increasing frequency in American society. It's almost inevitable.There is no glossing over of racial differences and problems. The reactions that Leah and Jason experienced from other people (like Leah's best friend and the rude cop) and each other to their relationship occur frequently. Kitt's book validates the struggles that people experience when others feel that they should not love each other."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Excellent novel that explores the importance of shared experiences that transcend race and culture to allow relationships to become the determining factor in choosing a path and a partner."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I felt Sandra Kitt captures the meaning of love in every aspect. She really can relate to the African American relationships, whether her books are about the white or black race I feel she has outdone herself again."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read this book in one night.

It held my interest from the first to the last page. I had been curious as to how she would cover the interracial issues involved and Ms. Kitt..BRAVO!!!..You captured the feelings on all sides from Leah and her family to Jason and his friends and you pulled no punches. I have a few problems with the sister, because I have one and I can't imagine her doing anything like that to me and me taking it so calmly!!!..But it was a wonderful book and I'm telling all my friends about it. PLEASE write a sequel...SOON!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Great characters, well researched, s-m-o-o-t-h . . . At the end of a long day, reading this book is like skipping the main course and going directly to DESSERT. I want to see the movie. I want to read the sequel. I want to see the movie. I give it SIX stars !P.S. Tell the June 25, 1999, person to get a relationship."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The characters involve you from the get go and hold onright to the last page. Well researched, so youreally believe in them. The tensions of an inter racial relationship are handled with warmth and caring. You sympathize with both people and want to follow their story with future titles. Sandra Kitt continues to show new talents as an author with each book. She is tops!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This book was seemlessly written. Kitt can write much better than most and I often felt while reading it that the book was reaching beyond the genre into something more literary and more interesting than just a run-of-the-mill romance. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was one of the best love stories I have read, have only read three other stories like it. Please write another story like this one and give us a sequel to the color of love so I can find out how Leigh and Jason are doing."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"&quot;Color of Love&quot; is one of the best books i have ever read. It is a geniune love story, not too mushy. The characthers were real, the interest and curosity gave way to a real love. Leah and Jason were so interesting, each with their own past and present problems to overcome. It is hard not to pull for this couple. PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE, GIVE ME A SEQUEL!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I have never read a book that had me so involved with the characters. I've read the book over and over again looking for something unreal in the storyline but each time I seem to get even more enthused. I felt for both Leah and Jason. Gail's character, as well as Joe's and Spano's, were true to life. The emotions were so real. I think every facet of having an interracial relationship was properly explored. THIS BOOK DEFINITELY NEEDS A SEQUEL. WE NEED TO KNOW HOW THEIR MARRIAGE AND GAIL AND ALLEN'S MARRIAGE FEARED. MS KITT THINK ABOUT THAT!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I really appreciated Kitt's realistic tale of interracial romance and the confusion that often accompanies it. I felt as though Leah and Jason were everyday people experiencing true emotions."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I HAVE NEVER RCVD THIS BOOK & I CAN'T GET A RESPONSE FROM THE SELLER! I TOTALLY FEEL RIPPED OFF!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The best novel of it's kind! As someone who has lived the Jason side of the story I can vouch for the accuracy of the incidents, stereotypes, predujices, and problems to be overcome in the books situations. I have used the book as an icebreaker-conversation piece with women-the response is universally teriffic! Would LOVE to meet a real-life Leah!!!!! Read, enjoy, and live THE COLOR OF LOVE!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This is my first book by the author however after reading some of those recommended by you all, I find this artist to be the most realistic, most well written one to date. Sure some of the stuff was far-fetched but isn't that why we're reading this stuff...to escape reality? Try Ms.Kitt's books, they're very good. Also kudos to the printing/publishing company because some of these other books have so many typos and messed up print it's upsetting. You won't be sorry by buying all of Ms.Kitt's materials."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The Color of Love was the first book I've ever read by Ms. Kitt and I could not put it down at all! I've read the story at least 15 times and it gets better and better each time. Automatically I was drawn to the warm characters and compelling plot that intwinded through their lives. I really thought the book was interesting, with Ms. Kitt cleverly flipping the script and doing a fine job at telling the love story of a Sister involved with a White man. When you read it, you soon understand that it's not a matter of curiosity or color at all. It's a matter of the heart, and that's perfectly illustrated in the relationship of Leah and Jason, who prove that real and true love does conquer all. I do agree with others that a Sequel is a MUST, so Sandra, if you are reading, congratulations on another winner and please, please, please consider a sequel or a film. Keep up the good work!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"What I liked about the story was that it wasn't about color, but about a relationship between 2 people who just happen to be of different races. It was the circumstances that brought them together, not blind lust. This is one of my favorite books and Sandra is one of the best."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I loved this book. I'm a black woman who fell in love with a white man. I was with him for almost three years, and let me tell you, this book touched on every one of the issues we faced. Leah and Jason were strong characters, however, I thought that Leah was a bit too...soft. I know that she was trying to make Leah a strong, yet very soft and sensitive person, but I feel she went alittle over the top. However, I totally recommend this novel."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Jason and Leah are so incredible. When I read this book, I could actually see a real couple struggling in a world where the people they care about the most don't accept them. The best part is when Leah tries to end the relatioship with Jason. The scene shows how much Jason really does care for her and that he really,truly loves her despite what the world thinks of them. This book is incredible. It opens your eyes and gives you a real look @ how hard interracial love is. It's one of my favorites and one of the best books I've ever read. I think every interracial romance lover or a romance novel lover in general should read this."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"In a phrase, Sandra Kitt IS the author I would like to be one day! Her work is a page-turner from the opening of the cover! The story is real, warm and sensitive to BOTH races! She makes the characters SO real that I wound up actually having a \\"crush\\" on Jason, for goodness sakes' and he's a fictional character!!!! She brought every character in this book to life and I could feel them, hear the intonations in their voices and see their expressions on their face! A remarkable author who's DEFINITELY found a new fan in ME!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I first read this book about 5 years ago, and when I need to read a interracial romance book this one is the one I pull of my shelf. If you want a romance that will make you cry and laugh and cheer for a happy ending than give this one a try. You will love it I promise you that. It is one of the best interracial love stories out there today that I have read and believe me I believe I have read them all, even the e-book ones."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This way my first novel dealing with interracial relationships. It was a very enjoyable read! It sheaded some much needed light on a fact of life that many people of this day and age refuse to accept. The Color of Love was beautifully written by one of the great authors of this time, well in my opinion she is!! So if you are in for something different, go pick up a copy, you will not be disappointed!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Next to Alex Haley's Queen, this is the best IR love story I have ever read. Haley's was more historical and biographical, and The Color of Love, as far as I know, is just fiction. Both I read in one night.This book is AWESOME!!! And I really mean that. I thought the story had a natural build. Apprehension, getting to know each other as friends, and then the progression to lovers. I had to chuckle at their first love scene coming on page 204 b/c any other author would have had them sleep together by page 89.Anyway, the only gripe about the book for me is how Leah handled her sister...and her sister, Gail, never really apologized for her betrayal. And I thought some of the B/W drama was a bit over the top, but I think Ms. Kitt brought it full circle in a believable way!Sandra Kitt ROCKS and I will be checking out more of her stories!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Great book and great storyline. Sorry to say that many people still have these ignorant views about mixed relationships, but ungortunately there are a lot of ignorant people out there.Well done Sandra!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I won't repeat the plot that has already be told by the other reviewers but FINALLY a writer has done a contemporary romance novel that deals with a real world issue that many of us see played out in cities everyday--two people who fell in love and who are of different races!Duh?! Why this is not written about more often, is the tragedy of living in a society that panders to the ideas of the past that has never came to grips with the realities of what people really were (and area) doing. Some of them were loving each other in spite of the tabu of race. Thank you Ms. Kitt for opening the door to talk about inter racial romance in terms of the possible instead of just the problems. I want more romance stories like this!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I think that overall this is a story of two people who were meant to be together, regardless of race or anything else. There was a connection from the very beginning that they couldn't deny. I did like Sandra's characterizations of Leah and Jason, but I do agree to some extent, with the criticisms leveled at the Gail/Allen storyline. But I will say, in Leah's defense, that after what Allen did to her, coming at the end of a long time of ambivalant feelings towards him, that at that point she was beyond caring about him one way or the other. And I think she was very hurt at what her sister had done, but she definitly could have gotten more angry. Gail DID NOT deserve to get what she wanted. But I think if Sandra writes a sequal (hint, hint) that we'll see that ultimately she didn't. Good job Sandra."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I'm definitely not one for romance novels - but Ms. Kitt is a very good writer. She keeps you going for sure. I sometimes find that I have to get in the right mindset for the topic of the stories (I've read 2 of her novels) - the inter-racial thing. But then, while reading, I'm asking myself what the hold up was because I find myself really wanting these two people to be together - no matter what their differences.Basically, I'm hooked and I can't wait to read another one of her books!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I've gotten hooked on Sandra Kitt. Her books are great weekend reading. Her characters become a part of you and let your imagination run. The Color of Love highlighted the typical stereotypes and also highlighted how your best friend can be your worst enemy. Sandra Kitt proves that love has no boundaries."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read this book in a couple of days and I really liked it. However, I felt that the characters got annoyed too quickly about everything. It seemed to me that the author's favorite word was &quot;annoyed&quot; and she really overused that word. Also, I felt that the main character was too passive and she let people push her around, especially her sister. This book wasn't the greatest book I ever read but it was good enough and captivated me for the most part."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I purchased this book from my favorite book store, read it in four days, and purchased two more novels since. THE COLOR OF LOVE was a very good read and made me change my mind about romance novels. Although I wouldn't purchase a pound of romance novels and run home with a half gallon of ice cream, Ms. Kitt has enough personalization in her characters to keep me focused. Good Job!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"One of the best romance novels i've ever read...can't wait to see if theres a sequel..i think that it should be a movie...this story was the best i've ever read...thank you ms. kitt!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I loved this book! i just got it the other day..and am about to go read it..for the second time! And the end was the best part! i hope that theres going to be a sequel...i'd love to see whats gonna happen to them!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"It was so very good. I have a criminal justice background and understand a lot of what the author was trying to convey. Just tell me, this novel left me hanging. When is the sequel? We MUST have one,I really want to know how Allen and Gail, Jason and Leah's marriages turn out."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I agreed with some of the other reviewers for this book. I actually read the reviews before purchasing and I guess I was expecting something else. The story moved a little too slow for me, and I think the author should have given us more of Jason's story. I actually was more taken with his job than I was with Leah's or anything else in this novel. I don't know...this was my first Sandra Kitt read and I was hoping for a lot more from this book. I gave it 3 stars because as romance novels go, it was good, it just wasn't my speed though. I think you can have a book that flows and still keep the integrity of the characters in tact. It didn't keep me glued to the text like other novels I've read."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"the book has an interesting premise which is why I bought it in the first place. it was my first Sandra Kitt novel and my second i/r romance.my problem was that the story just wasn't steamy enoughI personally like my romance novels to have some kick and this didnt do it for methe love scene is very bland..and thats the most important part of the bookI also didnt care for the way she dealt with her sister,she really should have fought her[I won't spoil]or at least slapped her."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I was suggested this book at a club I belong to because I was interested in reading IRR books. Like the previous readers, this was my first taste of Kitt's writing and I'm never looking back. Sandra Kitt is highly regarded as one of the best writers for IRR books. Once I got into the book, I knew why.The beginning of the book was a bit slow building for me, but it was quickly dismissed as it proceeded and was very well worth it. I found myself identifying with Leah Downey, an artist who was in a timultuous and somewhat misleading (as we soon find out later) relationship, but soon catches the eye of a white man on her stoop named Jason Horn. A man whom destiny has brought together with her only weeks earlier. Their lives are forever connected from then on.Kitt does a good job of distinguishing each character by voice and mannerisms that truly bring them to life. As a writer since a young age I was taught to rarely use the all knowing narrative. Kitt handles this viewpoint with ease and allows the reader to explore all of the characters in the scene at once to make them realistic. I was rooting for the two lovers to get together and understood the trials each had to go through. Although Leah's resistance to be with the man she loved (but didn't know it yet) became a bit repetitive, this worked well to help prove the strength of the relationship and to draw out the suspense. Nice twists added to the subplot ultimately adding to the much appreciated climax and end of the story.The love scenes were romantic and sensual between the two main characters allowing the reader to wistfully live vicariously through them within the story.Highly recommend this book for a great love story! I'll be eagerly waiting to read more of Kitt's fantastic writing."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"this is the real deal folks...a excellent read...realisticromantichard hittingraw at timessexyups and downsa cool glimspe of a IR relationship."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Its about time there was an interracial couple where the girl is black and the guy is white. Normally its the other way around. This book was a lot better than I thought it would be. And I was relieved that Leah was intelligent and not ignorant. Which is how black women are portrayed too many times. I would recommend this book to anyone I know who wouldn't be &quot;offended&quot; by this type of couple."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I thought I was the only one who saw the ludicrousness of the story line between the sister sleeping with the boyfriend and the tart way they interacted. Red flags should have been raised with Leah, instead of the &quot;oh well&quot; attitude she had everytime her boy friend and her sister were in the same room.I found the sister over the top and WAY too catty to be real and neither she nor the boyfriend had enough flesh and bones to give cause for their behaviors. I never found out why.I did like the interactions between Leah and Jason and found that the most endearing part of the novel, but the high praises this book got did not mesh with the overall story and it's nice to know that it wasn't just me who 'didn't' get it."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I found that this book had flaws that could not be disguised by the happy ending that both sets of characters seemed to have. I felt that Kitt was trying too hard to put these characters together and it was more of a forced relationship than a natural one. I felt that Jason was a typical white male who tried to forget that color was an issue and because he tried to dismiss it, he thought that the relationship between himself and Leah would work. Any relationship with obstacles, whether it be race, class, or anything else cannot go on with issues just being dismissed and i think that Leah recognized this which was why i appreciated her character more than i did any other character in this novel. I also felt that another flaw was Leah's sister. No respect there, and the fact that Leah was no upset with her ex or her sister was just ridiculous. If you put them in a real life situation especially after that rape scene that Kitt tried to dismiss between Leah and Allen, you will see that it doesn't happen that way. In real life, especially since Gail and Leah had tension before the Allen thing occured, they would not be talking or living in the same house. In fact, in real life, Gail would have moved out or Leah for that matter. And also to bring up another flaw, the antagonist of this story, the young black man, who was convicted in the end. That's really ridiculous. This novel made all African-american men and women look bad. But, ironically, I am glad that i read it."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I love this book.This was probably one of the best interracial romance novels that centered around an actual love story with conflict, passion, and understanding. There was no love at first site nor sex before getting to know each other. Leah and Jason had their ups and downs but they worked on resolving the problems in the end. Again, GREAT STORY."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The book \\"Color of Love\\" is an absolute joy to read as r the other books by MS.KITT. The book was perfect for me with its large print,I will definitely be ordering more from AMAZON..."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The Color of Love was the novel which turned me on to the interracial romance genre. It was great years ago and it is still great today. It and Ms. Kitt's other bw/wm romance Close Encounters are the novels by which I compare all others. Now, you can say I like it because it was my first, but I don't think that is the case. I know the book was published quite some time ago, but believe me...it is still a keeper. I loaned mine out and never got it back! Without super graphic love scenes Ms. Kitt was able to convey the emotions between the characters and it was good. Ms. Kitt, where are you? Please give us more IR novels. You are by far the best at the genre."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Congrats to the author who did a wonderful job on the book...lol...she even threw a little action in at the end."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This book is really great. I can't stop reading it. Are there anymore Jason Horns out there in the 45-50 age range? Please Sandra Kitt write a sequel."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The first time I saw this book I knew that it would be a great book and I was right! This book explores interracial relationships from a black female/white male perspective. Sandra Kitt should contact a director and have this book made into a movie."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Great book! I have read it so many times that the book is beginning to fall apart! I recommend this book for anyone who likes a good love story. I ESPECIALLY recommend it to ANYONE that is in an interracial relationship. Being in one myself, I could really identify with the trials and tribulations of Leah, the main character.After reading the book I had one question: &quot;Can Jason Horn be cloned?????&quot;"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was my first interracial (IR) romance novel and I am grateful for the high standard set by the writer (Sandra Kitt) by which all other IR romance novels will be judged. The relationship between Leah Downey (Black graphic designer) and Jason Horn (White NYC cop) is poignant and refreshing. You could empathize with both characters and saw the relationship develop - no love at first sight nonsense. This is a mature relationship. The issue of race was dealt with by the author, however it did not overwhelm the relationship between Leah and Jason. Leah's sister was not completely supportive nor was Jason's partner who is black. Instead the author focused on the issues that arise from Jason's job as a cop working with troubled inner city kids, who are primarily black. This is the best IR romance novel I have read to date."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read this book back in 2000. The beginning is kind of slow,however, hold on it does pick up. As an black woman who does date white men, it shows not only what black women go through dating interracially, but what white men go through as well. And true this is just a good book, not a good \\"IR\\" book. I highly recommend this book and I am sure that if you buy it you too will be recommending it before you finish it."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This is another book that was just ok, I didn't like how Leah dealt with her sister Gail, concerning Allen,..... I don't know when I'll read this one again.... \\"Back to life\\" by Wendy Coakley Thompson is still my favorite interracial romance so far."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was one of the most engaging books I had ever read. I had never read any of Ms. Kitt's books before until now. I loved the development of Leah and Jason's relationship. I do hope this is being adapted into a movie. As I read this, I could see Sanaa Lathan and George Clooney.The only problem I noticed was that there were several typos. Ms. Kitt's publisher needs to be aware of this. It was distracting at times, but the story made up for it in the end."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I liked the book but It was more cerebral than romantic . I felt like is was a study in a relationship between a black woman and a white man. This couple were attracted to each other but in this book they were not passionate about each other they just wanted to be together. I felt this was more a story of how society view I/R relationships. To me the book was a good story that explained the hardships the went through because of other people but to me they lacked the passion to make this a great romance."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was just okay for me, and that is almost a stretch. There was way too much betrayal and bitterness for me. Gail was a TRIP!!! It's good to see the different facets of love but I thought this needed to be a little more upbeat."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I found this story to be realistic and entertaining. I especially appreciated that the romance between Jason and Leah was put through the ringer. Their happy ending wasn't mired in cliches or stereotypes. Right up to the very end, I was rooting for their happiness. I only hope that Ms. Kitt writes a sequel to this story. I wanted to know how these two faired as a married couple. There were many areas of both personalities that could use more fleshing out. All-in-all a very enjoyable read! I recommend it."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read this book and was enthralled. It was probably the only romance novel I've ever read that wasn't a total stereotypical, formulated crock (i.e a beautiful woman who's fiercely independent and always manages to land herself in trouble and the proud, handsome man that always rescues her). Jason and Leah cared for each other and they dealt with the issues that faced their relationship instead of giving up on their love. What I'd like to know is whether or not Ms. Kitt plans to write a follow-up to Jason and Leah's story or will they make a cameo appearance in another of Ms. Kitt's novels?"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This story by Kitt was by far the most romantic and heart felt story I've read in a long time. I could not put the book down. The characters were believable and real. The love that Leah and Jason had was true and genuine despite the obstacles they had to go through. But in the end love prevailed and showed that color or race wasn't the issue even though society puts pressure on that element, but loving someone and being loved in return is the greatest reward of all."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This story by Kitt was by far the most romantic and heart felt story I've read in a long time.

Leah was caring and Jason was sweet. I could not put the book down and recommended to friends."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"THE CHARACTERS WERE WELL WRITTEN. I COULD SEE MYSELF AS LEAH, A YOUNG CARRER WOMAN ON HER WAY UP. I THINK THE CHARACTER OF GAIL COULD HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN A DIFFERENT WAY. IT WAS HARD TO IMAGINE ONE SISTER TREATING THE OTHER THAT WAY. JASON IS A REAL CHARACTER WITH FLAWS AND FAILED DREAMS. I WAS REALLY ROOTING FOR LEAH AND JASON TO MAKE IT. IT WAS A GREAT STORY."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I truly loved this book and it held my suspense from the first chapter through the last. I thought it was lots better than The Bodyguard because I actually believed this relationship was true, unlike the romance in The Bodyguard. The way Ms. Kitt built up the characters and the friendship/romance between Leah and Jason was done wonderfully. The relationship was not rushed which made it all the more believeable! I couldn't help but root for Jason and Leah's relationship to work despite all the obstacles because I could feel the love between the two of them grow. She made you feel for each of them, their weaknesses and their strengths.I read the book in two days only because I had to go to sleep at night and work the next day; but I could not wait to start reading it again as soon as I got home from work. I will be reading this book again. It was very heartwarming and I can't wait for Ms. Kitt to write another just like this one!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. THE STORYLINE WAS BELIEVABLE AND TOUCHING. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS THAT THERE WASN'T MORE. I WOULD HAVE MORE DESCRIPTION IN TERMS OF PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS. I ALSO WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE DESCRIPTIVE AND LONGER LOVE SCENES. BUT, ALL IN ALL IT WAS A FABULOUS STORY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I'M A AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN, AND I MUST SAY I HAD PROBLEMS WITH INTERRACIAL DATING...... BUT WHEN I READ THIS BOOK IT MADE ME UNDERSTAND THAT TRUE LOVE IS COLORLESS."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"A great book from a very unique and gifted storyteller! Filled with realism, originality and romance!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I enjoyed this book beyond measure and bought it for my friends. (I wouldn't risk loaning it and not getting it back!) Real characters that I could relate to. Although I also loved Significant Others, this is my favorite of Sandra Kitt's books."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"An interracial love develops despite the usual obstacles (family, friends, co-workers, etc.). I could never truly picture Leah's character as an enterprising black woman and I also had trouble with Jason's inability as a &quot;street-smart&quot; cop to see trouble coming. Otherwise, an okay book."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I opened this book and couldn't stop reading until the end. It seemed as thought I were right there with the characters. This book didn't gloss interracial dating. It really let the reader experience how difficult it is to date outside your race. But in the end true love won. A fantastic book."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"A (former) self-described literary &quot;snob&quot;, I rarely read fiction and NEVER those &quot;romance novels.&quot; Boy, did this book prove me wrong! The book held my interest from beginning to end. The story was good and the characters --male, female, black, white-- were well developed. This sensitive topic was handled with integrity and depth. So good that I read it twice!!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Here is a book that delves beneath the surface of an interracial relationship, and doesn't simply rely on the superficial titillation of the issue. You get in the character of Jason Horn a realistic figure, who has to confront his own racial demons and prejudices regarding Black people while at the same time slowly coming to realize that he is falling in love with Leah, a Black woman whom he had only thought to befriend. Leah, on the other hand, has to deal with the cultural stigmas and issues about dating a White man. She is presented as a sensitive, caring individual. Because neither of the main characters are flat (although I did have trouble believing the character of Leah's sister, Gail, who seemed a little bit stereotypical, i.e. &quot;sassy, over-opinionated Black woman), you do care for their relationship and how it will turn out. I was not disappointed by the ending."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I was in my senior year of highschool when I bought this book and have read it many times since (now a junior in college). My book also is plain worn out!! I almost consider myself an expert in interracial dating books and this is the one I keep coming back to because it is devoid of stereotypes and is full REAL feelings, not just the jumping into bed part. In the end you realize that these are two distinct people, not THE BLACK WOMAN with the WHITE MAN scenario."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I'll never forget this author and I'll never forget this book. Leah and Jason are real and promising. Ms. Kitt you inspire me!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Very, very special My mutilated copy with dog eared pages and highlighter marks.. So many layers of feelings and emotions whether an interracial relationship or not. Human feelings about love, taking a chance after hurts and disappointments. It touched me on many levels: Starting again, self-esteem, hope, and what it must feel like to be loved. I too wish there was a Jason Horn for me"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was a real written, and researched story. The characters one could relate to. The charactershad depth and passion. As a woman you could relate to her inner turmoil. I've read the book atleast 4 times and have passed it on to all of my friends who love it. Not one of my friends who I'vepassed this book on to have not liked it. My mother even read it and thought it was &quot;easy reading&quot;,very good book. When the book was finished, you wished for a Jason Horn to enter your life."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I REALLY didn't like this book.I tried to keep an open mind. I really wanted to read a well developed love story. I'd hoped that the interracial dynamic would be thought provoking as well as enlightening. If you, as a reader, are anticipating the same, this is surely not the book for you.The characters were meagerly developed. They were often one dimensional only one minor character offered any semblance to likeability.Leah Downey is an attractive Graphic Designer who is plagued with thoughts of self loathing, lackluster relationships, and an overwhelming fear of black men. Early on in the novel readers learn that Leah was raped. This traumatizing experience she decides to keep to herself. Throughout the novel Leah is tormented with nightmares and continues to be vexed by every black man in her life and those passing by on the street. The scapegoating of black men is surprising for a black woman, who, in all honestly can't manage to paint but even one man in an even remotely positive light: Leah Downey's father.Even the white male love interest, Jason Horn is a despicable rogue who I found hard like, let alone love. First of all, I just couldn't understand that this attractive successful woman would meet this man for coffee even though she met him when he was pissy drunk on the street and she believed him to be homeless. He remained an alcoholic throughout the book, and about the only thing he could do well was have sex with her. Over and over again Leah's blackness and womanhood was assaulted by associates and friends of Jason's and not once did he stand up for her. Leah's preoccupation seemed to be, \\"I can't believe of all the beautiful blonde women in the world, he loves black me...\\"Needless to say, I was disgusted.I was hoping for a story...I don't know...about LOVE! That is what the title suggests. The abuse Leah had to endure at the hands of everyone around her just left me feeling angry and wishing that she was a stronger character. Leah was unapologetically weak. Her weakness wouldn't have been so bad had she some type of revelation or personal growth to quicken the pace of the novel.I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"As a man who often dates interracially, I have always wondered why there aren't more books on this topic. Ms. Kitt's book is a welcome addition to this genre. Remember, I am a guy, and most guys don't read romance novels. But this one is different I think, because the characters are believable and real, and not based on some inane fantasy. Despite their intense passion for one another, Jason and Leah come from different worlds and they both find out the hard way that &quot;other people's attitudes&quot; DO matter. Leah's sister- perhaps the most unlikeable character in the book- and Jason's coworkers really make life hard for this couple but somehow they survive it all. I think Ms. Kitt captured the &quot;little things&quot; that interracial couples face, to include the black woman's anger and the white man's ignorance. I wish there were more positive white male characters in the book- Jason is pretty much the only one who is dealt with in depth. With the exception of Leah's father, most of the black males (Allen, Joe and Slack) are stereotypes. Nonetheless, I highly recommend this book. I read it in one sitting, it was that engrossing. Kudos, Ms. Kitt, great job!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"\\"The Color of Love\\" shouldn't be pigeon holed into the label of \\"romantic fiction,\\" because it's just a good story period...and a universal one to boot.This an excellent book and that's coming from someone who's never been a fan of traditional \\"romance novels.\\" I saw Sandra Kitt interviewed on a local cable station and decided to check out some of her work. I'm glad I did. Sandra Kitt does an excellent job of weaving an intricate story around a number of sharply defined characters.\\"The Color of Love\\" tells the story of Leah Downey, a black graphic artist and her unlikely relationship with Jason Horn, a white cop. A relationship that is vehemently opposed by Leah's older sister Gail, Jason's partner Joe, Leah's co-workers...pretty much everyone but themselves.They ultimately find that the main barrier they must traverse is themselves and worrying about what everyone else thinks. That and the fact that their worlds are so different - Jason's job (working with troubled youth) puts a strain on the resltionship and so does Leah's circle of friends.This a very well written book with a fascinating story line. \\"The Color of Love\\" is one terrific read!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Leah Downey is a young African-American commercial artist who by fate meets Jason Horn, a cop, who also happens to be white. Both their meeting and thier romance are unconventional. They must face obstacles that most couples never have to experience. They realize almost too late that ignoring the problems does not make them disappear. Leah and Jason must examine how their family and co-workers react and how society sees them as a couple. Then, they must decide whether color should matter when you find love.Sandra Kitt has an uncanny ability to make the reader know and understand each character by giving enough background to make them believable and realistic. The characters are well written with believable depth. THE COLOR OF LOVE begins slowly, but once the plot evolves the reader will find it difficult to put this book down. Even though this is a romance novel, it did not follow the typical romance formula. The reader will be able to watch as this couple experiences the good and bad of being in an interracial relationship. This is not my first time reading a novel by Sandra Kitt, but this is one of my favorites because of her ability to express the complexities of interracial romance.Reviewed by Cashana Sealsof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Ms. Kitt. You can surely write. This is one of the best love stories I have ever read. I have not read a love story in over 10 years and I just happenend to stop by the book store after church services to purchase a book for my 10 year old son. I picked up Close Encounters, which I read in one night, and was hooked. I called the Library the next day and got all of your books. I have read Color of Love more than 10 times, and each time I come away with a deep appreciation and amazement with the writing, the characters, etc. A sequel is a MUST! Let us know how the characters are doing in married life, kids, friends, etc. This is book is fantastic. The best! Jason and Leah come alive and it is interesting how they weathered the storm of their relationship."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I am a White male in my 30's who has dated black women before.First of all, it is rare to see a book about white men dating black women.It is more common seeing books about black men dating white women.I thought this book was excellent. I first read it in 2000 and was dating a black female at the time so it was very relevant in my life. Jason's character was a great example of how white men may face discrimination and other obstacles dating interracially.Jason loved Leah.In the book, Jason's wife and son were killed in an automobile accident.He is very broken and needy white man and he meets Leah, a very nurturing and strong black female. The blook explores the roller coaster of situations and emotions they explore as their interracial relationship evolves. As a white man,I hope that this book,if anything shed light or provokes discussion about white men dating black women.I though Sandra Kitt did an excellent job in portraying Jason.Jason needed nurturing and love-for he was broken,and he met Leah and their beautiful romantic bond transcended color barriers.This book was romantic and the love scenes were tender.I as a white male,I know there are many white men who date black women or have though about dating black women but may be afraid too given societies racism.Hopefully,many white men,like Jason in this boo, will have the courage to withstand the obstacles of interracial dating.I am encouraging other reviewers/readers of this book to email me if you would like to discuss this very well written and important novel by Sandra Kitt."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I read the color of love and I fell in love with it. I can really relate with the characters. I also truly believe that love finds you and sometimes it presents itself in ways you didn't think was possible. This book also pointed out the challenges of dating interracially. Your family, friends, co-workers and even strangers may tell you it's not right but the characters listened to their hearts and so should YOU..."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The Color of Love is one of my all-time favorite books! This is the first book I read by Sandra Kitt, and it will always remain my favorite of her work. All of Kitt's books hold your interest and really capture the everyday lives of people in society. Interracial relationships are not only difficult to develop in real life given peoples biases and ignorance, but they seem even harder to write about. Sandra Kitt thoroughly brings her characters to life in a way that not only makes you root for them, but also makes you identify with them.The love story between Leah Downey and Jason Horn took my breath away. Their romance was portrayed in a realistic fashion without all of the sappiness that some romance novels have. You truly felt the love, passion, and devotion between Jason and Leah, no matter what obstacles came their way. The only thing I didn't like was Leah's negative, interrogating sister - I guess she has her purpose in the story - and Leah's constant questioning of her relationship with Jason. I just wished that Leah would have relaxed and let her emotions take over.I could read The Color of Love over and over again and never get tired of it. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in an intriguing, thought-provoking, intelligent, realistic love story! It is one of the BEST!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"i loved this book from the time i picked it up..the characters were so original and no matter what hardship they went through together or separately they had pulled through. its good to read what could does happen in everyday life but you have to look beyond the differences and love a person for who he or she is and that is exactly what Leah and Jack did *S* I truly enjoyed this story. *S*"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I just want to say thank you to Sandra Kitt for creating such a masterpiece. I couldnt put this book down. I was hooked from the beginning. The character of Leah was so warm and caring and when she opened her heart to a helpless and loving Jason I nearly cried. I was moved by the interracial love story from beginning to end. Someone please contact hollywood and tell them this is a book movies should be made of."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I loved this book and have read it a least 6 times. I admire Leah so much for taking the risk that I was afraid to take when I was younger. I sometimes regret it because I don't know what it would have been like to have a relationship with a white man. I chickened out and married a black man....and so I live thru Leah's story every so often. I know it's not the same but it's all I have now."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was my first Sandra Kitt book. It was listed as a recommendation if you liked A ship Made of Paper by Scott Spencer, and I did, for the most part, so I picked it up.I have to say it's a departure from most of the romance novels I read, and I've read several. There was a lot of DETAIL about things I didn't necessarily care about. The story and the characters were certainly well develeoped, almost to the point of being overdeveloped, but it was still good. It did lack steam. I wanted more from the sex. And I was furious about how Leah handled the situation with her sister, and just how she let Gail talk to her in general. It seemed as though Leah had no real backbone, and that ruined the story for me. All in all, and okay read. I agree that there should have been a epiloge. Could have been a great book with better sex and a stonger female lead charachter."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This is my first Interracial book that I have read. The writing was good. But the book lacked heat, for a romance novel. Also as a woman that dates interracially I did not like the way the main character handles the negativity of those around her."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I had this book sitting on my self for about 4 years.One cold winter I picked it up to read, and read the entire book in one sitting(took me about 4 hour, for every year I didn't read it)I loved it.My only complaint is that the author didn't Epilogue, showing them married years later, with a child."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This book pulled no punches. Jason Horn is a troubled man and Leah Downey is not doing so great herself.They &quot;meet&quot; when she brings him a cup of coffee. He finds her again and they decide to date, even though everything and everyone says they shouldn't.They decide to follow their hearts and the world beats them up for it. But, they come back stronger and better in spite of the beating.Read this book. It is not the usual fare with I/R romances. This one is true to its subjects and the reactions that black/white lovers face."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"The Color of Love was a thoroughly engaging read. I have a very hectic schedule and summer is the only time I can fit in \\"escape\\" reading. I loved spending time with Jason and Leah. I felt like I was actually friends with them by the end of the book. And speaking of ending -- I didn't want it to!!! The interacial aspect of their relationship was handled realistically but not over-bearing. I was rooting for them all the way. I particularly loved Jason's confidence and street-smarts. The pace of their story added to success of this book. It was neither too fast or too slow. To summarize: I enjoyed it immensely!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This may be one of my all time favorite books. Anyone who says the people in this book aren't real must be living under a rock. The color of love follows the life to two very different yet not so different people. Leah Doweny and Jason Horn. The just happen to meet when Jason depressed over a tragic lost in his life parks himself on Leah's front stoop. She gives him a cup of coffee intruged as to why Jason comes back. Right away they have a lot to say to each other. They both find that they really do want to know about the other person. One date isn't enough so they go out. One date leads to another than another.Anyone who's date black white or what ever race has been down the what-exactly-are-we-to-each-other-now ? road that Jason and Leah find themselves in Lover friends ? Leah know what can happen if the become lovers. Despite what someone said interracial dating is still a taboo subject just look at the lack of it on t.v. While it may not as be as bad as it once was the trouble is still there. And this book did a wonderful job of covering that without being sterotypical. Jason and Leah both had to sit down and ask what they really wanted from each other and why where they really together. It made the both very human and both very easy to relate to. It wasn't a rose colored romance but a real one with real human emotions. The question and the old prejucties were real. The only thing I didn't like was Leah's whole roll over and let it go deal with her sister and her ex man. Other than that this book is one you'll want to read again and again one of the most realistic reads out there today."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I am an avid reader of biracial romance novels. Ms.Kittgive you the &quot;411&quot; on interracial relationships. This is a goodread. I loved Leah. She had a lot of issues to deal with----a silly sister and a stupid boyfriend. Jason was a tough as nails type of guy. He had to battle with the loss of his son and with the stupid bigots on his job. Inspite of all Jason and Leah had to go through, love won in the end."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"Finally managed to read this engaging story, in three sittings. There was much gritty reality, yet much romance. My only concern is Leah's calm, passive acceptance of her sister's betrayal.Jason is a good man who works hard for what he beleives in which is so rare and commendable these days. Leah was ready for a man in her life to love her heart and soul.If you are in a mixed relationship, just tell the wagging tongues to go away if the only thing they see wrong is the color. Otherwise you might miss out on something great."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I thought this book related to my actual lifestyle so much. The character Leah Downey kind of knew from the beginning that there was something there between her character and Jason Horn and they sometimes they knew each others thoughts. This book shows the great struggle of young interaccial couples and how blind love should really be. The color of love shouldn't matter to anyone accept for you and the person that you are in love with. Thank you Sandra Kitt for such a wonderful book!"},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I thought this book related to my actual lifestyle so much.

It started off a little slow but the book just dragged me in and kept me there. Loved Leah and Jason and found their story to be so true to life. They had their issues but the love they felt for each other was enough to see them true. I could not stand her sister Gail and that guy Allen. What a piece of work they both were. I don't know how Leah put up living with Gail all these years, sister or no sister, I would have kicked her sorry behind to the curb along time ago.Jason was right on track, he loved Leah and they wanted a life together. If other people can't understand that then it's their problem, let them be miserable. The entire story just held me and I was a little sad when it ended but every good book has to come to an end."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"My book arrived in a decent amount of time. The condition of the book was good."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"This was my very first interracial read and it set the standard for me in this genre.This is an intelligent and well written book.I loved the story so much that my book is dog-eared and tattered from reading it so much. I loved how the relationship between Leah and Jason developed. It progressed from strangers, to friends, to lovers in a style that flowed and was easy to follow.They tackled real issues concering interracial couples with honesty and maturity.I've read several other of Ms.Kitt's books, but this is by far my absolute favorite. I believe this book is a must read if you are and avid reader of interracial romances."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Excellent characters. Story was very real. I liked that the story did not read like a fairly tale. The couple faced some tough issues, which the author forced the characters to deal with. This is easily one of the best books I've read dealing with inter-racial relationships. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Color of Love","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The characters were well developed and Miss Kitt did not shy away from the issues. It just made the main characters realistic.

So the topic of this novel is right up my medieval alley. And I would say the author of this book is quite knowledgeable about King Harold and his arch-nemesis William. But I had some trouble getting my literary head around the changes in view point. Just as I was getting into the Saxon and Norman mindset, the author would make a reference to his own times ((19th century). In order for any fiction to work, the author must assist the readers in their suspension of disbelief. It doesn't help when the author keeps reminding the reader that this is only fiction by continually dragging them back to modern-day reality.I appreciate all the research that went into this book.

Just like some other reviewers, I became a Harold fan (and frankly, the telling is favorable to him). It's a tragic tale with ironic twists and intrigues, and in this telling there's a little bit of harmless mysticism thrown in. In the end I was blown away by this $3 book. This story would make a fantastic modern film, perhaps including this little bit of mysticism. [Hollywood would have to resist the temptation to have skeletons rise up and go to battle, or to have warriors leaping 30 feet into the air.

It gives examples of the cross that Father God brings to each of His children's lives to reduce our &quot;self&quot; life and become more like Christ, and it gives helpful advice on how to embrace the cross that Father God places in our lives. It is such an encouragement because it gives not only the &quot;what to do's,&quot; as so many books do, but the &quot;how to do,&quot; as well. God used this book to answer so many questions I had about the Christian life and used it to give me personal revelation about dealings in my life. Excellent tool for the Christian in his/her walk with Christ in learning how to fellowship in the sufferings of Christ and being transformed into the image of God's Son, Jesus the Christ!"},{"Title":"The Cross and the Self","review":"Have you ever wondered how Jesus did it? How he walked in two worlds at once? How He could make such astounding statements such as \\"I only do what I see the Father doing.\\" How He could be man and God at the same time and wrestle with the very same things we, todays Christians, wrestle with and continue to maintain the eternal perspective? This book answers those questions and alot more! Bill Freeman has written a book that will bring such revelation to your life and how to \\"walk out\\" your Christian walk with victory and peace that every Christian desires. What I love so much about this book is that Bill Freeman doesn't sugar coat anything. It is extremely evident that Bill has done his homework and he simply presents his thoughts based on what the Word says. Most of us don't have the time to search the scriptures as to \\"why\\" we do alot of things. We at best make feeble attempts to read the Word in hopes we will see what we need. This book answered many, many questions I have been having about WHY we do what we do not only as believers but as human beings. This book is deep and profound. I have read it numerous times and taught it in Sunday School. Many, many people said they have been blessed by Bill's teaching.ORDER THIS AND READ IT RIGHT NOW!"},{"Title":"The Cross and the Self","review":"In The Cross and the Self, Bill Freeman is attempting to create the illusion that he's a Biblical scholar who can guide the reader into a deeper experiential knowledge of the Cross of Christ. But, appearances can be deceiving. Bill has failed to provide full disclosure. During his undergraduate years at Fuller Seminary, Bill's GPA was less than 2.5. In writing his own preface to this book, Bill claims a desire to \\"further our spiritual understanding of the Bible's basic revelation concerning man.\\" Yet, on page 121, his words sound more like the first-person account of how his wife, Pat, presumptuously manipulates him and the lives of individual members of their congregation while she \\"plays\\" church and \\"plays\\" God:\\"Brothers and sisters, there is no way to deal with this hidden self apart from calamities and whirlwinds. So this is how God deals with it. He comes in with calamities ---calamities in your family, in your job, in your relationships. And he comes in with whirlwinds - things you cannot understand, things that suddenly appear in your life with no explanation. These things have the effect of whirling you around. This is the kind of dealing God measures out to these pompous, hidden selves that are nourishing themselves on their own spiritual experiences, on their service for the Lord, and on all their fantasies and self-justification.\\"--Bill Freeman, The Cross and the Self, page 121.We expect to be helped, not hurt, by pastors and others in position of religious influence. But, sorry to say, not only do Bill and Pat Freeman appear to be self-deceived, they've also misaimed. Bill might speak about the cross, but in their practice of the church, Bill and Pat have gone rogue and lead double lives. Instead of being constrained by the cross and the life principles portrayed in the Bible, their lives have literally gone wild. Bill is actually describing Pat and himself when he writes about these \\"pompous, hidden selves that are nourishing themselves on their own spiritual experiences, on their service for the Lord, and on all their fantasies and self-justification.\\" Former members of the Freeman's church congregation describe the aura surrounding Bill and Pat Freeman as delusions of grandeur.\\"Be wary of false preachers who smile a lot, dripping with practiced sincerity. Chances are they are out to rip you off some way or other. Don't be impressed with charisma; look for character. Who preachers are is the main thing, not what they say. A genuine leader will never exploit your emotions or your pocketbook. These diseased trees with their bad apples are going to be chopped down and burned.\\"--Matthew 7:15-20 (MSG)1. In their practical lives and while operating in their self-imposed church leadership roles, Bill and Pat have refused to remain on the cross. Instead, they have deceived and misled members of their congregation. Yet, Bill and Pat have not been able to fool all of the people all of the time. Instead of their church being a sanctuary from the storms of life, their church has become more and more like a tornado alley. Pat creates whirlwinds and calamities within their congregation, especially involving marriage relationships. Pat's \\"busybody\\" activities are like hidden twisters bent on destroying another marriage once she draws a woman near to her evil winds of deception. By misusing \\"Christ and the church,\\" Pat has left a trail of over three dozen broken homes, separated families, and discarded marriages across the western United States. At least fifteen of these divorces occurred in Arizona alone. Having caused divorces and broken families apart in at least three other states, Pat's activities are now the focus of a federal probe. Pat convinces these now divorced women to hand over the financial proceeds of their divorces to Pat's safekeeping. Thus, Bill and Pat are motivated by greed to destroy more families and promote more divorces. The bottom line is that promoting and causing divorces has made Bill and Pat Freeman very wealthy.2. This author is also describing how he and his wife prevaricate; how they evade telling the truth and twist Bible truths for their own financial benefit. Bill and Pat have failed to remain sober, act respectful of others, act appropriately, or remain properly focused on the Biblical truths while Bill ministers \\"the Bible's basic revelation.\\" They often appear drunk with their presumed powers of manipulation over others. Instead, of speaking the truth in love or being constrained by the cross, their misguided ventures in leading church congregations have crossed over to the dark and evil side. God's light dispels darkness. Yet, in their \\"practice of the church life,\\" the Freeman's sins of omission and sins of commission have been propagating and growing in darkness for decades. Perhaps, this explains why they prefer to live out their lives in reclusion.\\"Therefore, to one who knows the right thing to do and does not do it, to him it is sin.\\" -- James 4:17Christ gave his life on the cross to restore man's relationship with God. Genuine Christians walk in the light and do what's right according to the light. But, Bill and Pat Freeman do not walk in the light. They're promoting a life of living in darkness and isolation. Even though both Bill and Pat may speak what sounds right, they've repeatedly done wrong for their congregation. They've harmed and broken their follower's relationships with God and one another. Pat's efforts have in effect \\"dumbed down\\" their congregation. Even though the Bible begins with a wedding and ends with a wedding, Pat continues to convince dozens of women not to take their marriage vows seriously. Just \\"as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness,\\" Pat has deceived and persuaded these women to eat her poisonous fruit.\\"Satan did not attack Eve's heart first, he attacked her mind first. In the same manner, evil spirits want to attack our mind first, not our heart, with the purpose of corrupting us from a faith in simplicity. They know that our mind is the weakest spot.\\"--Watchman Nee, The Spiritual Man, Page 500.3. God's grace brings people together who wouldn't normally come together. The Freemans have used God's grace to gather a captive audience around themselves. Once gathered however, Pat, or Patsy as many of us know her, will glean the congregation by targeting the weak and the frail. She especially goes after the weaker vessels; women and children. Like a sociopath, Pat has personally set up and designed calamities and whirlwinds to target and manipulates these individual members of their congregation. Her invasive actions have also damaged the lives and relationships of her own children. Four out of five have recently divorced. The many unfortunate young people that innocently became involved in the Freeman's \\"church life\\" have also endured spiritual and emotional trauma after Pat's cunning encroachment into their private lives. This toxic environment is not about how God or any healthy parents would relate to and treat their children. Please read John 3:16 again.Among the Freeman congregation, Pat secretly \\"plays God\\" in a warped and presumptuous attempt at interfering in their church members' personal lives. Her dark side involvement has evolved and expanded over the last 40 years. Pat employs sophisticated Mafioso tactics likely learned from her Armenian-American heritage. Empowered with only a high school education, such unsanctioned behavior has literally nothing to do with God's unconditional love or a genuine experience of the cross of Christ. This author and his wife's efforts have callously distorted the eternal truths of the Bible. Their manipulative mind games operate much like a soap opera to control and mislead their \\"church\\" followers. Thankfully, on the Cross, Jesus Christ died to set us free from such corruption.4. Like Judas, Pat's passion is money. Thus, she maintains control of the Freeman's bank accounts. Pat has accumulated several million dollars through her own relentless efforts to convince followers to \\"give all to the church.\\" Some followers give their entire paychecks to Pat. Others give much more than their scriptural ten percent. Yet, none of these funds have rightfully made it to the poor and financial needy among the Freeman congregation. Nor have the Freemans ever supported missionaries or helped the less fortunate in their communities. Rather, these tithes and offerings are laundered through Bill's non-profit ministry on their way to a final resting place in one of the Freeman's personal bank accounts. Yet, this is not all. Pat has gleaned much of her present funds from dozens of loyal female followers as the proceeds of divorces Pat personally promotes, directs, and carries out. Pat has simply robbed these family estates by coercing women to hand over all proceeds from the sale of their homes. Thus, Pat not only directs and encourages divorces, she steals the money locked up in the homes and bank accounts of these women that might otherwise be passed down to the family's children as inheritance.\\"For, as I have often told you before and now tell you again even with tears, many live as enemies of the cross of Christ. Their destiny is destruction, their god is their stomach, and their glory is in their shame. Their mind is set on earthly things.\\"--Phil 3:18-20The Apostle Paul instructs the Philippian believers to hold true and follow his example; observing those who live after the pattern that the apostles have set. He further told them, even in tears, that there are many who live as ENEMIES of the cross of Christ. Paul is writing to Christian believers. Isn't this serious? Paul implies that these believers are DOOMED and their fate is ETERNAL MISERY. Their god is their stomach and sensuality. They glory in their shame (selfish pride of wealth, status, and the accumulation of earthly possessions).Yet, Bill Freeman has nearly skipped over this in his book by merely claiming: \\"My god is not my belly. My God is God Himself.\\" \\"So the end is destruction for the enemies of the cross.\\"--Bill Freeman, The Cross and the Self, page 252.5. These same words have come back to haunt Bill and Pat Freeman. Bible truths are eternally true, but what the Freemans have spoken is only temporal, if that. Many of us who have personally known this author and his wife have begun to understand why Bill does not elaborate. Although Bill and Pat often talk about Christ, in reality their lives have only revolved around themselves. Why else would they have moved three times across state lines within ten years? Why else would they abandon or uproot five congregations in four different states? Were they looking out for the best interests of their congregations? Does anyone genuinely believe that? What are Bill and Pat Freeman shamefully running away from?Even in 1999, after Bill Freeman spoke about the superiority of men over women in their church meetings, his wife responded by contacting an attorney and filing for legal separation from him. Pat shamefully twists the term \\"take the cross\\" to mean whatever she wants it to mean while she manipulates the lives of members of their congregation or gets them to do for her whatever she wants. Yet, the Apostle Paul has also spoken in detail to the Corinthian believers about such shame.6. The Apostle Paul wrote that it is a \\"shame for a woman to speak in the church.\\"--1 Cor 14:34-35. Women should take a secondary and subordinate place, just as in Genesis 3:16. It was the woman that got man in trouble in the first place. This should be simple enough. Paul even said women are commanded to be silent. Perhaps some women might laugh at the Apostle Paul for appearing old fashioned. Some might even brand him a \\"woman hater\\" and then push through their own human reasoning and worldly wisdom to brush aside the Bible's divine revelation. This is to glory in their shame. Perhaps we need to listen and hear from Paul again.\\"Let a woman learn in quietness with all subjection. But I permit not a woman to teach, nor to have dominion over a man, but to be in quietness.\\"--1 Tim 2:11-12.Some believers are \\"enemies of the Cross of Christ\\" for reasons which they would not like to confess. Perhaps this is because the Cross of Christ hurts their selfish pride. Why should they need to be pardoned? After all, in their own understanding, they have done nothing wrong; they are as good as most people and a great deal better than many! You might speak to one of them and they might say, \\"Do not talk to me as if you thought I was going to be lost. I do not know anybody who can find fault with me. I really think that I am an example to others.\\"--Charles Spurgeon, The Enemies of the Cross of Christ #2553, October 26, 1884.7. Many Biblical truths are straightforward, but this presumptuous author and his wife appear to have wandered far off track and lost sight of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Instead of a \\"heavenly vision,\\" this author and his wife's vision appear to be merely a figment of their own imagination. Although Bill Freeman claims to be a Bible scholar, he appears intent upon convincing readers that \\"there is no way to deal with this hidden self apart from calamities and whirlwinds.\\" He appears presumptuous by considering that he alone has the knowledge of \\"how God deals with it.\\" He claims that the only way to study the Bible, etc. is his way. Bill Freeman may have even deceived himself, and may need to be reminded of John 14: Jesus is \\"the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me. If you really knew me, you would know my Father as well.\\"Our loving Father has provided His only begotten son, Jesus Christ, to be our Lord and Shepherd. Often, in a normal Christian life, the way leads us through an experience of the cross. Yet, this author appears to be so preoccupied with his own diagnosis of the human self and his own assessment of our human condition that he may have lost all perspective and even his passion for God. Being overly concerned and focused on his role of acting and appearing \\"spiritual,\\" his discussions and the path he and his wife have been leading their congregation upon appears to have literally veered away from the cross and many Biblical truths. Instead of focusing on ourselves and trying to fix ourselves by ourselves, or diagnosing our problems by ourselves, why not focus on a healthy nutritional intake? This is certainly not a new approach.8. Health and nutrition experts confirm that \\"We are what we eat.\\" Years ago, a former co-worker of this author even shared a message entitled \\"The Christian Life is a Supplied Life\\". Everything we need to live the Christian life has been supplied to us in Christ. Spiritually speaking, if we eat the Tree of Life, we will live. But, if we eat the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, we will die. The difference, life or death, is all a matter of source. Fortunately for Adam and Eve, God also gave them mercy and grace.9. Apart from his wife, this author no longer has any co-workers. By leaving all Christian accountability behind, and by remaining overly ambitious and focused on portraying themselves as \\"spiritual\\" church leaders, Bill and Pat Freeman may have lost sight of the most central and fundamental truths of the Bible. Bill Freeman appears to be laboring to deliver life-less knowledge, yet this lies in stark contrast to the Tree of Life and the River of Life. A more sure path is to follow the wisdom of the Apostle Paul as he points us back in a healthy direction in 1 Corinthians Chapter 8: \\"Knowledge puffs up but love builds up.\\"If we actually believe the same gospel that the Apostle Paul believed and preached, it stands to reason that we should have the same emphasis on the message of the Cross of Christ. This message is so foundational and so important that the Apostle Paul said he resolved to know nothing among the Corinthians except Jesus Christ and him crucified.--1 Cor 2:2However, this author appears to be teaching differently. A danger lurking within charismatic and free group circles is coming to regard the message of the cross as being rather \\"old-hat\\". This author's tendency is to look for teaching that is more novel, more tantalizing, and more intriguing. His church messages seem to revolve around \\"seeing the church,\\" preaching lifestyle principles, and motivational messages to inspire young people. Indeed, we can teach all kinds of things: spiritual gifts, spiritual warfare, and so many other things. But, if these things are somehow divorced from the cross of Christ, they will inevitable contain seeds of self-destruction, whatever value they offer in the meantime.10. This author's misplaced emphasis appears to be bent on the self, as though he has an advanced degree in introspection or is certified to diagnose the shortcomings of members of his congregation or readers. But this may have simply become his \\"tar-baby.\\" God may allow calamities, but our loving Father certainly doesn't bring them upon His own children! No loving father would talk this way! The author has included a hymn about the cross, which he claims to have written himself, but it fails to contain the word \\"love\\" in any of his eight verses. Isn't God's love for mankind and Christ, as the \\"Lamb of God,\\" the fundamental and central message of the cross? Love builds up, but this author and his wife's efforts have been to tear down those people and marriages that have become deeply involved in their congregation. Instead of building strong families as a testimony to the health of their church, most of the women in their present congregation are either single or now divorced.The tangent that this author appears to be guiding his reader upon is directed away from our wise, powerful and loving God, who gave His only son, Jesus Christ, to be crucified on the cross for our sins, and towards a mentally confusing valley of introspection. Perhaps a more balanced work could be produced by this author if he and his wife would only allow assistance from others. But they have remained stanchly isolated and selfishly narcissistic. Therefore, they have failed to retain or trust any other co-workers. Narcissists believe that they are the only ones that count. No one else matters. Thus, to become teachable himself, this author may need some serious professional help. Like Abraham, he may need to return to some of the altars in his life, where he last heard the Lord's voice. But, recent accounts surrounding this author appear to confirm that he has become more isolated, disoriented, confused and may have become lost in another \\"whirlwind\\" himself.In a healthy church everyone does something so no one does everything. But in this author's church, since he and his wife have no other co-workers; they determine every decision themselves. There may be a token appearance of \\"fellowship,\\" but in the final analysis, only they determine the ultimate outcome. This author even writes in this book about our being dependent upon God. Yet, when he wrote this book, he wrote his own preface, and he claims to have written the words to the enclosed hymn all by himself. Like vanity books, Bill even prints and publishes each of his books himself, since he personally owns and operates Ministry of the Word and Ministry Publications. Thus, Bill Freeman has taken all credit and all of the financial proceeds from the sale of \\"his\\" books. A reasonable question should therefore be asked: Has author Bill Freeman remained faithful to the cross of Christ or is this book merely another of this overachiever's attempts to promote himself?11. A reader might unknowingly consider Bill Freeman to be an honest and humble Christian man. Yet, in reality, Bill often boasts about his personal library of over 10,000 volumes and he's rumored to own many expensive suits. Where did the money to purchase all these books and suits come from? Most of this money came as the proceeds of the divorces that he and Pat promoted among the elderly women in their congregation. They have profited by promoting divorces in their church.After moving to Scottsdale, Bill Freeman applied for non-profit status for Ministry of the Word, his bookstore or printing company enterprise, with the state of Arizona. But, the state of Arizona denied Mr. Freeman's request. So, Bill then refiled as a foreign non-profit corporation, by claiming that he maintained an office based in Washington State at a trailer park address in Bellevue, Washington.Bill Freeman's unscrupulous actions opened up a can of worms.a. Filing a fictitious office address in Washington State allowed Bill Freeman to evade paying certain B & O taxes for over 20 years. Organizations that qualify as public charities under Internal Revenue Code 501(c)(3) are eligible for federal exemption from payment of corporate income tax. Once exempt from this tax, the nonprofit will usually be exempt from similar state and local taxes.b. Besides committing fraud and tax evasion for filing with a false address, Mr. Freeman never bothered to ask the Christian man living at this trailer park address for permission to use his address in a tax-evasion scam.c. In addition to profiting from the unauthorized use of this man's address, Bill and Pat Freeman had already interfered in this man's marriage by convincing his wife to leave him and move to Arizona to become part of their Scottsdale congregation.d. Several years later, Pat Freeman circulated evil lies about this same Christian lady among their Scottsdale congregation in an effort to excommunicate her from her Arizona friends and their Scottsdale congregation. This Christian lady immediately moved home and restored her relationship with her husband. Should we still consider Bill Freeman to be an honest and sincere Christian man? No way.Yet, this is only one story of one married couple in the author's church that was initially supportive of him and his wife, but were later manipulated and evilly abused by them. After 45 years, there have been scores of others. Literally hundreds of similar stories exist about single women, single men, married couples, and innocent children that have all been manipulated and abused for financial gain by Bill and Pat Freeman. The majority of the older women remaining among this author's congregation were once married but are now divorced thanks to Pat's coercive persuasion of women. The trail of divorces attributed to Pat began in California, followed Pat to Washington State, Arizona, Oregon, and back to Washington State. Recently, in 2009 the Freemans moved back to Arizona. By getting rid of these women's husbands, the Freemans have gotten rid of their financial competition. Most of the young women in this author's congregation are not even allowed to date or get married without Pat's approval. In the Freeman misinterpretation, the cross has become a tool to convince their followers to do things most reasonable people would never do. Within this author and his wife's deviant ministry, the cross can be whatever they say it is. Many similar stories are now being written to set the record straight about this author, his wife, and their misdirected ministry.12. In his final hours Jesus prayed for our unity. He paid the highest price and died on the cross so that we could all be one. Yet, the Freemans have used religion to justify the many twisted and terrible things they do and have done. This author and his wife may be misfocused on their own selfish agenda to such a degree that they no longer recognize they're spiritually wounding many other sheep in the process. They have a long history of promoting divisions and \\"church splits\\" within the body of Christ and instigating dozens of divorces within their own congregation. They probably did not start out with any intention of hurting another lamb. But, they have wandered far from the cross and have shied away from assuming responsibility for their selfish actions. By rejecting the Apostle Paul's commands of faith and a good conscience themselves, this author and his wife have also shipwrecked the faith of many young people that no longer want anything to do with their \\"church\\" or any church.Jesus bore our sins on the cross and made us right with God, but our own actions have longstanding consequences throughout the body of Christ and throughout eternity. In contrast, this author and his wife have repeatedly inflicted damage and destruction upon believers and families within their own congregation. Bible scholars agree that a true shepherd's concern should be with his Master's sheep. In John chapter 21, the Lord repeated this burden to Simon Peter three times: \\"Simon, son of Jonah, do you love me?\\" ...\\"Feed my sheep.\\" But, this author and his wife appear to be more interested in cash crops, migrant sharecropping and freelancing, since they can move in and then move on after damaging another congregation and the local landscape. They've done this repeatedly, then simply moved on to a new city and carried off the spoils and financial profits reaped from shearing their congregational sheep and sending other sheep to the slaughter. Thus, they've violated God's explicit chain of command, while remaining staunchly unrepentant and poor role models for their ultra-loyal female followers and the Freeman's own estranged children. Their increasing reclusiveness and moral decline might best be explained by Revelation 2:4-5.Please caution any readers from pursuing further or entering into the cloud of confusion surrounding this author and his wife. Bill and Pat Freeman's appearances are deceiving. This author claims to cut straight the Word of God. Yet, in reality, he has maintained a long and slick history of twisting scriptures to engage and mislead his pied piper following. After bringing respectable people over to his way of thinking, and creating a sense of belonging among those in his congregation, Bill passes them on to Pat for her coercive manipulation. Several dozen innocent souls have been drawn in so deeply that they have followed Bill and Pat by moving and relocating with them five times or more across the western United States. We have all likely heard of misdirected church leaders and imposters that sound very compelling and enthralling. Yet, as sojourners, they have simply fled accountability by leaving a trail of broken homes and dismembered families behind in each of their moves. Their dwindling number of followers are being led along with big carrots, big sticks, and big promises that never seem to be fulfilled. Analogous to the parable of the wise man that built his house upon the rock, this couple has be building their \\"church\\" on the sinking sands of their own self-deception.The Cross of Christ is front and center to the Christian faith. Genuine Christian churches are built upon the solid foundation of the apostles and prophets with Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone. Healthy churches and their congregations are relationally hard-wired into their local community's infrastructure and cannot be simply uprooted at a pastor or his wife's whim and transported across state lines. A genuine church benefits the entire community and healthy church leaders are focused on their congregation. But, this author and his wife have reversed the focus and direction of their church by turning the tables. From the Freeman's self-centered viewpoint, instead of serving God, their congregation is serving them, the Freemans, as church leaders. The Freeman's never ending search for lost souls is simply a quest for more people for Pat to manipulate, control, and use to help fund her growing financial empire.Shame on you Bill and Pat Freeman. This author and his wife's mental posture reveal a deep-seated self-absorption that keeps them at the center of their own universe while insisting that God and His Word orbit around their needs and serves their interests. They have fled after each of their \\"church splits\\" or \\"spiritual accidents\\" by pulling up stakes and moving across state lines with a third or more of their original congregation. As might be expected from such a mobile economy, their selfish efforts have resulted is an abused and literally dismembered congregation or body of Christ. Instead of benefitting the community, this author and his wife's \\"church,\\" as their self-centered business model, only financially benefits the Freemans themselves and their personal bank accounts.That being said, I cannot recommend this book or this author and his wife to anyone within the body of Christ. Ordinarily, I would inject humor into my book reviews, but I find no humor in talking about such self-imposed and self-deceived church leaders that continue to intentionally harm and destroy Christian families in the name of Christ. Christ died on the cross for His church. He paid the ultimate price and died for you and he died for me. May we all return to respectfully honoring Christ, His cross, His family, and one another in honest, healthy and genuine churches."},{"Title":"The Bad Girl's Mix and Match Stationery","review":"As someone inclined to write letters like there's no tomorrow and sample dozens of stationery deisgns, I found the Bad Girl's Mix and Match Stationery delightful. The quality of the paper's really good, the designs are pretty and the colors are vibrant. It includes a few extra stickers (some with sayings such as \\"yummy\\", \\"love ya\\", and \\"naughty\\") and well, it's just whimsical and in a word, fun.There are 4 different designs of sheets and envelopes which match really well so I'm not too inclined to mix, rather than match. The sheets are also different, one is completely blank, the other one has a little drawing of the bad girls as a letter head and my favorite is a mad-libs kind of thing where you fill in your own bad girl letter. It's a bit unusual, yes, but fun to do once in a while (and I have to say, it's been appreciated).I have to admit that it's not so much of a grown-up set but it makes up for it in its fun factor and it's nice for giving some variety to the everyday things. Colorful, very pretty and yes, just a lot of fun and I'd say quite worth it."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"Ever since publication of the landmark work on college football's history by Allison Danzig in 1956 (&quot;The History of American Football&quot;), sport historians have been patiently waiting for another well-written work about college football's storied past which would bring the tale up to modern times. After any number of unsuccessful attempts by various authors, at long last we have that book with the release of John Watterson's &quot;College Football&quot; by John Hopkins Press; a work that is recommended by this reviewer.Watterson, a professor at James Madison University, has previously delivered talks and written a considerable number of articles on the early history of college football, and to his book &quot;College Football&quot; he brings the same attention to research and an easy-to-read style of writing that has characterized his earlier work.Rather than droning on endlessly about one season after another in college football's past that dates to 1869, Watterson has instead tackled football's history by using each chapter to examine the predominate and notable events through the years that served to gradually transform the game into what we see today. The result is a history of college football that provides an essential foundation for the novice historian, while still providing plenty of new and interesting material for the more experienced reader.The author takes up his story with the origins of big-time football in the 19th century, including the major controversies of the 1890s that evolved from the game's increasing violence and serious injuries. After examining the crisis of 1905-1906 when college football faced the threat of being outlawed, Watterson moves on to review the more significant battles over the rules in 1910 that directly provided the origins of modern football. The struggles of 1910 ultimately overcame Walter Camp's continued opposition to forward passing and eliminated the mass plays that had evolved since 1906, a topic that is one of the most significant in the sport's history yet is frequently ignored in most attempts at football history.Watterson continues the story of college football with the over-emphasis and abuses of the 1920s; then moves on through the hard times of the Depression, the war years, and the challenges of de-emphasis in the 1950s. A considerable amount of this material is the result of the author's tireless research, and again touches on significant material seldom seen in other football histories.After examining the many areas that characterized the game's entry into the big-money days made possible by television, along with the NCAA's attempts at controlling the frequent recruiting scandals; the author sconcludes with chapters on African-American plays at predominantly white schools, and the revolt of the major universities against the NCAA that led to the formation of the College Football Association (CFA).&quot;College Football&quot; by John Watterson is an essential work for anyone interested in the history of the intercollegiate game."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"A useful book for everyone who has a long-lasting interest and knowledge on the College Football, but it can be a little bit dazy and hard-to-understand for the beginners. College Football by Watterson is an analytical book which also solves the past-time football's problems according to the periods national crisis' and situations with huge acknowledgements. If you already have a good knowledge on College Football, then you will find a lot of interesting things in this book; if you have no or a little knowledge, then I will suggest you to read easier books to prepare yourself for this book. I really liked reading and learned a lot from this book though."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"College Football is an outstanding and important work. It is a true history--not a greatest teams and greatest players-type of celebratory writing--and falls under the rubric of sport history. Sport history, which is a subcategory of social history, relates sports to broader themes in society, and John Sayle Watterson in this regard does a terrific job in relating the history of football to the issue of collegiate life as a whole, and even to society as a whole (particularly where the colleges had to fight the pro game for the public's entertainment dollar).College Football is published by a university press (Johns Hopkins), but it is marketed as a trade book. Thus, the misleading subtitle &quot;History-Spectacle-Controversy,&quot; as there is not much spectacle in this book. But there is plenty of controversy, relating to violence, subsidies, and cheating scandals throughout the sport's history and the mostly failed attempts by the college football establishment to reform the sport.Watterson's work is actually a more narrow history of the governance of college football, rather a broad history of the sport (Johns Hopkins surely did not want to put the word &quot;governance&quot; in the title). As such, however, College Football is the best overview of the subject ever written, primarily because the author takes the story from the beginning up to the present day.I have some minor carping: there is an excessive number of typos and errors in this book for a university press book."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"This enlightening book covers the history of college football from an interesting and neglected point of view. That is to say, it contains none of the usual lionisation of players and coaches, and no re-working of big games we're all familiar with. Rather, Watterson examines (and questions) the place of the game in American society and its role on campus. The book establishes quite clearly that the over-emphasis placed on gridiron is hardly a recent phenomenon or even (as I foolishly suspected) down to the evils of television - that schools have been fielding ineligible players, fiddling grades, and operating slush funds from the days of Walter Camp. Watterson details the various movements which have attempted to reform the game and how it is run, and explains lucidly why virtually all of them failed. A seemingly insatiable desire for victory and glory to the alma mater has resulted in a gradual yet steady erosion of the original purpose of sport on campus, to the point where today a college President can express a desire to \\"build a university the football team can be proud of\\" without a trace of irony.The book's only real fault lies in some woeful editing, which results in a few stories being re-told, and several paragraphs being repeated almost word-for-word many pages later (not to mention some grammatical howlers which don't strike me as being the author's fault). I found myself able to to overlook this, though, and can unreservedly recommend it. It may not be one which the more avid Sooner, Fighting Irish, Crimson Tide, or Buckeye-backer will gravitate toward, but those who enjoy big-time football and yet abhor how tainted it has all become will find it difficult to put down."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"I purchased this for my dad because he is an absolute college football fanatic. He seems to really love the book. He started reading it immediately after he opened. Seems like a real page turner."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"The book reads like a college paper, but is extremely well researched. If you enjoy history and football, you'll love this book. But don't expect to read about the past champions and players. This book is about the development of the college game and it's numerous, unending controversies. We all fantasize about the \\"Good Ol' Days\\" of college athletics and presume that there was a time when the \\"Student\\" came before the \\"Athlete\\" in vernacular as well as in practice. This book explores the idea that, in reality, the \\"Athlete\\" has always come first, despite the well-intentioned efforts of the academicians.I didn't exactly breeze through this book. I'd put it down from time to time, read another book, and come back to it. I personally found the later chapters to be the most interesting, probably since the book is in chronological order and the issues were familiar. They must have re-edited the book because I didn't see many grammatical or typographic errors, as others have mentioned.Pick it up if you like college football, but keep a couple other books in reserve."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"I don't have opinion on the book itself, but the seller is really nice. Customer service is fast and accountable. Thank you."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"This a dry read and takes some effort as it is essentially an academic tome that is concerned with the evolution of modern college football from a political, policy, and business standpoint. But it is quite thorough and hits the nail on the head. The final pages discuss how the game can be saved .... since reform is not an option. This is the weakest part of the book, but understandably so since it would take the wisdom of Solomon to fix this problem. I have always felt that a return to one platoon football makes a lot of sense regarding costs (less insurance, travel and equipment, scholarship dollars).The editing in the book leaves something to be desired. There are a number of typos - and a few sentences that make contradictory statements. The author is not a well versed student of the game since there are several technical mistakes which indicate some deficiencies in research. Some of these are listed below as examples.(1) Identifying Brian Bosworth as an Oklahoma lineman when he was a linebacker,(2) Claiming All American status for 4 years (1982-1985)for a very average SMU running back,(3) Confusing the major Western Athletic Conference (WAC) with the minor Rocky Mountain Conference,(4) When describing the 1943 game between the College of the Pacific (COP) and USC attributing Pacific Coast Conference (PCC) membership to COP which was in fact an independent school during the 40's and never was a member of the PCC or its later version, the Pac 10.That said I highly recommend the book for anyone interested in the history of college football."},{"Title":"The Official bingo games manual","review":"Mr. Watterson has presented us with a volume that is unique among sports books - a comprehensive history of college football and its relationship to college life and American society. I recommend it for two reasons:1. It is incredibly well researched; Watterson has spent years digging through college and university archives around the country. He has amassed a mountain of valuable information about the progression and development of the college game that is not available elsewhere.2. Despite being an academic, the author writes in a style that is easily readable. In my experience, it is rare to find a scholarly book that is also comprehensible to a lay audience.Though it has many positives, there are two major flaws that drive me to distraction.1. Watterson insists on repeating himself, sometimes making the same point in the very next paragraph or on subsequent pages. At times, I found myself wondering whether I had mistakenly lost track of my place in the book and was reading a page that I had already covered. The author's tendency to rehash previously made points slows the reader's progression and makes each chapter significantly longer than it needs to be.2. The index is woefully incomplete. For example, references to Glenn \\"Pop\\" Warner are listed on three pages - 137, 146 and 172 - but more information about him appears on page 180. Likewise, Richard \\"Von\\" Gammon is referenced in the index on pages 36-38, but he also appears on page 47 (misspelled as Richard Gammen). There are many such instances in the index.Nevertheless, this book is very valuable for the many nuggets of insight and history that bubble to the surface. The information contained in this volume is found nowhere else, and far outweighs the drawbacks in writing and editing."},{"Title":"Keepin It Simple Baby : Guide to Mixology","review":"I found this giant little bar tenders guide an easy to navigate book and a must have for bartenders and consumers alike.

The coauthors are no doubt very knowledgeable about their craft. They have written a fun and important cocktail book. The construction and page coating will no doubt make it a standard in the industry for many years.

This familiarity prepared them for republican citizenship in a way that today's smorgasbord approach to post-secondary education manifestly does not prepare contemporary Americans. Read _Tyranny Unmasked_ for evidence of the first of these assertions: John Taylor of Caroline, self-consciously provincial Virginia planter, foresaw the following 150 years' course in America with great clarity, and he lamented it the whole way. This is a great book by one of America's all-time great political thinkers."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"John Taylor of Caroline's &quot; Tyranny Unmasked&quot; is a brilliant analysis of enonomic and political economy in the early 1820's. Taylor points out the injustice and folly of protective tariffs and their effects. He astutely shows how by &quot; protecting&quot; an industry from competition you effectively raise the price of the product and foster a government- business alliance destructive of liberty. He shows how financial interests use tariffs to unfairly gain advantage over other competitors and also how theyattain dominence over the representatives of the people throughtheir influence. Taylor recommends a Jeffersonian ideal of free trade, low taxes, and an abolition of protective tariffs. Overall a great Jeffersonian read."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"John Taylor was a member of the House of Representatives from Virgina. He also wrote \\"New Views of the Constitution\\" in 1823 which is a thorough but difficult read (Tayor was an attorney and writes like one). Taylor witnessed trends in the national government that were moving towards weakening the Constitution of states rights and self-determination into the Whig desire for power and centralization that would benefit the northern industrialialists. A Virginian born into the values of Jeffersonian Democracy, his writings forewarned of the coming of what became the Republican party, it's centralized grasp for power, empire building and the loss of personal freedoms subjected to the centralized government and their favored corporations. I wish I could have read such quality volumes in my high school history classes instead of the revisionist history that perpetuated the mythology of the centralized government.This volume is well worth the read. It is my experience that most of the population will not understand what you learn from them, nor be interested in the conflict that it will awaken within them."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"John Taylor of Caroline is one of the most brilliant political philosophers that America has ever produced. This work in particular demonstrates a compelling critique of government interference in economic matters that also demonstrates Taylor's firm grasp of political economy. Above all, this book is an absolute joy to read."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"Taylor's Tyranny UnMasked opened my eyes to the difference between where we have gone, and the course our nation's founders sought to follow. I never considered myself a conservative before reading it, and I still do not - today's conservatives are the descendents of the very radicals whose policies Taylor condemns. I do think of myself as the wiser and better for it."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"Taylor does a great job of offering his vision of the future, a future in which the free people of the UNited States were dominated by a strong centralized government working to promote some version of the \\"common good.\\" It is surprising how accurate his vision would be, given he was railing against a subsidy for wagon wheels. What you find in this work it that the logic of doing something for the common good is driven by an unquenchable thirst for more of the same. That he was right is seen in the nation's never-ending move forward to an ever increasing size and role in the lives of individual citizens. Yes, it is difficult to wade through, but it is very informative. Get it and learn about where our government is headed."},{"Title":"Tyranny Unmasked","review":"John Taylor of Caroline was arguably the best farmer in Virginia during the first quarter of the nineteenth century, carrying out experiments and advocating scientific farming techinques. In addition, he was a sometime politician and constant cultural critic. Tyranny Unmasked argues that the moneyed class in the north and especially in the cities created conditions that would eventually destroy American freedom as conceptualized by Thomas Jefferson: the freedom created by the independent \\"yeoman farmer\\" beholden to no higher power for his livelihood. According to Taylor, the emerging finance-oriented capitalist economy developing during this period distorted the \\"pure\\" capitalism in which an unmanipulated market provided the best measure of price for goods offered by productive workers. In this work and others, and especially in his uncollected congressional speeches, Taylor rails against the \\"pecuniary aristocracy\\" of big financiers that he saw as having undue influence on American laws and policies.The main caveat I refer to for potential readers has to do with Taylor's advocacy of slavery. Some commentators have justified this advocacy with the typical appeal that southern culture demanded that he support his region's beliefs. While the pressures of social and cultural acceptance were intense, even admirers of Taylor should be disturbed by his (as well as Jefferson's) promotion of a type of American freedom founded not only on denying African Americans any freedom at all but also on horrendous treatment that literally worked many slaves to death and made even those in less oppressive situations live in constant fear.Taylor was truly a genius in critiqing the society in which he lived but he also supported the continuation of a monstrous blight on American life and identity."},{"Title":"Environmental Policies in the Third World","review":"The book is a comparative study of environmental policy frameworks, in terms of the development of institutions, laws and regulations, for environmental management in developing countries. The first two chapters deal with global developments in the environmental arena and how they impact on developing countries in general, and the next seven chapters are case studies of specific countries (India, China, Indonesia, Africa, Nigeria, Chile, and Mexico). It is excellent in terms of detail of information presented on the development of regulatory frameworks in the case studies presented. The first two chapters also present an excellent historical review of global developments and the shifts in paradigms and emphasis. So in terms of being an information source, the book is excellent.However the main drawback of the book is that there is an apparent lack of understanding of technical issues related to the environment and how the different issues are linked. It is somewhat understandable, given that most of the contributers are political scientists, but it is unfortunate that nobody reviewed it for technical environmental issues. In the second chapter, the ozone layer and global warming are combined together as one issue and the impacts are listed together in one list. Global warming does not cause skin cancer and CFCs are not significant greenhouse gases! It is amazing that the authors did not realize that the issue of the ozone layer is on its way to being solved with binding international treaties and protocols in effect and substitutes found for CFCs, the main cause of the hole; while there is still substantial disaggreement on global warming in terms of reaching consensus on what needs to be done to reduce fossil fuel use (the main reason for carbon dioxide emissions) and how it can be done. In the case studies, it is the chapter on China that stands out as having required review of the technical issues. Among other minor inaccuracies, the author attributes a change in the climate in China as being due to deforestation and pollution in China! Climate change is a global, not a local, phenomenon and the whole problem with reaching international agreement is that what happens in one country has an impact globally and not locally.The other main drawback is that, although the case studies are excellent in the wealth of information they present on the development of the policy frameworks, they often mention that these frameworks were ineffective in having a real impact on the problems and issues. There is limited analysis on why that is the case and what the main constraints were. You can reach some tentative conclusions yourself, based on the information provided, but there is no structured analysis of this issue in the case studies."},{"Title":"Home Court Advantage: Preparing Your Children to Be Winners in Life","review":"As a mother of 4, I wish this book would've been written years ago.

But overall really good book."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"The Swords of Lankhmar is the fifth book in Fritz Leiber's collection of tales revolving around the barbarian Fafhrd and the diminutive rogue the Gray Mouser. Clearly two of Mr. Leiber's most famous creations, Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser belong to the genre of swords and sorcery; the setting is a fantasy where men of swift blades and loose morals do battle against impossible foes for their own personal aggrandizement. This is not the realm of Tolkien. Not only is Leiber's world of Nehwon lacking in the usual elves and hobbits of Middle Earth and its many imitators, but also missing is the clear delineation between good and evil. The primary conflict is between the sadistic and decadent rulers of Lankhmar, the most famous city of Nehwon, and an army of miniature invaders. Neither side enjoys anything like moral superiority over the other. The reader certainly isn't encouraged to root much for one side over the other. While our sympathies might naturally lean towards the status quo which clearly benefits humanity, the picture painted of a city ruled by the invaders is too intriguing to simply dismiss.So our sympathies naturally incline to our heroes, and what a pair they are. The first chapter of the book is about the best introduction to these characters you can probably find, as they return to their sometime home base of Lankhmar after a lengthy, and not entirely voluntary, absence. Their welcome back to the city is both comic and brutal; this is the stuff of Dumas' musketeer stories without the brooding angst. Death and comedy walk hand-in-hand through Leiber's stories, and the delicate balance he maintains between the two, especially in this longer tale, is a great example of his proficiency as a storyteller.Unlike most of the previous books chronicling the adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser, Swords of Lankhmar is a single story, a novel-length adventure over 300 pages long in my 1982 edition. All of the others books, except Swords and Ice Magic (also published as Rhime Isle), are collections of short stories and novelettes. Mr. Leiber is, of course, no stranger to the longer format, and Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser make the leap to novel-length adventures without missing a step. In this writer's estimation, Swords of Lankhmar is the best of their stories. If you read nothing else by Fritz Leiber, you should read this one."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"Fritz Leiber was one of the greatest fantasists that ever lived and a writer of incredible imagination and style. His sword and sorcery tales of the lovable pair of rogues Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are among the finest in the genre (the finest, in my opinion). And they are definitely the wittiest and most sophisticated. He drew inspiration from his theatrical background to create compelling scenes and dialogue and his heroes are both fanciful and believably human at the same time.The Swords of Lankhmar is the only full-length novel of the two adventurers. This is also probably the most erotic tale, full of kinky scenes, constant suggestiveness and delightful teasing, especially between the Mouser and Hisvet (and her servant Frix). As all the Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser tales, it is a joy to read, full of adventure, intrigue, witty banter, satire and mystery.I've read all of these tales more than once and will do so again. I deeply envy someone who is coming to them for the first time."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"I never get tired of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser -- I adore those two rogues! In The Swords of Lankhmar (a full novel rather than the usual story collection), the boys have been hired as guards for a fleet of grain shipments because several ships have recently disappeared. Aboard the ship they meet a couple of enchanting women who are escorting a troupe of performing rats across the sea. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser soon discover that these are not ordinary women, and those are not ordinary rats.Back in Lankhmar they find that the city is dealing with rats, too. The rodents have become belligerent and troublesome. The Mouser begins to suspect that there might be a connection between those two ladies and Lankhmar's troubles. With the help of his magical patron, the Mouser goes underground to spy on the rat army.The Swords of Lankhmar is an expansion of Leiber's novella Scylla's Daughter (1961, Fantastic Stories of Imagination) which was nominated for a Hugo Award. The Swords of Lankhmar has everything fans have learned to expect from one of Fritz Leiber's LANKHMAR series. It's strange, creative, fast-paced, and fun. Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are a couple of the best characters in all of fantasy fiction -- if you haven't read any of their adventures, you're really missing out.Let me again recommend the audio version of this series which has been produced by Audible Frontiers -- Jonathan Davis's performance is so entertaining!"},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"\\"Swords of Lankhmar\\" is the fifth volume in the adventures of Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser. Fans of Leiber need to know that fact but new readers can start right in with this book and catch up with the others if so motivated.In city of Lankhmar our friends are hired to ride shotgun on a convoy of grain ships across the Inner Sea to the city of Movarl. The reason for the extra security is that previous convoys have not only failed to reach it's destination but have all disappeared without a trace.During the voyage one of the ships is attacked by what appear to be highly intelligent rats. Only the intervention of a dragon with an appetite for those tasty rodents saves the ship and for than matter the entire convoy. Upon returning to Lankhmar the Grey Mouser and Fafhrd find that their report of events is ridiculed by the Prince as being preposterous and are sent from the council chamber disgraced.As events unfold the Prince's foremost confidants are in league with the rodents who maintain a hidden civilization under Lankhmar. A reprehensible plot is stirring to replace human rule and substitute rats rule. Our hero's smell a rat, or rats and with swords and sorcery restore equilibrium to Lankhmar in the land of Nehwon."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"The City of Lankhmar, in the world of Nehwon, is threatened from within by a force so cunning, so smart, and so massive that it is amazing how invisible it is to all who live in the city. Yet nobody will realize just how much danger they are in till Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser stick their noses into the plot - and make it even a bigger mess.As many reviewers have pointed out, it is kind of hard to cheer for either side. The invaders, in some ways, seem smarter and more loyal to their cause then the city's own Royal Family and nobles are. In fact King Glipkerio is unbalanced, sick in mind, and not very interesting to look at either. The people he surrounded himself with just enable his twisted delights with their own actions. I am surprised nobody had assassinated him before these.We also get to meet the Gods OF Lankhmar, who frankly, don't put up as much of a show as one would have wished.Ghouls, a two-headed dragon, a man from another words, we get a lot of action, adventure, humor, and thrills, for our buck. I think most of that has to do with it being a full length novel and not just a short story.If you enjoyed this book, or the Swords series as a whole, may I also suggest a few other books. First off, there is the character of Conan whose adventures are collected in three books ;The Coming of Conan the Cimmerian: The Original Adventures of the Greatest Sword and Sorcery Hero of All Time!,The Bloody Crown of Conan (Conan of Cimmeria, Book 2)andThe Conquering Sword of Conan (Conan of Cimmeria, Book 3). Then, if you prefer a longer, more modern series, in the form of short stories, may I suggest at least getting the first of the hardcover Thieves' World books -Sanctuary: Thieves' World; Tales from the Vulgar Unicorn; Shadows of Sanctuarywhich holds the first three paperback books in one edition. In fact, there are hundreds of titles, and I can't list them all. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"In this book Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser are back in more sheltered climes, or at least climes with a lot more rooves. Hanging around in Lankhmar for awhile after adventuring proves to be not quite as relaxing as expected.In fact, their skills are put to the test in defense of just that bunch of architecture as all sorts of things come calling."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"In Swords of Lankhmar, Fritz Lieber combines action with drama and suspense with excitement. He tells the story from a third person point of view. In the book he does not just tell you the description he shows it to you in your mind. He lets you imagine the characters and leaves room for you to make the features of them. He does all this without leaving out any details that are necessary to the story. It is a fantasy book that will appeal to all ages. The two main characters, Fafhrd and the Mouser, are rebels and do what they want when they want. They are an unbeatable force that adventures through different provinces, continents and worlds. They meet new and different people or creatures wherever the journey. They learn form past experiences some easier than others. The two are funny many times but at the action scenes it is like you can see them fighting right in front of you. They persevere through the hardest times while making friends and enemies along the way. In this book they fight human rats, dead warriors and Mongolians. To fully understand some of the conversations you need to read the earlier books in the series. With almost all of their adventures you can recognize what they are talking about without reading the other books. The worlds and provinces are easy to relate to and can be compared to many places on earth. But for some of the places it is an entirely new concept that takes an imagination to realize. The books are a must-read that teach people many things about human personalities."},{"Title":"The Swords Of Lankhmar","review":"The fifth book in the Lahnkmar series continues the story of Fafrd and the Grey Mouser. Somewhere along the way, the \\"special something\\" that made me start buying this series has been lost.

This book feels like standard \\"dungeon crawling\\" fare. In fact, as far as I can tell, the overall story arc is not advanced one whit by this entry.

She ends up to near rambling, and using almost hackneyed descriptions of what the characters do.Her whole idea is very intriguing, but she goes nowhere with it. The end of the book is in the blurb, and even if it was not, it would still be a very boring read. No empathy or connection was made with any of the charachters, false or not. They were stiff and dull."},{"Title":"On Infantry: Revised Edition (Military Profession)","review":"This is an excellent discussion (historical and schematic) of what goes on at the nitty-gritty level of infantry combat; the squads, platoons, companies, and battalions. It shows how various systems succeed or fail at tasks such as flexibility, manouver, combat cohesion and morale, and why the German army was generally qualitatively superior to both Western and Eastern rivals in both world wars.That being said, the authors tend to overemphasize the capabilities of infantry on its own -- particularly unsupported light infantry, and particularly in the theoretical section which concludes the book.While rightly critical of the excessive logistical tail some modern &quot;armies of drivers&quot; drag around, they lose sight of the fact that foot infantry by itself totally lacks operational mobility -- 20 miles a day vs. over 200 for forces with their own organic transport. And they neglect the degree to which infantry alone lacks even tactical mobility on a battlefield saturated with automatic weapons.It's no accident that the armies which actually do a lot of fighting -- the Israelis, for instance -- structure combined-arms teams around honking great monster tanks like the Merkava III or the M1A2 Abrahms, 70 tons or so of massively protected lethality.Mobility means the ability to move, but tactical mobility means the ability to move _under fire_.This poses a genuine strategic dilemma; forces light enough to move rapidly _strategically_ are often too heavy to be mobile in the tactical and operational sense -- you can fly light infantry quickly to the other side of the world, but they can't move when they're actually fighting.Still, an excellent book on the whole."},{"Title":"On Infantry: Revised Edition (Military Profession)","review":"John English is a brilliant tactician and historian who has written THE masterpiece on the origins of Infantry. I would have English describe infantry to about the Vietnam era and have Col Dan Bolger take the coverage from there to the future in his own book Death Ground: American infantry in battle. Bruce Gudmundsson was attached to the updated English book to attempt to bring the work up to date.Taking the masterpiece for what it is, it delivers an important lesson mechanized maneuverists do not want to realize---that the German &quot;blitzkrieg&quot; died in the forests and cities of Russian when it met infantry that would not crumble if surrounded or cut-off from comfortable supply lines. Using a defense-in-depth, a nation on a total war footing can absorb and defeat another less committed nation that hopes to use a smaller force to penetrate and collapse. Many, maybe even most people mistake the German defeat in Russia--and hence WWII---with the cold Russian winter, and this is incorrect. The next critical---perhaps most important lesson and contribution English makes to the defense of freedom is---that a mechanized &quot;combined arms&quot; unit is ONLY AS GOOD AS ITS INFANTRY. When terrain and weather go sour, artillery and tanks will reach a point where they cannot contribute--and the entire battle then falls on the infantry. When this took place in Russia--the German infantry was NOT up to the task with inadequate numbers, clothing and bolt-action rifles. English points out and lesser historians should take note--that the German war machine was good together but not really that good because its PARTS were weak. When combined-arms technotactics could not be employed in the forests of Russia, the battle rested on the German infantry and it failed.The cryptic lesson here is that we need GOOD infantry in large numbers and we don't get it by placing them into the back of armored vehicles in less than squad sizes, shut off from what's going on because they can't open a hatch out and see because we put a turret on the vehicle and we are afraid it will rotate into them. The Army made this mistake with the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, is trying to correct it with its vehicle for the new Brigade Combat Teams while the marines are about to repeat the error with a huge autocannon turret on their next generation amphibious assault vehicle. The second lesson of English is still being ignored---those that do mechanized combined arms don't value infantry action---they ride too long in their vehicles and get ambushed by missiles and RPGs fired from enemies hiding in key terrain that should have been taken first by the infantry. To do this you need a large amount of aggressive, not complacent infantry. As the Russians found out in Grozny, when their armored vehicles became flaming coffins, the battle then falls on the infantry to clear out enemies hiding in urban terrain.This is not to say English believes in a &quot;Super Infantry&quot; since we saw in Mogadishu the best light infantry in the world get shot up because it was without armored fighting vehicles to shield it from enemy fire. What English is saying is that we should start with quality infantry when building forces and not in the process of creating combined-arms organizations ruin the infantry capability by reducing numbers, battle awareness and use as a separate maneuver element.On Infantry should be required reading for ALL U.S. military personnel coupled with Bolger's Death Ground. I'd like to see the book updated to the present with a fresh perspective for the 21st Century where we apply English's lessons to the future battlefield."},{"Title":"On Infantry: Revised Edition (Military Profession)","review":"This is one of a series of surveys by Bruce Gudmundsson on different combat arms. (This book also has John English as a co-author.) As always, Gudmundsson's books are informative and delightfully easy to read. In this book the authors examine the evolution of infantry tactics resulting from the massive increase in firepower as muskets gave way to rifles and then to automatic weapons, in addition to the vast array of supplementary infantry weapons (i.e. grenades, anti-tank weapons, mortars, etc.).They start off by looking at the effects of dispersing troops in open order to mitigate casualties and different armies' responses to this organizational and mental requirement. As the machine gun speedily became ubiquitous early on in World War I, some armies adjusted rapidly and easily, such as the Germans, while others lagged behind, e.g. British, Americans. English and Gudmundsson examine and compare the tactical infantry doctrines and small-unit organizations of the French, German, Russian, British, Japanese and American armies of World War II. Also examined are the Chinese Army from the Korean War and the Vietnam-era American army. In each case, they utilize real battlefield examples to demonstrate how this doctrine was actually put into practice, how effective the chosen tactics were, and their strengths and weaknesses (e.g. the American army's reliance on firepower instead of expert technique). They also examine the importance of psychological conditioning in preparing infantry soldiers for 'the emptiness of the battlefield'. The concluding chapter then briefly examines how different modern armies have organized their infantry arms, e.g. by reducing mechanization & heavy equipment.This was a great survey on infantry organization and tactical doctrine. I highly recommend it as a brief introduction to the infantry arm. A more detailed study by Gudmundsson of the evolution of small-unit tactics can be found in 'Stormtroop Tactics'."},{"Title":"On Infantry: Revised Edition (Military Profession)","review":"Books such as English's \\"On Infantry\\" are difficult to review because it is wise to examine source material in conjunciton with the text. I ordered this book a year ago and have been working on this review since.Due to the scope of this book, I'll only talk about the evolution of the infantry squad as English and Gudmundsson outlined throughout \\"On Infantry.\\" Please note that there are multiple interpretations.The infantry squad had its roots in ancient times as an administrative unit, a sort of \\"family grouping\\" with a big brother serving to mold the younger soldiers. The authors pick this up in the first chapter, \\"The Open Order Revolution,\\" in the period between 1854 the Crimean War) and 1914 (the outbreak of World War One.) A combination of rifling (extending range) and repeater mechanism (increased fire volume) rendered the earlier means of command, control, and concentration of combat power a certain means to defeat; the enemy would shoot the closed-ranks regiments to pieces in minutes. Dispersion while mutually supporting the rest of the regiment or brigade forced the very junior leaders to assume responsibility for what had been the regimental commander's decision-making, as the battlefield became \\"empty\\" in the face of the hail of accurate rifle bullets. Rapid fire weaponry, which included both the machine gun and the quick-fire field piece (one with a recoil mechanism that limited the necessity to relay the gun after each shot--and often used recoil energy to eject spent cartridge casings, increasing the rate of fire), only added to this revolution--and made the old Napoleanic tactics pure suicide.The squad (often thought of as an American invention) became a tactical unit during the Great War, and its evolution from administrative element (for guard duty, for fatigue details, for grouping into mess elements for distributing rations or for issuing supplies) into a tactical element possessing independant internal manuever and fire elements is spread out through \\"On Infantry\\"-- but the most important chapter is 7, \\"A Corporal's Guard.\\" Oddly enough, the French Army almost got it right during the Great War, and was one of the three models for the modern infantry squad. The French put an automatic rifle in the squad and formally divided the squad into two elements--one grouped around the automatic rifle for fire support, and one for manuever with \\"ordianry riflemen.\\" The French squad leader went with the maneuver element and the assistant squad leader stayed with the automatic rifle--but the French failed to exploit this innovation. French Army regulations stipulated that the squad was indivisible and that the smallest element capablie of being assigned an independant task was the platoon. The Germans did it right (funny about those Germans) by exchanging the squad's automatic rifle for a light machine gun, keeping the squad leader with the LMG and making that element the main killing system, with the assistant squad leader running a manuever/assault element of riflemen that supported the machine gun's tasks. The Germans called this universal squad the Einsheitsgruppe, and then proceeded to reinvent the wheel due to deterioration in their non-commissioned officer cadre due to casualties to form a second, \\"guerrilla\\" formation armed (on paper) with the assault rifle and grenade launcher. Simplified tactics also reduced the ability of the squad for independant action--for a single objective (ie, taking or holding a single small building) the minimum maneuver element was the platoon or even battalion. It should be noted here that even though--on paper--the 1944 German Volksgrenadier squad was supposed to have eight men, it was more common for the actual strength to be four, five, or six. There was no assistant squad leader, and Germany relied upon indoctrinating every soldier to take charge of the situation and continue the mission even when leadership personnel became casualties. The third squad formation is one I was most familiar with, the USMC's three fire team rifle squad standardized in March of 1944. Derived from the Chinese Communist practice of grouping three men around a single automatic weapon, this system was first tried out by the Marines in the Second Raider Battalion under Colonel Carlson. Three independantly-maneuvering four-Marine \\"fire teams,\\" each organized around the Browning Automatic Rifle, achieved a balance of mobility and firepower which could be controlled under chaotic battlefield conditions that was hard to improve upon. Too bad that it was squandered in mostly frontal attacks against an enemy whose defense was basically an area ambush, a trap that sucked in attackers for annihilation. It is a credit to the Marines and their lowest-level tactical organization that they managed to prevail over the Imperial Japanese infantry's defensive webs--something like the fly overpowering the spider after getting entangled in its web.There are other subjects covered in \\"On Infantry,\\" but for brevity, I've just covered the evolution of squad organization. This evolution was impacted by such things as changing American Army drill--instead of forming the squad as two ranks of four men, the \\"new\\" squad of 1940 formed as a single file of 12 men--or any other number. Another factor in the evolution of the squad was conversion from foot mobility to motorization--the twelve-man squad of 1940 became a six-Soldier dismount team aboard a Stryker or Bradley. Due to low priority given to \\"bayonets on line,\\" these dismount teams may number a mere two soldiers at times. Infantry squads always suffer attrition-often administrative attrition (mess duty, guard details, \\"give me a guy for a patrol,\\") and frequently casualties due to non-combat accidents, illness, or combat injuries. This messes up tactics because it isn't unusual for a rifle squad to be missing as much as 2/3rds of its strength in combat. The American idea of men as interchangable cogs in a massive machine ignored the human element, but this has changed due to combat experience. When a bunch of \\"weekend warriors\\" who have limited training time, but have known each other for years and have built mutual bonds of confidence out-fight \\"better-trained\\" active-component soldiers in both war games and actual combat, something is obviously wrong with regarding the infantry squad as an ad-hoc grouping of individuals. Sports teams train together to develop team work. The best individual players tossed into a game as a mob will almost always lose to a team of mediocre players who are lead by a competent coach and who play as a team. Infantry combat is a \\"team sport\\" rather than an individual event, and the long-overdue recognition of this simple fact is one reason why American infantry out-fights the Iraqi \\"insurgents.\\"An extensive bibliography and a very useable index enhances \\"On Infantry.\\" This well-read book is an important part of my small unit tactics library."},{"Title":"On Infantry: Revised Edition (Military Profession)","review":"John English's \\"A Perspective on Infantry,\\" and its revised edition, have been enduring residents on the bookshelves of military professionals since first publication in 1981. English's topic is the tactical role of infantry on the twentieth century battlefield. As a Canadian officer, his focus was primarily on the wars in which Canada participated, but this is not a history of the Canadian Army. His narrative closely examines the evolution of infantry organization and use in the American and British armies, and in their 20th century opponents such as the Japanese and German armies.English discusses, in very accessible prose, how changes in warfare and technology tended to drive changes in basic infantry organization down to the fire team and squad level, and how infantry was used on the battlefield. He relies heavily on the historical record of the two world wars, but other conflicts are referenced. English's prose is straightforward and matter-of-fact, even sometimes moving, as in his description of the heroic performance of the U.S. First Marine Division in the breakout from the Chosin Reservoir in 1950.English was a professional writing primarily for other professionals. The reader without military or historical background may not fully appreciate the value of this work.The extent to which integrated joint and combined operations have come to dominate the actions of the U.S. military and to a lesser degree of its NATO allies is an event largely postdating this edition, as is the degree to which netcentric warfare is now commonly used.

This book is a schmaltzy, badly-written, gothic potboiler, at best. Minimal literary merit. At least it's short. Characters were poorly developed, and the plot is predictably silly. This book would find its true audience more effectively were it to be covered in pink foil, with a picture of Fabio brandishing a violin!"},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book, because it promised an entertaining, at times mysterious story about an instrument I love. I was not disappointed.Although I am not a violinist myself, I was taken with the atmosphere of the first chapters of the book, the descriptions of wandering in Vienna and its taverns at night and listening to a great violinist, a true master who somehow wound up selling his art for pennies to customers of local pubs.Jeno, the violinist then starts to tell his story and how he became the man he is today. The atmosphere starts to disappear a bit at this point, although not completely until later in the book.The ending is sadly abrupt and leaves much room for thinking. I would love a Canone Inverso 2 that further elaborates on all the things that happened in the first book...There was a movie made in Italy from this ook and I can't wait for it to get to out theaters."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"In a boisterous tavern on a warm Viennese summer's night, a man encounters a mysterious violinist with whom he feels a connection. Compelled to search for the violinist the next evening, they finally meet at an almost deserted restaurant garden. It is there that the violinist, Jen&ouml;, tells a story of friendship and betrayal.Jen&ouml;'s story captures readers imagination all the way to the mysterious end. The atmosphere of early 20th century Europe is perfectly captured along with the rise of the Third Reich. Although it leaves many unanswered questions, the book is very satisfying and memorable."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"Being a beginning violinist, I was intrigued when I found this book. From the first few pages, it did not disappoint me. Although it was somewhat tragic, it develops the characters in a way few books have. It is a must for any who enjoy worthwhile novels."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"A one-day read of a magnificently crafted, beautifully translated novel. Woven about the passion of musical giftedness, it is a tale that touches on the glories and the evils of our century of Holocaust, of destructive war, of broken and deteriorated families, and of adolescent instability. Having read it rapidly and deceptively easily, one feels the need to re-read more carefully to search out the missed clues leading to the astonishing denouement."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"The format of a story within story (within a story) is one that Maurensig is successful and obviously most comfortable with since both this and The Luneberg Variation take the same format. In this, his second novel, Maurensig tells the story of a beautiful voilin with a strange carving on it, which goes up for auction and is bought by someone who obviously has a long history with it. Upon taking it home, a stranger comes knocking who wants nothing more than to lay eyes on the violin, to authenticate its existance. Curious, the new owner of the instrument asks him why he is so interested in this particular violin and the stranger tells the story of how he came to learn of it. He tells about an eccentric violin virtuoso he met many years ago, who told _him_ a story about the beautiful violin with a strange carving which belonged to him. The eccentric is the topic of his own story, relating the events of his life, the cruel music school he endured, his friendship with a young schoolmate who considered himself more talented than he, and his relationship -- which was his lifeline really -- with this particular instrument. To elaborate any more would mean filling the review with spoilers. Sufficing to say, it is an engaging book, haunting and eloquent, and very satisfying in the realization of its ending which puts a surprising new light on the story within a story within a story the reader has just encountered."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"This is a very different and engrossing book. It has all the ingredients of a life and friendships gone badly wrong, but it has many other interesting features that make it very worthy of the reader's attention.The story begins in the first person, being told by the purchaser of a rare violin at auction. He pays considerable money for it, but is thrilled to have it. He in turn is visited by someone who was also interested in purchasing the violin, but missed the auction. This man relates to the buyer a story of a fascinating man that he had met - the owner of the violin, and how he was unsure at the end of their meeting that he had ever even existed! In telling that story to the buyer, this man then relates the life tale of the violin owner as told to him, of his musical obsession and a great friendship gone badly wrong. A life story, told to a story teller, who tells the narrator, who is in turn telling us, the reader. It is a fascinating and very clever plot device.The story itself is one of music obsession, of discipline and friendship, and woven through it is the underlying menace of the rise of the Third Reich and the horrors of Europe in the 1930s. But it is the surprise ending, and the revelation of the identity of the purchser of the violin that had me most surprised. I never saw it coming, and I do love to be surprised in a book! It is certainly an abrupt ending, and of course it leaves many loose ends, but I think this adds to the impact of the final chapter. It is a finely woven and written story, and it will stay with you for some time.I recommend it highly."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"Don't read this review if you don't want to know what happened. Here are a few of my glaring questions. 1) According to the Priest, Varga died in 1947. But Kuno, on the other hand, didn't die until 1985. Someone, please explain. 2) Who was the violin player who tells 90% of the story? Kuno would have been in the sanitarium. Varga, supposedly, is long dead. So the violen player is a ghost, maybe? The ghost of a schizophrenic's alter ego?Here is what I actually know about the book:1) Gustav buys the violen at auction.2) The &quot;messenger&quot; type character comes to see him. He wants the violin. He relates the story of a man he met who says he was Varga.3) The man who says he was Varga was a) a ghost of Kuno b) Kuno on leave from the sanitarium...which the author never alludes to. This means the story the &quot;messenger&quot; was relating must have taken place before Kuno died in 1985...once again, something that wasn't explained.4) The end.Someone please tell me if they were able to make any better sense of this.That being said, I enjoyed the writing, setting and characters."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"This novel is a finely woven tale of two boys and their passion for mastering the art of the violin in and around Austria during pre- and post war times.

It's a compelling story with sharply written characters and fascinating musings (via the characters and plot) about music as passion, the nature of talent, immortality, and more. Only when you turn the final page will you realize the story Maurensig has told you.

Maybe impossibly so. The story begins with the auction of a very special violin. The fact that we don't know who the buyer is or why he is so anxious to own the violin only adds to the mystery. Further complicating matters is the arrival of an unknown writer who wishes to buy the violin--for almost any price. From this writer we learn the story of Jen&ouml; Varga, a young Hungarian musician and former owner of the strange violin. At this point, Maurensig seems about to launch a fascinating story woven around an equally fascinating theme--the power of music to dominate our life and thus direct its course. When Jen&ouml; meets Kuno Blau, however, the story and its theme seem to shift gears slowly. Sadly, the musical theme, and even Jen&ouml;, seem left behind as Maurensig focuses his attention on Kuno Blau and his obsession with immortality. I wouldn't have minded this mid-story shift had the author somehow tied it more closely to the wonderful theme and story with which he began. The ending, although predictable to me, at least, still left many unaswered questions. What caused Kuno's agonizing deterioration? And what of Jen&ouml;? Did he find the secrect of immortality? And did he find it through his music or through his connections to the mysterious Gustav Blau? And what about the enigmatic Sophie Hirschbaum and her equally enigmatic father? Jen&ouml;'s ties to her are never explored deeply enough to warrant the belief that he truly followed her into death. Maurensig is definitely a first-rate writer as far as his prose and ideas are concerned but his characters and their complex relationships are far too under-developed to give us the insight we need and deserve. This book tends to gloss over a fascinating theme and what could have been an equally fascinating story had it only been treated with a little more depth. I came away from Canone Inverso feeling as though I'd been offered a tantalizing appetizer and then been denied the rest of the meal."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"Before I read the book I read all the reviews, many of which expressed frustration at what wasn't clear, or perhaps how ambiguous the ending appeared. So I decided to try to read more closely, with the result that I too failed and was frustrated as well. Since this work like the Author's first novel, \\"The Luneberg Variation\\", is brief I opened to page one and started again. I cannot say that every detail became clear, every issue resolved, but the story is not as open ended as it appears on the first read.As in his first novel the primary emotion at work is obsession, there are other strong issues, but I believe this to be the strongest. Where other readers feel the Author went off the track of his story, I believe it was meant as a bit of misdirection. The Author mixed the discussion of immortality and music, but I believe he did it primarily to confuse the reader. I was confused enough without that, for the Author plays games with everything from ready made graves that do/did and may yet have an occupant, to Patrimony, and then a mental condition that throws many presumptions to that point out of order. As this last point is revealed on the penultimate page, the Author tests how well you followed the characters, and how high your frustration level is.I have been reading a number of books by the Author Michael Dibdin, and like Mr. Dibdin Mr. Maurensig enjoys telling his stories in a pattern akin to a labyrinth as opposed to an orderly sequence of events. But a good Mystery needs to move in a manner that at times may appear random, but if done well will become clear at the end. This Author leaves more to be interpreted by the reader than other writers. His tales however are intricate and would make for great debate if all the reviewers were to gather and put forth their \\"answers\\"."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"From the start I was captivated by this modern classic. The book started out with questions and concluded with questions. Those who have written reviews who questioned the book's ending do so legitimately, but sometimes a complete ending is not necessary and would ruin the book. Leaving us guessing at certain details in the ending was the authors attempt to touch our souls, and he did so mine. We can all imagine what happened to Sophie's father, he probably died in a war camp, or disappeared to America. We can also determine that Jeno probably died soon after loosing the instrument. I think that one who dislikes the way the author ends this book lacks imagination. The book gives enough answers, but we should also analyze it ourselves. This book kept me guessing through most of it. I could not possibly set it down because of my desire to know what was going to happen. The author did wander in the middle, but the end made up for it. A tragic and surprising end should give every creative reader a thrill! It touches the soul, a must read!"},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"Paolo Maurensig's second novel, CANONE INVERSO, is told in the form of an oral history of an oral history -- it is a dark story, but a compelling and human one.After purchasing an unusually beautiful antique violin at an auction, the buyer is visited in his hotel room by a mysterious stranger. The man tells him that he was planning to bid on the instrument himself, but was unable to arrive at the auction in time. Noticing a strangeness about the man, along with a seemingly emotional attachment to the instrument, the buyer inquires further, and the man begins to tell the story of the violin -- which involves his retelling of an older story, told to him by the instrument's former owner, sitting at a sidewalk cafe table in Vienna, long ago.The story is an unusual and gripping one -- I found this novel especially hard to set aside, and finished it the day after I started it (I had to force myself to go to bed). The story told by the man in Vienna involves himself and another boy -- both musical prodigies -- who met while attending a prestigious musucal institute in Austria just before the outbreak of World War II. The talent that the two boys shared draws them together into a long and difficult friendship -- and the novel has much to say, cloaked within its gripping story, of the nature of friendship, its blessings as well as its pitfalls.Maurensig's prose is liquid and beautiful, reproducing perfectly the sense of an oral history. As the story unfolds before the reader's eyes -- and into the listener's ears -- aspects of the boys' lives are revealed like new days dawning over time. This is some very effective storytelling. At the heart of their lives is their love of music -- and they each love it in different ways, for different reasons.The conclusion of the story is not altogether unexpected, but neither is it telegraphed in an obvious way -- Maurensig's talents are obvious and formidable, making this book a great joy to experience. I look forward to reading his first novel, THE LUNEBERG VARIATIONS."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"I was just looking through the other reviews, and found the one with all the questions in it by nikita128. Again, don't read this if you don't want the story to be given away...Jeno *did* die in '47; it was Kuno as his alter ego Jeno who was telling the story - remember the reference he makes to &quot;returning where i came from&quot;? It's Kuno who's escaped from the funny farm. This all happens in 1986, when the visitor comes and explains his reasons for wanting to get the violin, saying that this happened to him the previous year - in 1985.I absolutely loved this book, and although i am not a musician, i know a number, and absolutely love how Paolo Maurensig was able to convey the deep emotion and passion that a musician like Jeno puts into their work..."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"In this dazzling tour de force, Maurensig plays a clever intellectual game, setting traps for the reader, his prey. Fiendish in his deceptions, he actively engages our emotions from the outset, evoking curiosity about his mysterious characters and their circumstances, inspiring sympathy for teenage musicians surviving psychological torment in music school, and creating enormous empathy for an orphaned boy, homeless, unloved, and passionate about his music. We feel rather than think, we get caught, and we love it.What makes the book even more remarkable to me is that while the author is playing tricks with the reader's emotions and views of reality, he is also creating a passionate tribute to the power of music and artfully structuring his book in the pattern of a musical canon--a round, in which a \\"melody\\" is introduced and then chased indefinitely by its imitation, until, as in this novel, it rises \\"to its supreme fulfillment in an original burst of mutual genius...and [then begins] its descent, its countdown,...its canone inverso.\\"The symbolic melody of a valuable 16th century Stainer violin sets the voices of the canon's narrative aswirl. The first voice, an unnamed old man, buys the violin at auction. The second voice, a writer and passionate lover of music, comes to his hotel the next day to see, and attempt to buy, the violin from its new owner. He tells the old man the story of Jeno Varga, a Hungarian itinerant musician who once owned the violin and who stupefied a tavern audience, playing rapturously the previous year. \\"One of music's fighters\\" whose career had, for some reason, been interrupted, Jeno becomes the third and dominant voice as he tells his story to the writer.Many readers have talked about reading the book a second time to answer questions about Jeno and his life and to understand the ending. While I rarely reread a book, I did with this one, marveling at the author's cleverness, amazed at how clearly the characters and events fall into place and the questions are answered, once one has the benefit of hindsight. Dozens of clues and peculiar statements, which I ignored in the first reading, stand out clearly on the second, especially those pertaining to time. The irony of the title is stunning. Like music, this story improves and begins to reveal itself more completely the second time around. Encore. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"Here, as in his first book &quot;The Luneburg Variation,&quot; Maurensig aims to intrigue, entertain, misdirect, and ultimately give insight to the bright and dark sides of genius. In the first book, chess was the vehicle for exploring genius; in &quot;Canone Inverso,&quot; music is the mode.This short, yet complex book, follows the story of a violin and its series of owners. Through the eyes of a modern day music enthusiast, we meet young musicians of Austria who were subjected to prison-like training regimes, and old men who bear the scars of their abilities.Maurensig, himself, displays the two sides of genius in his work. At times, I find myself enthralled with his characters and descriptions; at other times, I'm perplexed and disturbed by the places they take us. This author seems intimately familiar with the seduction of art and its ability to eventually take us captive. Rather than enjoy the art (music, chess, or what have you) for its own sake, we are susceptible to the desire for perfection, for greatness, for immortality. And this struggle is precisely what Maurensig explores in the convoluted tale of Kuno Blau and Jeno Varga. The twisted thinking of genius is in full display here and only in the final pages do we get a clear picture of the truth.But don't expect the author to put all the puzzle pieces together for you. He's too smart for that, and he expects you to be as well. To read his stories is to be taken captive by the same artistic allure of his characters. To reach the end is to resist the temptation and master the beast. &quot;Canone Inverso&quot; refers to a countdown or descent in music. This book, indeed, is a descent into the tortured mind of one who strives for acclaim, fame, family, and self-discovery.What Arturo Perez-Reverte attempts to do in his literary mysteries, such as &quot;The Flanders Panel,&quot; Maurensig manages to do in half the space. Although the interaction between his characters is limited and the depiction of mental decay tedious, you will find the themes explored to be strangely unique, yet universal."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"My preference in novels is for books that are realistic and mirror the society in which they take place; I like to enter the universes created by writers, with the single proviso that such places must be believable enough to totally absorb me. So I was surprised by having to give (in all fairness) this novel its five stars despite its violation of my verisimilitude requirements.But in truth, this is not a novel, but a carefully crafted mechanical device composed entirely of words, intricate and at times unfathomably complex, but one that moves and has rhythms, its gears engaged, every \\"tick\\" followed by its inevitable \\"tock;\\" a machine that works and is probably extremely accurate in what it does, even though, in the end, one is not sure what it is that it does.I appreciated the warnings from other reviewers that the book may need to be read twice before it is fully grasped; a violation of general principles: the writer should have one chance to engage our attention, not two. Yet Canone Inverso was surely better in its re-reading.It is a short book, consumable in one sitting. Its prose is exquisite, its translation so good that one does not notice it, and its effect on the reader's mind is galvanizing. Exotic, intricate, playing with dangerous themes of good and evil, of trust and hatred, of life and death, this confection is not a toy, but a serious intrument of reflection. A joy for seekers of word pleasures."},{"Title":"Canone Inverso: A Novel","review":"On the advice of a friend I bought this book. As I began reading, I was pleasantly surprised by the book's excellence. I am sorry that the author didn't maintain it to the very end.The mysterious circumstances of the story immediately caught my attention, demanding me to continue reading. In the middle of the book I feel that story begins to stray a bit from Jen&ouml;, the main character, and his passions and ambition. I found the end to be rather abrupt and one that answers far too little. The bits of information that the author offers do not add up, leaving the ending and the true fate of the characters open to much debate.

This one is different. It is a wonderful novel about two men and their passion for music. It reminded me of a music version of Oscar Wilde's \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray,\\" in its descriptions of the passion for music (as \\"Dorian\\" has passion for art.) The descriptions of music, immortality, friendship and the underlying theme of the coming of the Nazis are all very powerful. (I think kudos to the translator are appropriate.) I love books about music or art and the violin is my favorite instrument. I read it in two days, not able to put it down until I finished it in the wee hours of the morning. Maybe I should have figured it out, but the surprise ending was a surprise to me. If you are at all interested in classical music you must read this book.

It contained 152 works by 83 authors. There were 50 short stories (42 authors), 71 poems (30 authors), and 30 essays plus 1 excerpt from an autobiography (11 authors). The short fiction comprised about 70% of the book, poetry 10% and essays/excerpt 20%.There were 88 works from the 20th century from mainland China (47 writers), 58 from Taiwan (31 writers, including &eacute;migr&eacute;s), and 6 works from Hong Kong from the 1970s and after (5 writers). Seventeen of the authors were women.The works were divided into short fiction, poetry and essays, with each of these divided further into pieces from 1918-49 (early modern), 1949-76 (post-\\"Liberation\\") and since 1976 (post-Mao). The middle period, 1949-76, was represented almost entirely by Taiwanese, including &eacute;migr&eacute;s from the mainland. This was because most of the literature from the mainland during that time, intended mainly to promote the new society under the Communist Party, was judged unable to stand inclusion on artistic merit. The one exception was a poem by Mu Dan published at the period's end, in 1976.The short fiction was by far the most enjoyable section, with stories by the early moderns to 1949 (including Lu Xun, Mao Dun, Lao She, Shen Congwen, Ba Jin, Zhang Tianyi, Ding Ling, Wu Zuxiang, Xiao Hong, Zhang Ailing), writers from Taiwan from the 1960s to 1990 (Zhu Xining, Bai Xianyong, Li Yongping, Yuan Qiongqiong, Li Ang, Xiao Sa, Zhu Tianwen), and mainland writers after 1976 to 1991 (Qiao Dianyun, Wang Meng, Li Rui, Can Xue, Chen Cun, Mo Yan, Yu Hua and Su Tong). No writer besides Lu Xun was presented in any depth, but the coverage was broad. There were many strong works: humorous, ironic, naturalistic and humanistic, the best of which were written with compassion, powerful imagery and historical insight.Before 1949, there were a narrator's description of the decline of a store that couldn't shift with the times (Lao She), a ferocious depiction of oppression by landlords (Wu Zuxiang), a compassionate story about the effects of prejudice (Xiao Hong) and a wry description of a brief encounter in Shanghai (Eileen Chang). After 1976, there was a fascinating story showing how the treatment of an ancient artifact reflected the changing political currents of the times (Qiao Dianyun) and a piece showing unusually keen psychological insight into one man's behavior (Chen Cun). On Taiwan, there were stories with great descriptive power (Li Yongping), sometimes with allusive symbolism (Zhu Xining), reminiscences about the past (Bai Xianyong), and careful depictions of a relationship (Yuan Qiongqiong, Xiao Sa) and contemporary decadence (Zhu Tianwen).Missed in this prose section were a story from Liu Xianwu, one of the earliest post-Mao writers, Kong Jiesheng, another early post-Mao writer, and pieces from the 1980s by mainland authors Bei Dao, Cheng Naishan, Feng Jicai, Wang Anyi and Wang Shuo.In the poetry section, there were poets before 1949 (including Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, Li Jinfa, Feng Zhi), many poets from Taiwan between the 1950s and 80s (Ji Xian, Yu Guangzhong, Ya Xian, Xiong Hong) poets from the mainland from the 1970s to 1990 (Mu Dan, Bei Dao, Shu Ting, Yang Lian, Wang Xiaolong, Gu Cheng) and an anonymous poem from Hong Kong following the government crackdown on the mainland in 1989.For this reader, the poems were much less interesting, marked by much self-consciousness and obscurity. One enjoyed was \\"Self\\" (1976), by Mu Dan, in which the speaker looked back at the selves of his life and wondered which one was real. Moving poems missed in this collection included \\"Spring Waters\\" (1923) by Bing Xin on love and optimism, the despairing \\"All\\" (ca. 1980) by Bei Dao, and a reply to it, \\"Also All,\\" (ca. 1980) by Shu Ting. Or anything by Zha Haisheng (Haizi), another important poet for the post-Mao generations. Early poetry by Ai Qing from the 1930s was included, but nothing from 1979 or after (\\"Hope,\\" \\"The Great Wall,\\" \\"The Colosseum of Ancient Rome\\").The essay section highlighted writers before 1949 (Lin Yutang, Zhou Zouren, Zhu Ziqing, Feng Zikai, Liang Yuchun), those in Taiwan after 1949 (Lin Yutang, Yu Guangzhong, Yang Mu), a few writers on the mainland from the late 1970s (Ba Jin, Wen Jieruo) and one from Hong Kong in the 1980s (Dong Qiao). The majority of their works seemed bookish and/or ephemeral, unconcerned directly with the major events of their time, with too many on subjects like installing a telephone, going shopping, quitting smoking, getting sick or visiting the barber, activities about which it was often felt necessary to cite passages from Chinese classics or historic anecdotes.Interesting exceptions were an essay from the 1920s by Lu Xun for his first collection of short stories that described the aims behind his writing and the excerpt of a memoir by Wen Jieruo and an essay by Ba Jin about the suffering of those close to them during the Cultural Revolution. For most of the rest, I would've gladly traded the space they took up for more excerpts from memoirs -- such as Half of Man Is Woman (1985), by Zhang Xianliang -- or even extracts from important modern novels like Fortress Besieged (1947). No essay by Qian Zhongshu was included, either.All of the younger prose writers from the mainland who were featured in this anthology were still based in China after 1989. Among the poets, however, Bei Dao and Yang Lian had subsequently moved abroad, and Gu Cheng had emigrated in 1979.Because this first edition was published in 1995, the coverage of the 1990s naturally was scant: only five works. I'm looking forward to reading what's been added to the second edition, published in 2007, to reflect recent developments among Chinese writers, both in China and overseas."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Literature","review":"These comments are for the first edition of the book, which was published in 1995, not the second/revised version, which came out in 2007.The book was the largest collection of modern Chinese literature that I've seen, and must've taken some years to compile.

On Taiwan, there were stories with great descriptive power (Li Yongping), sometimes with allusive symbolism (Zhu Xining), reminiscences about the past (Bai Xianyong), and careful depictions of a relationship (Yuan Qiongqiong, Xiao Sa) and contemporary decadence (Zhu Tianwen).Missed in this prose section were a story from Liu Xianwu, one of the earliest post-Mao writers, Kong Jiesheng, another early post-Mao writer, and pieces from the 1980s by mainland authors Bei Dao, Cheng Naishan, Feng Jicai, Wang Anyi and Wang Shuo.In the poetry section, there were poets before 1949 (including Xu Zhimo, Wen Yiduo, Li Jinfa, Feng Zhi), many poets from Taiwan between the 1950s and 80s (Ji Xian, Yu Guangzhong, Ya Xian, Xiong Hong) poets from the mainland from the 1970s to 1990 (Mu Dan, Bei Dao, Shu Ting, Yang Lian, Wang Xiaolong, Gu Cheng) and an anonymous poem from Hong Kong following the government crackdown on the mainland in 1989.For this reader, the poems were much less interesting, marked by much self-consciousness and obscurity. One enjoyed was \\"Self\\" (1976), by Mu Dan, in which the speaker looked back at the selves of his life and wondered which one was real. Moving poems missed in this collection included \\"Spring Waters\\" (1923) by Bing Xin on love and optimism, the despairing \\"All\\" (ca. 1980) by Bei Dao, and a reply to it, \\"Also All,\\" (ca. 1980) by Shu Ting. Or anything by Zha Haisheng (Haizi), another important poet for the post-Mao generations. Early poetry by Ai Qing from the 1930s was included, but nothing from 1979 or after (\\"Hope,\\" \\"The Great Wall,\\" \\"The Colosseum of Ancient Rome\\").The essay section highlighted writers before 1949 (Lin Yutang, Zhou Zouren, Zhu Ziqing, Feng Zikai, Liang Yuchun), those in Taiwan after 1949 (Lin Yutang, Yu Guangzhong, Yang Mu), a few writers on the mainland from the late 1970s (Ba Jin, Wen Jieruo) and one from Hong Kong in the 1980s (Dong Qiao). The majority of their works seemed bookish and/or ephemeral, unconcerned directly with the major events of their time, with too many on subjects like installing a telephone, going shopping, quitting smoking, getting sick or visiting the barber, activities about which it was often felt necessary to cite passages from Chinese classics or historic anecdotes.Interesting exceptions were an essay from the 1920s by Lu Xun for his first collection of short stories that described the aims behind his writing and the excerpt of a memoir by Wen Jieruo and an essay by Ba Jin about the suffering of those close to them during the Cultural Revolution. For most of the rest, I would've gladly traded the space they took up for more excerpts from memoirs -- such as Half of Man Is Woman (1985), by Zhang Xianliang -- or even extracts from important modern novels like Fortress Besieged (1947). No essay by Qian Zhongshu was included, either.All of the younger prose writers from the mainland who were featured in this anthology were still based in China after 1989. Among the poets, however, Bei Dao and Yang Lian had subsequently moved abroad, and Gu Cheng had emigrated in 1979.Because this first edition was published in 1995, the coverage of the 1990s naturally was scant: only five works. I'm looking forward to reading what's been added to the second edition, published in 2007, to reflect recent developments among Chinese writers, both in China and overseas."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Literature","review":"I strongly recommend this book for all who are interested in modern Chinese literature and history. I reference this book extensively in my history class, and my students enjoy having \\"book club\\" sessions about this book. The fact that all literature included in this book are relatively short make them excellent materials to work with in teaching and learning. All translations are beautifully done, and we need more books like this to promote Chinese literature for English readers."},{"Title":"The Columbia Anthology of Modern Chinese Literature","review":"The thing that upsets me about this book is that it ignores a considerable body of Chinese literature published in Mainland China between 1949 and 1976. There were some novels of great insight and brilliance published during this time period in Mainland China. Before I first went to China, I read an anthology of 20th century Chinese literature that was spectacular and covered Chinese literature in this period and dealt with the early days of the revolution, Chinese intervention in Korea, the Hundred Flowers movement, the Anti-Rightist campaign, the Great Leap Forward, the Cultural Revolution, and a little bit of what followed in the years between the fall of the Gang of Four and the rise of Deng Xiaoping. I can't remember the professor who compiled these works and provided context. I want to say it's Lee Kai Hui, but I'm not sure as that doesn't return anything on Amazon or other book sites. I borrowed it from the University of Arizona Library in Tucson for those looking for a good anthology of literature that covers this time period. Anyway, I don't think this particular book is bad, but how can you have an anthology of Chinese literature and omit the whole communist period. It seems awfully propagandistic to me, especially for a work backed by Columbia University, so this is my reason for the 1 star review."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I'm not a giant sci-fi fan. I do find some of the best films and books out there to be sci-fi, though, usually when the author tackles philosophical topics with twists that this genre allows so well. On that note, I thought the themes of the first book were a lot more interesting than this one. While the plot of the first one really mirrored the birth of modern western civilization with lots of clever plot twists and clear themes for each short story, this one seems more like a straight forward space opera adventure story, like a Star Wars flick (and yes, I know this came well before Star Wars). There are only two stories in this one and they're very similar and without a clear theme that I could pull out.So yeah, it's a less cerebral experience than the first book. If you're into hard sci-fi you may enjoy this more."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"As the second book in the original three of the Foundation series, Isaac Asimov picks up with the last efforts of the Empire to root out the Foundation. Those familiar with the first of the original three in this series will recognize the characteristics of the first book in this one immediately; a mixture of science and technology with a lot of wit and intriguing conversation. The second half of the book introduces the Mule, a mutant that Hari Seldon's models could not account for. Anyone who enjoyed the original Foundation will surely enjoy this sequel.For those new to the series, this should not be the first book you pick up. Based on order of publication the original series is best read in this order:Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Asimov extended the foundation series further in the 1980s and included two books at the end and two prequels. I believe the best idea is to read the books in order of publication, but any reader will do fine reading them in chronological order as well (shown below).Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It was a very interesting concept, a bit heavy on a scientific version of \\"fate\\". This series of books uses the concept of random motion as a prediction for the future was quite a brilliant idea. The story deals with a genius who predicts behavior for millenia into the future and actually has recorded holograms for future people that deal with his predictions. Where I had trouble was the reliance on robots in the later books. I personally prefer the human side of things. It was an interesting read and well worth it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov is my favorite sci-fi writer and this book is great. Do realize that this is the first book of the Foundation trilogy and that Amazon sells all three books in a single hardcover which makes the most sense costwise. So buy the trilogy in a single volume rather than buying this first story separately."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"but just barely!Foundation (Foundation Novels)by Asimov; a classic, a reread (its been at least 35 years however), and a very quick read. Sadly, Foundation doesn't hold up well at all. It's hard to understand how such an accomplished mathematician and scientist like Asimov was so completely unaware of the coming ideas of chaos theory and how it would make his theory of 'psychohistory' so completely improbable and even faintly ridiculous. Secondly, it's 12,000 years into the future... and Asimov can't imagine beyond the common use of tobacco products, blasters, and nuclear power??All that said (and I know it's been said in many reviews in far less kind terms than I have)... it's still a fun story, and one can see the roots and budding ideas of lots and lots of later authors. One can only wonder what science fiction will look like 70 years from now!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I recently re-read this classic work of science fiction, and was pleasantly surprised to find it's still relevant today. The characters and language are a bit creaky, but the social issues Asimov raises are sound. Under what conditions is it ethical for a self-appointed academic elite to hoodwink and trick the general population for their own good? Phrased that way, the answer seems obvious -- under no conditions at all? -- but what if it really IS for their own good, and if disaster is the alternative?We don't have any better answers to those questions today than we did 70 years ago, when Asimov was writing."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Absolutely wonderful book. Real science fiction is not about blasters and spaceships, it is about people who've been put in extraordinary situation and how they react to it.I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"One more trip outside my usual reading waters. Science fiction. Foundation makes me remember why I loved science fiction when I was in my late teens and early twenties. The whole world is tilted and new ways of thinking and doing things become possible. All our world leaders need to read science fiction, with its ominous ventures into possible futures. Foundation is the story of a world set up solely as place to compile an enormous encyclopedia, an effort for the ages. But as the story moves forward rapidly in time, we readers come to see that the world has been set up for many other, secret purposes, purposes designed to save the thinking peoples from an eternity in a dark age."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asmiov is not at all a great writer. He does not develops the characters, who are often just tools to set the story going. Classic readers may find his style too crude, too objective. In this series, a character you find important for the story in one chapter may never appear in the rest of the saga.But Asimov is a master storyteller. His imagination has delivered us a lot of great sci-fi stories, and the Foundation series is among the best.In the far future, experts in the study of the behavior of great populations determine that the galactic empire is going to disappear, and then they conceive a plan to preserve human civilization, and reduce a many thousand years of \\"dark age\\" to just one thousand years. They predict what is going to happen decades and centuries in the future, and take precautions so that humanity will be able to avoid each crisis, according to the strongest factor at each time. It seems complex, but it's not. As long as you reach chapter three, you're ok. I can't tell anymore without spoiling it, but despite its lack of literary quality, it's a story you must read if you like science fiction.I liked this book most for the outstanding way the plan comes together in each crisis, revealing Asimov's amazing creative mind.I you think sci-fi silly, or if you value literary virtue a great deal, this is not your book. But if a great story is enough to entertain you, you won't be able to put this book down."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In this second volume of Asimov's classic \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, the Foundation continues its struggle to preserve civilization at the fringes of the crumbling Galactic Empire. In the past, the Foundation has used religion and trade to control their neighborhood at the edge of the galaxy, but now they grow strong enough to attract the attention of the Empire itself, which, though weakened, still exists and is still a powerful foe. And after the Empire, yet another danger appears, an individual called only \\"the Mule\\" who seems to effortlessly brush all resistance aside. Can the Foundation survive and succeed in its mission to preserve civilization in the wake of the Empire's collapse?"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is a classic series of galaxy rebuilding. These books combine stories that jump hundreds of years to become a history of the Foundation. This is a new and different way to look at science fiction writing that has created many copycats. As the series comes to a close the location of the actual Foundation is moved from planet to planet so many times that the reader is ready for the unexpected twist. Science fiction writing is all about the concept and the Foundation series has a concept that can produce books for years to come."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Set more than 10,000 years in the future, at the edge of a failing galactic empire, this book isn't a story so much as a series of vignettes spanning decades. The book starts by detailing the effort to create the Foundation, which will try to preserve civilization from total collapse as the Empire continues to decay. With each jump to the future, we see the members of the Foundation confront a series of crises that threaten both the Foundation and the very fabric of civilization.Asimov has done a remarkable job of creating a believable far future, with a human civilization that spans the massive space of the galaxy. His descriptions of the decline of the Empire, and of the resulting chaos at its edges extrapolates nicely from history (particularly the decline of the Roman Empire). Though written half a century ago, very little about this book feels particularly dated, except possibly for the prevalence of characters that smoked. This book deserves its reputation as a science-fiction classic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"this book is one of the most important books in science fiction historyand a must for all science fiction lovers."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Ah, Isaac Asimov. A god, some would say, in the sci-fi genre. I picked up this book at the urging of a friend, trusting in its reputation.At first I found Foundation unusual to read, it covers large swathes of time at once. However, Asimov does this extremely well. He gives us little anchors of information or characters that we can recognize, so we can figure out where we are in the time line without him having to come out and say it.Much of the book is dialogue, which is something I have not encountered before. Most of the story and characterization is carried in the dialogue rather than through plain description. Asimov doesn't tell you what the characters are thinking, he *shows* you what they're thinking as they explain it to other characters. This rather prevents us from growing too close to the characters, but that is rather the point because the time line goes so fast.Foundation was an unusual novel, but I can see why it is still a classic. It may be a little dry for some, but I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\"..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When you foretell the decline of a galactic empire, you don't make many friends. But Seldon manages to keep what he finds low key and sets into motion a series of events that will lessen, not stop, the ravages that are to come.A great sci-fi classic. One of the best from an all time master of the genre. When I was younger I tried to track down every book he ever wrote. Think I got all the Tales from the Black Widows, but am not sure.Any lover of Sci-fi will find this not only exciting, but intelectually stimimulating."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I totally liked the pattern that Isaac Asimov established in \\"Foundation,\\" the first volume in what we know refer to as the original Foundation trilogy. Hari Seldon created the revolutionary science of psychohistory and mapped out a future for humanity that would allow thirty thousand years of barbarism between the existing galactic empire and the future one to be reduced to only one thousand years. Through the effort of the psychohistorians the Foundation was established with its encyclopedists. Then we saw the rise of the Mayors, the Traders, and the Merchant Princes, each representing a step on the path laid out with mathematical precision by Hari Seldon over the first two centuries of the millennium he plotted out.I was looking forward to a continuing series of Seldon Crises as the Foundation played out the rise of human civilization, thinking that what we had hear with what Arnold Toynbee had done with his study of ancient civilizations extended into a future that covered an entire galaxy. But Asimov was setting us up for something unexpected in \\"Foundation and Empire\\"; the idea was that at this stage the Foundation would be threatened by the final power play of the dying Empire. But the universe is apparently tired of Hari Seldon playing with his mathematically loaded dice and has thrown the entire plan into doubt by creating a mutant, nicknamed \\"The Mule.\\" Now the Foundation, the Seldon Plan and the entire galaxy is facing a new and powerful threat.When I first read \\"Foundation and Empire\\" I was rather dismayed at the big change in direction. But, of course, Asimov knew what he was doing. He had already proven the validity of psychohistory, at least within the context of his futuristic novel, and there really is no reason to put out another four books (at two hundred years apiece) to complete the plan. Historians might find this interesting, but Science Fiction fans were going to want more than that from Asimov. Indeed, the Mule proves to be, both in terms of the story and the trilogy, the link between the Foundation and the Second Foundation. The Foundation trilogy is classic science fiction from the genre's self-proclaimed Golden Age, and even if the writing style seems dated or quaint, it remains a seminal series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"But, then, how could it not be when its author was the incomparable Isaac Asimov?

It is grate, and once I started to read it, I couldn't stop. Read it!!! and you will become an Issac Asimov Fan like me."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The big brain of Isaac Asimov composed this series and it shows. This book contains more characters than a fifteen-act Shakespearian play and still manages to unfold as one impressively coherent space-saga. This is by no means a detriment, and characters as well as past events are periodically referenced in later chapters.I'm by no stretch a science fiction aficionado, but upon reading summaries of the plot I couldn't wait to read this book, and it verily meets my expectations. The most interesting thing about this work is that it can be read as pure-science fiction or as social-commentary/social history. Without revealing too much, the sections of the book are dedicated to describing certain \\"Crises\\" that invariably occur due to the events of an imperialistic planet - planet Terminus, home-world of the Foundation - and it's attempts to reestablish (or supplant) a dying Galactic empire. The Foundation uses religion, politics, and economics to spread it's influence across the periphery, or \\"outer-edge\\" of the galaxy. Most of the book centers on characters who possess an aptitude for politics or are just plain cunning, and it's extremely entertaining to see how each character handles the crises and mini-crises laid before them.This book is, surprisingly, heavy on politics - but not politics as usual...that is to say, not any politics that you and I would be familiar with, but politics of fictional worlds and fictional people. However, the political theory behind it all is strong...I was hoping for a little more description when it came to the actual \\"science-fiction,\\" but I guess it was Asimov's intention to leave most of the work to the imagination, and this actually works-out beautifully. Your imagination can truly run wild with this book - Asimov gives only the most cursory descriptions of the characters, but what he gives is enough to get you going. Besides, who wants to spend time reading about a character when there is a good chance that he or she will no longer exist a couple pages down the road? You can infer much of the characters content from their actions and dialogue. Foundation is an entertaining and ambitious book, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series. Classic for a reason."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book, Foundation, is a very detailed fictional book that place in the future. Isaac Asimov wrote many books and series in his lifetime and this book along with the series was one of his first books written. This story is mostly about the First Galactic Empire and its fall. Hari Seldon was a psychohistorian, and, using his advanced mathematics, was able to conclude that the Empire would soon fall in 500 years, and then be followed by 30,000 years of barbarism. Hari, however, could limit the 30,000 years to only 1,000 years, by having the people on a planet called Terminus follow an Encyclopedia Galactica that Hari Seldon had made. They followed this for 50 years until they found out it was a fake. Many years pass, and there are many different people who try to do something to help. Each person had a crisis to get past in order to keep doing what had to be done to limit the barbarism to 1,000 years. This continues until the end of the book, and is then continued in the sequels. I think that this book was very interesting and I enjoyed it a lot, but the only problem about it is that it is very difficult to follow because each chapter, new characters are brought in and it take place 50 or more years later in time. Other than that, if you are a good reader and enjoy fiction books then this is a great book to read. Also, if you really like the book, there are a ton of other books that he wrote, including several other sequels that you can read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Few works of literature merit me acquiring several copies and I must say that the Foundation series is one of those. Whenever I find an old edition of this series I tend to pick it up and now I own several copies of this series of books ranging from decrepid old paperbacks to some of these newer copies.Here are a few spoilers about the story but I hope not too many:Overall, the premise for foundation is quite intersting. The books take place in a far away future where humanity has colonized the galaxy. In this far future, a scientist discovers that he can tell the future...not for any particular person but for the aggregate of humanity as a whole and then only over long periods of time. The future that Hari Seldon, our scientist, sees is grim: the galactic empire and the society that billions upon billions of people depend on will fall. Nothing can stop this decline and fall.The scientist though figures that his formulas and computers can find key inflection points in history when the future can be altered or \\"helped along\\" and if the right decisions are made, the empire can be restored much more quickly than if history was simply left to run its course.So, the Foundation is created to safeguard human knowledge and especially this concept of psychohistory and every few millenia or so - whenever the computers predict that a \\"shove\\" is needed to get the empire back ot its glory - the Foundation \\"speaks\\" and tells people what to do to fix things.Overall, this is a fantastic series that Asimov at some point winds up tying into with his whole Robot series...you know the laws of robotics?...which winds up being just fantastic.This book was written in the 50s or 60s so there is quite a propensity to use nuclear technology powered gadgets of all kinds and people smoke quite a bit and the characters don't tend to have that heavy gravitas that you find in some modern TV like Battlestar Galactics: it was a more innocent time and that comes across int he writing. It is quite interesting to read science fiction from this era as it shows some of the cutting edge thinking of the time, but Asimov was so good that his writing transcends through to today and in many ways is better than some of the overly complex baryon/tachyon hard sci fi of today. This is smart sci fi - and it is smart sci fi because Asimov is so well read. So please as you pick this up, put it in context - you're not going to get Stephen Baxter or even Gregory Benford and you're not going to get David Brin -- you are going to get Asimov and it just tastes different from modern sci fi. These words are 50 years old.Now, Asimov was very well read and that comes across in his writing and if you read carefully you will find Machiavelli, Gibbon, Plato, and a slew of other writer's concepts interwoven into some of the very original thinking of Asimov.Asimov was truly a giant and the Foundation series is required reading along with the Robot series. A couple of things, one - there is quite a bit of mythology and gravitas associated with Foundation as one of the foundational works of science fiction and that causes people to approach the work with different emotions. Some people have their hopes way up. Others, like me approached Foundation with a bit of trepidation, I was a bit scared as a 15 year old whether I'd be able to read this book - my literature teacher recommended it to me. I must say that Foundation reads fast and it is a rather engaging story, so you get sucked in pretty quickly and there aren't a ton of turns or multiple branches like in Zelazny - Foundation is straight forward....and refreshing in many ways.The second parting item I leave you with is regarding this edition. I found it to be more of a collectors paperback than a mass market paperback - a bith higher quality. It does give you the feel that you're reading something special...but if you want to save yourselves a few bucks go for the mass market edition or if you want to dress it up a bit, get this one --- or if you really want to get an old copy, go to some antique book shop and pick up a leather bound edition with the gold trim (yes such a beast is out there).In any case, enjoy - this is \\"classic science fiction.\\" Those are loaded words and I offer them as consideration before you pick this book up."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first book of the original trilogy, but the third book overall.

To reduce the time to a mere 1,000 years, he establishes two Foundations at each end of the galaxy.This book focuses on only the First Foundation, the Second Foundation makes its first appearance in the sequel, Foundation and Empire. The First Foundation expands to take over the edges of the receding empire using its superior intelligence instead of force. They win conflicts through technology, religion, and trade.The theme that reason can overcome brute force is cleverly illustrated in this science fiction classic. It's a relatively short book at 320 pages, and a very fast read. The first book of the original Foundation trilogy is the beginning of a truly great series, a must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is one of the original science fiction novel of all time. I read this book as an outside reading assignment for my English class. First of all, I chose this book out of all the other books because I didn't want to read something that sounds dull and unexciting. I wanted to read something more innovative, and I certainly made the right choice when I picked this book from the library shelf.Hari Seldon, the protagonist, develops a area of study called psychohistory, which allows psychohistorians to predict future events in big pictures. According to psychohistory, the Empire will encounter decay in the future and an age of collapse will follow. This book portrays how our civilization tries to shorten the age of collapse by preserving all human knowledge.The book is divided into five section, each with different settings. First section explains the psychohistory and sets up the stage. Second section takes place 50 years after the first, and the new Empire starts encountering conflicts with resources. Third section starts 30 years later, and it deals with religion. Fourth section takes place 55 years later and the new civilization gets involved in a trade conflict. Last section takes place 20 years later and involves merchandise matters. Each section has different characters. Each experiences different conflicts, but they all pile up to show us how a civilization grows and how history is made.I liked how the writing is terse and straightforward. It is hard to follow the story because of the change of settings and many characters, but they do come together. I liked how I could observe the history being made. It is fun seeing a civilization encounter conflicts, digress from religion to economics, and so on. It feels like I'm experiencing a century of history. It's easy to read because there isn't really any complicating science that you need to understand or in-depth character conflicts into the story. Definitely a book to read if you want to know how it feels like to be a god looking down at human civilizations and how they behave. Read it if you want to know what Hari Seldon's true plan is!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I can't say enough about this book, weather you like SF or not this book is a MUST READ!!! It's more about people/civilizations/political systems than SF but either way I highly recommend it.As for SF it is simply the best SF book ever written!!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"By the end of the thirteenth millennium, mankind had populated millions of planets scattered throughout the galaxy. The centre of the imperial government was located on the planet Trantor, in effect a single planetary city some 75,000,000 square miles in extent. Every conceivable square foot of habitable space was occupied with a teeming population well in excess of 40 billion souls. Its internal problems were so vast that it was all but inevitable that its grip on the outer reaches of its dominion should weaken. The empire, like every other empire that had preceded it, was in the throes of decline.Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician and psychologist developed the science of psychohistory - the use of mathematics and symbolic logic to evaluate and predict the future behaviour of statistically large segments of human population. When he applied his analysis to the Empire, the conclusions were bleak and inescapable. The stagnating Empire would imminently fall and collapse into a galactic dark age - a period of anarchy and chaos and a loss of art, culture, knowledge, technology and science that would last for thirty thousand years.When he knew that imperial collapse was inevitable, he created the \\"Foundation\\" and implemented what was later to become known as the Seldon Plan. He couldn't stop the dark age but he could shorten its duration to a mere thousand years and give civilization the ability to start over again.Asimov, known to his millions of fans merely as the \\"good doctor\\", certainly didn't stint when it came to the scope of his ideas and the size of the canvas on which he chose to paint. \\"Foundation\\" is a classic sci-fi novel that leans far towards the left side of the sci-fi spectrum. Hard sci-fi, technology and advanced science are touched upon only to the extent that they are necessary to make sense of an Empire that spans an entire galaxy. Quaintly, much of the science is seriously dated - data storage is on microfilm, atomic power is the norm even in spaceships that are expected to travel galactic distances - and could hardly be considered brilliantly prescient.So it is clearly the ideas that Asimov deals with that have elevated \\"Foundation\\" to its status as one of the most loved and most read science fiction novels of all time - science as religion, the authoritarian nature of religious dogma, the insidious Machiavellian nature of political diplomacy, the inevitability of the decline and collapse of a major empire and a powerful discussion as to whether violence is a necessary tool to resolve differences or whether it is merely \\"the last refuge of the incompetent\\".While I will happily acknowledge that \\"Foundation\\" was interesting and thoroughly enjoyable, I was somewhat disappointed to discover that it did not have the same thrill or excitement that I experienced when I first read it thirty years ago. The level of science in the book seems almost lack-lustre and in my mind did not live up to the grandiose scope of the novel. Like so many of his peers in the 1950s, women were stoutly ignored and played no part in \\"Foundation\\" at all.Dickens wrote at the turn of the century so one expects his prose to be different. Asimov wrote \\"Foundation\\" in 1951 so one certainly expects it to be a product of that time. But, unlike Dickens (and I'm not really quite able to put my finger on the reason why), the prose simply didn't age quite as well. So, in the full knowledge that many will disagree with me, I'm unwilling to accord \\"Foundation\\" the 5-star rating that many will expect. Four stars only from this reader and a high recommendation that this book must be read if you claim to be a fan of the classic sci-fi genre.Paul Weiss"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I won't bother you with much detail about the book, just know that this is one of the best (if not THE BEST) Science Fiction books I have ever read. I highly recommend this book to everyone. If you plan to read only one Sci-Fi book in your entire life, please make it this one! Asimov pretty much established the grounds for all space odysseys' that followed (think Star Wars, Star Trek, Hitchhiker's Guide, etc.). You wont be let down.The book is actually a collection of 5 short stories published together in one volume. It all begins at about 30,000 years after our time, and about 12,000 years after the Galactic Empire was established. Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, has developed a theory (psychohistory) that can accurately foretell the behavior of immense human populations to the tee. Using it he placed the Empire's demise at 300 years, with an added bonus of 30,000 years of struggle in a chaotic and barbaric galaxy, until the Second Empire is established.What are you waiting for,get yourself a copy!!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a masterpiece, bar none. It is not only great science fiction, but great fiction. Asimov does a truly wondrous job of painting a large picture, much in the way that the Hudson School of painting did in the 19th Century, while also giving compelling characterization, like a Rembrandt, and selecting the \`right' moments that the reader can zoom in on, in this compelling account of future history. Asimov leaves Clarke in the dust in terms of characterization, and most of this is achieved via dialogue, while still painting a big picture. Asimov wrote wonderful dialogue, and one can read the tenor of a character's soul simply by how they react in words to other characters. That said, I am very surprised that Asimov did not take issue with George Lucas's Star Wars films, because without Foundation there would simply not be Star Wars. Everything is there to be plumbed and looted- a galactic Empire, rebels, space jumps to circumvent the speed of light, the Galactic Spirit (aka The Force), and so on. Even Star Trek took a heavy load of its mythos from this book, as the human dominated Federation and human-looking and human-derived aliens that dominate most of the Star Trek universe have much akin with the Empire that rules Foundation at novel's start....Foundation was first published in novel form in 1951, but consisted of a number of short stories published throughout the 1940s in magazines like John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction. Book One, The Psychohistorians, was written specifically as an opening for the novel; Book Two, The Encyclopedists was published as Foundation; Book Three, The Mayors, was published as Bridle And Saddle; Book Four, The Traders was published as The Wedge; and Book Five, The Merchant Princes, was published as The Big And The Little. Each of the Books within the novel functions almost as an autonomus story, much the way Bradbury's Martian Chronicles, or Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio do. Yet, it all ties together, and though it has always had a reputation as a space opera, even if the ultimate or original space opera, it transcends that label. Yet, those sorts of labels can be offputting to casual readers of a genre, like I am. For I am not a sci fi nut by any means, yet I sense that many people have avoided this book because like, say, reading a Rilke poem or watching Orson Welles' Citizen Kane, they have felt that something so overpraised and hyped is bound to be a letdown. It's not. It earns its praise and labels, like epic, for, even though the book is less than 150 pages long in my version, probably 250-300 pages in paperback, it is certainly epic- the timescales and range of the Empire demand nothing less. And although that term is grossly overused, in this case it is spot on. The very title of the book has, in the decades since its first appearance, taken on another connotation, though- that of not only referring to the Foundation within the tale, but its place as the Foundation upon which modern outer space sci fi is based upon.This is not to deny the books flaws, which are there. But, given that most of them have to do with technological things, they are not truly literary flaws, merely those of the nature of the sci fi genre. Among them are anachronisms such as typical hausfrau-like portrayals of women, who apparently still worry over household domestic products, an addiction to nicotine, an over-reliance on atomic power, the use of parsecs rather than light years as a unit of distance, the galactic Empire being at the center of the galaxy where we now know only a supermassive black hole exists and makes life as we know it untenable due to radiation, and other minor points. Other flaws are less anachronistic than what in film would be called continuity errors, such as being able to transcend the speed of light, but recording information in actual books, and on microfilm, rather than digitally, or quantumly, yet being able to teleport that information; the Empire possessing holographic technology, yet it all being powered by vacuum tubes; or civilizations possessing interstellar ships but having economies dependent on fossil fuels- which means that dinosaurs and the like must have appeared on millions of the other worlds. Then there are just the plain odd things, such as Asimov's faith in capitalism being the solution to the galactic ills, even though in his universe it's what ails all the worlds. The idea that even were an Empire to arise and dominate a galaxy that such a massive thing could ever stagnate, seems odd. Diversity argues against that, but this shows Asimov's pessimism regarding the human ability to evolve. That these future men also have life spans akin to ours, smoke, and suffer cancer, bespeaking there seems to have been little in the way of medical breakthroughs (this was pre DNA discovery), also seems a bit of an imaginative lack.But, perhaps the greatest flaw of the book is Asimov's love affair with the Freudian Psychohistory (although I'm told in later books Asimov redacted the mythos to reveal it all a fraud), which reeks of determinism, exalts psychology to a \`hard' science, damns free will, plays to the Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends, and has been totally demolished in the wake of chaos theory. Still, even though Psychohistory fails as science, it's still far easier for a writer to predict human nature than scientific advances.But, again, these are mere quibbles, relatively speaking. Let me look at the pro side of the ledger. The very Psychohistory that, in reality, is specious, allows for the very drama of the tale to exist. While poor science it makes for excellent drama. To watch the various Foundation leaders grapple with their own will versus their faith in Seldon is the essence of existentialism. Asimov's use off offstage action is not just a condensing device, but clues the reader in to what is really important- the human moments and confrontations, not the comic book like blowing up of great interstellar vessels. A third device that works well is the use of select epigraphs throughout the story, culled from the fictive Encyclopedia Galactica. They unify the tale, lend it grandeur, and ground this future history as if it were already in the reader's past, much as Edward Gibbons' real and influential The Decline And Fall Of The Roman Empire did, and which Asimov acknowledged as his main source of ideas. Wisely, there is not too much technobabble, which helps date a work more than anything else. Also, as stated before, the book is rife with humor and sparkling dialogue, as well as plausible catchphrases like \`Galaxy knows' or \`By galaxy!' It is also worth re-stressing that the book's focus is not on scientific progress but social progress, and this predicates a number of major existential queries, such as what is progress? How does progress reconcile with human nature? Is progress ever expanding, cyclical, or helical? What is knowledge? How do the two square? Should knowledge be commoditized? Should knowledge be mysticized? What is free will and ethical agency? But most of all, how can all these subjects and ideas be best related?Yet, most of all, despite the ideas and the narrative, is the wonderful fact that Asimov is just flat-out a damned good writer. His prose is sometimes muscular, sometimes poetic, but always lucid and clear. His plots are not overly Byzantine, yet quite complex, his sentence and paragraph structure not ornate, but subtly seductive. How Hollywood has never optioned this book for a film is beyond me. Wait, no it's not. Why would they want to do compelling, human-based science fiction when they can pump out the pseudo-intellectualism of a Philip K. Dick, or the vapid &uuml;r-mythography of Star Wars, and make a fortune? Perhaps Asimov might be re-thinking his faith in Adam Smith's invisible hand in the great beyond?"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The main plot of the story copies the evolution of every human society. The decline and fall of empires, followed by the rise of others, depends on the same phenomena as those described here. We are puzzled by Psychohistory, but the notion itself (forecasting the future as the weather) is sound. This novel opens a range of questions and issues beyond other books of the genre."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In my initial read of this book, I stuck with it because it is a classic and everyone loves it. However, after about half of the book I got bored, nothing seemed to be building or catching, so I stopped. I have restarted and am more interested now because I know some more of the background story. So far, the second trip through this book is much more enjoyable than my first slow trip."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov didn't write about aliens or alien life it seemed. Or not very much. But he did develop a Galaxy populated by humans in this start to the series. A fallen Galactic Empire, and a society of scientist using a new psychological technique to start a new one on the proper footing. But there is a wild card involved in the Mule, a mutant with powers to control minds and change the course of the history plotted by the scientists. Introduced the concept of the planetary city that is the center of the empire. Another essential read for those who love science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is Sci~Fi at it's best, from that great era. It was fun to read again after all these years. The lifestyle of the times when this book was written, really shine through, everyone smokes and everything is nuclear.

Asimov really shines here, as each of the Seldon crises arise and is dealt with - no wonder he is such a big name in science fiction!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the only review (of literature) I have ever written. If you like well written characters, mystery, adventure, intrigue, and a surprise twist to your stories.. oh yes.. and SciFi (but that is beside the point).. the Foundation Trilogy is for you! I haven't even read this story in 37 years, and it STILL stands out in my mind as one of the best I have ever read. Second only to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" by JRR Tolkien. It matters not that \\"Foundation\\" is SciFi.. it is just a darn good read! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It's kind of funny when i think that less than 3 months ago, i had never heard os Isaac Asimov, and i had not much interest in reading science fiction. Then i get some book called \\"Foundation\\" for christmas, and it kind of interested me although i didn't read for over a month after i had it.Well since then, not only have i read it, and not only have i done alot of research on Asimov and science fiction in general, but i've also bought and read \\"Foundation and Empire\\". Quite a difference one book can make.I can not get enough of Asimov's Foundation series. I own over 100 books that i've found at thrift stores and second hand stores by many different authors. However the second day that i owned \\"Foundation and Empire\\" i dove right into it, and it did not dissapoint. The only negative thing i can say is that it's just barely not as good as the first book (although that book really blew my mind and was my very first sf novel).Regardless, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is another solid tale by Asimov, filled again with great characters (even a clown!), and written with top notch imagination and imagery. Particularly amazing is how Asimov created the character of Hari Seldon. He appears in this book for about two pages, and yet the man's presence is a highlight. I did question if Asimov wasn't skilled at creating solid character's with real depth. However, when a man who was only in 40 or 50 pages of the first book makes an appearance in this one, it was easily my most anxious moment of the story, and i truly felt just as eager as everyone else sitting before the vault for Seldon to appear. Consider my question withdrawn haha.I am really loving the Foundation series, just the whole creation of, the many planets, the talk of ships, the different classes of people, everything! Not only am i very antsy about continuing this series (which i will definitely be doing soon), i am dying to read his robot novels and his stand-alones as well. Great book!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Good: I really liked this book. The plot was solid and the characters good. I can highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is a great scifi read but it is essentially a series of short stories. So you shouldn't expect a typical \\"novel\\" story. They are set around the same theme of the Foundation, a group set up by a man, Hari Seldon, who is brilliant at something called psychohistory. He predicts that the galactic Empire will fall and sets up the Foundation as way to prevent the knowledge of man from being lost. The first section details this storyline. later storylines are about the trials of the people of the Foundation. Hope you enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"continuing the lifetime Hugo award winning series written by Isaac Asimov...lest my snarkiness towards this venerable and respected author and his writing give anyone the wrong impression..

As some of the other reviewers have pointed out, the writing style is of a very poor quality indeed. It is not only very dull and dry, but it is also totally lacking in any kind of style or art. The dialogue is simply dreadful, the character development is nonexistent, and the story is pointless and not at all well structured. The fact that this alleged \\"novel\\" is really a collection of short stories is readily apparent, as there is no cohesion and very poor correlation between sections. This is not memorable writing in any way and it has no redeeming qualities as a work of literature.

After having noticed all the editorials, reviews, and awards attributed to the Foundation series, I didn't hesitate to order all the books in the series. What a mistake! I'm not sure what people are seeing in these novels, but in no way do they even come close to approaching some of the other hallmarks of sci-fi, like Dune, Ender's Game, you name it. This book has a semi-interesting setup about trying to preserve civilization during a coming galactic dark age, but beyond that the book devolves into stupid scenario after scenario about how the Foundation is threatened but through the citizens' skill (i.e. sheer stupidity and dumb luck) they manage to somehow make it through the crisis only to face another yawner a few pages later. In between each crisis numerous years elapse, so by the time Asimov sets up the next unrelated crises, the entire cast of characters changes -- you barely have time to figure out their names much less get to know any person in significant detail.This series of books did nothing but put me to sleep on multiple occassions when normally if a book is good I'll stay up all night to finish it. My advice is to steer well clear from this series and try one of the other highly rated sci-fi books out there -- there are so many others that would be far preferable."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I can understand why this book is considered one of the best science fiction books ever written, especially considering the time period it was written in. It has a very interesting concept of destination and cause and effect (although it is weak in execution and very weak in explanation). For these reasons and other I should only give this book a one star, but instead I gave it two and I will explain why later.There is almost zero character development in this book. The extremely short chapters jump thirty years to eighty years and more between chapters. Almost every &quot;book&quot; within this book has a new set of characters with only a few references of the &quot;heroes&quot; from the previous &quot;books.&quot; At times, this makes for very confusing reading because I had no idea who the new people were in the successive chapters.As mentioned in the title, this book suffers greatly from the Superman sydrome. By this I mean that you know the outcome before the events have unfolded. Superman can't be beat (except for by Doomsday in the comics but he comes back anyway) and therefor when watching the movies you know he wins. So there just has to be more elaborate plans and more complex ways of defeating him but he still will win. The same is true with the foundation. Harry Seldon, the prophet who esentially created the foundation, knew what was going to happen because he could see the future. Every &quot;book&quot; in &quot;Foundation&quot; will ultimately see the Foundation as the victor, so there just must be more complex problems arising, but of course the Foundation will ultimately prevail. And in this book, the problems are not really that complex, just different social economies arising to counter the previously established social economy that prevailed in the previous &quot;book.&quot; I can only imagine that in the later books the problems will get ridiculously complex - maybe even too complex for enjoyment.Because this book has almost zero characterization and is very predictable I would give this book one star, but instead I gave it two. The reason for this is because I have read the backs of the other books in the Foundation series and other reviews of them and I am interested in the storyline. I want to read about the Mule in Foundation and Empire, and I want to read about Earth in Foundations Edge. If not for that this book would recieve a one star rating from me and I would also never recommend this book or ever pick it up again.It may be a classic, but it's not that great. It's not great at all."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Three stars is a bit generous, but this certainly isn't a bad book. In fact, it is easy to read, always interesting, and often exciting. But that's all it is. It is not deep or meaingful. It is not profoud. It is not thought provoking. It isn't even particularly well written. But it's so easy to take and has enough good qualities that it can't be disliked.The plot center's around the creation of a Foundation, a place where mankind's accumulated knowledge can be protected from the approaching collapse of civilization. This is an interesting enough premise and very original in its day, but the blending of mathematics and psychology into a science that can accurately predict much of the future is hard to take seriously.If you come across a copy of this book, read it. It won't take long and you'll probably enjoy much of it even if your not a SF fan, but I don't recommend anyone by this book. There is to much out there that is much much better."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The book, Foundation, by Isaac Asimov, has promise but leaves the reader without satisfaction upon completion. Though having what initially appears to be a gripping plot, the grip loosens throughout the book. While philosophers may enjoy the lack of action and adventure, other readers who crave that amazingly described action sequence, will find that this is not the book to get. Taking place beyond the year 12,000 A.D, the Galactic Empire, spanning galaxies, is predicted by the revered physcohistorian, Hari Seldon, to crumble. On a mission to shorten a period of 30,000 years of barbarism after the fall of the Galactic Empire, to a mere millennium, he establishes an association, the Foundation, to preserve the Universe's knowledge in a giant Encyclopedia. Foundation takes place on many different planets in many galaxies across the universe. This book spans many generations and involves many characters, as the book covers in different plot lines that converge at the end.Foundation is a book that focuses on political issues, thus making the book void of action and adventure. This can make the book extremely boring and aggravating to some readers. The story focuses on conflicts among activist parties and groups conspiring against the political leaders of the Foundation's home world, Terminus, as well as diplomatic and religious conflicts between the Foundation's home planet, Terminus, and neighboring kingdoms such as Anacreon and Smyrno, along with greedy kingdoms bent on conquest of their neighbors. But out of the 285 pages of the book, there is only one significant action sequence, which is between the kingdom of Anacreon and the Foundation. The sequence involves a mass riot and uprising of priests on Anacreon's home world, along with the total emancipation of the Anacreonian naval fleet by a priest who threatens to curse the fleet. When characters, like the mayor of Terminus and his advisors, discuss war or the inevitability of a war, there never is an explanation of what occurs during the fighting, just a summary of the war, and who is the victor. An example is at the end of the book, when there is a war between the Foundation and the world of Korell, because of disagreements over religious beliefs and the tolerance of missionaries. The war is only summed up in an excerpt from the &quot;Encyclopedia Galactica&quot;. Another noticeable point about Foundation is how confusing it is in many aspects. The book is broken up into &quot;Parts&quot; that separate time, setting, and characters. A part entitled &quot;The Mayors,&quot; which takes place mainly on Terminus and involves the mayor, Salvor Hardin, and the relations between his world and the kingdom of Anacreon, is then followed by one entitled &quot;The Traders,&quot; which takes place many decades later and involves totally different characters in a different part of the galaxy. When and where each part takes place is not answered until later into the chapters of the part. Also confusing is the fact that new characters are introduced quickly in every part, thus making it harder for the reader to grasp. If the reader gets attached to a character or really likes where the plot and characters are going in a certain part, he or she will be unpleasantly surprised when those characters are never talked about again in the novel, after that part.One good thing about Foundation is that it expresses new and intriguing ideas about predicting the future through the science of psychohistory and what the human race and universe will be like in ten more millennia. This includes the idea of having a Galactic Empire that controls millions of planets. Along with ideas of nuclear power still being the most advanced power system, man-sized force fields able to block any nuclear handgun's blast and giant space ships with the capability to destroy planets are discussed. Also the ideas of monarchy being the prime governmental system is included in the novel. These may seem like interesting ideas that would make Foundation a great book, but the reader may find that these ideas also make the story harder to understand because they are either seemingly too primitive for the time period, or too far-fetched to be logical. This book could be someone's favorite book, if they happen to like philosophical books without action. It could also be the bore of a lifetime for some people."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read this* because it presents a galaxy without aliens, colonized by people. It was soft SF in so many ways (incl. FTL, antigravity, flying cars, walnut-sized nuclear reactors, laser pistols, personal and city force shields, egregious use of energy in the form of anti-gravity elevators) and the psychohistorian-predicts-future-events-to-the-day plot was dumb--not to mention the idea of civilizations with FTL ships incapable of harnessing nuclear power. With repeated suspensions of disbelief, it was pleasant enough. The characters were not such nitwits as those of \\"Prelude to Fdn.\\" No need to read his other books.* after reading If the Universe is Teeming with Aliens...Where is Everybody?: Fifty Solutions to the Fermi Paradox and the Problem of Extraterrestrial Life (2002) by Stephen Webb"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I realize I'm in the minority compared to the other reviews but I don't feel this book is even close to being half as good as the first foundation book. The two stories lacked charters that I cared about and unlike the first foundation book their was very little to contemplate. Also I guessed the big twist in the second story by the third page."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is a great read. A lot of great characters, and interesting events take place. This book definitely advances the whole \\"Foundation\\" idea, but it does stand on its own."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"My sister likes to randomly give me things, based on conversations we had weeks prior that I barely remember. I must've been talking up Asimov (the man published enough articles/books for 10 lifetimes) because one day she gave me Foundation and asked me to read it. Not having read it herself, she said the only thing she knew about it is that it's the book that established him. In reality, the books, initially a chapter-by-chapter series in a two-bit magazine, never made him that much money until much later in his life. So it goes.You should, therefore, pick up this book knowing only that one piece of information; this book was his \\"big break.\\" It starts engagingly enough: One arithmetician, Hari Seldon, has found a way to predict the fall of civilization, and develops a plan to stem the suffering of mankind. Very little of the story is actually about the man himself. By nature of the predicting-science, the science of history, the narrative spans a multitude of exotic settings, and even more lifetimes.An interesting thing happened to me as I was reading the book, however, despite having been warned by Asimov himself in the foreword. I realized that nothing happens in this book. That is to say, no actual action takes place. The entire book is dialogue driven.Unfortunately things sometimes take a hit or I have to stop pretending for a second, because during some of the dialogue exchanges people say or do things outside the boundaries of their character(lines like \\"and I'm glad you refuse to countenance it.\\" from a Han Solo-style trader? Just say 'face it' instead!) It's clear that at the age Asimov was when he wrote it at least, that he had a Davincian understanding of women at best. Characters throughout sometimes act in grandiose, dramatic ways that defy common sense or motive. It's like watching a good play with bad acting, and as well, you can practically FEEL the curtain coming down in between chapters since so much of this book happens \\"behind the scenes.\\" Speaking of scenes, they get somewhat sparse of props. Asimov will rarely, if ever, describe inanimate objects. Unless they do something science-fictiony (lets just say he GROSSLY over-estimated nuclear physics and under-estimated electronics.)Anydangway, there's also a problem of overconfident protagonists. At first you're not used to it, so the feeling of imminent peril is genuine, but after reading one cocky protagonist after another, you begin to stop worrying about them because they always come out on top in a vaguely predictable fashion. I suppose part of that is in the design of the book's thesis, but it would be nice to show some more range in his characters.I'm already almost finished with the second one. So far, this first one was better. I know after reading this review it sounds like I was hard on the guy, but really it's not bad. I'm only a little surprised a movie hasn't been optioned, because it kindof feels like Dune. Feel free to correct me if there actually is a movie out there."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This may be a classic and I may be a science fiction fan, but read Asimov's &quot;The Gods Themselves&quot; instead of this. His later work is definitely better. &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; is like its predecessor (&quot;Foundation&quot;) in that you get several stories told in different periods throughout Foundation history. Everything Asimov has come up with in these books is fundamentally good sci-fi story stuff, but the lack of character development makes you think while you're reading, &quot;Why am I reading this?&quot; I'll read the last in the trilogy (&quot;Second Foundation&quot;), but that's as far as I'm going to go with these.For great sci-fi, read &quot;Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Fall of Hyperion,&quot; &quot;Ender's Game,&quot; &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey,&quot; &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep.&quot;For good sci-fi, read &quot;More Than Human,&quot; &quot;The Gods Themselves,&quot; &quot;Slan,&quot; &quot;The Demolished Man,&quot; &quot;The Stars My Destination.&quot;TOO MUCH TO LIST, MY FRIENDS!!!Good luck and good reading."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In a twisted (mis)reading of the Foundation series, the Japanese terrorist cult Aum Shinrikyo used Asimov's epic as a prophecy of upcoming apocalypse and converted dimsighted guru-dictator Shoko Ashara into an incarnation of Hari Seldon. Worthwhile to sharpen your wits as you read the story to see how the zealots got it wrong -- but also how they could easily pervert Asimov's points.

I thought the story was thin. Surprisingly, the best of the Foundation novels is not the first but the fourth - Foundation's Edge.

If you're looking for truly exciting sci-fi about the human condition and empire-building I would suggest trying Herbert's Dune."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"i've read it 4 or 5 times already and i STIL can't stop after i start! it has a plot! something most Sci-Fi seems to be severly lacking..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation Trilogy, one of the touchstones of Science Fiction, began as a magazine serial in John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction in November 1949. Respective stories were gathered together into the three volumes: Foundation (1951), Foundation and Empire (1952) and Second Foundation (1953). Finally, the whole shebang was published as The Foundation Trilogy in 1961 and in 1966, won a Hugo Award as the best science fiction series of all time. I don't know that this last is still true, but it is certainly one of the seminal works in the history of Science Fiction and remains extraordinarily influential.Oliver Morton, in The New Yorker of May 17, 1999, had an excellent essay about the books wherein he pointed out that Asimov is really responsible for the concept, so prevalent in science fiction, of the Galactic Empire. He particularly demonstrates the debt that the Star Wars series owes to Asimov's vision, a vision which apparently in turn owes a debt to Edward Gibbon, whose Decline and Fall of The Roman Empire Asimov had read twice as a young man.He also draws one important distinction; where the main foundation of the Star Wars series is speed (iconified by the image of the accelerating starship), the Foundation series is built upon size. It is the epic scope, spanning thousands of years and worlds and incorporating billions of people, that really made Foundation so groundbreaking. It enabled Asimov to apply historical themes to a genre that, virtually by definition, lacked history.All of this is certainly true, but it strikes me that the epic scope as utilized by Asimov presents a political/philosophical problem. Asimov posited a future science of psychohistory, a discipline which would bring scientific cause and effect certainty to the field of human affairs. The Trilogy traces the fall and reemergence of a Galactic Empire with the entire process having been predicted by and, to some extent guided by, Hari Seldon, the Founder of Psychohistory. This premise manages to combine two of the worst ideas that human's have ever had--first, that history is deterministic and follows some kind of iron clad pattern; second, that there is any merit to psychology, particularly as a predictive tool when applied to large populations over a lengthy period of time.The whole thing is sort of creepy in so far as it dismisses free will and the impact of ideas and individuals on man's development. The quest for discernible patterns and laws in human existence is nothing new, most religions are predicated on the revelation of such hidden patterns. And it is natural for scientists to be attracted to the idea that there are certain universal laws that will eventually explain our behavior, everything from why we love or why we kill to why I just typed the letter r. But I for one, do not believe that our lives are predetermined. In fact, I find such an idea pretty bleak and antihuman.I still recommend the series, particularly in light of the influence it has had on the genre and for the massive scope of Asimov's vision, but, for me at least, the Freudian &amp; Hegelian overtones are a little bit off-putting.GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation was by far one of the best science fiction novels I have read. I especially loved his take on religion, and actually making a parody of it! Through the Foundation's organized religion, Asimov showed how science can possibly and really be equated with a new religion, or a set of superstitions and preternatural phenomenon. Asimov also showed how religion can sway the minds of the masses, as the subjucation of the Four Kingdoms illustrated. Asimov wrote his wonderful opus as a parallel of the Roman Empire, and the historical allusions show. However, there was something in the book that was surprisingly missing. There were no female characters! Except for the Commdora of Korell, most of the figures holding real political, social, or economic power in this society of the future, thousands of years ahead, were male. I find this hard to believe. I reasoned, though, that because Foundation was written by Asimov in the 50s, during the &quot;Golden Age&quot; of SF, female characters were a scarcity in most science fiction anyway. There were no female writers of SF either. Other than this glaring omission, Asimov has done a brilliant job with Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When a book is slated as one of the greatest Sci-Fi novels of our time, it should be extremely hard to criticize. Unfortunately I found The Foundation to have more than a few flaws which actually made it a chore to read. Considering that it beat out \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" for the Hugo Award in 1965 for best All-Time Series, which is why I decided read it, makes it even more insufferable in my opinion. Simply look at how momentous LOTR's has become over The Foundation in our culture and you can begin to see how it is obviously lacking something. So why does it fall short ? Well, the primary reason is the story line jumps vast amounts of time chapter to chapter, which even though I found refreshing, it gives the reader a completely new set of characters in different settings which receive little to no development. So ultimately the visual depth, as well as character depth, which I find so alluring about Sci-Fi, is ultimately lacking leaving little for the imagination to grasp on to. What this does do though is leave room for what I believe Asimov wanted the reader to really experience, which is the psychohistorical themes built upon long term economic strategy, which was wonderfully orchestrated and second to none. The thing that gets me, is considering that is the focus of the story, it could have just as easily taken place in the 1800's and 1900's and be based on oil or guns instead of nuclear power. Don't get me wrong, the story is intriguing but if you are looking for a visually stimulating Sci-Fi book, I would look elsewhere...or you can just wait for the feature film in 2013."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I got pretty bogged down with the multiple characters and places and time periods. Not a good book to pick up occasionally, takes a focussed reading. And that's just one of the series!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Inscribed along the bottom of my well-worn copy of Foundation is the following accolade: \\"Awarded the Hugo as Best Series Ever!\\" In response all I can say is, \\"don't hold your breath.\\"Sure, I give the book three stars for its creativity and imaginative appeal. But, as a stand alone work, it doesn't measure up to other estimable sci-fi classics, most notably Robert Heinlein's thoroughly engrossingStarship Troopers. As the first work in a series, Orson Scott Card'sEnder's Game (Ender, Book 1)and Frank Herbert'sDune, 40th Anniversary Edition (Dune Chronicles, Book 1)far surpass it on similar terms.I lost interest in the remainder of the Ender and Dune series, which is unlikely to happen with the Foundation lot from what I know of the rest. It is in the remainder of the series where Asimov supposedly hits his stride. I don't doubt it, but his first book, much likeI, Robot, lacks an overarching narrative that one would expect in a Hugo series. Replacing the narrative is an overarching theme. But the theme's unabashed anti-religious and humanistic elements are somewhat off-putting.Most readers will likely look past this, but it diminishes the book's appeal in my mind. It also dampens my enthusiasm for diving into the remaining books. In the end, the Foundation series may have received the Hugo, but the first book leaves it with much ground to make up when compared to its two most notable Hugo runners-up, J.R.R. Tolkien'sThe Lord of the Ringsand Edgar Rice Burroughs'The John Carter of Mars Series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"No judgement againt asimov as a sci fi innovator, but i did not find the story telling to be very enthralling and felt almost no emotional connection to the series of characters introduced over large jumps in time.The method for introducing new twists or skipping decades by introducing fake abreviated &#34;encyclopedia galactica&#34; entries was awkward and rough."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"As the beginning to his Foundation series, which will eventually incorpate his entire Asimovian universe, this collection of intertwined short-stories is a must read for Asimov fans. But it is not close to his greatest works - he's only getting started here, but if you take the time to read his other stories and novels, you will appreciate these beginnings."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov considered his work that eventually became the Foundation and Empire book of The Foundation Trilogy to be his best, due to his introduction of the misunderstood, mutant conqueror: \\"The Mule.\\" Given Asimov's personal stamp of approval, for that reason alone, this book is well worth devouring. Published originally in the 1940s by the magazine \\"Astounding,\\" this trilogy eventually won the Hugo Award for Best All-time Series ever. It even beat out Lord of the Rings, although I think evaluating two such different series in dissimilar genres is like comparing apples to oranges.Asimov's imagining of a future, immense and extremely technologically advanced galactic empire (based on the Roman empire) that is on the verge of falling back into barbarism is indeed astounding. Among other fantastic characters in this series is Hari Seldon, the Empire's greatest intellectual, who sets about to reduce the period of barbarism from 10,000 years to 1,000. But unfortunately, Seldon's mathematics-based science called \\"psychohistory,\\" whereby he can predict group human actions in the future, was unable to account for a mutant with vast mind control powers; the previously mentioned character who mysteriously calls himself The Mule.Foundation and Empire tracks The Mule as he conquers planet after planet and the efforts to stop him and make sure that Hari Seldon's Plan for the future is maintained. One aspect that sets this book apart from a lot of science fiction is a strong and compelling female character, Bayta, who plays a critical role in combating The Mule. This is especially surprising considering that this work was written in the 1940s. I will leave it at that so as not to reveal not one, but two fantastic plot twists at the end of the book. Foundation and Empire is perhaps the best of a truly classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Once again, Asimov serves up a thrilling read for the sci-fi fan. The two story-lines followed in the text pertain particularly to the question of if/how spectacular individuals can alter the Plan of Hari Seldon. The first pertains to a final thrust of the Empire while the second pertains to the question of an anomalous power known as the Mule.The final expeditions of the Empire attempt to take over the foundation by means of the talented general Bel Riose. Bel Riose launches a campaign against the Foundation and pushes toward victory with nearly unprecedented ease, backed by the Imperium. This first half of the book considers the power of the individual and the mass with respect to the great movements within the Foundation according to the Plan. Although I will not reveal much more than this, I will at least say that the outcome of part one is intriguing in comparison to part two, dealing with the Mule.The second half of the story deals with the relationship of Seldon's plan to the possibility of a mutation which begets a figure who is an extremely powerful galactic conqueror, destroying the overall political milieu foresaw by Seldon. To speak much more of this would spoil the read for you. However, I must say that it is a thrilling text which kept me on the edge of my seat all the way through the end. The ending itself was such a surprise that it indeed reminded me that I was reading Asimov, for it is just the type of intellectual curve-ball that he would throw just as the novel ends.Once again, we have a stupendous text on our hands in these two. It raises major questions about the plausibility of psycho-history, some of which are raised again in the third text in the series. I suggest this text most thoroughly to all sci-fi fans. I only suggest that you at least read Foundation before reading this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Any coment's on this serie of books must be a positive one and if it's not then thats becouse you dident understand the story, so you should reread them all again, i stronly recommend this serie of books to anyone, not just sci fans, but to all that have the taste to read.

By use of the science of Psycho-History of which he represents the apex, Seldon atempts to establish the foundation, and reach beyond the grave to shape the forces of the future, but to what end? Sort of a stripped down Dune, it reads like a Steinbek re-write of The Scarlet Letter. With religious, psychological and political intrigue, Foundation and its subsequent works are the perfect stepping stone to Herbert's monumental series.

Enjoy it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"\\"Foundation\\" is a must. Even if your taste is for other styles, Asimov's \\"future history\\" has rightly become part of the science fiction canon of great books.The first episode in \\"Foundation\\" appeared about 50 years ago as a stand-alone story in Astounding Science Fiction under the title \\"Bridle and Saddle.\\" At the time, Asimov had no idea where it would eventually lead. Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and the Galactic Empire emerged in that single story to shape all the \\"Foundation\\" novels that were to follow. It's all the more remarkable, then, to read that story today with the realization that none of the sequels or \\"prequels\\" had yet been thought of.The original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy is written in a style that may seem quaint or even prim in comparison to the baroque convolutions found in some novels of the '90s. And, at the time, one reviewer had trouble with the episodicity: \\"The bare bones show.\\" On the other hand, many readers find those early Asimov stories to be quite refreshing.If I had to choose, I would rate \\"Foundation\\" as the best of the entire series. Outside the \\"Foundation\\" series, I think \\"Caves of Steel\\" is his very best, closely followed by \\"Pebble in the Sky,\\" although, as Asimov himself said, the latter was written at a time when almost nothing was known about the hazards of nuclear radiation.Some critics have questioned the logic in Hari Seldon's \\"psychohistory.\\" Deterministic as it is, how can Asimov's clever heroes count for much in the grand scheme of things? Perhaps, in some as yet unwritten novel, \\"psychohistory\\" will be revealed to be a kind of secular religion where the mathematical trappings are a faade behind which a happy few labor heroically to save the galaxy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the epitome of the ideal of the pessimistic technocratic utopian. Strange as it may sound, the plot is as follows: pseudo-science finds a way to predict future, politicians banish scientists, scientists establish new citizenry, trade flourishes, scientists gain control through pseudo-religion. This supposedly tried-and-true pseudo-science is a way to predict the future by way of studying human behavior (an oddly fatalistic view of a scientific universe). However, I disagree with the notion and invest my interest in the rival fund of the \`Crazy Eddie' effect of Niven's Motie series where an individual can make the most drastic difference.I must further state that I was born in 1980 and began reading SF in 2007 with the likes of Niven, Bear and Brunner. I like my complex Iain Banks, voluminous Alastair Reynolds, mind-bending Greg Egan and ever-changing Brunner. Now while many of the so-called \`old timers' have proclaimed Foundation sacred like the novels of Dune, I am of the new generation and of the new voice, which can't be held to the same standard as the last generation (or two). Times changes, ideals change, perspectives change, terminology changes, tolerable prefixes change and personal development changes. While Dune may have been impressive in style and scope, it did not satisfy me in content, interest and follow through. To these effects, I wish to express my dissatisfaction with Foundation.To paraphrase an excellent book about the relationship between psychology and musical composition entitled \`Of Mind and Music,' the author states that repetition is an exploit of human emotion causing the listener (or in this case, the reader) to fall into a collective primal rhythm with fellow listeners (read: readers). Like in Foundation, the amount of repetition is akin to the acute attack of bass at a rave; theories are repeated endlessly, idiosyncratic allegories are scattered through every chapter and the word \`atomic' was shotgun blasted, litter strewn, scattered to the winds, chucked without consciousness onto nearly ever page (sign of the times, I presume?). Here is the alphabetical list of \`atomic' phrases found in Foundation:Atomic blaster, atomic drill, atomic drive (also the hyperatomic drive), atomic fire, atomic force, atomic force-shield, atomic gadgets, atomic generator, atomic knife, atomic power, atomic shear, atomic ships, atomic specialists, atomic techniques, atomic washing machine (bwah!) and atomic weapons.If \`style' could mean the expressed use of repetition, the Asimov has easily seduced the science fiction reader of the early 1950s. With the blossoming (pessimists read: destructive radiation) of the atomic age, the dream of an atomic future must surely have seemed to be an optimistic fantasy. Nowadays, the equivalent would be novels which saturate their content with micro- and nano- prefixes. Thus, it seems as Asimov had the initial bug of beginning of the \`atomic' prefix fixation? Did Asimov overdo it? In these regards, I stand to say that Asimov had a single-tracked mind.While reading the sciences and unfolding plot of the pseudo-science, I was constantly remained of the \`Seldon crisis' and the mightier-than-thou proverb \`Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.' As an educated reader, I only need to be reminded once to have the full effect of conveyance and depth. Throw in the tame pre-sensor curses of \`Oh, space!' and the cringe-worthy \`Great galloping galaxies!' and you have for yourself a novel which is mildly aggravating, almost maddening. Repetition doesn't mean a solid follow through. Rather, it just means the author is either under-evaluating the reader of filling up word space.Additionally, the characters were as bland as cardboard for breakfast. Everyone seemed to be a utopian plutocrat or an idealistic capitalist in a struggling capitalist society. Scientists know best, so scientists so rule, right? It's ONE vision of style of government but the path Asimov takes is one of superiority and, ultimately, disagreement. The approach is too preachy to the benefits of an ideal technocratic civilization. Throughout, I understood the relationships and the dealings between opposing parties, but I found the unraveling as tedious as the usage of the word \`atomic.' Politico scenes compounded by feudal titles bored me to bits, much like Herbert's Dune, Tepper's Grass and some of Wolfe's Long Sun series. While the over-all feudal scene works well with the future technocratic/religious society, I find the kowtowing to be overwhelming (more so considering I already live in a fairly visible feudal society).Inevitably, as the word and review suggest, I must say that the novel has failed to impress me in the year 2010 after 30 years of mortality and four years of reading science fiction. Surely, many modern novels must have been based off the ideals presented in Foundation, but from my standpoint in the ear 2010, I fail to see greatness which was intrinsically embossed upon it during its publication and further years of intense readership. In the year 2010, the novel does not stand the ultimate test of time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia. Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have. More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to this kind of thing, or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust, power, fear, and so on are too powerful to overcome. Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie, author, Virus of the Mind: The New Science of the Meme"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"For those of you who would like to read the Foundation story in it's entirety, from beginning to end, chronologically, then I suggest following this course. There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R. Daneel Olivaw who designed and created the Trantorian empire in the first place, and so the robot novels--which introduce the cradle world of Earth before the dawn of the empire--come before the Foundation Trilogy:The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and EarthNow some of you might not recommend that one read the Second Trilogy before the first. True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way. Note also that I do not consider Asimov's early &quot;Empire&quot; novels to apply to the Foundation series. Interesting that they were included in Foundation's Triumph, but not relevant. It was cheesy in my opinion that the &quot;time machine&quot; was included in that story and then not even used for any practical purpose. Again, another plot-joiner there (Triumph was filled with them!). So, 14 books in all, in my estimation. The three galactic empire books are so cheesy, just don't read them...nothing to do with Foundation at all."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I was expecting so much more from this book as it was once awarded best sci-fi series ever. It was good, but not that great. Maybe in the 1950's it was the best of sci-fi, but compared to today's standards it was a little boring and out of date. It contains long dialogs and a lot of politics wrapped in a sci-fi environment. It doesn't contain fascinating worlds and interesting glimpses of the future. There's not a lot of action but I have to admit the dialog is pretty good. If you're into nostalgia, politics and interesting dialog this book is for you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In reviewing the book Foundation I am recommending that you read all of the Foundation books by Asimov. Just get started and read them all. Even though each book can be read individually, do yourself a favor and read them in order. I won't be reviewing any other books in the series. I want you to do the whole series.One of the most interesting ideas that Asimov gives us is the ultimate form of self defense. No, it isn't karate or jiu jitsu, boxing or wrestling. It's touching the other person's mind.There are enough circles within circles, things that aren't what they seem to be, surprises that put the theories into a cocked hat, to keep you on your toes.Don't deprive yourself of the best sci fi series ever written."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"From everything I've heard about this book, I was really excited to read it. After reading the first half in a few days then forcing myself to finish the second half after taking a two week break, I can honestly say that I found it to be a real let down.The main theme was about the only part I liked. Humanity has colonized the stars and controls everything blah blah blah but a really smart guy and his friends do some math equations and figure out that the currently all-powerful and all-encompassing Empire is doomed to collapse and thrust mankind thousands of years back to a &#34;barbaric&#34; state. His solution is to gather all the great minds of the day and create an educated stronghold on the edge of the galaxy to serve as a becon of hope and enlightnenment to supposedly shorten the time mankind has to spend in the dark ages.Their main goal is to create an encyclopedia that pretty much contains every biit of information ever learned. Ever. (wikipedia)Well it turns turns out that several years after the creation of Foundation, the shallow characters are riddeled with &#34;crises&#34;. Good thing the late creator appears via prerecorded videos at strategic times to offer advice to the indistinguishable residents and assures them that he did some math problems fifty years ago and discovered that everyting with work itself out. This is the basis for the rest of the book.The characters are dull, boring and super confident in everything they do because some dead guys math and future predictions will save them all.The second half of the book proved to be slightly more interesting, but not much"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The first thing to understand about Foundation is that it isn't really a novel. It is a collection of 5 connected short stories (The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders, & The Merchant Princes) written in the 1940s for publication in Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. The first story in the book was actually written a few years later for repackaging the stories as the first novel in what would eventually become the Foundation trilogy (later expanded with additional books).The galactic empire is rotting. After it collapses, there will follow 30,000 years of barbarism. Nothing can prevent the collapse, but Hari Seldon believes that the subsequent dark ages can be contained to 1,000 years if the proper steps are taken. To achieve this he sets up the Foundation at the very fringes of the empire. The first two stories are far and away the best in the book, and are worth the price of admission by themselves. This is because they deal directly with the central premise, which is a fantastic idea.Things go downhill with the next two stories. In particular, The Traders, seems completely unnecessary. Things pick up a bit with the final chapter.Taken as a whole, Foundation is less than the sum of its parts. I don't think it is the unrivaled masterpiece that many make it out to be. I would definitely go in with an open mind and lowered expectations.However, as I mentioned earlier, the idea is fantastic and promises much more and better to come. I will definitely be checking out the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I have no idea why I hadn't read this series until now.

The premise and scope of this novel are staggering and the plot develops at a blistering pace. You will not be able to put this book down once you start. The only minor critique I have of this book is that, as a series of novellas that continually advance into the future, characters you have grown to care about are quickly whisked away and replaced by new ones. Therefore, it is helpful to approach this book as a set of separate, though interconnected stories. When all is said and done, this book sets the stage for one of the greatest sci-fi series of all time. Complete with larger-than-life characters, unforgettable twists and suprises, this book is sure to satisfy any who have an interest in science fiction.

The 4 star rating is that the story does not seem to come to a complete end, I did expect more."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"While I believe that Asimov was a great science fiction author I was disappointed in this book and the whole series. To me science fiction is about new ideas of the future and an exciting story. While the idea of a falling society, where some foresee the downfall of its society and plan to minimise the impact, is interesting, it could have been staged as well in the past. One can tell that the book has been written some while ago and it is missing the action and technologies I want to read about in a science fiction book today. For me personally the book is also very slow paced and not engaging enough to make me want to continue reading it, but rather read some chapters at a time and then I can put it down for weeks, since I am not engaged enough to read further. Still I am kind of interested in how the series continues and finally ends, but not interested enough that I have to use every free minute reading it. I find it hard to judge this book and if you are into science fiction I believe you just have to give it a try. Yes, I rated it only three stars, but rating this book in a one dimensional fashion doesn't do its justice, since I believe it is still a very good book, but just not what I was expecting of a science fiction and wanted to read. I personally prefer a Peter Hamilton, Stephen Baxter or Andreas Eschbach for example."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is an interesting technological/political science fiction. A very famous book, obviously. The Galactic Empire has lasted 12,000 years, but it is predicted by Hari Seldon, a genius scientist/psychologist/mathematician that the Empire will fall within 300 years. So he takes a large group of people to the distant planet of Terminius, to create the Encyclopedia Galatica, a book of knowledge. It won't save the Empire, but at least will prevent the world from falling into chaos for too long. At least, that's what I got from the purpose. The various parts of the book skip from generation to generation of people on Terminus, and their various political problems.The political element of Foundation was very interesting to me. I hadn't read much political science fiction before. I don't think the world was that well developed; there wasn't a lot of description of it, it was more focused on the various power-plays and intrigues going on. Also, the way that each part is a different time period was a little off-putting; I really would have liked to know more about Gaal Dornick and some of the other characters. But you can't really narrate 300 years of history without skipping many years. At first, I thought Gaal Dornick was going to be the protagonist. I was wrong.Anyway, Foundation was an intriguing science fiction with an interesting plot, and I'm certainly glad that I decided to read it. The cover says \\"The Foundation Novels\\", so perhaps there are other books about this world too? If so, I look forward to (possibly) reading them.All of my reviews can be read at my blog (novareviews.blogspot.com)."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second book in Isaac Asimov's Foundation trilogy. Bloated with administration and complacent with power The Foundation is now failing. Asimov's science fiction elements include a mathematical \\"mob\\" theory that is able to predict the future of large populations. He calls it psychohistory. The math breaks down with individuals as they are too finicky and unpredictable. I loved the 'Mule' character.

The first book was required reading for a college SciFi literature course and I liked it so much I read the other two. They were my introduction to Isaac Asimov. Grand in its sweep, Foundation explores societal disintegration and renaissance. The trilogy is dated; Asimov wrote it before the computer revolution. However, it still holds up amazingly well.Asimov was regarded as one of the greatest explainers of everything. He richly deserved the accolade.

Like The Lord of the Rings, it should really be read in combination with its sequels, but the book contains its own strong moments, especially the first section on Trantor.

So your comment about the &quot;deplorable&quot; lack of women in the Foundation books is off the mark. And the characters are not poorly developed - what you learn about characters like the Mule is staggering - but you wouldn't know that because it is in the second book.

You will be well respected for it, even if most people disagree with you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The first book in Asimov's Foundation Series is actually an anthology of stories tracing the formation of the Foundation to its growth into a competitor of the Galactic Empire. The premise is simple, its execution complex: the Galactic Empire has started to decay even though the Empire itself denies the truth. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian whose mathematical theories of historical psychology have allowed him to determine when the Empire will crumble and the probabilities of the aftermath. To avoid a Dark Age, he sets up the Foundation at the outer edge of the galaxy to preserve the knowledge of humanity. The stories in Foundation deal with the formative years of the Foundation and its growth from an (outwardly) academic's and historian's interest into a power on (and behind) the galactic stage guiding humanity's redevelopment.Cleverly written and plotted with quick-moving events and the interesting theory that humanity's future for hundreds and thousands of years can be predicted based on probable outcomes. This is the foremost intellectual, yet generally accessible, science fiction series ever written. The lone drawback is that Asimov did not finish it before he died."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I am making my way through the original Foundation trilogy for the third time now, and I'm still gaining new appreciation for it. Fifty years after it first appeared, Asimov's Foundation series can still justifiably be called a classic. A clear influence on the Star Wars saga, and probably Star Trek as well, along with a large chunk of all science fiction that has come since. Sure there are a few things to quibble about with this series, and with this first book in particular. Asimov's vision of the distant future, with its nuclear reactors, microfilm communications, and picture phones, all seems ridiculously quaint today. As the story blasts through several decades, interchangeable characters come and go without making much of an impression, and this first book is so obviously part of a trilogy that it doesn't have a chance of standing on its own. But that's not the point, and by focusing on these quibbles you're missing the forest for the trees. Here Asimov has created a tremendous masterpiece of the imagination that is larger in scope than just about any other literary creation. The saga is built around the intriguing concept of psychohistory, in which the movements of huge masses of people can be accurately predicted over thousands of years (while it is still impossible to predict the actions of any one person). An ossifying empire, obviously based on the Roman Empire in its death throes, is on the verge of horrific collapse when the Foundation is created to subtly change the course of history behind the scenes, and gradually rises to prominence and tries to usher in a new golden age. The entire saga (not just this first book) takes place over a thousand years across a whole galaxy, while Asimov believably incorporates a full palate of psychology, politics, and sociology to lend the story credence. Still a masterpiece after all these years."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Disclaimer: I am judging this book as a standalone piece of work.Isaac Asimov's Foundation is the first of a series that would eventually be considered a cornerstone of the Sci-Fi genre. While it is certainly a solid piece of work, I don't quite understand how it is deserving of such praise. In my opinion, it suffers from an abundance of poor storytelling techniques, which reduce what is a great concept to a finished product that left me feeling empty. In fact, I struggled to finish the final pages, nearly racing through it solely for the sake of completion. I have rarely, rarely done this before. I'll start with the good aspects along with plot setup type-stuff first, and then finish with the overwhelmingly bad.The ideas and concepts behind Foundation are wonderful. The basis of the book is the work of Hari Seldon, the master practitioner of a discipline called psychohistory. If executed correctly, psychohistory has the ability to predict behavior of human beings thousands and thousands of years in advance through a combination of many disciplines, including mathematics, statistics, and psychology. It is, in essence, what modern day economics aspires to be. Being an economics major who currently works in the field, I found this to be highly compelling. In fact, it was from a blog post suggestion by Paul Krugman that I picked the book up in the first place.A bit more of the plot: Hari Seldon, the well-known psychohistorian, seeks to avoid an extended Dark Age, a period of 30,000 years in which barbarism runs rampant and tons of information is lost. His work in psychohistory leads to the establishment of the Foundation, which send ripples through the universe and ultimately attempts to shape its fate for the better. Hari Seldon is the first of a string of highly intelligent characters you'll meet, and Foundation is saturated with clever and thought-provoking dialogue amongst these characters. This, unfortunately, is where the good stuff ends.To say that this book is saturated with dialogue is a vast understatement. This book is 95% dialogue and it is the vehicle through which the story is told. This, I found to be abysmal. Even with an omniscient narration technique at hand, rare are the thoughts of characters, their descriptions, or an inkling of the settings on which these dialogues are taking place. One of the largest structural weakness of this storytelling style is that Asimov must infuse important details into his conversations. The problem with this is that these are details that would never come up in normal conversation. Thus, they come off as very awkward and ultimately serve to cheapen the dialogue. Not being able to get into the minds of characters leaves too much unsaid, which is the part of the cause of every section having the same structure: Person A is the plotter, Person B is the questioner. Person A knows something that Person B doesn't, Person B continually questions Person A about his plans, which all finally ends with a \\"Don't you see?\\" moment by Person A in which he explains his elaborately constructed conspiracy to Person B. This is the essence of every single section. By the time you get to the end, nothing is unexpected.And worse still, every single character is similar (except for one, who speaks with an accent and makes for a very comical section of the book). They are all intelligent, but not wholly different. Their lack of physical descriptions and thoughts serve to make them feel like the same lifeless replica of one another. The nature of the story, which causes there to be major gaps in time, make this even more egregious because just as you are getting used to one character, his section ends and a new character has replaced him. I felt zero emotion for these characters. As for the setting, this universe is not a living, breathing world. It is merely the outline of one, a skeleton of what could have been something magnificent. This bothers me. I am confident when I say that this book would have been absolutely stunning if Asimov had included 100 pages more of thoughts, descriptions, and settings.Some other small gripes: Asimov is prone to overusing adverbs, usually considered a literary sin. Foundation also has not aged well in terms of technology, as Asimov really misses on a lot of advancements that it seems other Sci-Fi authors were able to catch. I do not take any points off off this review for that, however, because the predictions he did make were far better than any I could have ever fathom, and I commend him in that regard. All I'm saying is that these misses, relative to other authors, aren't helping."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation saga is one of the most widely-known sci-fi series ever published. Started in the 1940's with this book, Foundation, Asimov continued the series up through the 1980's, at which point he was being basically threatened by fans to continue writing to satiate their reading interest.Foundation's setting is in the far-future, when planets have not only been discovered and colonized, but millions of planets have been organized into a Galactic Empire that spans thousands os star systems. Hyper-industry and nuclear power form the core to this civilization, which seems to have an endless grasp on the future of civilization.That is, until Hari Seldon, a scientist, discovers the science of psychohistory, by which future events can be predicted based on calculations of human behavior. He foresess the collapse of the Empire based on inevitable social, political, and economic forces. He devises a plan to save humankind from an imminent dark age by instituting a scientific Foundation at the edge of the galaxy.This premise is what drew me to the read the book. What exciting prospects! The opportunity to plumb the mind of the genous Hari Seldon. To get a closer look at this Galactic Empire, whose proportions were mindboggling. To understand, at a more nuts and bolts level, this &quot;psychohistory.&quot; To see what Hari Seldon has up his sleeve.Unfortunately, though the book provides an historical fiction that encompasses 300 years of life after Hari Seldon, and introduces leaders of his Foundation that are memorable for their nerve and intellect, some of the imaginative possibilities, such as most of those mentioned above, are not fully realized. I am not sure if they are realized in other books of the series, but I guess that's for someone else to comment on.Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. Though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking in addition to the brevity of focus on Hari, a good discussion of psychohistory, or much emphasis on the Galactic Empire.Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes (there are 5 heroes that are portrayed in the generation following Hari), there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men-at-work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets. The dialogue is great, though, and that's part of the reason the book is a quick read.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. There's not much refelction on the part of the narrator, or poignancy. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the interesting description of the false religion that a protagonist, Salvor Hardin, invents in order to undermine the economy of a neighboring state. Religion is also used to manipulate other planets. Hard to swallow, this helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The book is also full of cute phrases that portray the all-importance of technology in Asimov's future: characters say things like, &quot;What in the name of space?&quot; or &quot;Thank space!&quot; The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. Not only are technology and politics the deepest material this book touches, but even the technology the book introduces is not very interesting. With the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There are no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also in the true spirit of what the word &quot;romance&quot; conveys, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far-off worlds is sparesly and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms. Though, admittedly, Asimov's grasp of political personalities is astounding.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game and the moves than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I know I'll take some major heat in saying this, but I wasn't that impressed with this beloved classic. Oh, the idea intrigues me, surely, that of humankind eons in the future existing across the galaxy on a multitude of worlds, so far removed from earth that eminent masters of science themselves debate whether earth was even the planet where human life began, but once the dust settled from an idea that lofty, what did Asimov really DO with it? He used it for unexciting little tales of science v. military might. I love the parallel between the fall of this vast space empire and the fall of Rome. The way bands of scientists struggled in a dark age to keep the light of knowledge alive was thought-provoking (which is high praise in my lexicon) but this was backdrop, and the plot Asimov employed in telling the story of all this was (sorry to say) dull, slow, simple, and unworthy of the imaginative concepts he thought up in his setting for this tale of knowledge overcoming strength of arms. I haven't read the later Foundation novels, so maybe they're the ones where the brilliance of the series exists, but I found this book from Sci-Fi's golden age so demanding on my patience that I didn't finish it the first time I tried to read it and barely made it to the end the second time. I wish I shared the glowing praise for this classic that millions of others claim they feel, but to be honest, I just don't."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is great science fiction for the scientific minded, no deus ex machina here. The only fault I find with this 1st book is that the 3 main characters are exactly the same person. Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are the exact same character. All calm, cool and collected. Perfectly confident and perfectly logical. No difference in dialogue and problem solving skills, you wouldn't be able to tell from Asimov's writing that these characters are from different time periods and are from different cultures. For that matter, every character in the book seems to be of the same culture and dialect. I realize Asimov uses a minimalist style of writing, like Hemmingway, there are good and bad sides to this. No fleshing out of characters has to be considered weakness in Asimov's writing. It may have made for a longer book, but his characters would have been better served if they all didn't behave as robots."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov is one of the few popular science fiction writers whose fame is derived mostly from his intriguing story line and character interactions as oppose to pure imaginative science. In fact, given that this series takes place 50,000 years into the future, one could easily argue that its incredibly short sighted given how little science has evolved; yet this detracts very little from just how entertaining this book and the series is. Asimov is a fantastic writer in terms of creating intrigue, wit, and believable dialog, and the result is he has developed a very enjoyable series.Foundation is the first book of the original three that Asimov wrote in the Foundations series, and although the series is now quite a collection of books with some even taking place before the period of this book, Foundation still represents a terrific point to enter the series. The premise is that a science exists that is able to predict the downfall of an empire that ruled the galaxy for 20,000 years, and as a result a foundation (two in fact) is set up to ultimately shorten the period of anarchy that will result in the empire's downfall. This of course leaves open plenty of intriguing possibilities and Asimov does not disappoint.Asimov is very straight forward in his writing and leaves little open to interpretation. He has often been criticized for this style, yet in place of open ended complexities the book contains a quality that fully immerses its readers and satisfies them with clear and definitive answers. Reading the foundation novels is somewhat akin reading a history book that that highlights specific elements of importance. This style may not appeal to everyone, but once you are engrossed in the story line you will find it hard to put this book down (as well as many others in the series).***For those new to the series, here are the specific seven books tied directly into the Foundation story line and their original date of publication. I read these in the order they were published and was very happy to have chosen that order. Asimov also tied in some of this other book series into this one (specifically his Robot series) thus making the entire story line a much larger volume of books.Prelude to Foundation (1988)Forward the Foundation (1993)Foundation (1951)Foundation and Empire (1952)Second Foundation (1953)Foundation's Edge (1982)Foundation and Earth (1986)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a classic of the Sci-Fi genre, and that is nearly everything you need to know.

The first book was \\"Foundation,\\" which introduced us to Hari Seldon, psychohistory and Hari's plan to reduce 30,000 years of chaos to a mere 1,000 years. This book is two novelettes combined into one book, and tells how the Foundation struggles to survive against the remnants of the galactic empire and then against a mutant, whose coming Hari Seldon failed to predict.In the first part of this story we meet the General, Bel Riose. I enjoyed the story, but I kept getting the feeling that Bel Riose was being manipulated for most of the story. I assumed that Riose was being manipulated by the Foundation, though it was also possible that the Second Foundation, which we learn much more about in the second half of this book, was also manipulating Riose. In spite of my perceived lack of suspense as I waited for Riose's inevitable defeat, I did enjoy this half of the book while longing to get into the second half.In the second half of the book we meet a unique and unpredictable mutant called the Mule. The mutant is called the Mule for biological reasons. We also learn that the Mule was unpredicted by Hari Seldon. The Mule realizes that the Second Foundation is his only true nemesis as he quickly conquers the Foundation. The Mule follows the exploits of researchers as they seek, and find, the Second Foundation. How can the Second Foundation be discovered? Has the Second Foundation been discovered? Is Hari Seldon's plan truly out of control? The reader must move on to \\"Second Foundation\\" to learn these answers and more!I enjoyed the second part of this book immensely. I had to read about the Mule until I learned whether he had truly destroyed Seldon's plan. Unfortunately, I had to wait until the next book in the series to learn the truth, but I was still on the edge of my seat.This book carries on nicely from \\"Foundation.\\" If you liked that book you will enjoy seeing the challenges the Foundation faces as it tries to help create a future that remains hundreds of years away. This book is a worthy second book in the original Foundation Trilogy.The final book in the original Foundation Trilogy is \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Not surprisingly this is a second reading - I first enjoyed this classic about twenty years ago.There's much to enjoy. Or, rather, there's the central idea to enjoy: Asimov is generally at his best in short stories with a single \`what if' notion. What's unusual about Foundation is that he managed to successfully spin his workable \`psycho-historian' idea out into a (wisely short) novel. The series even kicked along OK for a while, but by the time we get to the dreadful fifth Foundation and Earth Asimov had spun out of control into event horizon of his ego.One way he gets away with a whole novel here is by basically telling the same story three times (only the character's names have been changed to protect the word count). Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow are all puppet master politicians who keep their master-plans carefully hidden, pulling a clever rabbit out of a hat at the last minute to thwart their thug foes: I can't really remember who's motto was something like, \\"Violence is the last resort of the unintelligent,\\" but it works as well for any of them. The latter two are a bit annoying in their reiterated, \`Look, it's obvious how to solve this crisis - Seldon's plan means there's no other way', when it's no such thing, but the joy of fiction is never having to say your wrong. I mean, Asimov's quasi-Marxist political theory of historical progress is, at heart, flapdoodle, but he can have the fun constructing his universe to confirm his protagonists' convictions. We can have fun to: it's a nice idea competently realised.The leading men are arrogant, spurning or using public opinion with machiavellian disdain while they manipulate enemies with the same Trojan horse technique. Oh, and they are, of course, leading *men*: Asimov's SF futuristic orientation didn't stretch as far as women being any more than pantomime caricatures, if indeed they exist at all. His only female character is execrably predictable: vain, pretty and shrewish. People are basically divided into three groups: realists (successful scientists, businessmen and/or politicians); greedy amoral militaristic imperialists; and sheep."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It had been quite some time since I had read Asimov, so I was relatively excited when I picked up Foundation. I was not disappointed in the least. This novel is an absolutely fabulous piece of psycho-political drama that is perhaps most enjoyable because of its suspenseful trill as well as its political/sociological considerations.The entire text, built on the theories of the fictional character Hari Seldon, is driven by the concept of psycho-history. This is primarily a form of mathematical sociology that allows for the statistical prediction of galactic masses, given a set of variables. As the Galactic Empire is beginning to crumble, Hari Seldon perceives this fall and takes the precautions to insure a quick return to a Second Empire. The development of his Plan spurs him to create two foundations at the ends of the galaxy to promote this return.This text chronicles the early founding and rise of the first foundation. Given the nature of psychohistory, most events unfold in such a way that a critical moment, at which the probability of success is nearly 100%, always arrives for solutions to the problems facing the foundation. This drives the story in a suspenseful manner, as Asimov pursues the interrelation of individual freedom and the \\"mob psychology\\" of psychohistory. The text is also an interesting exploration into the rise of power by a means of a variety of factors, concealed in this review for the sake of not spoiling the story.Foundation deserves the accolades of the Sci-Fi community and truly should be read by anybody who has any latent interest in science fiction or fantasy. It is an exciting, and fulfilling read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the unabridged audio cd version of Isaac Azimov's book foundation.

For me at the time, it seemed boring at that age, and I had trouble reading it. Next year, I picked up the book again, and couldn't stop reading it. Asimov sets up a realistic structure for how to contain millenias of combined information from across a galaxy, and build a stable, remote world to contain the falling Empire's scientific knowledge. But especially after reading the entire series, I always must ask, is psycho history scientifically possible? It states that the actions of an individual doesn't affect the flow of the universe. Later int he series though, you will learn of the mule that broke this rule, and even later after the trilogy, where he came from. But how could mathematics, and the general pschology of people,possibly predict when specific crisis's happen. Even though in Second Foundation, where the reader learns more about the second foundation, which is based not on science, but on pschohistory, helps maintain the course of the Foundation. You can get lost in thought trying to discover the possibilities psychohistory could bring, if it could work.????"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It has been many years since I read this and I guess the boquets that are so generously thrown at Aasimov don't seem quite as wonderful as they used to."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"What else can be said, other than it should be required reading reading for all sci fi fans. A classic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first of the three novels in the original \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". The trilogy is similar to \\"I, Robot\\", in that the novels are created out of shorter fiction that was first published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940's. It was first published in novel form by Gnome Press in 1951. A trimmed down version was published under the title \\"The 1,000 Year Plan\\" by Ace books in the 1950s.While certainly a classic and important to setup the series, \\"Foundation\\" is easily the weakest of the three novels. Consisting of five parts, four of which are taken from the shorter fiction from years before, it covers a large period of time in a relatively short amount of space. In addition, the stories are fairly short, and it is rare for a character to appear in more than one. As a result, there is little in the way of character development in this book. The subsequent novels (\\"Foundation And Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are each comprised of just two works of shorter fiction, and thus do not suffer as much in this area.The sections of \\"Foundation\\" are:\\"The Psychohistorians\\" - This is the story of Gaal Dornick who has come to the capital of the Empire, Trantor to work with Hari Seldon. This story introduces the key concepts of the series; introducing the reader to Psychohistory, the Empire, and the purpose of the Foundation. It is unique among the sections of this book, in that it was written specifically for the novel and was not published previously.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" - In this story, the Foundation becomes separated from the Empire, and is threatened by its neighbors, the Anacreonians. It is in this story that the citizens of the Foundation find out their real purpose, having believed before that they were sent there to create a Galactic Encyclopedia to preserve man's knowledge. This was first published in part as the novelette \\"Foundation\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in May of 1942.\\"The Mayors\\" - This story is closely tied to \\"The Encyclopedists\\", and there are some of the same characters. Once again the Foundation is threatened by the Anacreonians; however, this time the Foundation uses its technological expertise to avert the crisis. This story also introduces the use of \`Priests' to spread the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Bride and Saddle\\" in the June 1942 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Traders\\" - This story is about the use of trade to expand the influence of the Foundation. More specifically, it is about an agent of the Foundation who has been imprisoned on Askone, a planet that prohibits the use of the Foundation's devices. This was first published in the October 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" as the short story \\"The Wedge\\".\\"The Merchant Princes\\" - This is a more complicated and involved story than the others included in this book. A merchant trader, Hober Mallow, goes in search of several missing Foundation ships, discovering evidence of the old Empire. More important though, is the struggle for power within the Foundation which results in the abandonment of religion in favor of economics as the source of expanding the influence of the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"The Big And The Little\\" in the August 1944 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I think asimov truly showed his ability in Foundation and Empire. Whether or not Foundation was better is debatable. But to create 2 knockout novels is pure gift. All the people who say it is bad are wrong. they say you should read a classic. It is a classic!

First let me say this is not STAR WARS and it isn't STAR TREK, This is what Science Fiction is all about. Truly epic in every sense of the word, Foundation offers us a window into a future so far away Earth is forgotten completly. And like any good epic, their is no main character, instead the story is a series of short stories. Each story features new characters and plots decades, sometimes centuries apart. The best part of this book is that its only part one! I can't recommend this book enough! If you consider yourself a serious Sci-Fi fan then get this book today."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second of the original Foundation trilogy written in the 1950s. The first book is Foundation and the last is Second Foundation. I enjoyed Foundation but I liked F&E; quite a bit more! Foundation consists of five disconnected short stories, too short for adequate development of the settings or characters. F&E; is much more focused, containing only two stories, the second of which really impressed me.A quick refresher on the background: The psychohistorian Hari Seldon was able to mathematically foresee the future of human society in the Milky Way. It wasn't pretty. Socio-economic forces were to cause the total collapse of the Trantorian Empire and lead to 30,000 years of anarchy and barbarism before a new empire restored peace and order. However, Seldon saw an \\"alternate path\\" that could reduce the duration of the Dark Ages to a single millennium. He established two societies (called Foundations) to bring this change about.In Foundation, we learn how the fledgling First Foundation established itself after Seldon's death and how it grew powerful. In F&E;, Seldon is long dead and the First Foundation faces much more serious threats: a war with the dying but still powerful Trantorian Empire and a war with a mutant leader called The Mule who possesses incredible powers. The part about the war with the Empire is a straightforward narrative with a couple interesting twists. The second part about The Mule takes place a few decades later and is written in the style of a mystery, sort of like the first two Robot novels.Since The Mule is an individual of extraordinary power, Seldon's psychohistorical predictions for the First Foundation are in jeopardy because they deal only with masses of people and large scale socio-economic forces. Hence the second part is a more exciting read. :-) Also, until the end of the second part the Second Foundation is a mysterious society on the other side of the Galaxy about whom we know next to nothing. Although I guessed the nature of The Mule's powers, I did not guess his identity and it was a great surprise for me when it was revealed at the end. The events of the last two chapters are stunning and really make you want to rip into the third book. Yet F&E; doesn't end on a cliffhanger and is quite satisfying in and of itself. This unique blend is a testament to Asimov's genius as an author. Also, you'll learn why the mutant calls himself The Mule and it's quite enlightening!With novels written later, Asimov tied together three series into one huge one! I recommend reading the entire 14-book series in the following order: the four Robot novels, the three Empire novels, and the seven Foundation novels (the original trilogy plus two prequels and two sequels). So far I've yet to read the last three Foundation books (Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and Earth), but so far most have been excellent and all have been well above average."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"As in Foundation, this is actually not a single story. Here are presented two separate episodes in the development of the Foundation toward the establishment of the Second Galactic Empire.The first details the encounter between the growing Foundation and the still-very-powerful Empire. At the forefront is an Imperial General of outstanding ability and charisma. Unfortunately, Hari Seldon, the architect of the Foundation, predicted all this with his psychohistorical calculations. While the general is very successful in his opposition to the Foundation, his very nature ensures his downfall.The second story is quite ingenious, in that the single large failing of Seldon's psychohistory is brought to light. An individual beyond the predictive nature of psychohistory has appeared and done the impossible. While there is a type of mystery presented, Asimov either wanted the reader to know the answer before the characters, or he didn't try very hard to obscure the nature of things. But this is a crucial moment in the Foundation's development, as they seem to be vulnerable after all. This story depends heavily on a plot element present in all the Robot-Empire- and now Foundation Series: psionic abilities. Clearly this was a favorite concept for Asimov, and he never seems to abuse it; that is, it never seems there for its own sake but always represents a fundamental encounter when it appears, and you can bet there are severe ramifications.While I have noted a few complaints about the second of these two stories, this book is still very well written, with action and suspense as good as any I've read. Asimov did such a wonderful job crafting this future history that I can only applaud having had the pleasure to read it. If you like S-F, you will love this whole series, chosen as the Best Series Ever Hugo winner. Need I say more?"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When Isaac Asimov was writing at his best, he was the one of the best science fiction writers to ever heft a typewriter.He wrote the orginal short stories to make up the Foundation novels in the 1940's for John W. Campbell's Astounding Science Fiction Magazine. In large messure, he modelled the history in the stories after the fall of the Roman Empire.Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, Hober Mallow are names that stand in the history of Science Fiction like the names of real people in many ways. &quot;Violence is the last resort of the incompetent&quot; and &quot;Never let your morals get in the way of doing what is right&quot; are quotes that every reader of SF knows well.Only names like Jubel Harshaw and David Bowman (who came to life from the pens of Robert Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke) rank with these characters created by Isaac Asimov. I'm not positive if this is the best SF/F novel ever written, but it definitely makes the top five list of best SF novels ever written.It is a great loss to the world that Asimov slipped off his mortal coil back in 1992. His writting is great. At least we still have his books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The key to enjoying the original Foundation trilogy is to understand that the three novels which make up the \\"trilogy\\" are not really novels. They are a series of interconnected stories written over time. Foundation is actually 5 short stories. Because of this the stories vary in quality.The second book, Foundation and Empire is actually two stories. The first is called The General, and tells the story of the empire's last ditch effort to conquer the foundation. The weakness of the first story is that all the action takes place off page. We never see any of the actual combat, we just read the characters talking about it. Also, the resolution comes way too quickly. It feels like Asimov had reached his page limit and decided to end the story as quickly as he could.The second story, called The Mule, is the real draw here. All the previous stories presented a challege for the foundation to overcome. However, it was always expected that the foundation would triumph based on the long term scientific predictions of its founder. The Mule throws in a variable that was not predicted. The appearance of a mutant who swiftly moves to conquer the various planets left in the wake of the old empire's collapse. Ultimately, he sets his sights on the foundation. The best part of the story is a visit to the ruins of the planet Trantor. Former capital of the galactic empire.Having finished this second book, I have come to realize that the Foundation trilogy, while entertaining is certainly not Asimov's best work. Time is not always kind to science fiction and all of these early stories were written before 1950, when Asimov was still a young writer. I plan to continue on to the next book, but I no longer expect to be overwhelmed by the classic status these stories have achieved."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The original Foundation series was released as a series of three books: Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation, in 1951, 1952, and 1953, respectively. Some datedness to this series is to be expected, but I've read SF stories written 40 years after these that felt more dated, and personally I think the concept, the sweeping distant future galactic empire Asimov writes, far outweighs any datedness one might expect. So much so, that for serious science fiction readers this series is almost essential reading. Not essential in that you *have to*, nothing kills interest faster than making it some classroom prerequisite to SF, but more in that it would be hard to consider that you wouldn't find some aspect of this series worthwhile at least and absolutely fascinating at best. Several reviewers had said that this trilogy is really a series of shorter novellas that were published earlier thus leading to some incohesiveness. Until a few days ago, I wasn't aware of that and when I read this series and discussed with friends afterwards that never came up. This is a sweeping series, where if an *only* 1000 year dark age is the *best* case scenario, you realize that a lot of time may have to be covered leading to chronological jumps.The idea of psychohistory is a fascinating concept and I haven't seen anyone else really copy it. With that said, it could also be considered a far fetched concept. To predict the history of a huge civilization statistically, albeit in large numbers to offset individuality, but still made up the most irrational entities in the known universe, human beings, is pushing credibility. But that's what also makes this a powerful concept as well. This idea has also been considered in the United States, for what else, economic theory. Statistically there had been too many variables, basically risk. Then in the 80's some economic theorists came upon the concept of eliminating the variable of risk, by forming a mutual fund of as many diverse economic sources as possible. The more the better (like Seldon's the larger the group of people the better) because any worldwide effect causing one economic segment to go down would be offset by some other economic segment that wouldn't. This concept was considered revolutionary and massive amounts of money were poured into this mutual fund from numerous financial institutions. And it worked and paid off well... for a while. But like the Mule of the book series, the theory couldn't account for a single element that would take a large segment of the economy with it. In this case, it was the financial meltdown of the Asian economy that was so sweeping, it took down so many markets that this mutual fund plummeted. So many institutions had poured money into the fund that the US government actually had to help bail it out, because it's collapse threatened the US economy and possibly the entire world economy. (PBS did a fascinating documentary on the events.) So the theory of psychohistory is difficult to consider viable, but is still a fascinating theory and the inventor of it in the series, Hari Seldon, is the Albert Einstein of the empire and is successful at it. Until, that is, a powerful individual comes along, The Mule, which the theory cannot account for and the Seldon Plan fails. The Seldon Plan is so visionary at first that every once in a while long after his death, a prerecorded holographic speech of Seldon would occur stating would should be occurring in the universe at that time and indeed it is occurring. The Foundation realizes they're in big trouble when, after the emergence of The Mule, Seldon returns in one of his recorded messages and the events of the time isn't what he predicted. Asimov writes this section brilliantly.Thus Seldon had secretly instituted a Second Foundation (which is essentially a Backup Plan). I cannot call myself an Asimov fan. I don't really care for his robot series in general and the endings of Asimov's novels tend to be anticlimactic. But with the Foundation series he turns this into an advantage. The final book of the series deals with the confrontation with the Second Foundation. By this time the reader is aware of the power of the Second Foundation and thus the confrontation doesn't need to be with laser pistol or light saber, and is over in minutes. What a brilliant conclusion.I've considered the original Foundation trilogy a stand-alone series. Asimov's Foundations Edge, written 30 years later, is different as to be expected. Since the Foundation series was sufficiently concluded (and stood for 30 years), Foundation's Edge has to add a new element and I've always mentally considered it the Third Foundation. The entire Foundation series is now a seven book series (septology?) and some might say that the post-trilogy novels have corrupted the original series. If you decide to read on, Foundation's Edge is a good book, and did win the 1983 Hugo Award, deservedly so, it helps to keep in mind the real-world chronological differences between the two."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Recently, I picked up a copy of the first book in Issac Asimov's Foundation series, for which this review is written. I will not spoil the book in this review as some others have done.The theme was quite interesting. Essentially, one man somewhat manipulates humanity into protecting its knowledge and creative abilities by setting them apart from the &quot;masses&quot;, so that they can weather the coming dark ages. The great joke of this book is that Asimov almost makes it seem as if history is pushed forward by the &quot;masses&quot; themselves but in reality, his apparent humanism and rationality comes through as he shows that it is always the &quot;individual&quot; who in the end can save or destroy humanity.If you are a man (or woman) who cares about how ideas move history, if you believe in the sanctity of the individual, if you love life, then this is a book for you.Asimov is a man of reason and he shows it well throughout this first, in what I hope to be an excellent sci-fi series. Often times, contemporary authors infuse their lack of values into their books and characters, making one wonder who one should be rooting for. Asimov paints a clear picture of the values within man that make him worthy of praise (or not) - reason, justice and a love of life.This book can proudly stand side by side with Ayn Rand's Anthem and Orwell's 1984 as a warning to society about the dangers of the &quot;irrational&quot; in all its glorious forms."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"One of the BEST science fiction books I've ever read, as written by one of the best science fiction authors to live, Foundation is a wonderful look into a completely different universe than our own.Foundation is based on a community of planets who have formed and Empire- A large collective society...

The foundation is formed in an attempt to reduce that time to 1,000 years by maintaining the knowledge of the present. While acting as a terrific science fiction setting and story, Foundation also serves as a very deep look into society as a whole, and how predictable a society is. The social implications of each major crisis as it occurs is aptly predicted and accounted for, which proves largely entertaining and intriguing...This is a must read for any science fiction fan, historian, or sociologist... It's well written and imaginative with engaging ideas and concepts true only to Asimov."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation and Empire is the second book in this series. If you have not read the first one yet, you should. Still, because of the rare and very clear writing found here, you can read this book and never be confused. Since both books are so good, why skip the first one?In this book, we return to the future. A small empire, the Foundation, is on the edges of a greater one. The &quot;Empire&quot; currently encompasses thousands of worlds. Still, compared to its past, it has been shrinking. One of its most able generals, aware that the Empire is less then it once was, decides to expand the Empire. Unfortunately for the Foundation, he has choosen the systems occured by it, as the best direction for his expansion.Like the first installation, this book continually talks about the &quot;inevitable&quot; victory of the Foundation. Since they are being systematically destroyed by the Empire, such predictions ring hollow. How the book solves this problem seems to make sense. But this war is only the prelude for a greater conflict - a Civil War in the Foundation itself.Here is a really interesting dilemena. Since the Foundation is &quot;fated&quot; to survive, what will happen if it wars with itself? And, to make things more interesting, a third party joins the conflict. This mysterious entity, the &quot;Mule&quot;, leads forces that beats both foundations back. What is happening here?Again, like the first book in this series, Foundation and Empire is as much a mystery story, as science fiction. How the author solves these problems are great fun. The ending, actually the middle of the book, is a great surprise on your first read. What happens afterwards, and the new developments, make for a great twist to this story and a powerful new development in this series. A great story. It is great fun and easily as enjoyable as the first book which, on its own, was a classic.

This book takes place so far into the future that they do not know which planet humans came from! This book spans over 160 years and shows the developments of the Foundation. The Foundation is a group of people sent to a remote planet to preserve information and to secretly start a new empire. When the old Galactic Empire begins to crumble, Hari Seldon starts the Foundation. He and his followers work on an encyclopedia to help shorten the barbarian age that results from the destruction of the empire. Seldon's true plan for the Foundation is to raise the next empire that would control the galaxy. As the book continues, the Foundation grows and tries to spread their beliefs across the galaxy. Powerful neighbors become jealous and try to conquer the foundation and destroy it. The Foundation wins usually using non violent means unlike their violent foes. When the Foundation starts to conquer the other surrounding worlds, they expand and send out traders. Traders hold the Foundation together and keep up the economy by trading with the inhabitants and bringing them the Foundation's beliefs. Much of the galaxy is unaware of the Foundation's secrets and the power it holds! This book is divided into five sections, starting at different time periods with new characters and conflicts. The beginning of each section is difficult until you learn the new characters. However, the books flows well since the ideas of people in the past sections are presented in each new section as historically important. Each section is exciting with descriptive characters and a suspenseful plot. The book is a fast read, written for pure enjoyment and entertainment. It does a terrific job of both. I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Prelude to Foundation describes the young mathematician Hari Seldon's flight from an entrenched galactic bureaucracy bent on destroying him and what he represents - a threat to the established political order.Foundation opens with Hari Seldon having successfully escaped his old enemies, and having refined his new mathematical theory of statistically predictable human behavior (modeled on similarly ponderous equations of statistical mechanics): \\"Psychohistory\\".Already old but still intellectually formidable, Seldon deftly masters the waning political intrigues still seeking his life. His new project is development of a galactic knowledge repository (similar to the Great Library of Alexandria or the US National Archives) where all knowledge will be stored for future generations against the impending collapse of galactic civilization, (which Seldon's psychohistorical equations have predicted accurately). Building on his psychohistorical knowledge of the future, Seldon establishes two \\"Foundation\\" outposts in opposite and extremely remote corners of the galaxy. He does this with galactic government financial backing - ostensibly to create \\"dictionaries\\" - but the galactic government is only told of one of these Foundation outposts; the other outpost \\"is not on any of the star charts\\", (which becomes significant in later volumes of the Foundation tales).As usual, Asimov's poor ear for dialogue never gets in the way of his rich storytelling.

All this comes to pass as the great galatic empire slowly but surely fades into chaos. Only Hari Seldon, creator of this science of prediction, can save the universe from a galatic dark age.

So begins the reader's journey through hundreds of years of history and turmoil, watching as Asimov paints his picture of the tiny Foundation and its struggle to keep Seldon's plan alive. Asimov's characters are first-rate, grabbing the reader's interest with their intelligence and charisma. The plot is solid and fascinating to watch as it unfolds, taking twists and turns, every one guaranteed to surprise. Originally published as four short stories, Foundation is the beginning of the classic science fiction epic, and is not to be missed by any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a must buy, by writing this Asimov opened a gateway for other science fiction writers, none, in my opinion who have been able to better him yet. Issic Asimov doesn't just give you one set time period but 5, jumping 50 years or so into the future, each one with rebelious and revolutionary characters, adding colour and flavour to a already brilliant plot. If this wasn't enough, and the books well worth reading for just for that you are introduced to a new kind of warfare- giving the enermy something that they want and become dependent on, then when they become too mencing.... well you can read it for yourself. Foundation is pure genious, you MUST read this book"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation was the first Asimov book I read and that was about 15 years ago. Subsequently I purchased and read multiple times, every Asimov sci-fi book. All but one of the Foundation Series I have in hard-cover in addition to paperback.Reading Asimov is for me a pleasure. How he wrote in conjunction with his rich and diverse use of English I have found unequalled.A must read without which the stage for the rest of Foundation remains unprepared.True it is not his best book, but how do you decide between Masters from The Master."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation has been called by science-fiction lovers all over the world as a cornerstone for science fiction. Isaac Asimov's all time best, this book tells the tale of the crumbling of the Galactic Empire and is only the beggining of a 7-book series. The way Asimov uses the analogy of the Fall of the Roman Empire has pleased readers for decades. Asimov tells the story of a planet alone at the edge of the galaxy awaiting a future already planned for it. Leaders struggle for the planets survival, for this planet, Terminus, holds the future of the Human Race in its hands. Isaac Asimov tells the thrilling tale of human survival in an environment that is against it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Few doubt the power of these novels, and no one mildly competent in the realm of science fiction would at all. I don't remember ever being so sucked in by any book or set of books before. I think that Foundation and Empire was the best of the set, with &quot;The Mule&quot; being the best single story of the nine-story set. This is Asimov in his purest form-- no pomp, no ornation, no flowery aspiration to a false literary quality; just plain, simple prose and story: a mix that earned this set the honor of Best Science Fiction series, an honor I believe is well deserved."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I never would have made it through this book if I hadn't read the other foundation novels first. Because this was originally published in magazines, this book is very fragmented and hard to follow if you don't already know the story. Still, I love Asimov. This is just so early, he isn't excellent yet"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read this in the early 80's when I was a teen, and I was blown away by the economic theory. I just reread it, great short story's. The story of the galactic empire is very interesting."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book it simply one of the best science fiction stories ever written. It should be on the \\"must read\\" list for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Unlike a lot of other sci-fi books, Asimov has the ability to include not only the sense of futuristic complications and inventions, he has the unrivaled ability to also include a dramatic and intense showing of personal interactions, which is what makes him such a master.Its more than an idea, Asimov makes it a story. Great book and possibly the best of the three foundation novels."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Get this book! One thing that may help is that the farsighted hero, Hari Seldon, sets up a plan that supposedly needs no individuals to make it work, forces of humanity and all that, but the stories repeatedly show the importance of individuals. If you know this ahead of time, you will appreciate each story even more."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov, remember, wrote this initially as a series of short stories for a sci-fi magazine. Only later were the stories combined as a book. That is why of course no great character development occurs and the stories seem tidbits rather than grand scale work. Granted there is not much science in the book, but I have always felt that sci-fi is a form of fiction to allow the author to write freely on a subject and be able to mask what he is really talking about. Think about it, change the story to another world and have strange names for planets and suddenly nobody sees it as an attack against their country or their people. I have also felt science fiction to be more political than science (even though we call it science fiction). Politics are immense in Foundation and the style of having conversations to tell the story vs. having lots of action and space battles is fantastic. I read this first when I was 18 and did not appreciate what Asimov is trying to do. At 39, I get it. Asimov is looking at society in general and commenting that no society can be perfect and ideal and all wonderful and that dirty tricks and greed and compromise and working with others (including our enemies) is the only way a society can survive and the rest is simply propaganda. It's a direct attack against all societies that foster the idea that we're the best and the greatest and we stand for freedoms and love of country. Instead he states that what all societies become are survivors finding their strengths to counteract the enemies weaknesses. It's a great reality check which is why this should be required reading for all political science majors."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov participated in American science fiction's golden age, helping to convert pulp fantasy stories into realistic predictions of the future based on current science. It isremarkable that he wrote the Foundation while a young man, barely 20 I believe, a work with grand themes and the cornerstone of his massive and sprawling future history of mankind, which I believe went into more than 50 volumes. The basic plot is that a scientists created a new discipline, psycho-statistics I believe, that could predict the future behavior of huge masses of humans. He then attempts tomold - or at least influence - man's fate over the next 30,000 years. What is truly amazing is that Asimov succeeds in this and the two following volumes. In a way, he should have stopped here with the series. The ideas are crisp and not yoked into a determined framework, so are fresh with lively characters. Later novels in the series - the overwhelming majority - feel more stilted, bound by concepts more than by a plain old good story.A sci fi classic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I liked Star Wars. But for those of us who knew and loved the Foundation trilogy as one of the greatest masterpieces in all of science fictiondom, it was galling to hear the misplaced accolades heaped on the movie lauding its originality.Asimov's seminal universe was created decades before Lucas's derivative one, and Lucas shamelessly lifted whole passages of ideas, themes and settings from Asimov. The idea of a galactic empire; the conflict between an established empire and a fledgling but vital upstart; a world-girdling city at the heart of galactic government; a noble elite with incredible mental powers; a mysterious antagonist possessing the same mental powers but directed towards dark conquest; even the robots are there (albeit from a different Asimov source).I mention these things not to disparage Star Wars but to elevate Asimov. Today, it is too easy to forget just how original and inspiring the Foundation trilogy was when it first appeared in print. In the intervening decades, lesser imitators have copied, twisted and diluted the original story so often that its brilliance has been buried under mountains of mediocre muck.This trilogy has so much going for it that it is hard to know where to begin. For one thing, it is tautly written. Asimov would tend towards bombast later in life, but not here. For another, it sustains bold visions and landscapes of truly cosmic proportions. It also strikes the right note in setting the lives of a group of protagonists against a backdrop of immense historical forces. In so doing, it attains the weight of epic.Mostly, it astounds us with the sheer power of its imagination. I have already alluded to its many firsts, but it is what Asimov does with these firsts - the subtle way he folds them into the very substance of his story - that distinguishes this work. Take the theme of psychohistory. Asimov coined this term for his premise that all of human behaviour is reducible to a complex set of mathematical equations. He translates this abstraction into a storyline that is so compelling that we never think to question the outlandishness of his premise.This is science fiction at its finest: the marriage of science with fiction, all done with such consummate skill - the one merging so seamlessly into the other - that we are never aware of where the one ends and the other begins. Do not pass up the opportunity to read this trilogy. In the science fiction universe, it is the work of a grand master at the height of his calling."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is a well written science fiction classic. While not a major action-adventure story like many science fiction novel really makes you think about the plot, the characters, and all of humanity.It is truly one of the best scienc fiction books I have ever read and encouraged me to read the whole, equally enthralling, series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the first book of Isaac Asimov's aptly named Foundation Trilogy. Foundation presents the premise that when examining large enough populations of people it becomes possible to predict their behavior stochastically (and sociologists become statisticians). The great psychologist of the day, Dr. Seldon, finds from his statistical data that there is going to be a great social collapse; and he creates two colonies (or foundations) that are designed to shorten the period of chaos the universe will experience before a renaissance occurs. Without giving too much away, this novel is the story of the early years of one Foundation and its' experiences with the universe around them. This book makes one wonder just how much people act of their own volition and exactly to what extent we are all the same. Is it possible to predict the behavior simply by examining a large group? Another interesting sub-theme with this book that I found extremely interesting is that eventually there won't be any original thoughts; the example given is of archeology; the archeologists of Seldon's age assumed that there was no point in examining ruins; they simply read books written by the archeologists of earlier generations; it was assumed that there was nothing else to find. As people explore, explain, create, and discover more and more of the universe, will there eventually come a time that there is nothing else to find?"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The books in Asimov's universe are by far the best scifi to date. I enjoyed the Foundation and Robot books so much I collected all 45 books that are set in the Foundation universe, written by Asimov and other authors. While not all authors live up to Asimov, their contribution allows his loyal fans a chance to slip back into the universe he created. If anyone is interested in Scifi books, the Foudnation series is a wonderful place to start."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book was hilarious. I read it yesterday, and I am still laughing my Asimov. Get it? Hahahaha. Huh. Okay. Nevermind."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is my favorite book. It is very well writen, and it pulled me in. It wasn't quite as gripping as some other books, but after I read it the first time (and every time after) I felt changed. It is very. The other books in the series aren't as good, but they still are very interesting. I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"(If Amazon allowed fractional reviews, I would have given 3.5) While I enjoyed &quot;Foundation&quot; and found some of the concepts intriguing, it seems that Asimov had a lot of maturing to do as a writer at this point. The characters don't seem to really reach me the way they should, but one has to bear in mind that this book is actually a collection of shorter stories published in serial format, and the writer could not be bothered too much with deep character development. I still reccomend this book, in part because it leads into the rest of the series, which tends to improve stylistically as the books advance. However overrated &quot;Foundation&quot; may be, it firmly holds ground simply because it is so integral to the foundation trilogy and subsequent additions."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov takes the reader on a journey that is thought provoking and entertaining. It's probably his best work of all the foundation series.&quot; Foundation and Empire&quot; is one of those books that you simply can not put down."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I have just read all the volumes in the &quot;Foundation&quot; series. Because the basic ideas of society and its control (&quot;psychohistory,&quot; &quot;Foundation, &quot;Gaia&quot;) are cleverly and skillfully constructed, I could grasp these highly abstract ideas much easyly. Forever Asimov's Galactic genious! Of course this series planned as an entertainment, it can be recommended to the academician, who has his/her major in social science or its related area."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book does not need action to be great. Mr. Asimov was a profound writer. I do NOT mean swears or grownup matters. His words go beyound the sci-fi plot. This is why I give it five stars. This book may be hard to follow. This is because Mr. Asimov wrote it in sections for a magizine. Just be patient an you will lovvvve it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Before &quot;Foundation&quot; i'd read somes short-storys from Asimov, so i become insterested in his style. And what can i say now about this book? Really is a excelent piece of scifiction: Asimov united 4 independent stories in a book with lifely descriptions, a strong main-story and credibles characters in incredibles situations,...the result is just epic. So, with this book we become in eyewitness on the monumental development and fall of the human civilization... becoming it in a surrounding journey trought our future and past."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is the best book I have ever read. Issac Asimov shows off his expertise in what is probably the best series ever. Hari Seldon is a psychohistorian and can predict the future. He sees the impending collapse of the Empire and establishes two Foundations to prevent that."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation details the fall of the Galatic Empire and rise of an island in the midst of desolation - the Foundation. Not full of starship battles, but I have never seen a more clever story in its use of thought. The three Seldon crisises and the solutions have an intellectual beauty to them in that 1) the crisises are believable and 2) the solutions are also believeable and in retrospect obvious. I have noticed this about other Asimov books, espically &quot;The Stars, like Dust,&quot; and it is my favorite part of his style. Very higly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is a highly cereberal study of history. I you want a lot of action look somewhere else. (I suggest David Drake or S.M. Sterling) If you want something to ponder this is the book. Asimov's ideas have been borrowed by other works so some of it will not seem new. The science is somewhat dated (nucleur light bulbs and economical transmutation). This book does give an excellent veiw of the forces of history. If you want to understand what causes nations to fall read this book. Just don't expect Star Wars style entertaiment."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Although Asimov's Foundation Trilogy is over 40 years old, his overall writing is still top notch. There's just something about it that draws you in, and then you can't put the book down. Unfortunately, many people get unhappy when they read this first book alone. Because it was written originally as a magazine serial, it sometimes has a choppy format. But as a whole, its superb. Only after reading all three one can appreciate the magnitude of Asimov's work. There is simply not a sci-fi trilogy anywhere that can compete."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read this series when I was 15 years old and could not put it down. Ten years later and it still comes to my mind from time to time. Asimov had a wonderful imagination. I would like to have met him."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A decent series, but none of the books really stood out for me. The first, as is usually the case, was the best. A very fascination premise."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation, and all the other books that complete the extense colection are wonderful. I remember when i read this book 8 years ago, and as you see i still love it. If you don't want to read all the books of the series, you don't have to do it, the saga of foundation it's only three books (foundation, foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation), but if you want to read a good, good, GOOD,GOOOOOOOOOOD series of books, read them all, you won't regret it. I really loved all this books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When I first read The Foundation book, I was pretty dissappointed and I didn't finish it. After about half a year, I've tried to read it again and I started to like it. Finally, I liked it very much and it's one of the best series I've ever read. Asimov is a fabulous writer, no doubt."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Yes, it's got some truly lovely ideas. But, no, I didn't especially enjoy reading it. Gripping storyline, anyone? Not here..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"After reading Prelude (which I thoroughly enjoyed), I began FOUNDATION with much anticipation. Unfortunately, the book did not meet my expectations. First, it was really boring and predictable. Second, you never stay with a scenario long enough for any character development. As soon as the reader gets to know one of the characters, Asimov rushes ahead 50 years and a new cast of characters enters. My final complaint about FOUNDATION is that most of the characters are presented as simple minded. I might read the rest of the books in this series only because I have been told they get better. However, FOUNDATION is just an average read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I admit it, I am an Asimov-phile. This is yet another book by Asimov that is very hard to put down. I rate this, and all of Asimovs books with the highest regard. Quite simply buy it now, or you are a fool. ;-)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A nod to the greatness of this book, on a recent episode of Deep Space Nine, a group of genetically altered humans got together and used mathematical formulas to predict the outcome of the Dominion War. They went as far to go ahead thousands of years to predict the rise of a new Federation that would &quot;rule the Alpha quadrant for thousands of years.&quot; After just finishing the book, it finally hit me where they got that from. If only they would have given credit..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I just finished it today, and must say I wasn't dissapointed. The movement in time for each section is very effective and interesting in moving the story. I found that at each part, the radical, the person immediately disliked, turns out to be the savior of the Foundation during that crisis. I've been exposed to a lot of Science Fiction and while reading this book, I saw pieces of almost all of them in here. The Galactic Empire of StarWars originated here, the personal shields and the control of the spice guilds from Dune, to name a few. I must say, in my humble opinion, Foundation deserves the high placing as one of Science Fiction's greatest works."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Ultimately, the hardest decision about the Foundation books is to decide how to read them. Maybe I'm being ridiculous, but I think you will enjoy them more if you read them in the order they were written. If so, this is the second book. If you have not yet read Foundation, then you need to go back and do so before tackling this one.Your other choice is to read the prequels first, then go onto Foundation. In that case, this is the fourth book you should read.Whichever choice you make, don't read this book first.On the surface, Foundation and Empire will seem like an uninspired playing out of Hari Seldon's vision for the future. Ah! But there's much more happening, so pay attention. When you get to the end of the book, you may find you have missed the mainstream and will have to go back. Don't worry, almost everyone has that reaction.Asimov is a brilliant conceptual writer, but not someone who slaved over every word (in fact, he was famous for writing most of his many books in only 1 or 2 drafts, with little editing after that). This book begins to develop the full Foundation concept in all of its stunning beauty.In many ways, you will be reading this book from the eyes of the first Foundation. But that's the unimportant one. The real action is with the second Foundation. Be sure to keep that in mind.When you meet the Mule, don't think of him as an aberration but rather as an extension of today's potential. That will make the book more interesting for you.Many people find this book to be the least interesting one of the Foundation series. Let me warn you that reading this one will greatly increase your pleasure in the following books beginning with the Second Foundation (which is your next pleasant reading assignment).Enjoy this irresistible series!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I found the politics of this novel interesting enough to disregard the dated scientific references. Seldon and his science was fascinating to behold, and the plot was masterful. What concerned me was (dare I say it?) the fairly amateurish use of dialogue tags and the fact that each character seemed pretty much to speak with the same voice. Asimov wrote this as one of those authors who are at pains not to repeat 'he said'. So it must be a new tag each time, no matter how ridiculous, often paired with an adverb that makes you cringe: ('spluttered angrily', 'cried sternly', 'mumbled grumpily', so on.) Sad this very basic trick of writing lets down passages of vivid description and intriguing plot.Also, some things seemed implausible to me, such as: how was the foundation, which exported its technology across the galaxy, able to keep its technology secret?Nonetheless, this is a series every sci-fi fan has to read - its attributes outweigh its faults by a fair margin."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second novel in Isaac Asimov's landmark science fiction series, is a definite improvement on the first novel. The first novel was hardly a novel at all, but rather a loose and uneven collection of short stories. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is actually two novellas, and more care has obviously been taken with writing style, pacing, and character development.The second story, \\"The Mule,\\" is perhaps the best of the entire Foundation series. The characters are enjoyably real and likable, and there are two masterful surprises at the end.The entire Foundation series is essential reading for any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"You can read the publisher's summary for yourself, but let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I have not readf the Foundation series in years. However, the other day I was thinking about how much fun the trilogy had been. One has to remember that most of the scifi you read today has at least some of its roots based in Asimov's work, Asimov was not the best writer, nor was he the most creative. What he did accomplish was selling you another time and world that you could believe in. So, taking it for what it is, not a great piece of literature but a really enjoyable trip, i need to give the trilogy 5 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I always prefer to think of the foundation Trilogy as one book.They are meant to be read one after another and are also written that way.While the first part(Foundation) gives us the historical perspective and a sketch of characters who influence the events,this book is where it gets better in a serious way!!There is not much of a point in discussing the plot-lots of other people have commented on that.But i'll tell you this - the 2nd part of this book- which talks about the Mule and his rise to power is THE best part of the ENTIRE FOUNDATION series ( Yes all the 7 books!!).IT ends with the most famous twist on paper it will make your mind reel!! It sets up the things nicely for the Second foundation - the 3 book in the series.I have read almost everything that Asimov's written.The foundation series and the End of Eternity are my favourites.The difference between Asimov and the other Science Fiction writers is that he makes the Science Fiction believable.Asimov is also a very good mystery writer(no kidding!! - he's right up there with the authors who write mystery alone).It's easy to write a Sci Fi book with an amazing amount of Science and imagination- but how well you can bind it to a story and make it real, that is the deal.Apart from the idea the story has to be told well. This is where the good doctor excelled.Trust me if you have not read the Foundation Series you are missing something which in indelibly written in the records as the one of the best books on paper.Asimov's written it so that you are sufficiently intrested for more at the end of the book one , by the time you finish the second book you are thinking this is great stuff - desperate for more you go the 3rd book. By the time you are through you think this is soooo cool - it might be the best thing you ever read.Do yourself a favour go read the Foundation and Empire , follow that up with the Second Foundation.You'll be glad you did when you return to it over the years!!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Welcome to the second book in the Foundation trilogy (although Asimov did write further books, it was a trilogy originally). The book picks up where Foundation left off - the Foundation has established itself as a formidable force in the Periphery of the Galaxy. Of course, everyone is too well aware that gaining control of the local warlords is small potatoes compared to what's to come. In Foundation and Empire, the inevitable comes.As the previous novel, Asimov has divided this into books, however here there are only two. As a result, he gets to explore the characters at more length then in Foundation. But again, expect wonder, amazement and enjoyment at the themes, issues and grandeur of this book, not the characterisation and &quot;literary&quot; qualities.In the first book, the conflict between the Foundation and what's left of the Empire develops. This however is a much bigger game - in the past, the warlords barely out-war-powered the Foundation, while here the Empire dwarfs it even in its twilight. As always, something must be done other than a brute force tactic. Furthermore, the &quot;heroes&quot; of the Foundation are no more, in the conflict there are no Mallows or Hardins to guide the political intrigue, so it is here that Seldon's plan is put to the ultimate test.In the second book (not to give away too much), a new threat to the Plan arises. A man known only as the Mule comes to light. And for the first time, an individual drastically changes the course of history. Indeed, he consists of the biggest threat to the plan thus far. What's so special about him?.. Personally, I found this book the most enjoyable in the whole trilogy - it reminds me of the little cryptic &quot;detective&quot; plotting from other Asimov works I read, such as I Robot and Steel Caves. However, here, it's an almost perfect melodrama played out (and unlike many detective elements in novels includingthose of Asimov - this one doesn't seem contrived or make you feel at all &quot;cheated&quot;), as we follow some Foundationers in their quest to find out what the Mule is and how to deal with him.This is a great continuation of the saga and will also bring out many interesting questions - like whether an individual can change the course of history. It will also shake up your conception of the Seldon plan - overall, a great book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I just finished Foundation and Empire and so far it is my favorite in the series....Foundation presented us a struggling organization of scientists on the Planet Terminus who must deal with the newly formed barbarian kingdoms that arise from the retreating Empire. Important figures within the Foundation use religion, trade and technology to dominate over adversarial planets....In Foundation and Empire, we are given a new perspective on the Foundation. Before, we were lead to believe that the Foundation must survive and that no one could hinder its progess; that Hari Seldon's predictions of the Foundation were infallible; that the 1,000 year plan was set in stone and that a new Galactic Empire will arrise in such time thanks to Hari Seldon. However, these beliefs are put into question when an individual calling himself 'The Mule' threatens to destroy Hari Seldon's 300 year old project. He is a mutant of considerable mental powers who can seemingly convert anyone into his cause, even the greatest opponent. Thus, we are asked, \\"Does Hari Seldon's precious Psychohistory take random genetic mutation into account? If not, then is it possible for the Mule to destroy the Foundation?\\"...I loved the ending to Foundation and Empire. Like Empire Stikes Back, it leaves you hanging, desperately wanting to find out what happens to the main characters (and the galaxy) after the book ends....I've always loved enigmatic characters in books. The Mule fits this catagory, which, in my mind, makes him even more sinister and evil. We never see him or hear him speak (for all those who have read the book, don't say anything), and yet we experience his destructive force. It reminds me of Sauron of The Lord of the Rings. At the end, however, we are given a profound revelation of the Mule that adds a new dimension to his character....All in all, it was the dispair and depression in the book that captured me. There was little hope and yet the human spirit was still evident. I applaud Asimov for creating a believable story in which death, destruction and dispair overshadow an entire galaxy but hope and determination remain. This theme, I think, is present throughout the series and, in my opinion, is the most important human quality that makes us who we are. The foundation is ultimately an exploration of this theme. Clearly, Hope is the most formiddble force that human history and, according to Asimov, the galaxy has ever seen."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second book of the original trilogy, this book is an amazing follow on to &quot;Foundation&quot;. The seven books of the Foundation series together form what I consider to be the most complete and astonishing blend of deep reality with science fiction. The septet, for the uninitiated, include (in the order I believe they should be read in): Prelude to the Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth. Do yourself a favor, buy them all. If you don't drool over the books by the time you're done with them, read them again."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I give all 14 books 5 stars!For those of you who would like to read the Foundation story in it's entirety, from beginning to end, chronologically, then I suggest following this course. There are 14 books in the series! In the end, it was R. Daneel Olivaw who designed and created the Trantorian empire in the first place, and so the robot novels--which introduce the cradle world of Earth before the dawn of the empire--come before the Foundation Trilogy:The Caves of Steel, The Naked Sun, The Robots of Dawn, Robots and Empire, Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph, Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, Foundation and EarthNow some of you might not recommend that one read the Second Trilogy before the first. True, but they come chronologically BEFORE the first Foundation Trilogy! I do recommend that you at least read Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth AFTER you have read the second trilogy (Foundation's Fear, Foundation and Chaos, Foundation's Triumph) because the subjects in the last two (chronological) books are more interesting that way."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"First, I read quite a bit from all genres, primarily to expand my world. Foundation is a very good series, but here's a few reasons why this book might not expand *your* world: 1) you were a statistics/religion/philosophy major in college (it may annoy); 2) you want a book for entertainment, not to ponder (it may bore); 3) you really think character development is important in a book (it spans generations, hence little/no development); 4) You're already a scifi buff (most of the books you've read have already assimilated the ideas of Foundation -- credit where due!). Biggest reason to read: its robust, well-crafted universe. Other tidbits: I've tried to read this series a second time, but it can't sustain my interest quite like other 5-star selections."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I always liked Asimov, but finding series books in sequence is difficult with print books. Kindle makes it easy! Now they're all cataloged in order and I don't even have to get out of bed for the next one.Reading the \\"Foundation\\" series in order rather than by availability makes a great writer even better."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"All I can say, for warm start, is that Isaac Asimov is a genius. Acclaimed Hugo Award winner, he really makes you feel a part of the future, as he proves to be a genius not only in a robot way of thinking, but also in politics, economy, religion, mass manipulation and, of course, in every way that makes a human, human. And I am pretty sure this characteristic of him is really connected to his also great robotics series.Imagine yourself in the future. Now imagine yourself in a further future where you are studying the chronology of the future. Remember your history classes in school? Yeah, that's where he's taking you. Analyzing the Galactic Empire from a distant and omnipotent way of view, he sets a pattern in the development of mankind that repeats itself various and various times, that's why this book could be written set in Middle Age. But it isn't and that's one of the most fascinating things about it.Everything starts when Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian - a new science developed by himself based in history, statistics and mathematics - predicts the fall of the Galactic Empire. To save mankind from thousands years of darkness and restart, he suggests setting a new colony at the fringe of the Galaxy - Terminus System - to develop the greatest literacy work of history and regroup all knowledge ever acquired: the Encyclopedia Galactica.Set as a scientific colony and lacking natural resources, the Foundation, as it is called, starts to suffer of politics and diplomatic issues and that's just where all the greatness starts coming. As it's well more developed in technology and science than the rest of Periphery - as they call the region of the galaxy containing the Terminus system - other colonies start trading natural resources, such as gold and iron, for scientific gadgets to control their masses.Based on science, there is created a new religion in which priests are, actually, researchers and technicians. It was Arthur C. Clarke who once said that high level technology is indistinguishable from magic, though it makes perfect sense for this novel, except we are not taking magic in consideration, but religion (although they are equal if you look from a different angle, but this is not to be discussed in this review). To control masses in the Four Kingdoms of Periphery, they sell science. And it works pretty well until there's a crisis, and another, and another. In each of them, those called Seldon Crisis and taken in consideration when the psychohistorian predicted the need of Foundation, he appears and hints a new period of development.But it is not only religion that control masses and it is not only faith that is needed in human race, but also trading, protection, food, gadgets, industry and, of course, a stable economy. Nuclear force moves everything in the future, that's how Asimov puts it and he puts it so well that he really makes us think if isn't it the power we should explore - consider this book was written in the beginning of nuclear power.The book is well-split in five sections: The Psychohistorians, The Encyclopedists, The Mayors, The Traders and The Merchant Princes. In each of those, Asimov explores a deep wound in human civilization, psychology and sociology, based on a few dominating aspects, and shows that it is even easier to overpower an entire society poking only its foundation.It is a masterpiece, well-thought from the beginning to the last word. That's all I have to say.95/100"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Clever twists, incredible imagination, and a fun, quick read. Some of Asimov's ideas of future civilizations invoke awe even decades later. My only complaint is that the reader only gets to experience each generation for a single chapter, so character development is tricky and brief. Not as good as Ender's Game, but still worth reading."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is completely a story of ideas, the characters are completely servants to the scifi galaxy Asimov has created.

I read this one in record time. A great read, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is a \\"trilogy\\" of thirteen books. This review will mainly talk about book one. The Foundation, a group of scientists and engineers writing a galactic encyclopedia, starts before book one takes place. The prologue is about an apparently irrelevant person. Nonetheless, I think it is important to read the beginning because it sets up the story. The main story takes place much later, when the actual Foundation is formed at the edge of the galaxy. This entire group of people are the main character, though at time other people take the spotlight.During the book, challenges arise to meet the Foundation, and at each challenge, the Foundation uses a different and unique method of dealing with the task at hand. As the book progresses, the Foundation gets more and more technology, while the empire at the center of the galaxy dies away. The Foundation was created to start a new empire after the old empire is destroyed. To make sure this would happen, Harry Seldon used psychohistory to predict the future and lock the foundation in a path that will reach its goal.I think that this book should only be absorbed by people in college or beyond because it has very advanced ideas."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation And Empire, by Isaac Asimov is the second book in the original Foundation trilogy, which won a Hugo Award in 1965 for Best All-Time Series. It follows much the same narrative structure as the first book, Foundation, save that the book has only two \`books', to the original's five, which allows for less epic scene setting, and much more character development. And don't let some of the books' critics fool you. The characterizations in these books are wonderful, deep, and complex. They simply are not done in the usual ways. They use a characterization style I term \`silhouetting', wherein characters are portrayed not so much by what they do as the important things they do not do, or that which is not described in \`on stage' actions. This book, though, is not merely a continuation of the first book, but an expansion of its themes, which includes some more detailed characterization.The first book set up the history of a senescent galactic Empire on the verge of tottering into oblivion and thirty thousand years of barbarism. A scientist named Hari Seldon attempts to shorten that Imperial interregnum by establishing two Foundations on either end of the galaxy, ostensibly to compile an Encyclopedia Galactica. In reality these two Foundations will be the cornerstones of the Second Empire, which Seldon's Psychohistory- a deterministic pseudoscience, predicts will cut the interregnum down to s ingle millennium. By the first book's end the first Foundation, on the planet Terminus, has survived several \`Seldon Crises' via his holographic intervention, which helps the Foundation outwit its enemies, and the work of legendary leaders- Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, and a few centuries in to its existence seems poised to actually take on and destroy the ruined Empire.This is where Foundation And Empire starts....the book is relatively easy to get into- even if you've not read the first book. That's because Asimov's style of the pseudo historical work allows for quick recaps (in the old movie serial vein), and the fact that each chapter within each book has new characters and situations means that they can stand alone, even as they add to the overall tapestry. Asimov also makes a wise dramatic choice in The Mule section. By spending a book and a half showing Psychohistory's upside, and proving its internal \`validity', the second half of Foundation And Empire shows the downside of lulling oneself into a false sense of security, as well the consequences that coyuld await the Foundation if it falls the same way the Empire did. The funereal descriptions of Trantor contrast vividly with the awesome complexity that opens the first book of the trilogy. Then, the Empire seemed impervious. Yet, Asimov is so good a writer that he rarely lapses into caricature. Even The Mule is sympathetic, when we understand his drive to prove himself. Even more interesting is that he seems no worse than the old Emperors, nor even the dynastic heirs of the current Foundation. With his powers his Second Empire might even be better than the Seldonian one. Yet, lacking an heir- due to his sterility. and his own powers, it would seem likely that even greater chaos would befall the galaxy upon his death.This begs the question that seems to be central to the trilogy: \`What place does the individual have in the overall scheme of things?', or, more succinctly, \`Does an individual matter?' The Mule seems to be a resounding answer of YES! He also seemingly cuts to the dubious heart of Psychohistory, which is based upon the well known Fallacy Of Uninterrupted Trends. Because of these philosophical depths, wonderfully concise and spare writing which does not bore one silly with extraneous detail, but a lean, clean narrative line, excellent characterizations, and an ability to deliver a twist ending many mystery writers would envy, Foundation And Empire ranks as a truly great novel, even outside its genre. Only readers addicted to the modern need to reveal why everything is, in excruciating detail, and to have mere action, action, action on every page, will not recognize this as not only great sci fi, but great literature. Asimov, too, deserves the label as a great writer. As The Mule might say: On to Second Foundation!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov's Foundation books are well-crafted, masterfully imagined, and peopled with fascinating characters. Spanning some several thousand years, and multiple generations of characters (often more than one per book), the author does a fantastic job keeping each set unique and captivating. The stories follow the progression of Psychohistory, a technique for predicting the future behavior of masses of people, and the people set up to use its information to further the birth of a greater galactic empire. Space battles, intrigue, mutants, telepathy and mind control, as well as personal triumphs and failures run throughout all the novels. They are, in my opinion, among the best crafted series in the sci-fi genre ever produced."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"What else can one possibly say about one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written?? A terrific beginning to a beginning series. I can hardly wait to read the rest of them."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was not conceived as the beginning of series of novels. It was not conceived as a novel. It was not even conceived entirely by Isaac Asimov.Beginning in the late 1930s and for decades thereafter, the editor of the most prestigious and far more important, the best-paying monthly publication in science fiction was John W. Campbell of Astounding Science Fiction (now known as Analog.)Before taking over the editorship of the magazine, Campbell had been a popular hack writer of unabashed, wild-eyed space opera. A typical Campbell plot involved a couple of young American go-getters who whomp up a superduper space cruiser in their garage, set out on a test flight around Saturn, find themselves hurled into another dimension by a short circuit, and stumble on a planet inhabited by humans who are at war with some interplanetary Nasties who display unusually bad table manners. They forge an alliance with the good humans against the bad Nasties which, a few hundred pages later, inevitably leads to the utter annihilation of the world of the Nasties, not to mention the Nasties themselves and every vestige of their million year-old civilization and culture. By the literary standards of pulp magazine science fiction in 1936, this was pretty sophisticated stuff.When Campbell took over the reins of the magazine in 1938, he raised his sights. In short order he dumped the old stable of writers whose collective knowledge of science could have been stuffed into a peanut shell with room to spare and began cultivating new ones. A. E. van Vogt specialized in social science mumbo-jumbo that actually sounded like it meant something. L. Sprague deCamp had a sense of humor. Robert Heinlein possessed a literary spark that might be carefully fanned into a flame. And Isaac Asimov was a college kid from Brooklyn who wrote stories to stretch out the limited income generated by his father's candy store.All these and many others were overawed by the wondrous fact that the godlike JWC deigned to accept their humble stories--after he mercilessly picked apart their flaws and demanded re-writes, pronto!Those were the heroic days of magazine publishing. Editors in general and Campbell in particular did not wait for undisciplined and slothful writers to hatch ideas. No, JWC would call in his disciples and hand out plot lines and devices to be made into short stories, novelets and serialized novels. To van Vogt he tossed the idea of a totalitarian society whose tyranny was leavened by weapons shops that sold guns which could only be used in self defense. From deCamp, citing Mark Twain's \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" he demanded to know what would happen if a contemporary American were hurled back from Mussolini's Italy to post-imperial Rome. Of Heinlein he demanded a series of stories that would collectively outline the history of the next few hundred years. For Asimov he reserved a far larger patch of history. What, he queried, would happen when a galaxy-spanning empire finally decayed and began to fall?Asimov pondered. Then, in his own words, \\"With a little bit of cribbin' / From the works of Edward Gibbon / And that Greek Thucydides,\\" Asimov took the Roman Empire of the Fifth Century and cast it into the stars as the expiring Empire of Trantor. From Eighteenth Century France he took the Encyclopedists and renamed them the Foundation. Finally he spiced up his literary gumbo with blather about \\"psychohistory,\\" a mathematically-based fortune telling system which yielded valid results when the human population achieved the vast numbers only attainable in a galaxy-spanning civilization.Campbell bought the first story. The fans--at the time, a demographic aged 12-25 and virtually all-male--loved it. Campbell ordered more stories. The Trantorian Empire fell, but slowly and reluctantly. The fans loved it. The Empire blazed up under the last great imperial general, Bel Riose. (Gibbon's Belisarius, get it?) The fans loved it. A Napoleon-like conqueror appeared to muddy up the predictions of the psychohistorians. The fans loved it. Darkness and barbarism followed the collapse of civilization across the Milky Way. And the fans loved it. On and on it went, to book, to trilogy, beyond--even to new books written by other hands long after the passing of Campbell and Asimov.The fans still love it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is not a novel, but a series of stories which had been published separately. The entire trilogy was written in nine stories which were completed in the period between 1941 and 1951. Asimov notes himself in the foreword that part of what he intended with the fourth book _Foundation's Edge_ was to have a chance to write an actual Foundation novel.I actually like the effect that the story-based approach gives, particularly considering that Foundation is meant to be covering the fall of galactic empire and the rise of a new power. Having chapters based on discrete periods, I think the reader gets a better sense of the sheer time involved in politics than any 9000 -page space opera could ever achieve.One of the things I like about Foundation and its subsequent other parts is that it isn't an action-packed adventure. There isn't high romance. It isn't really about individual heartache and success, although the role of the individual is important. It's a meditative look at both politics and the future, and a darned sharp one at that.An excellent read, even worth the time for people who don't think that they like science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Personally, I don't like &quot;classic&quot; sci-fi. It can be preachy, dated, dry, corny or just not as &quot;mature&quot; as modern science fiction. However, Asimov gives just enough characterization, not too much science and the right amount of action adventure and conceptual gems to keep your mind racing. He truly is the grand daddy of science fiction.Quirky lines like &quot;Galaxy knows!&quot; or &quot;By Seldon!&quot; evoke nostalgia for the time of space rangers and laser guns. So what if nuclear power is a thing of the past? Asimov doesn't beat you down with tecnobabble. You just know that thats the prime power source in his idea of the future. Remember, this was written in 1941. Furthermore, the writing style and dialogue don't seem dated at all. Asimov's writing is simple, clean, and doesn't get bogged down with excess ramblings. His true talent is in plotting unexpected twists and turns that make this book a pageturner.Hari Seldon created psychohistory. It is mathematics applied to the development of human society on a grand scale. Seldon's new science predicts the path of human civilization with no regard to individual actions. Religion has given us fate vs. free will. Asimov poses a perhaps even more frustrating question, what if science tells us that one man's will cannot change the path of history?You're not going to get soliquoys droning on and on about a lost love or a crumbled courage; But what you do get is a brilliant collection of short stories Asimov wrote separately that later were compiled as one novel.The four(?) stories are brief yet cohesive glimpses into the developing stages of the Foundation's rise amidst the decay of the Imperial Empire. Each character driven event propels the Foundation through its first stages of development: political autonomy, technology protected by religion, and economy. I think Asimov did a great job in breathing life into these characters. After I finished the book, I remembered Hari Seldon's mystic wisdom, Salvor Hardin's determination and Hober Mallow's money hungry practicality and what remains is an overwhelming sense of awe and satisfaction. You will get that too."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation trilogy is really a rebinding of stories published serially in Astounding Magazine, so each part really stands on its own, making only passing references to previous stories and explaining anything necessary to the current plot.Asimov's writing is rather dialog-heavy, and evolves slowly enough that I couldn't get past the first book when I read it the first time (in high school). Coming back to it years later, I've really enjoyed these three volumes, and am looking forward to reading the extension novels by Greg Bear and David Brin, two of my favorite authors (and the reason I picked up Foundation again). It's not as slow as Lord of the Rings (also worthwhile for those with patience).The story is very interesting, and lets you into the psyche of the characters only through their words and actions, so your understanding of them builds slowly through your reading.I definitely recommend Foundation. I also read Bujold's &quot;Warrior's Apprentice&quot; recently, which I find to be similar in style, and I recommend that as well."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the second volume published of Asimov's classic Foundation series (originally published as two novellas in 1945). Part I is titled &quot;The General.&quot; A military leader in the Old Empire sees the Foundation as a threat (about forty years after the end of the events described in &quot;Foundation&quot;). He gets permission from the emperor to wage a campaign. The Foundation must find a way to stop him. Fortunately, the mathematics of Hari Seldon has already considered a course of action. In Part II, called &quot;The Mule,&quot; a mutant with unparalleled power (power never considered in Hari Seldon's psychohistory; he can control the emotions and commitments of others) fights and defeats the Foundation about 300 years after the start of the novel &quot;Foundation.&quot; But, now the Mule has to go in search of the Second Foundation which is made up of psychologists and psychohistorians (the First Foundation had been set up primarily with physical scientists). When &quot;The Mule&quot; appeared in magazine format in 1945, it wowed the readership. With these stories, the series really began developing a following. I am in my 50s and have read the books a couple of times. But, my father has read them ten times!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov's classic series has a quaint, nave simplicity about it that never fails to entrance this reader. For all its episodic construction (unavoidable, considering the unparalleled scope) and its rather flat, exclusively male characters, the Foundation Trilogy takes readers back to a time when America was making the world safe for democracy, personal freedoms were a given, and science seemed to be the salvation of a fallible humanity.The first volume, Foundation, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to mold a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. After the introduction, whose final paragraphs subtly lay out the whole structure without our knowing it, we get to see the Plan in action as the Foundation faces a series of political and military crises. Because the scientist/hero is long dead before the second chapter, the heroes are the political and economic, rather than scientific, leaders who must resist the temptation to take direct military action, and instead allow events to proceed until Seldon's Plan points out the answer. The magic of this book is the exquisite means the Foundation uses to defeat its enemies without resorting to force, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make these solutions seem inevitable. As such, each chapter is like a sociopolitical puzzle that challenges the reader to find the move that will defuse each situation, and taken together these stories comprise a virtual primer in diplomacy.Countless millions of fans have enjoyed Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, consisting of Foundation, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. Other Foundation novels, written by the master in his later years, lack the simple charm that makes these earlier works so popular. They were tacked on solely because the power of those first three created a demand that Asimov felt obligated to try to fill, but they have an entirely different feel, and don't possess that single-minded surety of artistic vision that marked the original series.This book is about political maneuvering, not action, so it may not be a favorite of action/adventure fans, although the next book in the series, Foundation and Empire, is a little more dynamic, and reading the complete Trilogy is a must, since the first two volumes don't so much end as just leave off. Still, the vast historical vision begun in this book is so sweeping, it should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Many consider Foundation a Sci-Fi classic, while others concider it a poorly written, boring piece of something I really shouldn't mention by name.I personally fall within the first category, I liked this book a lot. But although I myself loved this novel and its sequels, I do can imagine why other people simply hated it.Those who don't like it usally refer to the fact that there is virtually no character development, no action of any kind whatsoever, and that the technology used seems outright \\"retro\\" (nuclear trashcans and the like).All of this critism is undoutably true. Since this book is actually a collection of a series of short stories, and all of those are about different eras in the history of the Foundation, Asimov has to replace most of his characters every 50 to 100 pages which leaves room nor reason for descent characters.And since the story focusses promary on events in the future \\"history\\" of mankind and the reasons they take place, most of what happens is people talking to other people, with only small references to battles, wars, and sofort.Finally, lest not forget that these stories were written when the last century was only halfway over. Nuclear trashcans, atomic guns, and typwriter-isch computers were perfectly plausable back then.The point I am trying to make with this review is that this book is about a subject that simply isn't everybody's cup of tea. Foundation is nowhere near as accessible as Sci-Fi series such as Star Wars, Star Trek, or Babylon 5 (all good series in their own right). Or even like the more famous classic Sci-Fi novels such as \\"2001: a Space Oddessy\\", \\"1984\\", or \\"Dune\\".If you like juggling with logic and stories of people trying to make sense of their situations, then you're probably going to liove it.However, if you're more into character development, scientific discovery, or action, I wouldn'd recommend reading this novel. You'll probaly just get bored to tears."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a landmark in science fiction, and epitomizes the best of what Isaac Asimov stood for. This book proves that you don't have to have a lot of sex and mindless violence (\\"-the last refuge of the incompetent\\") to make a book suspenseful and a page-turner. The book is entirely without action and romance in the normal sense, and consists almost entirely of dialogue. What makes it so interesting is the ideas (and reversals of ideas) that it presents, in all their aspects, subsequently debates, and solves. It has an aura of almost detective story fascination with regards to political ideas. What is interesting is that the book takes a pacifistic approach to politics, and thereby forces itself to present a plausible solution to occurring problems (say, rebellion, anarchy, and war) without degrading into violence. Each self-contained story (the book is not a novel, but a collection of stories that were originally published stand-alone) is therefore a sort of logic puzzle (much the same, in principle, as Isaac's Robot stories) that you must delve into and accede all its ramifications, and come out with an answer that will work, without using violence. It's a credit to Asimov that he could not only achieve this, but make it interesting, and, indeed, arresting. This is an essential science fiction read, and perhaps Asimov's apex."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I had read a great deal of Arthur C. Clarke, Peter F. Hamilton and H.G. Wells before finally coming upon Issac Asimov.I really hadn't heard of him until a friend of mine recommended him to me. I was looking for a new author to read after coming off 4,000+ pages of Peter F. Hamilton, and decided to try something different.In the beginning, I was a little worried that since the books were written in the early 50s that they would be technologically dated and not have the technological appeal that newer scifi books had.I was TOTALLY wrong. The concepts that Asimov illustrates in his writting are still used today, and were probably their original origin.Asimov's writing style does take a little getting used to, however, but in the end, I appreicated it more than hated it. It's so different that it seems to give the characters an entirely different feel. With long, descriptive, deep dialoge and a very schemish design, you don't really fully understand the ENTIRE story until the end, when it finally clicks in one of the character's heads what is really going on, after meeting the supposed opponent and hearing his side of things.I think, in the end, the best part is how you can really see the evolution of the Foundation right before your eyes, and see how things happen and how some little thing that happened a hundred years ago set off some other thing that was HUGE in the present in the story.If you do not read Asimov's Foundation series, you cannot call yourself a scifi buff, remember that, always. Now GO and read!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read this book maybe 20 years ago, when I was more accustomed to 'action' sci-fi replete with ray guns and space ships and trying to guess how such technology shaped society (a la Larry Niven, to name one). This book is more like an historical novel, or a future history, like reading Gibbons or Kennedy. What is particularly astounding about this work, which he first published in 1951 at age 31, is Asimov's ability to scale- from the drama of a handful of individuals to the seminal events of the last decades of the ancient, galaxy-wide empire (which does not even remember its Earthly origin!). Unlike Heinlein's _Citizen of the Galaxy_ or _Friday_ (or many others) we do not follow the story of a single person or family in the backdrop of a civilization, but rather, the original Foundation trilogy makes both the individuals as well as the whole history of the galactic empire come alive in an extremely concise work. Here, the context is just as important as the characters, a scaling rarely seen elsewhere. This is the book's greatest strength- which becomes one of its weaknesses: To be sure, and Asimov himself admitted as much about sci-fi in general, the characterizations are not terribly deep. Much time, he has written elsewhere, is required to build the context of the worlds that sci-fi writers create, with little time left to build characters to any depth. But we are watching the fall of worlds, so the relatively shallow characters may be overlooked.A must read among the classics of sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In a preface written in 1982 for a volume collecting the original \\"Foundation\\" trilogy, Asimov recalled the sources of inspiration for the series and boasted, \\"Why shouldn't I write of the Galactic Empire and of the return of feudalism. . . ? After all, I had read Gibbon's 'Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire' not once, but twice.\\"Edward Gibbon's influence is certainly obvious in \\"Foundation.\\" A galactic empire, centered in Trantor (a celestial Rome), is on the verge of collapse. During the Dark Ages that follow, the surviving remnants at the extreme borders of the galaxy initially maintain control by creating a religion that hides scientific knowledge behind theological mysteries and by training a caste of priests to monopolize this learning. Asimov, however, goes beyond the period covered by Gibbon (who ended his masterwork with the age of the Crusades): when new and powerful rulers challenge the priestly authority, an upstart mercantile class--the Medicis and Borgias of the galactic future--gain the upper hand.Yet \\"Foundation\\" is hardly a history lesson; Asimov simply channeled his understanding of medieval and Renaissance Europe into a series of intriguing stories, what might instead be described as \\"psychohistorical\\" and sociopolitical thrillers. In the opening chapter, during the dying days of the Empire, Hari Seldon studies \\"psychohistory\\"--a kind of societal (but not individual) determinism based loosely on the idea that broad historical trends are cyclical and predictable. Aware that he cannot prevent the fall of the Empire, Seldon uses his learning to chart a course for the preservation of knowledge and an accelerated re-creation of a Second Empire. (Asimov had no way of knowing, of course, that psychohistory would later become a legitimate field of academic research by such scholars as Peter Gay.)Each of the five episodes in the book reads like a tautly played game of political chess in which the winner is inevitably the visionary who is not wedded to traditional moves and who is patient enough to wait for his opponent to make the first mistake. The suspense is developed almost exclusively from the \\"cold war\\" tension between rival forces: there's not much action in \\"Foundation,\\" and (as other readers have noted), the lengthy dialogue is spotty and the \\"character development\\" is pretty much nonexistent (although the same could surely be said about such sci-fi classics as \\"2001\\" and \\"The Time Machine\\"). But if you like your science fiction a tad cerebral, you'll find much to admire in Asimov's first major work."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov's Golden Age classic Foundation Trilogy is one of the early milestones of the science fiction genre. This second installment is less episodic than the first volume, focusing on just two specific stories. The first volume, &quot;Foundation&quot;, sets up the whole idea of the Seldon Plan, a mathematically based view of sociopolitical forces that enables one brilliant scientist to grow a new galactic empire from a foundation of one hundred thousand scientists and their families. &quot;Empire&quot; starts off in the same vein, showing how the Foundation staves off annihilation at the hands of the currently decaying, but still dangerous Galactic Empire. Once again, the magic of this section is the subtle means by which the Foundation overcomes impossible odds, and the convincing arguments Asimov uses to make the solution seem inevitable. Part Two involves an internal struggle between the Foundation's authoritarian central government and the Independent Traders who spread that government's economic power. While the Foundation is threatened with civil war, the rise of a new warlord on Kalgan poses a danger to the entire human race.Because each story is substantially longer than those in Foundation, this volume focuses more on individual characters. In fact, it is not too much to say that a major theme is the historical question, \\"Do individuals matter?\\" As a result, the characters are developed slightly more, and there's even a wistful love triangle, and considerably more action than was featured in the first volume, which tended to be distant and impersonal. If you liked Foundation, you'll surely enjoy this and the climax to the series, Second Foundation.Although these books will strike many as hopelessly dated, Asimov's sweeping historical vision should not be missed by any fans of speculative fiction. They have a directness and honest charm about them that is rare in contemporary science fiction. Later additions to this series, both sequels and prequels, don't adhere to the tone of these original novels, and really add very little except bulk."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"If you have the patience to read the first 100 pages you'll not be able to put this book aside.The first time I read this book I was 14. I've probably read it a dozen times by now. The plot is extremely good. The outcomes of every event (since the group leaves Trantor) are surprising, the way the main heroes solve the problems are exciting and satisfying (to me at least). The good amount of dialogues keeps the book from becoming boring and overly descriptive.Asimov's imagination is as yet unsurpassed!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The classic Foundation trilogy continues on pace in this second installment. The first half of this book is rather flat with uninspiring political wrangles and a story of the Empire's last general who is defeated by the Foundation and is never mentioned again. This episode has little effect on the overall flow of the story and is a curious piece of filler in this otherwise strong trilogy. However, the second half of this book, taking place many decades later, more than makes up for it. Here we learn that Hari Seldon's once flawless predictions on the course of humanity throughout the galaxy are starting to break down, because of the passage of huge amounts of time and the introduction of an unforeseen variable. This variable is a mutant known as The Mule, who has strange mental powers that are outside the realm of Seldon's psychohistory and throw his ancient predictions out of whack. Soon both the Foundation and the Empire are in ruins, and barbarism reigns throughout the galaxy. Only the mysterious Second Foundation, which has not been heard from since Seldon's day, can possibly help. Whether or not the Second Foundation can save the galaxy from the dark ages, and whether this is all really a part of Seldon's plan after all, are questions that arise in this book but are not answered. Thus we have an excellent intellectual cliffhanger that gives a great reason to continue to the third installment of the trilogy.There are two strange occurrences in this book that speak volumes on the time period in which Asimov wrote it, that being the 1940's. First, there is a prominent female character in this book, which was nearly unheard of in the sci-fi of that area. Furthermore, Asimov writes as if this is an amazing occurrence, and other characters are shocked and uncomfortable with this woman's status as an \\"equal\\" among the male characters around her. This sure seems strange today. Was Asimov slyly commenting on the state of women's rights back in mid-century, or did he think he was making a grand statement about the future? Either way, the sentiment is oddly outdated and even more oddly takes place in the distant future of humanity, where I would hope things would have progressed. Finally, in the second-to-last line of the book, Asimov inserts a rather sick dirty joke through the use of a sly double entendre (the key word is \\"mule\\").. Back in 1952 Asimov probably thought he was making a goofy in-joke to his learned friends that would not be caught by the general public. If that's the case, the joke in question seems extremely silly and predictable today, and brings the book to a close that is rather difficult to take seriously."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Normally I need lots of action and suspense to keep me interested in a book. This book had some level of suspense (not like Koontz's, The Watcher) but focused more on the growth of the main character. Very intriguing plot that had me wondering what was going to happen next. I liked it enough to read the next two books in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I had read Foundation when I was in High School and I decided to revisit the book later. Last summer I revisited the book and by the end of the summer I had read all of the books in the series. Asimov had combined 3 series into one leading to 15(?) books. I can't remember how many I read. I even checked out the Foundation books written by &quot;the Killer B's.&quot; Read this book. It is a pillar of Sci-fi as is his &quot;I, Robot.&quot; There is a reason that these books were in contention with Tolkien for the Sci-fi series of the century. Foundation is a wonderful starting point for an engaging series.If you decide to read the &quot;series.&quot; Understand that he took 3 different series, his robot series, foundation series, and the empire series and combined them to create a vision of future history. Few authors have tried to create a series in such a grand scale and Asimov is the master of grand scale. Only the empire series (which is currently out of print) feels outdated. Yet, all parts must be read to truly enjoy the second foundation trilogy.If you want to get your feet wet with Asimov, start here or with his &quot;I, Robot.&quot;"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Besides his Robot stories and novels, Foundation stands as oneof the greatest science fiction novel written by the late IsaacAsimov.By mixing properly the future, humanity and the sociopoliticaldevelopment of our race on a galactic span using the decline ofthe Roman Empire as a base, Asimov tells us a story of one man'sstruggle and the product of its stubborness in following stories.This book is a must for anyone, genre fan or not, I guaranteeyou will read it more than once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation series is Sci-Fi's grandest and most accessible epic. Asimov's writing style focuses on the story, not the jargon, so you never get bogged down. The hero is Hari Seldon, who is able to scientifically predict the future (don't ask how), and he knows that the vast Galactic Empire is soon headed for the dustbin of history...Hari, the prophet that he is, endeavors to shorten the time before another Galactic Empire can restore civilization to 1,000 years instead of 10,000 or 20,000...surely a worthy goal. This book will amaze you, will excite you and have you wanting more. It's fun and thoughtful at the same time...And, IMHO, these books get even better later on in the series.This book, which is later linked to the Robots series, may also be one of the most influential sci-fi books ever. (The galactic empire of Dune shares a lot of similarities)...Great stuff from the Grandmaster!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov captivates the reader in this book, the &quot;unofficial&quot; start to the Foundation series. The story revolves around 3 major characters, Hari Seldon, a famous psychohistorian and predictor of the Empire's demise, Salvor Hardin, mayor of Terminus, home planet of the foundation, and Hober Mallow, a Master Trader who rises through the ranks. I found the 3 separate yet interweaving storylines appealing, much like The Martian Chronicles by Ray Bradbury but not nearly as divided. Each character has their own opinion in how to accomplish a goal and presents each in a logical and realistic way. The thing that's amazing about the Foundation is that it doesn't have to rely on epic battles, hyperdetailed sensory imagery, or ridiculously long monologues by static, stereotypical characters. The characters are real, they get afraid, they make mistakes, and they change throughout the story. The writting is paced just perfectly so that it doesn't tire you out yet it provides enough details about any given situation. Asimov is a literary genius and I can't recommend the whole Foundation series enough to anyone who just has a little free time on their hands. And remember, &quot;Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent&quot; - Salvor Hardin"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A GALACTIC EMPIRE IS PREDICTED TO LIE IN RUINS IN THE FUTURE BY THE GREAT PSYCHOHISTORIAN- HARI SELDON.the commission of public safety approves of the seldon plan to minimise the worst of what was to come. two foundations are set up at opposite ends of the galaxy.the first guards the secrets of psychohistory -of this planet nothing could be told. the second -TERMINUS- is the pawn in the master plan of hari seldon. the inhabitants of TERMINUS are busy writing the encyclopaedia galactica.and going on with their lives. in the 50th year of the landing of humans on the planet, the first crises is faced...the first SELDON CRISES. this is when the high &amp; mighty of planet terminus sees seldon appear in the time capsule. other crisises follow and they are dealt with great diplomacy. this story is the story of a disintegrating galactic empire,and that of a lone planet on the outet rims of the galaxy trying to survive in a hostile world of barbaric planets with dictators as the rulers.it is the story of a planet inhabited by the best brains in the galaxy and how they emerge as diplomats from their original occupations of scientists and scholers. asimov is brilliant in sketching the slow but steady evolution of a world of scientists into a world of future rulers. though the jump between great lengths of time makes us feel as if we've experienced a jump through hyper space. a good book to lay one's hands on, if one likes to zoom into the future. a book for all, no doubt asimov's foundation is the perfect start for the following books of the foundation saga. happy reading."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is one of the best SF novels by one of the best SF wrters.

Reading this as a stand alone would be a bit like reading Tolkien's two towers without having started at the beginning of the series.

I can't remember any other book that i've ever read that covers such a large time span in the way that this book does.

Originally published as two novellas, Foundation and Empire the novel is made up of \\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule\\".In \\"The General\\", as the Galactic Empire crumbles, General Bel Riose launches an attack on the Foundation. Although the Foundation is theoretically stronger than the Empire, General Bel Riose has access to greater resources and personnel and so his attack does begin to threaten the Foundation. A Foundation citizen named Devers intercepts a communication that details the General's double dealings and attempts to escape to Trantor so that he can show the communication to the Emperor and hopefully stop the attack.\\"The Mule\\" is set roughly one hundred years after \\"The General\\". The Empire has crumbled, Trantor has been sacked by invaders, and most of the galaxy has split into barbaric factions. Due to its extensive trading routes, the Foundation is now the major power in the galaxy. Until, that is, a new threat arises in the form of a growing army of barbarians led by a mysterious individual known as the Mule. Once it is discovered that Hari Seldon has failed to predict the existence of the Mule, Foundation citizens Toran and Bayta Darell, along with psychologist Ebling Mis and a refugee clown named Magnifico Giganticus, travel the galaxy attempting to locate the Second Foundation that had been established by Seldon.Although a much darker and more intense book, Foundation and Empire is an excellent follow up to Foundation. Asimov's writing is excellent as ever, with his descriptions of the alien worlds and his characterisations being particularly strong. The whole Foundation series is fantastic and Foundation and Empire is further proof that Isaac Asimov is one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation, a collection of five short stories, is the first book in Isaac Asimov's epic century-spanning science fiction masterwork known as the Foundation Series.The first of the collected stories, \\"The Psychohistorians\\", takes place on Trantor, the capital planet of the 12000 year old Galactic Empire. Mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new science known as psychohistory which equates are possibilities in large societies to mathematics, allowing him to predict long-term outcomes. Using his psychohistory, Seldon discovers that the Galactic Empire is decaying and that it will collapse within 500 years, the collapse being followed by a 300000 year period of barbarism in the galaxy. When his findings are declared to be high treason, Seldon and a group of hand-picked scientists agree to go into exile on the planet Terminus, where they intend to create a mammoth Encyclopaedia Galactica as the repository for all human learning. In this way they hope to limit the period of chaos that will inevitably follow the collapse of the Empire.In \\"The Encyclopaedists\\", having progressed 50 years into the future, the planet Terminus is facing its first Seldon Crisis. The Foundation on Terminus is caught in the middle of a power struggle between four neighbouring planetary systems and the scientists are ill-equipped to deal with military matters. Luckily, Mayor Salvor Hardin is quick to realise the danger and attempts to work out a solution. Hardin receives guidance as to the way forward for the Foundation from an image of the now deceased Hari Seldon that appears in a specially created Time Vault and confirms that psychohistory has predicted a series of crises that will occur on Terminus.\\"The Mayors\\" takes place 30 years later when the Foundation has used its scientific knowledge as the basis for a pseudo religion that keeps neighbouring planets in order. However, the Prince Regent of Anacreon seeks to overthrow the Foundation and so Salvor Hardin is once again called upon to avert a Seldon Crisis.In \\"The Traders\\" another 55 years have passed and a trader by the name of Limmar Ponyets is sent to the planet Askone to retrieve a fellow trader who is facing execution. The leaders of Askone are determined to avoid contact with, and contamination by, Foundation technology so Ponyets must employ devious methods to secure the release of his colleague.The final story is \\"The Merchant Princes\\". The Foundation has expanded and grown powerful through the use of its science religion and economics but three Foundation vessels have recently disappeared in the vicinity of Korell, a civilisation trying to develop their own variety of technical superiority. Trader Hober Mallow is sent to uncover information on their technology and hopefully find the missing ships.Foundation is clearly an epic undertaking, especially since anyone who reads this first book is pretty much guaranteed to want to progress on to the further books in the series, but it is well worth the effort. The Foundation Series is perhaps more esoteric that Asimov's Robot Series but is still a rewarding read. The characters, planets and indeed empires that Asimov has created are truly immense and his storytelling ability is outstanding. Foundation is a fantastic book by one of the greatest science fiction writers of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I hadn't read this since I was a teenager. I had forgotten what an excellent writer and fantastic mind Isaac Asimov was. It was refreshing to see character and idea development that kept my interest and actually made me think. Read this and enjoy all Asimov was to the Science Fiction genre."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov is an exception author in any genre, he just happens to write in science fiction. His Foundation novels are at the apex of classic science fiction. If you are going to read only one book in this genre then this is the one to choose.

It had an excellent plot, I was almost always on the edge of my seat when reading. Some moments in the book strike you as pure guniess, the way the characters got out of a tight situation.

It needed a date as to when you were, and not having to pick it up from conversations."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The &quot;Foundation&quot; is one of the best book I have ever read (and I've read a lot of science fiction books).

And each time I read them, I only enjoy them more and more. But what would really make my millenium (can't forget to interject a Y2K joke...) would be to see at least the first Foundation book made into a feature length movie or at least a direct-to-video production. So, if you're a film-maker that's reading this, why not consider it? You'd make a killing at the box office, that's for sure."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Totally gripping and involving. Very imaginative and successful fantasy/mystery."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I am a teenager, but I read books that are for more advanced readers. Once I picked up Asimov's &quot;Foundation&quot;, I could not put it down. To write a book of such imagination and complexity, and yet to capture the mind of the reader as it did mine, is and extraordinary feat. Asimov is a brilliant writer. I have now begun reding the fourth installement of the series, titled &quot;Foundation's Edge&quot;. He has been able to keep the same level of intensity throughout the entire series, and is still able to keep the reader guessing. Asomov is truly a mastermind. Worthy of comparison with &quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;.Surely, one, if not the greatest book of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I think that the first three books of the Foundation series (\\"Foundation\\", \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\") are excellent.

For me, it's a matter of seeing where the genre has come from and where it's going. \\"Foundation\\" was a quick, worthwhile read which, much like Tolkein, helped define a genre. After reading, I see why Asimov is still relevant today. His stories don't age because the lessons can still be applied to modern empires and the struggles they face.**Spoiler Alert** Do not read below here if you don't want details of the story.\\"Foundation\\" certainly didn't disappoint. At first, I thought it was a little odd that the sections of the book were so far apart in time, but as I kept reading, it began to make sense. Asimov wasn't trying to tell a story about specific characters as we're used to thinking of them (i.e., individual people), rather, he was aiming to tell the story of a civilization. As I read, it began to make perfect sense. His premise is that the actions of humans as a race can be predicted on a large scale. In order to get that across, the story had to be told using large scale and long time periods. Whether Asmiov was thinking of this or not, I can't say. But it works."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This was probably my fourth reading of the book and what can I say? I highly recommend it.My brief review is this. The book is a lot of fun to read, has some excellent characters, and a very intriguing plot. For a little more detail continue reading.I'll start with three specific observations.FIRSTGeorge Lucas was impregnated by the Foundation prior to the birth of Star Wars.Let's check off some parallels. Decadent empire in decline? Check. Deep space religion? Check. Traders/smugglers with a wild-west attitude? Check. Central planet is entirely one city? Check.If you are a Star Wars fan and have NOT read this book these little hints alone should be reason for you to check it out.I'm not discrediting GL for his development of Star Wars, simply identifying a primary source of his inspiration.SECONDThese short stories which became this novel were originally written in the 40's. Given that the stories are written before the computer age it's really easy to forgive what technologies he didn't anticipate and appreciate the development of his futuristic world and its own technology.However, it is interesting to note that the technological innovations of the Foundation anticipate to some degree the technological phenomenon we see everywhere in that devices get smaller and smaller but more and more powerful. The main difference is that the Foundation's limited resource was metal while our real world limitations are more related to energy.THIRDThe scary point? That even in decline certain civilizations can produce their most advanced achievements. These achievements are however quickly lost as the downward impetus of that civilization is too great to escape its destiny with implosion.Yikes!I think I'll end with that. Have a nice day!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I love classic sci-fi, in all it's wondrous unbelievability. I like stories where humans go to venus and find rainforests and go to mars and establish colonies and can breathe for no reason at all. It's way off science fact. but it's awesome. There's a nostalgic feeling to it that makes me feel comfortable and happy.I've never read anything by Asimov before, so i thought i'd start with his multi-part epic classic. The Foundation series takes place in the far, far distant future when humanity has spread itself across the entire galaxy. They live in a political empire, quadrillions of people on billions of planets unified for millenia under one system, advanced, strong and stable. Enter Hari Seldon, a psychohistorian (aka a mathematician who can use advanced formulas and sociology to predict the future with absolute certainty). Seldon predicts the demise of the Empire and a period of chaos, a new dark age, that will last for 30,000 years, unless he takes direct action to preserve all of human knowledge and make subtle changes to reduce those 30,000 years of disunity to a mere 1,000. I know. A 1,000 year long story. Epic. Seldon is tried for treason and disruption of the peace of the empire, but convinces the leadership of his theories and sets up the Foundation, responsible for the construction of an encyclopedia galactica to preserve all human knowledge on the rim of the galaxy, away from the turmoil about to unfold.From this introduction, Asimov proceeds to tell his story in almost like an anthology format. We see major figures and major events from each generation and how the members of the Foundation deal with crises that lead them to the forging of a new empire, conquering the darkness, chaos and barbarism that spreads across the galaxy in the wake of the fall of the first empire. There are wonderful themes explored from fate, predestination, individuality, change, and religion. This last is probably the most powerful for me. In the wake of the collapse of civilized society and it's technological wonders, the Foundation finds itself the only group of humans with advanced technology (mainly nuclear power). The other bands of humans whose tech has fallen into disrepair looks upon this advanced technology and science as magic, and the Foundation is quick to seize upon this and make a new religion out of the science, teaching \\"priests\\" how to repair and use the technology to further their own power and domination in the galaxy. An interesting concept.Asimov is a brilliant sociologist and finds interesting ways to resolve immense political and economic crises. The series is well thought out and brilliantly executed. So why four stars? Well, the scope of the story is so large that there are innumerable characters to keep track of and develop. Asimov does a fantastic job at that, but I never really identify with anyone, and just when I start liking someone, they die and we move on to the next generation. This is more of a personal quibble than anything serious. Asimov forsees a great many modern technologies from the early 50s including video conferencing, the internet, and miniaturization of a lot of the gadgets available in the 50s, a trend we see continuing today. Looking forward to the second book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov was one of the founding fathers of Sci-fi and to him we owe a debt of gratitude for making the genre worthy of the literary title. His messages and considerations give the reader a lot more than just something to kill time. It makes sci-fi an avenue to real soul searching."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I buy a few and the others are missing. Why? Is Prelude to Foundation an &#34;obscure&#34; book? This is absurd."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second book in the Foundation series and by far the strongest of the three, and my personal favorite.The book is divided into two parts giving the characters ample time to develop (compared to the first) and the story itself will grip you and never let go. It will very easily keep you on the edge wanting more and the final conclusion will leave you wide eyed. Both parts of the book, especially the second, create some incredibly strong and memorable characters that will immerse you so completely in the universe you'll not want it to end. Asimov created a master piece with the Foundation series and this second book is the staple that holds it together."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation series portrays a tremendous sweep of future history. Published in 1951, Foundation is the first book of this series (however, Asimov would later write prequels to Foundation). Set many thousands of years into the future, this book opens with a description of psychohistory and its founder Hari Seldon. Psychohistory is a branch of mathematics which deals with the reactions of human conglomerates to fixed social and economic stimuli. Mathematician Hari Seldon predicts a series of crises which will impact the Galactic Empire. Wanting to preserve knowledge Seldon sets up a foundation staffed with scholars and scientists.As Asimov wrote Foundation he was influenced by Edward Gibbon's multi-volume work History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire. In fact, Asimov read Gibbon's book not once, but twice! It may be inferred that the emergence of Christianity during Roman times and the emergence of a new religion in Foundation are parallel events. What struck me about this book is that it is primarily composed of dialogue. I also found it interesting that Asimov has newspapers and tobacco still in existence so far into the future. I did like this book and I look forward to reading additional volumes in this epic science fiction series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Notetably one of the finest chapters in the Foundation series...the \\"original triology\\" is still the best."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read this book after coming blind to the foundation books - I've never read Asimov in a novel before. I've noted how Asimov, when writing the books, was very much a part of his time. When a character doesn't smoke, it is a character trait to point out where everyone else smokes by course. Also, sexism is taken for granted, and when a female character assumes to be treated with equal rights it is a place for comment. I had hoped that we would have found better ways to get high and allowed more equality that far into the future, but I suppose smoke 'em if you got 'em.Anyways, I like this book better than the previous one because there are characters that you can root for and unexpected jerks in the plot-line and a more linear narrative based on the fact that a lot of the exposition is out of the way from the first book. I now cannot wait for the finale of the original series and debate weather to read the other three ancillary books that Asimov wrote later."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first book I read by the author Asimov. I know there are many more famous books from him like the Robots collections and Foundation. I picked this one for the first book simply because this is the first entry to the Foundation series, on a chronological sense. I must say surprisingly, this is a very easy-to-read (compare to Dune, Lord of the Ring, etc), but exciting, and full-of-surprises book. At times, it also gives us thoughful issues (e.g. can we 'predict' the future?), which is what we are anticipating from a sci-fi. I know from many many readers that Foundation is the best among all the volumes, but I can imagine that this is already an enjoyable read, I cannot imagine how exciting the Foundation book will be. It also thrills me to read all other series (Robot, Empire, etc) so as to get a full understanding of the history under Asimov's reign. I recommend this one to everyone who has never touch Asimov's work before."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"As well as a trilogy that is as far-reaching as it is set in a far-distant time with characters and galactic backdrop unrivaled by any other book.

Things were going smoothly until the periodic prediction (when Seldon appears holographically) was obviously wrong.The cause is the Mule, a mutant of incredible mental powers who no one has ever seen. The introduction of this character was one of the best plot devices used in a long time and it gave the fledging story a much-needed boost. Who is this mutant and why does he do the things he does?

The goal of the group is to rebuild the Empire after its inevitable fall. The characters are actiive, and the plot is always moving, never letting the reader go for a second.

Hari uses mathmatics to reset the prediction so only to allow for a millenium of darkness if a programme he sets up is followed to rule.Banished to the Foundation planet he sets off a type of timetabled holographic calender that would guide the remains of humanity through a thousand years of darkness. However as we know you can't predict the future and eventually things start to go wrong. A new character arrives to totally disrupt everything he has planed out for the future, The Mule.Humans are so unpredictable."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Unlike the first Foundation book, which was a series of related but not inter-connected stories, Foundation and Empire has two longer stories. This lets Asimov flesh out the stories more, adding detail and plot intricacies. The first story, The Big and The Little, is not one of the series' strongest. However, the second story, The Mule, is the masterpiece of the series. It tells of a muntant, The Mule, who falls outside the scope of Hari Seldon's psychohistory as one supremely powerful individual. The story is told in almost detective story fashion similar to the first two Robot novels. It's quite as suspenseful and involving as Asimov at his best and one of his utmost classics. There's quite a lot of plot tangling and twists, and the ending is a shocker. It's not quite a cliffhanger but will definitely make you want to read the next book, which is great also. The whole series comes highly recommended."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"There's so much to be said for Foundation. We start out with the psychohistorians with their leader Hari Seldon who has predicted a 10,000 year Empire is about to crash to its knees and herald in a new Dark Ages. Hari can't stop the Dark Ages but he can shorten it.Interestingly he creates a priest class that runs the \\"nucleonics\\" of the Foundation, its erstwhile goal of creating an Encyclopedia Galactica set aside by stemming the tide of losing technology.You see, the Empire is losing its grip on the other sectors of the galaxy. More and more are dividing and becoming their own little kingdoms. The book centers around several characters who, through inside and cleverness, make things happen to keep the Foundation and create an insidious society that keeps it going.Asimov as an author, I have always been impressed with. His ability to create and predict (micro-miniaturization), parodies and criticism of religion and science, trade and technology, is throughout the book.Near the end, we find that The Foundation is set to expand. Each chapter stands on its own and can be difficult for some to follow. But each chapter expands decades, some more, and as such can be hard to keep up.Highly recommended. Not \\"hard core\\" sci-fi so much as character-driven sci-fi.Recommend:The Foundation Trilogy Boxed Set (Foundation, Second Foundation, Foundation and Empire)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The foundation novels are superb! I went on to read the entire original trilogy, the first foundation book being my favorite. The story jumps ahead by leaps and bounds between sections, which can be confusing at first but ends up making for a fantastic treat. Can't recommend this series highly enough for any SciFi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Over time, the stories are good but not the best ever. Somewhat erratic and hard to follow."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I highly recommend the time to read \\"Foundation\\"...it just may convince you to continue on with the rest of the series. I believe it was the forerunner and main idea behind the concept of a galactic empire as has been expanded on by Star Wars and Star Trek. If you would like to see the genesis of the idea behind those phenomena then you'll very much be rewarded by reading the Foundation series...besides, anything by Asimov is worth its weight in gold and this is the zenith of his space operatic writings!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I cannot recommend Foundation, and its entire series, highly enough. When it comes to worldbuilding, and examining the possibilities of earth's future, Asimov does it best. His entire basis is that intelligence, learning, and confrontation of the unknown will be our salvation, instead of ignorance or seeing who carries the biggest gun. A welcome change."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The book doesn't really need yet another enthusiastic review, so I'll keep this to the point.The stories in this book are really enjoyable. You get to learn about characters in the beginning and then spend the rest of the time reading about the legacy they created and the later events that they had a hand in shaping. I find this satisfying in a way similar to the Dune series but I didn't have to read 6 books.As with every Asimov book I've read, the plots in this book are forged and hewn into complicated machines that are disassembled before your eyes at just the right climactic moment. It makes for a hard book to put down."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation is a series of books about two Foundations at the end of the Galaxy, at the rotting fringes of the Galactic Empire. Psychohistorian Hari Seldon has predicted the fall of the Galactic Empire, and 30,000 years of barbarism that will follow. The Foundations are established at two opposite edges of the Galaxy, little settlements that contain all human knowledge. The problem is that there are certain crises that the Foundations must overcome, with as little guidence from Seldon as possible.This was the first Asimov book I've ever read, so I didn't know really what to expect. I found I loved it! It was full of interesting characters, and each novelette showed a different point of time in the Foundation, so instead of slowly going through each year in the 1000 years of barbarism, you actually get somewhere. The characters had pros and cons to them, and seemed well rounded. It also showed a change in character through time, such as characters that were once sharp become dull and characters that used to rebel fall in line. Instead of telling you all about the character on the first page, it gave a general idea and then let the story tell the characters. One part I really liked was that it had plot twists that I didn't see coming, and the plot wasn't completely transparent.In the end, this book was a very interesting sci-fi novel that kept me going, and held my interest until the end."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I realize that it is a fairly arrogant thing to think that I have something new to say about this classic work that the 335 people who reviewed it before me haven't said already, so if you are reading this, you must REALLY be interested in this series.The only reason I'm bothering is because I tend to write personal reviews with personal musings, a habit which has cost me more than a few \\"helpful\\" votes here and there.My purpose here (really) is to be a sort of compass for people, especially newer SF fans who are just learning about the genre.If you are a member of this group then you need to ask yourself a question. That question is: Are you interested in rich, well drawn characters that develop over time and make you love them? If the answer is yes, for God sake, go read something else. This is no insult to these books, they are great, but if you want character development, you really need to look elsewhere. SF in this time period in general tended to be rather, um.. what's the word... DULL, THAT'S THE WORD. Notice I didn't say bad, I said DULL. SF books of this period read more like philosophy tracts then what we would think of as novels.NOW!! With all that being said, when I first read this book in the 8th grade I thought it was the best thing since Dune (I didn't have a real sense of copyright dates so Dune came first.The reason I liked this book so much had something very much to do with my love of history and the underlying idea that you could use math (another interest of mine) to predict it. For me that was great, my fellow 8th graders thought I was In-SANE. They didn't get it, as they didn't get most things I was interested in and so I sluffed them off like the useless intellectual baggage they were.Now, at 34, I reread these books, and now I think they may have had a point. This book (and the ones after it) are just people having long political discussions as time goes by in a series of increments. Because the book is comprised of short stories that are set decades apart, you get all the grandeur and scope of a great epic with almost none of the action.To make this clear and simple, this book is about politics. There is absolutely nothing wrong with a book about politics, but if you read the description and you think this is a grand epic full of action and war and complex politics then you are going to get one out of three. If you want ALL three, I suggest that you read the original Dune series instead.It should be noted that when I was reading Foundation, the normal children were reading The Pigman and their idea of SF was William Sleator's Interstellar Pig and Jane Yolen's Dragon's Blood. These are all good books, but it just so happened that I wasn't normal and so I was reading Dune and Foundation.My point is this: your average run-of-the-mill younger reader will probably find this incredibly boring, but if you are one of the odd ones, the geeky ones, the ones who watch TV Sci-Fi and think \\"There has to be more than this,\\" you know, the kind who actually don't think that a movie being old doesn't automatically equate to a movie being BAD and/or isn't afraid of a book because it has more than 24 pages, this one just might be for you.If on the other hand, you think Star Trek or even Star Wars are the peak of SF (I did at one point) you may not be ready until you have a couple of years on you. Lucky for us the people immigrating to print SF are growing up with much more mature SF then I had on TV. Babylon 5, Firefly, Battlestar Galactica, the first season of Heroes and the British New Wave shows like Doctor Who and Torchwood, completely and especially Torchwood are ensuring that the people who change over to print SF are much more well balanced then I was at that age. I had Robotech as my big Sci-fi epic and that was IT, and anyone who is a fan of THAT show knows that blueballs is no myth, we've been waiting for the end of that story for 25 years and.. but that's a different review.These books are a cornerstone of SF because they deserve to be. That doesn't mean you'll like them, but I hope I've given you a clue as to whether you want to pick them up. I hope so, but make sure it's the right time.Good Reading.P.S. If you still aren't sure, try to get your hands on the very cool BBC adaptation of the Foundation Trilogy. It's rather spacey and is more like Doctor Who meets Foundation, but if you can deal with that, you're probably a fan :)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"You would be hardpressed to point to another of Asimov's work and name it better the Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Over a decade ago I checked this book out of the library, only to return it later having read only a couple of pages. I bought a copy the other day and was pleasantly surprised.Asimov started writing the Foundation series when he was 21 and this novel was first published in 1951. In some ways the time period in which it was written can be seen. Nuclear power is envisioned as the be-all, end-all of energy. People smoke (although the cure for cancer was apparently found, so any carcinogenic effects would be annulled) and there's talk of \\"microfilm records.\\"That said, the story was well-written and the reader can clearly imagine the events depicted as plausible. There is an overarching narrative focusing more on the grand sweep of history, but it is told in vignettes from the lives of key characters at important moments in time.\\"Foundation\\" is a clever book with a storyline that ages well."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read these books for the first time over 30 years ago.

Asimov has this clever idea that extensive control of the population requires religion, technology and the guise of freedom.In reading the introduction by Asimov he reveals the Foundation story was created after completing Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.The story is full of political intrigue and religious power-plays.Some of my highlights from the book:\\"...religion-controlled commercial empire\\"\\"Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.\\"\\"...so that we could incubate art, science, and technology, and form the nucleus of the Second Empire.\\"\\"Now any dogma primarily based on faith and emotionalism, is a dangerous weapon to use on others, since it is almost impossible to guarantee that the weapon will never be turned on the user.\\"I'm looking forward to the second and third books in the trilogy, Second Foundation and Foundation and Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I had never read any of the foundation novels and yet, considered myself a science fiction fan.

Even the smart ones do dumb things, they just do them for smart reasons."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Really an enjoyable book to read. Asimov had such a hard task in this book, introducing his readers to a large span of history. Most of the book maintained immersion, but the smoking of the characters threw me off a bit (I wish someone would go through and pull the smoking out, as well as the newspapers, and change them to something else). Many people complain about character development being non existent in this book, but character wasn't the point of this work. I have never seen another author try in under 300 pages to cover the span of time covered in Foundation. For the constriction he put himself under, the characters are developed as far as they need to be with broad strokes.For people who are critical of this work, read contemporaries of Asimov, and you will find that only he, Bradbury, Herbert, and a few others even bother to develop characters. Most Scifi doesn't even bother to develop the science enough to stand on it's own. In this case, Asimov simply developed what he knew on the time through scaling the size, and using hyperspace to solve distance problems, so it was easy to accept every premise he laid down (well except for the smoking...)The whole point of the premise is that the main characters all have an inkling that there CAN BE NO HERO for Seldon's plan to work. If at any point, someone had acted with rash heroics, his mathmatics would be rendered null, and the decay of the galaxy would last for ten millennia instead of one."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is simply way out of this scarry scarred annoying world we are forced to live in called earth, with all its stomach aches and dripping joints and footsores and boredom. But old Asimov gives you a chance to go way out of this into just plain gigantic empires and it's all so way past any human imagination it keeps you satisfied, your poor little soft skin human body satisfied, so long as you keep reading it. Asimmov knows really how to keep you out of it all as long as your nose in his pages. But what is too much a puzzle I just don't get is how so many people want to take a good fanstasy like his and say he is actually realistic, this is the world we are going to make ourselves in a few hundred years or even sooner. But these people are totally missing the point, I don't care even if Asimov himself wanted to make all this Foundation real oine day or hoped people would, beause then if we are actually living in this sort of Foundation Empire then, if you think about it, we'll all actually just be back in boring old scratchy reality again that always feels sort of uncomfortable like velcro. They just don't get how the whole genre is called \\"science fiction and FANTASY.\\" The two halfs go together like the inside and outside of your face. Keep reality out. Hooray for unreality and yummy unreality like this one."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Breathes there a teenager of the md-20th century with a love of science fiction who was not weaned on the Foundation series? All that sweeping drama, testosterone-laden but basically non-violent (all the violence is simply swept into summarizing references to ships destroyed and cities ransacked) marching through decades without concentrating on anything really boring, like character development, emotional entanglements or the trappings of society. Not a single reference to such trash as classical music, or stage shows, or pop music, or romance, just sweeping views of a distant future (or could it have been the distant past?) with the means of traveling between stars in the galaxy in the flash of a gnat's eyelash.And yet . . . revisiting the beloved Foundation, reading through the filter of a lifetime of experience, cracks appear in the plaster, and beneath them one finds that the lath is too widely spaced, the bricks behind that lath are often without mortar, and one can see the trees where bricks are missing. We live already in an age where technology has bypassed this particular Universe. Computers have become infinitely more pervasive than Asimov might have dreamed in his wildest fantasy, for at the time of the writing they were mere collators of stacks of punched cards, the transistor had yet to be introduced or shrunk to the size of a grain of sand, much less a sub-microscopic speck imprinted by the millions on a tiny wafer of silicon.Asimov had enormous faith in the future of Humanity, but he had no idea of how rapidly that future would approach - or how slowly humans would react and adapt to the challenges posed. No Empire can be established when information is instantaneously available to three-quarters of the population. Will an army composed of humans indefinitely repress an entire population composed of their friends, family, relatives? We see the answer in Libya, in Egypt, in Syria, in Africa - where the mobile phone has allowed guerrilla tactics to be employed by any group, whether terrorist or freedom-fighter or mall-invasion gangs or \\"mothers against the death camps of dog pounds.\\"Human society has been transformed by 24/7 information availability - but the universe of the Foundation proposes a populace of ciphers acting in ignorance of facts that would already be generally available in the 21st century. \\"Just Google it\\" or \\"look it up in Wikipedia\\" is nowhere to be found. There is a project of the First Foundation to write a \\"Galactic Encyclopedia\\" - yet it already exists in 2012.And yet that universe is immensely attractive, reduced to comic book simplicity, perfect for any adolescent (whether 14 or 74) to immerse himself - or very infrequently herself, as this universe is truly misogynist: the strongest female is just a papier mach&eacute; accoutrement.The psychobabble of \\"psychohistory\\" which is the very premise of the Foundations is wholly implausible, of course. The introduction by Asimov of \\"The Mule\\" is his admission of the absurdity of such a concept, which he probably didn't consider when the first book was written. Man has mutated more rapidly in the past 10,000 years than Asimov's populace has in 50,000 - a highly unlikely probability in the event that man actually progresses to interstellar colonization.All that said - I downloaded the trilogy on Kindle whilst in America, read it through lovingly, and was again transported to that clean, technologically impossible universe, forgetting all the travails of real life at present, putting the horrors of terrorism, the Hunger Games, the beheadings of \\"infidels\\" and the lies of politicians to one side for too brief a span. It isn't great literature, not even great Science Fiction - yet it is riveting to any adolescent male who enjoys reading as opposed to or in parallel with the escapism of cinematic action films like the \\"Matix\\" or \\"Terminator\\" trilogies.For some reason, Europeans aren't allowed to download the books. No doubt the vagaries of copyright laws, tax authorities and those %^&* politicians - as well as the accursed lawyers (who are blissfully absent from the trilogy, undoubtedly bred out of existence due to their total lack of humanity).Asimov was the supreme techie of his time - and it shows in his use of language - sparse, precise, technically impeccable, but occasionally impenetrable without a modicum of concentration.I heartily recommend it to you !"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov is incredibly easy to read. His sentences are perfectly formed, neither too long, nor too decorated, nor too sparse. He strikes the perfect balance for his type of story, driving things forward consistently through description or dialogue whenever each is appropriate.This story takes place over a rather large time period and could really be considered a collection of closely related short fiction instead of a novel. It works well that way. We're only given information on the most exciting periods of time in the Foundation's history, and we're left to fill in most of the blanks on our own.On the downside, there wasn't much time to get to know any of the characters. I, Robot follows the same two characters through several situations and you get to know something about them by the end (even if they are almost cardboard cutouts, it works). In Foundation, nobody lasts long enough to really care about.Despite that flaw, it did what any good book should do- it made me interested in continuing the story. Luckily, this is a long series. I'll have plenty of time to finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"WHY CAN'T I BUY THIS FOR MY KINDLE?????

He wrote this award-winning book at the age of 21. Foundation is one of the best books I have read to this date.Science Fiction is a broad area and can only be defined by these two words, hence the name. Asimov utilizes very realistic facts in a novel placed 15,000+ years in the future. In the year 1951 when the novel was written was just 5 years after the first computer showed its face. Yet Asimov utizlizes the common computer and calculator in many scenes in this novel.The use of nuclear power for showing superiority is also used often. This book was way ahead of its time.Anyone who enjoys science fiction or even one who just enjoys being entertained by realistic facts put into a story will enjoy this book. Foundation is also very suspenseful. Such as life-changing decisions to be made, assination attempts, spaceflight, and the exploration of new worlds in detail, the reader feels like he is in the mix of the action."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I can see why Issaac Asimov is consider the king of science fiction.

I was amazed of how much this book was mostly all dialouge usually I would of been bored if the book was mostly dialouge but the theories in this book can they be all real one day!! The thought of psychohistory should be a considered science of future and politics. Most of the books I read that are consider science fiction I feel is mostly influence by this man.

Shockingly, Foundation is hardly a classic. Its theme of history repeating itself is drilled into the readers head. However, Foundation and Empire, the second book in the trilogy, continues with these themes with better fluency and character.\\"The General\\" continues with the stories of Foundation. General Bel Riose of the old empire tries to conquer the Foundation, and Asimov, once again, reassures that Hari Seldon's plan can never go wrong. With this setup of reassurance and the death of the first empire, Asimov raises the reader's hope that the Foundation will never fall.Immediately in \\"The Mule\\" Asimov rattles his audience with the fear that the Foundation, like the empire, will fall. The Mule, a mutant with psychic powers, was not seen by Seldon's Plan. The conquest of the Foundation is unstoppable. The second part of the novel allows readers to actually know the characters. They are not just people who act, but we can see their motifs. The end of the book is supposed to have many plot twist that shock the reader, but with foreshadowing, many revelations are undermined. Bayta, one of the main characters, has a deep dread every time something happens with the Mule. This gives away the identity of the Mule.Foundation and Empire is a great read through its despair and hopelessness. It left me on the edge of my seat scrambling for the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"How can this be considered a classic? It's fun, it's entertaining, but it lacks so much qualities all classics have!The Mule was a disappointment. I knew from the beggining who he was. I found myself skimming sections of this novel because I got bored with it. When I got to page 50 I was ready to give up on the novel and put it down, but I thought this book has to be good it's consider a classsic! So I decided to read the whole novel. A classic novel is suppose to convey a message to the reader about life, the words and writing style is suppose to be superior to the average writer, and the story should stand out as one of the more creative stories. This novels main lesson about mankind is not a unique one : The idea of history being preditced by math ,science, and psychology. People will never change, civilization will always end up destroying itself. Nothing is for certain even if science says so. I have heard this all before he did not invent this idea I want to hear somthing new and original. The great writers have superior writing skills. Askimov writing skills are just average. I expect to see in a classic novel a lot of symbolism, carefully crafted prose, well thought out sentences, better play on words, and better dialog! The dialog spoken by the characters is 3rd gradish and dull. Finally the author lacks the creativity the classic writers have. I expect to see a detailed lay out of how each creation works. I like an author who invents hi-tech gizmos and then educates the reader with all the scientific details of how it works. I like to learn a little physics when I read a science fiction book. --Main point: I liked the robotic novels better. Askimov went into details of how the robots worked. His robot books were good,not classics, but much better I thought."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"...The first book (excluding PRELUDE TO FOUNDATION) in a five-book series introduces the idea of pyschohistory. Pyschohistory is simply the mathematics and variables in predicting the general future since it cannot predict an individual's. Hari Seldon, pioneer of this revolutionary science has seen into the future where chaos will INEVITIABLY exist for thirty thousand years but with the triumph with each &quot;Seldon Crises&quot; they will be able to shorten the years by a millenium. Hari Seldon must rely on the future (Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow) to provide each step in shortening the amount of years. FOUNDATION covers the first 100 years of this chaotic period following the life of Salvor Hardin and Hober Mallow, the key players in the book. Though somewhat lacking action and fast-pace suspense, it's a very good book nonetheless. Asimov is able to find clever ways to conquer each &quot;Seldon crises&quot; so ingeniously that it makes up for the lack of action. Infact, Asimov writes with a &quot;cause and effect&quot; basis. The book also ends in a way leaving the reader somewhat satisfied yet will want to read the rest of the series.I recommend this book to sci-fi fans or anyone looking for a great read, but the lack of action can bore some.

Read it again several years later, and could not understand what it was that I liked. Sure, Asimov writes with ease - and it is equally easy to read.

It's a work of genius! There are two sections of the book. The first is a seemingly typical war story of the conflict between the Galactic Empire, led by a strong emporer and a firebrand general, and the dumb-luck, mediocre leadership of the Foundation. It illustrates how, under the Seldon plan, it is virtually impossible to defeat the Foundation. The second part is just phenomenal. Word spreads of a mighty mutant, the Mule, who is conquering the galaxy with unprecedented mental powers. The Foundation is astonished when they don't beat him;the Mule is the .001% that the Seldon plan left room for and dismissed. The Foundation falls, and only a small group of hopefulls dare to go to the library of Trantor to find the Second Foundation and defeat the Mule. This book has it all;plot twists, philosophy, and colorful, memorable characters. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book has all the Asimovian trademarks: intriguing ideas marred by utterly forgettable and indeed interchangeable characters, cringe-inducing dialogue, and a plodding storytelling style and pace. Later in his career Asimov fixed these problems *somewhat*, but at this point he was very young and they are present in full force. The unfortunate truth is that this book simply doesn't deserve the praise heaped upon it; it's some kind of herd mentality that leads to so many people venerating Foundation. If you are seriously into science fiction, then by all means read the entire Foundation series: it has historical importance and there is enjoyment to be had there. But I hate to think that there are people who are introduced to science fiction by this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Let's face it: Isaac Asimov was not a very good writer, especially this early in the game. We read 'Foundation' not because we are interested in reading some fantastic literature but because the ideas in this little book became the tropes that have thrived in science fiction even to this day. If you're interested in sci-fi, 'Foundation' is a must-read.The importance of 'Foundation' in the genre may force us to allow for the blandness of its prose; however, it does not excuse it. The characters are ciphers, the style is blunt and ugly, like a sledgehammer, and there are plenty of minor but annoying infelicities of grammar. It's a good thing the novel is pleasantly short; whatever Asimov's faults, long-windedness was not one of them."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This series sets the standard for excellence. This demonstrates a master of the craft of writing. Asimov was brilliant and when he turned that intellect to writing, he created amazing works, none better than this."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"That's not saying much since I thought that \\"Foundation\\" was pretty poor.\\"Foundation and Empire\\" was pretty good, but still lacked in certainareas - mainly character development and also the first third of thebook had a very weak story line. The whole battle with the Empire bythe Foundation was very very weak, I cannot stress that enough. Maybe Iwas just hoping for an epic battle between the renegade Foundation andthe dying Empire. Nothing really happened to spur the victory of theFoundation, there wasn't even really a battle. But I guess that mightbe the point that Asimov was making since Seldon predicted the choicesand decisions of the Emperor about the passion that the characters hadfor the battle. It wasn't even a battle between the Empire, it was somemission designed and orchestrated by some general in the navy thatthought it would be a good idea to take over the Foundation.This book also lacked in strong characterizations, but not as much asthe first \\"Foundation\\" by a long shot. The last two thirds of the bookstick with the same characters the whole time. It also enters apowerful mutant, the Mule. I won't give much away about the Mule andhis plans because I don't want to spoil the book but it sets up for thesequel, \\"Second Foundation.\\" Once again the idea of the Mule is a goodidea but is somewhat poorly executed until the ened when everything isexplained about the effects the Mule has on the Foundation and thepeople in the main storyline.Get ready for \\"Second Foundation\\" because it will probably be the bestof the first trilogy. This book is worth reading and if \\"SecondFoundation\\" is better than this book then I will recommend the\\"Foundation Series\\" to anybody who can persist in their reading anddoesn't mind a long slow beginning."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The first book in the series is NOT Foundation.

I found the characters to be flat and one dimensional. The story uses unrealistic plot devices. Yes I understand that it's science fiction, but I find it strains credulity to think that the characters were able to invent a religion worlds-spanning religion in 30 years. It also didn't seem very likely that a 12,000-year-old empire would so quickly crumble into the stone age (I'm exaggerating slightly). I realize that this book was written in 1951 but the high tech stuff in the story was hardly high tech back then, much less in an empire spanned the galaxy.Bottom line: not an especially great read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The book starts with an enticing psychohistory idea, but then it dives deep into politics. It is quite interesting to read the ingenious solutions for the crises taken by the great leaders of the Foundation, specially for resigning war whenever it seemed the most sensible way out.The problem is that this book is supposed to be science fiction, yet the story seemed to have happened back in the mercantilism period in the XVII century, with its priests, kings, viceroys and merchant ships trading raw materials for manufactured goods. The gadgets used by the traders to fool the other empires are a bit silly as well, for a far future based science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When I was in junior high school, Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was my favorite science fiction. Recently, I picked it back up, and have had to revise my opinion somewhat.First, in terms of character and plot development, Asimov certainly hadn't hit his stride when he wrote these books. The characters are cardboard cutouts--especially the female characters.More importantly, Asimov uses the basic idea behind the series...that Hari Seldon created his &quot;psychohistory plan&quot; and launched it, invisibly determining the future of his Foundations for centuries...as a kind of magic box from which he pulls plot developments. This drains the story of dramatic tension. One knows from the get-go that it'll all work out in the wash. (In the second half of &quot;Foundation and Empire&quot; and &quot;Second Foundation&quot;, Asimov had found a way out of this problem, by introducing a wild card in the deck.)Finally, the book hasn't aged well. The technology forseen for his far-future galactic civilization seems positively &quot;retro&quot;. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem...Orwell's 1984 is still an effective piece of fiction, even though it's 2002, and the world is far different from the world Orwell envisioned...but the Foundation books' other flaws just seem to make this worse."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation novel is very dated, which I suppose is a function of the time it was written. Women are almost entirely absent except when they turn to putty over pretty pieces of jewelry. A gun is an \\"atomic blaster,\\" and other quaint 50s relics.The one dimensionality of the characters is problematic. I have to admit that although I don't read a lot of science fiction, I know priority is never put on characterization. However, since nearly all of the ideas of the book are no longer relevant, this shortcoming becomes glaring. The book is more of a time capsule than a living book.There is actually a single main character who re-occurs as 3 different personas (Seldon, Hardin, and Mallow). SeldonHardenMallow is calm, calculating, and always right. His opponents flail around until the denouement when SeldumHardenMallow has maneuvered them into exactly the right position and emerges victorious. It's so predictable that there isn't any dramatic tension.The biggest problem I had with the book is that the politics seem very nave. This novel was supposedly based on Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,\\" but Foundation seems to have only to most primitive understanding of that work.I don't really understand the love generated toward this book. It seems particularly flat. A lot of people seem to enjoy it -- just not me, I guess."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Just writing this to provide moral support for anyone who reads this book and is thoroughly underwhelmed.Asimov's prose is clean but his tone seems uneven in this installment, as opposed to the tighter first book.The book is essentially two disconnected adventures... not very appealing.There's a female character in the second adventure that's quite problematic; she's dull, and Asimov spends a lot of time and effort on the fact that she's (gasp) not male.Finally, this series feels very dated, in terms of language, attitudes, and even vision of the future. \\"Nuclear\\" is the buzzword; everything's like the '50s, but nuclear-powered.I liked Foundation but Foundation & Empire tends to wander away from the idea of the Foundation as the main character, and instead can't seem to decide whether to focus on galactic-level events or protagonists. This would be excusable if the protagonists were interesting.Go read Jack Vance or Gene Wolfe if you want masterful sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I just finished reading Foundation and was extremely disappointed. Maybe I was expecting too much, something grander along the line of the Dune series. But the book in of itself is an extreme disappointment. I realize Asimov was young (21) when he wrote this, but his style leaves a lot to be desired. I'll take an early Arthur C. Clarke book over Asimov any day. This is the first book by Asimov I've read and I'm not sure I want to read another. His style is very dialogue driven with very few, if any, detail given to what the characters think. Everyone is very two-dimensional. And he never describes any of the scenes were all of this dialog takes place. Part of the interest in science-fiction is exploring new places, seeing different things. This entire story could have taken place on an empty stage. In fact, it seems like it's written more for a play than a novel. As for the story, it starts out interestingly enough. The Empire is going to crumble and to avoid thousands of years of dark-ages, a Foundation is set up to preserve the past learning's of the Empire. Well, that's what the original thought was at least. Soon we discover there's an alternate motive to this. Once we learn of this motive, the story goes straight downhill. Asimov skips decades from one page to another. Characters are introduced that we know practically nothing about, and he never tells us anything about them. I've read history books that had more character development than he gives the people in this book. By the time I got to the end I found myself saying &quot;So what&quot;? Am I supposed to continue on reading this series because it's been called a &quot;classic&quot;. I've seen the word &quot;classic&quot; thrown around a little too much sometimes. This is definitely one of those times."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I ordered this book 2 weeks ago and it just now came today. What's worse, it's in absolutely terrible shape.

I find this one to be the least enjoyable, but I still consider it a classic. While Asimov's writing style improved over the years, Foundation is still a great read. Psychohistory is such an interesting idea, that it makes one think if it is possible. Although the books get better as the publishing years increase, the first one is still a great one. One note, though. Asimov's style of &quot;action&quot; here is not excellent, so be forewarned. Personally, I find his Robot series more enjoyable, but Foundation is still one of the best series ever written. I would give 4.5 stars, but unfortunately I cant."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Having just finished Greg Bear's brilliant &quot;Foundation &amp; Chaos&quot;, I've decided I can no longer wait to begin re-reading the original again. I wish I could take the next few months to start off with the Robot series, move on to the Galactic Empire series, and then finsh with the entire collection of the Foundation books (because it's all one big wunnerful story, doncha' know!). Well, not this year, perhaps, but in a few I may do just that. In the meantime, I will re-read &quot;Foundation&quot; with yet another new perspective of Hari Seldon and all that came before this original masterpiece... it truly never gets old."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is a great book, but it's not one that would translate to film. It converted me from Star Trek books to real sf. (Although Star Trek started me out so I'm not too harsh on it.) As a lover of history it drew me in. One of the major advantages of science fiction is it's ability to deal with grand scope of history &amp; it does it. Interestingly I like the later books too. In conclusion A movie version?????? I sure hope not they'd ruin it. However his End of Eternity ,which is one of my favorites, might be cinematic if they did it right."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation trilogy is the best work of science fiction I have ever read.

You may find the science of psychohistory a bit hard to believe, perhaps more so because history always celebrates the individual heros. But all leaders make use of mass belief to reach their goals.

Not bad for fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is really great. It consists of two stories. Bothe stories invovle Hari Seldon's theory and promise that the Foundation will last forever against threatning enemies. The first stroy is about an Emperial general who threatens the Foundation, but obviously lose, since Hari Seldon's plan can not be changed. The ending gives the reader a broad prespective on Hari Seldon's plan and theory. I would rate the first stroy as very good. The second story is even better. This time the Foundation is threatened by a mutant, and the Foundationa is loosing. You must read the second story, which is EXCELLENT, juts for the surprising and excellent ending!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book was almost perfect. It was actually better than the stellar first book (Foundation), which was also great. I just hope that we will one day get to see a 'Big Budget' movie series on the Foundation Series.

(and will probably give all his other books 10's too) The basis behind this story is that it describes an Empire- a Galactic Empire, mind you- that seems to be the same incredible picture of strength that it had been for 12,000 years. The brilliant mathematician, Hari Seldon, developes his science of Psychohistory, a way of predicting the course of future events and discovers that the Empire is decaying and will soon collapse. He then works out a plan to place two &quot;Foundations&quot; at &quot;opposite ends of the galaxy&quot;, so that in the course of a millenium they will converge and form a new and greater Empire on the ruins of the old. The novel is sort of like a fictiona"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is one of Asimov's early masterpieces. However, I would not recomend it to those who like action books. This has only a little bit of action in it. The main attraction to it is the intellectual stimulation. The Galactic Empire is falling after 12,000 years. Hari Seldon realizes it and, using the science of psychohistory, the prediction of the future in broad, statistical terms, establishes two Foundations &quot;at opposite ends of the Galaxy&quot; to cushion the Fall. This, the first of the classic Foundation series to be written (though only 3rd in chronological order), traces the early development of the First Foundation as it struggles first simply to survive in the prescence of powerful, hostile Kingdoms (which had formerly been parts of the Galactic Empire), and then to gradual growth and domination of its area of the Galaxy, and the promise of eventually establishing a Second Galactic Empire. Not a traditional novel, but perfect if you like history, as it traces the &quot;historical&quot; development of a nation.

He might have been pulling my leg but every year fopr five years I reread these and enjoyed them every time.

Set far in the future, Hari Seldon's goal is to shorten an impending period of Dark Ages from tens of thousands of years to one thousand years. To do so, he creates an organizational entity, the Foundation, and maneuvers to create circumstances so that the Foundation will recreate the Galactic Empire amid a blossoming of science and technology.This book is the first in a series that will keep you happily reading for days. In Foundation, the stage is set for the problem, and you will begin to understand the plan that Seldon has employed by examining the first 150 years after the Foundation is established.The book is built around four crises (Seldon Crises) that shape the potential of the First Foundation to fulfill its goal. In the first crisis, the Foundation is viewed as being a traitorous activity by the political authorities. Seldon explains that his purpose is to create an encyclopedia to encompass all current knowledge before it is lost. The crisis is survived when he agrees to take the project into exile on a planet with few natural resources at the far edge of the galaxy.Fifty years later, that fledgling is threatened by its powerful neighbors who have greater resources and military power. The Emperor can no longer protect the Foundation. Thirty years after that, another attempt to militarily capture the Foundation occurs. Another seventy years later, a fourth crisis occurs when remnants of the Empire start funneling advanced weapons to planets at the edge of galaxy that oppose the Foundation.Each crisis is overcome with a different approach, by a different leader. And the Foundation continues to develop towards its eventual form.These crises are much like a good mystery story. You know there's been a crime that needs to be solved, but you haven't quite figured out how yet. Because there are four crises, you get to enjoy that problem-solving experience four times in one book! Pretty neat!The Foundation's advantage in all of these crises is that it has advanced knowledge and has applied it, while the rest of the Empire is losing knowledge. Pretty soon, things are falling apart technically for those outside the Foundation. The key technology is built around atomic power (as it appeared it would developed in the 1950s).Reviewing Foundation is a challenging task. This book has become a science fiction classic, yet many will see little value in it because the science fiction perspectives and forecasts about science are dated. The book has to be read in the context of the books that follow to be fully understood and appreciated, but how does that help the person who has just finished Foundation? Isaac Asimov used a most unusual style in the book, as though you are a historian uncovering bits of primary and secondary sources concerning a long ago period in time (that occurs in our future). That either makes the book more authentic (if you like that) or annoying (if you don't).At bottom, these contrasts require the reviewer to attempt to capture for the potential reader what makes this book an enduring classic.First, Foundation squarely asks a fundamental question: How should knowledge be built, maintained, and used for the benefit of all? A subset of that question is: What are the appropriate uses of knowledge? These are questions that we do not wrestle with nearly enough today. Many people enjoy thinking about these questions, and welcome their introduction by this book.Second, Foundation suggests that progress is faster with the benefit of planning that takes into account human nature. Seldon's discipline is the reliable behavior of large groups of people (psycho-history). Those who like to plan and those that do not will equally enjoy Asimov's scenario for making his point that we should build from our understanding of human behavior. You can debate the point and have lots of fun forever, based on what is here.Third, many social thinkers have been inspired by the Foundation concept to structure their own changes. Nonviolent political movements match the Foundation concept in many ways, for example. This book gives you a lens to consider many of the global agencies that have been created by international organizations.Fourth, what should be the relationship between knowledge and power? Usually, they are united. But the Foundation posits a world in which they can be divided, and that division could have some benefits. A current example would be the unharnessed knowledge of the Internet. No government will probably succeed in trying to hold dominion over it.Science fiction has long played a useful role in helping society to examine its most important scientific questions in advance. Then the concepts that seem useful become the early paradigms of scientific and social progress. In the case of Foundation, that paradigm here is applied to social progress primarily . . . not scientific progress. So think of this as a book about the science fiction of governing.Foundation suggests a world where knowledge has more power than today, and is also more effective at curbing harmful exercises of power than currently. That shining ideal, I believe, is at bottom the key to understanding Foundation's lasting and broad appeal.Whether you like, love, are indifferent to, or hate Foundation, I suggest you read the initial trilogy before making up your mind about this book. Much of the genius of Foundation (the first book) isn't apparent to most readers until the trilogy is read and grasped.One word of caution: Asimov wrote lots of one-draft wonder books, and was certainly not a great craftsman in his writing. Look past that writing quality to the conceptual brilliance of the picture he is painting.After you have finished the trilogy, ask yourself the question of how you can make knowledge more effective in promoting human moral and economic progress. I think you will find that to be an intriguing question well worth the attention you give to it. And you can think of Foundation to remind you of the question."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I only recently read this so called masterpiece.

Even though I got through it I cannot believe all of the outstanding reviews and awards this series has received. No characters, no science, no mystery (who couln't figure out the identitiy of the Mule?). In addition the story is basically one of the collapse of the Roman Empire. It probably could have been rewritten replacing historical language instead of spacefare and it would not have mattered in the slightest. The only science fictional element was Psychohistory which is not developed at all due to the nature of the plot. If this is a classic, I shall stick to more obscure and worthwhile reads.

I'm not really sure why Asimov thought that the future galaxy would be ruled by an emporer, which is a dying system of government, instead of a democratic republic. I know this is nit-picking, but I didn't like this book.Apparently, the future can be predicted with a high degree of accuracy using math and statistics. Anyone who works as a mathematician or statistician, as I do, knows that it's difficult to predict what's going to happen in anyone's life tomorrow, much less the entire world 500 to 1000 years into the future using statistics.This book is intellectual worship, which is something I can't stand. Intellectual worship is when people think they are intellecually superior to everyone else, so feel they should rule over everyone else, if only you would listen to them. This idea drips off the page as event after event is predicted by some really smart dude. This smart dude predicted a collapse of civilization and treated it as inevitable. Another idea that's patently absurd- that any event that occurs is inevitable.If this guy was so smart as to predict, with a high degree of accuracy, the downfall of civilization, and the rising of a new one, along with the traumatic events this new civilization would go through, why wasn't he smart enough to avert the downfall of the original civilization. Surely, with his predictive ability people would listen to him, but he decides to let it crumble for whatever reason.And Asimov is a mediocre writer.

I kept waiting for the \\"eureka\\" moment when I finally understood why everyone likes this book so much. It never happened, and when I finally came to the end of the book, I realized that Mr. Azimov stole a good two hours of my life and gave me NOTHING in return.The story sounds interesting, and in the hands of another writer it may have bore fruit. Unfortunately, in Mr Asimoz's hands, the story falls flat in the implementation. Had the writing not been funny, I would have been completely bored. Of course, Mr. Azimov did not intentionally make me laugh - sadly, his understanding of the human condition appears to be based largely on old, cheap pulp fiction novels. The characters are completely one dimensional and unconvincing. I truly cannot understand why anyone would like this book - but calling it a classic is simply unbearable. I can only assume that most of the people reviewing this book favorably are children. In any case, they are certainly not familiar with truly good writing. My advice: avoid this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Being a sci-fi fan myself, I decided I wanted to try reading some of the works by the giants of sci-fi. I had always heard how great &quot;Foundation&quot; was, so I thought I'd start with this one. I was thoroughly disappointed! Asimov used way too many large words (&quot;using dollar words where dime words would suffice&quot;). The story seemed to jump around from one time to another. The characters were very one-dimensional and very flat...I didn't have that &quot;I wonder what's going to happen next to ---&quot;. I just didn't care what was going to happen next to the characters or in the story. There didn't seem to be anything to propel this story along; nothing to develop the characters or the story. I read over 100 pages and I still had no interest in what was happening. (Even Stephen King, who can be pretty tough to get into his stories, has me hooked within 50 to 60 pages!) I just don't get what all the hype is over this book. Could someone out there PLEASE tell me! I will try to get into his Robot series...maybe he has better character and story development in them...I hope!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation is completely undeserving of the fame accredited to it. Had it been more eloquently executed, the collage of textbook style narrative and bad dialogue might have been sufficient to generate a bearable story. All the social concepts Asmov brings up are well worn and ill-portrayed on the backdrop of a generic, illogical sci-fi universe. His writing style is bland and every one of his characters can be found by an other name in star wars."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It is astonishing to realize that science fiction consisted of a relative humble portion of Isaac Asimov's ouevre. While most of his time was spent on nonfiction work, his contributions to science fiction proved so monumental that there is not a single science-fiction writer today who has not been influenced, in some way, by Asimov's writing. His intellectual and engaging fiction has produced some of the finest short stories and novels in the genre, in classics such as \\"The Last Question\\" and \\"Nightfall\\". But his seminal work is the top-of-the-pyramid, groundbreaking, and famous \\"Foundation Trilogy\\". He is to SF what Tolkien is for Fantasy.\\"Foundation\\" is an entertaining piece of sociopolitical SF in the backdrop of a space opera. This book is the foundation of SF for the past six decades. Asimov's prose is clear and concise, without any room for ambiguity or vain style. Asimov's words, though pared down and stripped of subtext, are not any less true or beautiful or witty.Set thousands of years in the future, after humanity has colonized millions of planets in our galaxy, \\"Foundation\\" introduces the Galactic Empire is in its waning years. One man on the capital planet of Trantor, Hari Seldon, predicts the cataclysmic and chaotic decline and fall of the Empire. Seldon has developed the science of psychohistory, which aims to calculate the behaviour of mass populations over the course of events using, among other things, socioeconomic trends. Seldon has predetermined not only the demise of the Empire, but that thirty millennia of barbarism will follow, unless his organization, the Foundation, is able to finish its gargantuan mission of cataloguing and preserving all accumulated human knowledge and history. The act would serve to lessen an inevitable thirty-thousand years to a mere thousand.Asimov portrays the epic grandeur of the galaxy through the unyielding arc of time and history. Individual lives are ineffectual, though not inconsequential, in the grand scheme of things. Throughout the stories, there is a pervading sense of \`greater good' or \`the bigger picture'. There is only one recurring character in each of the five tales: the Foundation. It stands in the background, an entity both mysterious and arresting; a godlike presence that shaped religion and ruled a city. The story of the Foundation is portrayed through the periodic snippets of human life throughout the growth of the First Foundation from an indefensible, dependent, colony in the backwaters of the outskirts of a great empire to a massive political juggernaut with commercial and technological prowess. The central characters: Hari Seldon, Gaal Dornick, Salvor Hardin, Linmar Ponyets, and Hober Mallow are seen in flashes as their importance and contribution to the longevity of the Foundation is waxes and wanes.Asimov has an arresting flair for conjuring up a methodical, articulate, and complex history. In the battle for free will over determinism, Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" falls securely into the side of the determinists. Psychology and economic trends and the insurmountable turn of time dominate the short stories with a sense of inevitability. But it the tone of the story is far from pessimistic. There is only ever the slightest indication that they should lose hope, or that individual lives are meaningless. As one character says, \\"Seldon's laws help those who help themselves.\\" Asimov appears to advocate forging a better future through the sole and collective action of the present.Unquestionably, \\"Foundation\\" is an intellectual treat that tends to emphasis the background scenes as opposed to the ones that illustrate more action. Most of the book is exposition and dialogues between characters in a meeting over smokes. The third story, The Mayors, provides the most exciting, and arguably cleverest, climactic confrontation in the book. It is a scene between Mayor Hardin and Prince Regent Wienis. Hardin, in a stroke of brilliance, has manipulated events to stave off a rival political party's attempt to impeach him and end the threat posed by the Four Kingdoms.\\"Foundation\\" is a significant to the genre in more ways than the ideas it challenged us with. It is the culmination of science fiction into a literature encompassing reason and ideas. It reinvigorated the genre and turned it into a platform of higher ideals and concepts. \\"Foundation\\" steered it away from the pulp swamp creatures. It did for science fiction what \\"Spiderman\\" (2002) did for superhero movies, or in particular, what Christopher Nolan's \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005) reboot did for the franchise. Asimov gives us excellent characters, complex sociopolitics, and a good story that never wanes."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is far and beyond one of my favorite books of all time.

Now on to Foundation and Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I loved reading the Foundation novels a long time ago and was glad I found them on Kindle. Can't go wrong with Asimov."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It's taken me quite a while to get around to reading this one, and I hesitate to review the first book of a trilogy when I haven't completed all 3 books, but I figured I'd better get this one in while I can, as it may take me another 10 years to finish the series.I'm surprised that it took me this long to finally read &quot;Foundation&quot; by Isaac Asimov, but I can say that I'm glad I did. Actually, I didn't have high hopes going into it, as I am not a big fan of Asimov's writing. While his technical approach is always entertaining, he tends to become very stilted and ham-fisted when it comes to characterization. It was this quality that turned me off of &quot;I Robot&quot; and almost got me to give him up completely; however, seeing as the Foundation trilogy is regarded as a classic of the genre, I had to give it a shot.As everyone has said over and over (and I'll do it, too), the Foundation trilogy is a futuristic parallel of the fall of the Roman Empire and the following Dark Ages. Hari Seldon, father of Psychohistory, sees the writing on the wall and establishes the Foundation in order to buffer the fall of civilization and technology. The first book of the series, &quot;Foundation&quot;, does a good job of setting the stage for what is to come. The book is told in 5 parts, each one focusing on a different character or time period in the early history of the Galactic Empire's fall. Surprising to me, Asimov actually does a fairly good job with his characterization. There's very little melodrama, and the story is evenly paced, holding up pretty well for a tale begun in 1941. The only complaints I have with the story are that the main characters always seem to be overly confident in themselves, as if they are holding all the cards and can easily handle any adversity while blindfolded (presenting a tense situation fails if the protagonist has no concern or doubt for how things will be resolved). Also, as the different parts of the story skip a hundred years here, 30 years there, etc., it may take some imagination on the reader's part to develop a &quot;big picture&quot; of what the Empire is really going through. These are minor issues, however, and should not detract from enjoying the book.One last observation - I have noticed that Hari Seldon appears to be getting younger with each new printing of this book. My copy of &quot;Foundation&quot; from the early '80s, with cover art by Darrell Sweet, shows a decrepit, bent, wizened Seldon (as I feel he should look). The next cover, by Michael Whelan from the early '90s, shows a more healthy and happy Seldon. The cover of the latest edition, shown on this page, features a Seldon who looks like he's about to jump out of his wheelchair and punch you out. You have to love that artistic license..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Keep in mind: this is the first book in a trilogy. Even though each book stands on its own as a classic of science fiction, you have to take them as a whole, I think. Besides, once you've read Foundation, you'll want to read the others. That said, I first came across this trilogy in the library and was reluctant to read it. On first reading, I was weighed down and a little turned off by the politics, and I almost lost interest. Hari Seldon, a mathemetician, predicts that the mighty Empire, centered on the giant planet/city Trantor, will be destroyed in 500 years, which will be followed by 30,000 years of barabarism and social decay. Only after that will a new Empire emerge. He devises a plan to shrink that dark period to 1,000 years, and new rulers of his design will take over. After a trial, Seldon and his band are exiled to a backwater planet, Terminus, surrounded by stronger and more resourceful enemies. What band? Those working on a great Encyclopedia to preserve the knowledge of mankind once the dark period strikes. They wouldn't travel to the other end of the galaxy on their own accord. Forced exile was the only way Seldon's Plan would work. Soon the true purpose of the Plan is revealed. Seldon was dead before the Foundation established itself on Terminus. But he appears as a hologram during times of crisis. It turns out Seldon predicted these crises, and the Foundation's actions are forced down one path. The Foundation slowly gains advantage over its enemies. It will still be centuries before they are strong enough to take on the Empire. The Foundation gains these advantages sometimes by heroic acts of its leaders. But according to Seldon, the actions of the individual are unpredictable and can't be counted on. So is there some greater power guiding this whole scheme? The question is not approached until the next book, Foundation and Empire. We and the men of the Foundation know that Hari Seldon formed two Foundations, and that's all we know. You might spot elements that George Lucas borrowed for his Star Wars movies: Empires, small versus the mighty, parsecs, blasters, and as you read further, mind control. Foundation sets up the series strongly. Read it, and keep reading. The politics don't bother me so much anymore. They are a necessary part of the story. That's why I say to take the trilogy as a whole. All three books are essential to the whole story, one is not necessarily the best, but the real excitement and surprise endings are saved for the next two books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"\\"Foundation\\" by Isaac AsimovIn the distant future: humanity has spread to the stars and it has been so long that most have forgotten which planet humanity originated from. All of the inhabited planets (almost 25 million) owe allegiance to the Empire, a gigantic centralized government that is located on the planet of Trantor. Hari Seldon is a scientist and the utmost expert of new science known as \\"Psychohistory\\". Hari uses psychohistory which is mathematics based to map out the future in detail. He has determined that the Empire will fall within 300 years. Hari knows that he cant stop the fall but wishes to minimize the dark ages that follow in which he predicts that most science will be lost and that it will take humanity over 30,000 years to get back to where they currently are. Hari thinks he can minimize this amount of time by forming the Foundation whose job it will be to compile all knowledge into a galactic encyclopedia.........This was actually a very good and well thought out story. The story unwinds in an interesting and unique way that is very different from most sci-fi stories I have read.The Good: The story was well thought out and unfolds interestingly. Asimov is a great world/universe builder and his take on the emerging society of the foundation and its purpose driven evolutions is excellent. The story is well paced and never really felt like it had time to slow down. It is surprising that Asimov managed to tell his tale which covers an expansive amount of time in just under 250 pages and still make it feel fleshed out.The Bad: Some say the characters in \\"Foundation\\" are flat. This isn't untrue however as surprising as it may sound this doesn't have an extreme adverse effect on the story. The reason it doesn't is because the story isn't character driven. The characters act more as small pieces in a large extended chess game and merely serve to move an event driven story along its path.Overall: Foundation was a great and unique read. Pick it up and give it a read!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The foundation is setup to secretly monitor mankind through its darkest hours. It reminded me a little of Orwell's 1984. In placing humans away from the central government on a planet with few resources. They are forced to develop quickly. This is a novel more about political machinations than about action. The contradictions in human nature are here to analyze. The characters use guile, spirit, & cunning to survive. Some 80% of the book is dialogue & the character development is a bit shallow. Nonetheless, Mr. Asimov portrays the future in poignant & diverse ways. The predicted conflict makes the story of galactic history entertaining, especially since this was written in 1951. Some 7 years before Sputnik was launched. The author deserves praise for his imagination that was well ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I personally enjoyed ever word of this particular work. Many other reviewers have gone into the plot, etc. so I will not do so here to any depth. This is one of those works of SiFi that will appeal to certain taste, while others may find it not to their liking. There is a great deal of politics (almost Pre WWI European) involved in the story line. As the story covers (all books included) over one thousand years, there are many, many characters to track and keep track of. This is indeed a series of short stories, all linked. I personally enjoy this sort of thing but can see where some might not. That being said, it, the book, can certainly be regarded as a classic in this particular genre and certainly should be read by any student of such. You certainly cannot fault the author's story telling ability and imagination. I enjoyed this one a lot and do highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is an amazing story about the ingenuity of one man whose quests bring him to the brink of barbarism-- in a time a million years from now. Hari Seldon is the character we'd all like to be, and Isaac Asimov is the writer we'd all like to be. Definately five stars. I recommend for anyone with a likeness to math, history, or science, or anyone who has read anything by Asimov, Brin, or Bear."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"With all the rave reviews about this book, perhaps I set my hopes too high. I just really didn't care for this book. There is almost no character development (since every chapter spans huge jumps in time) and the \\"science\\" in this novel takes a back seat to the political ideas of the author. With endless pages of dialog and few reasons to care about any of the characters, I had a very hard time getting through this one. And while I know it was written years ago, the author's science-fantasy was pretty much limited to \\"nuclear powered devices.\\" That just didn't feel like much of a stretch of the imagination, all things considered.I thoroughly enjoy sci-fi when told by authors such as H.G. Wells and Ray Bradbury. These authors know how to paint a picture in your mind and bathe your imagination in colorful imagery. In Foundation, however, I was thoroughly unimpressed by the style, context and story as told by Azimov - it was boring, unimaginative, and I never even had the pleasure of painting the scene being played out in my mind. I would definitely not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"For its time \`Foundation' by Isaac Asimov was a tale that predicted futurism as the calculation of the eventual outcome of each technological economic progression that mankind could, and would, go through, if it stuck to certain paths, especially the implementation of the concept that \\"small is better\\" with an economic drive that produces its best results when under stress, such as wartime. This model is pretty much the way the world works today with technology leaps made when there is a demand for it to do so and at no time is this demand greater than when a nation is faced with a possible crisis. Asimov's \`Foundation' is a story about a society of colonized scientists that have been chosen by Hari Seldon, the creator of psychohistory, who sees a crisis developing in the cosmic empire that can only be avoided if certain conditions are met for each impending emergency that is predicted through psychohistorical analysis. He sets up an off world colony at the unknown edge of the galaxy, the foundation, that goes through several generations, with each generation reaching a hidden 'Seldon crisis' point that becomes the focus of several successive stories in the book. Futurism was actually an artistic movement originating in Italy around 1910 whose aim was to express the energetic, dynamic, and violent quality of contemporary life, especially as embodied in the motion and force of modern machinery. Nowadays it means to believe that the meaning of life and one's personal fulfilment lie in the future and not in the present or past. Foundation symbolizes these ideas. Although not the most exciting or action packed SF you could read, is also somewhat limited in its SF feel, is more of a revelation of economics and is the kind of literary material that would impress the business and politically minded reader more than the seasoned SF reader. None-the-less this is still an important work that remains relevant today as it did in the early 50s, but the sequels might be a bit of a hard sell on the bases of this educational SF novel."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I love this book and now fully understand why Asimov is considered one of the grandmasters of this genre. Over the years I have read a considerable amount of Science Fiction; books ranging from military exploits to technological exploits, but never have I read one that I would consider high literature.In this book Asimov deals with issues such as religion, politics, economics and the control that they all grant in such a deft way that it in no way detracts from a riveting and page turning novel. Take, for instance this quote from page 210.\\"The religion we have is our all-important instrument toward that end. With it we have brought the Four Kingdoms under our control, even at the moment when they would have crushed us. It is the most potent device known with which to control men and worlds\\"In regards to the power of economics\\"The whole war is a battle between those two systems; between the Empire and the Foundation; between the big and the little. To seize control of a world, they bribe with immense ships that can make war, but lack all economic significance. We, on the other hand, bribe with little things, useless in war, but vital to prosperity and profits.\\" - Pg. 231My one complaint is really based on a personal preference. I really enjoy a novel which has one central character that I can get to know and even identify with. I think that it helps to draw the reader into the story. However, Foundation covers several hundred years in just a couple hundred pages thereby making this impossible. This is a small point, but for me detracts slightly from the story.That said I adore this book and am eagerly looking forward to finishing out the series. If you have not read it then I say move it to the top of the list. This is truly one of the great SciFi stories of all time.Leave a comment below and let me know what you think!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation surprised me. I had been expecting dry, hardcore science fiction with hard to grasp worlds and characters. I couldn't have been more wrong. Foundation takes politics, psychology, statistics and survival and showcases them in a galaxy far, far away.Time passes quickly in the novel, so you don't get very attached to any of the characters. The focus is the big picture, the future, and the steps taken to prevent the coming anarchy. More than that, the focus is on the plot. Clean dialogue and a lack of heavy description keeps the plot constantly moving forward. The pace the plot progression sets makes the book very hard to put down. Foundation is a smart and easy read that deserves its label as being the best science fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"While reading this book, I couldn't help exulting on the philosophy of the book and the characters' conduct. Though the Foundation keeps confronting belligerent forces, the heads of Foundation's government and those in charge do not resort to violence! Instead of the automatic jump to use violence in a threatening situation, they use civil disobedience, embargos, and gentle ways of subjugation. Even though some warhawks (the Actionists of Terminus in Hardin's time) agitate the Foundation to go to war, in the end, the doves prevail, using their tactics of nonviolence. Since Asimov (genius) published this book in 1951, three years since the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, I could tell that it was influenced by Gandhi's nonviolent philosophy. Albert Einstein recognized the enlightened mind of Gandhi, who advocated nonviolent tactics and change without shedding blood. Throughout Asimov's Foundation, published three years after Gandhi's assassination, Gandhi's teachings are very evident. Most readers probably didn't recognize this, but Foundation was probably influenced by one of the major figures of our century--Gandhi. Also, the nonviolent philosophies of Leo Tolstoy and Henry David Thoreau are also somewhat present."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I really liked Foundation. Then I really liked the first part (&quot;The General&quot;) of this. And then the Mule showed up... First, Asimov always had trouble writing a mystery. I identified the Mule the first time he showed up, and I figured out the basics of his mutation as soon as the Visi-Sensor was described. And that leads me to my second nitpick. The Mule didn't need to have such a powerful ability to affect others. The ability to read minds plus high intelligence would give the Mule the same ability to predict reactions as a trained psychohistorian, and the Visi-Sensor would give him the tool to exploit it. The story itself would go much the same way, with the Mule's ability to force predicted reactions replacing his ability to force actions, but with a tighter integration with the ideas of the previous book. Furthermore, it would have meant none of the psychic conspiracies which proceeded to dominate in the books Second Foundation, Foundation's Edge, etc. The ability to twist minds transforms psychohistory from the powerful science of Foundation to simply a method of forecasting the societal impact of psychic manipulation. It also transformed the Foundation series from moderately hard SF stories about the impact of a new science to just another set of stories about mind control magic. BTW, I like fantasy and soft SF -- I just wish Foundation didn't change genres in mid-trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Very briefly, to the pair of one-star reviews below, keep in mind that these stories were written in the 1940's! Must you blame Mr. Asimov for &quot;inaccuracy&quot; in a time where much more mainstream sources felt that by 1980 we'd all be zipping around in flying bubble cars? Obviously you missed the point here. The Foundation series is about our own humanity, not about where we will be technologically in the year 15000. No, I can't prove that there could actually be a Mule, but why waste your time trying to? The Mule is probably one of the best literary constructs to grace the world of science fiction, one that isn't decked out in gadgets and laser beams. There's something to be said about a writer that can make a sci-fi villian without resorting to hi-tech hijinks. You didn't like the Mule? Well tough luck and go back to reading your Star Trek novels."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In his Foundation Trilogy (later to be extended in additional books), the prolific science fiction/fact writer Isaac Asimov told a story of a small group of people who secretly steered the course of history using technology that we would now recognize as an outgrowth of memetics. By recognizing group psychology and the effect of various memes on populations, they were able (Asimov creates) to shorten the intergalactic Dark Ages by millennia.Is such a thing possible? We are seeing the beginnings of attempts at memetic engineering today. Advertisers are designing memes that are becoming fairly effective at penetrating populations, in hope that they will carry with them a message influencing consumer buying behavior. Have you heard someone say &quot;I love ya, man!&quot; lately? Anheuser-Busch is delighted if you have.More broadly, I'm seeing a steady trickle of organizations copying and mutating successful Profit Viruses (MLMs) and Power Viruses (cults). It's an interesting question whether the population as a whole will ever build up an &quot;immunity&quot; to this kind of thing, or whether the evolutionary-psychology buttons of lust, power, fear, and so on are too powerful to overcome.Who knows? There may have been a small group of Illuminati steering us for millennia past without us even knowing...--Richard Brodie, Author, &quot;Virus of the Mind"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The instant I read this wonderful series, my life changedin some very significant ways. I have two degrees inmathematics, and am working on a Ph.D. in mathematics as a DIRECT RESULT of these books. Asimov explores the whole notion that human behavior is predictable on a very large scale, but completely unpredictable on an individual scale. The marriage between the clockwork Universe and the humanistic feeling that we have free-will is masterfully completed in this award-winning work. The Foundation series is classified as Sci-fi, but it is in a league of its own!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Simply the best science fiction series ever. No one macthesAsimov in the combination of thought provoking futurism andsheer out and out entertainment.

His plot twists never turn onmajor battles or laser fights, but always with the triumphof reason. It's all here in abundance."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Though \\"Foundation\\" was later tied to many other novels and stories that Isaac Asimov wrote, many of us considered this story to be the first of the Foundation Trilogy. We meet Hari Seldon and learn of the beginning of psychohistory. Hari has predicted, using psychohistory, that the 12,000 year old galactic empire is facing eminent collapse. Hari determined through this calculations that the collapse of the empire will lead to 30,000 years of chaos before a second empire forms. Hari also determined that by taking certain actions that the 30,000 years of chaos could be shortened to 1,000 years.Considering that this novel is only 256 pages long it covers a lot of ground. The novel begins on the ultra-urbanized planet Trantor and then heads to the edge of the galaxy. We watch the empire collapse and then the struggles of the Foundation as they attempt to re-start civilization. We also watch as the Foundation changes from a religious organization to a scientific one.This novel is the best of the first three Foundation books. Part of the reason may be that these stories were originally short stories. Also, Asimov was not trying to form a single cohesive story lasting 1,000 years; at this time he was just trying to launch an idea. I sometimes think it is easier to launch an epic adventure than it is to evolve the epic over hundreds or thousands of pages. Certainly Asimov's launch in this book was grand and is one of the best classic science fiction novels.The next two books in this series are \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation.\\"Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"My 14 year old loves science fiction and fantasy and I've introduced him and reintroduced myself to some of the Classic Works of the Genre that Predate Star Wars and Serenity.Its been at least 20 years since I first read the trilogy. I had completely forgotten that the books are several self contained novella's that show the evolution of Hari Seldon's plan to keep the dark ages from the fall of the First Empire to the creation of a second empire confined to a period of a single millenia.He foresees a set of crisises that can only be managed with one solution every 75 years or so to increase the power of the foundation. Some are solved by trickery, some are resolved by Religion, and some by economics.I didn't notice until this reading that each \\"crisis\\" that emerges is resolved by someone thinking 'outside the box' of the people who resolved the previous crisis and are now controlling the reins of the Foundation.Classic scifi from the Golden Age before Star Wars.

He was NOT, however, a great writer. At times it is difficult to separate the brilliance and scope of his imaginative ideas from the pedestrian and awkward manner in which he presents them.\\"Foundation,\\" the first novel in the ever-lengthening Foundation series, is a collection of short stories originally published in \\"Astounding\\" magazine. The first couple are very good, but the last few are pretty uninteresting. The writing is uneven, dialogue is unrealistic, and characters are wooden and one-dimensional. And yet, through Asimov's wonderfully creative idea of psychohistory and its use in saving a dying Galactic Empire, this series became one of the best science fiction stories of all time, and well worth reading.Do be careful which edition you read.

It consists of two sections which are taken from shorter fiction that was published in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in the 1940s.

Asimov himself wrote in 1982 that the knowledge of astronomy at that time was \\"primitive\\" and that he could now take advantage of electronic computers in his stories, which hadn't been invented until he was halfway through the series in the 40s.The two sections of \\"Foundation And Empire\\" are:\\"The General\\" - In this story, the Foundation is attacked by what is left of the Empire. The Empire, though much weaker than it once was, is still stronger than the Foundation. This was first published as the novelette \\"Dead Hand\\" in the April 1945 edition of \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\".\\"The Mule\\" - Perhaps the best of the Foundation stories; in this one the Seldon plan is destroyed by its inability to predict a singular event. The Foundation is threatened by a person known only as The Mule. He is mysteriously able to defeat more powerful forces, with inferior forces. This was first published as the novella \\"The Mule\\" in \\"Astounding Science Fiction\\" in November and December of 1945.The trilogy has been recognized by readers and critics alike over the years. In 1952, it was rated as the 15th best book overall by the Astounding/Analog All-Time Poll. It moved up to 12th on the same poll in 1956, and then to 1st in 1966. In 1975 it was ranked 6th on the Locus poll for All-Time Novels. In 1987 it was 6th on the same poll for SF Novels. In 1998 it was ranked 4th on the same poll for novels before 1990. It also received the 1966 Hugo for All-Time Series, beating out Tolkien's \\"The Lord Of The Rings\\", Smith's \\"Lensman\\", Heinlein's \\"Future History\\", and Burroughs' \\"Barsoom\\" series for the award."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Comes this novel, given to me on Christmas, by my dad, on the recomendation of one of his co-workers. I am not a big science fiction fan, not that I've read dozens of sci-fi books and hated them. It's just that besides what I run into in the occasional Koontz or King, I have little interest in sci-fi.So after Christmas, a month or so goes by, and I finally open \\"Foundation\\". Doing research before reading this, I am quite impressed at how popular this series is. After reading the book, I clearly see why. The first few pages took a re-read, as I was very confused. Before I knew it, im onto part 2 and not able to put this book down. All I can say now is I can't wait to get my hands on the rest of the series. I was in the mood for something different than my usual reading, and this really delivered. Asimov writing is intelligent, yet simple. His character's aren't deep, but the plot amazes. His imagination is amazing.What I especially enjoy about this book, is that each of the five parts takes place many years after the previous part, so you really feel as if you know the whole empire's history.All in all, this book took me from not caring much for sci-fi, to at the bare minimum reading the rest of this series, and eventualy, probably reading alot if not all of Asimov's work. A book that's on the short side never contained so much in opinion. I am now an Isaac Asimov fan. Recommended HIGHLY!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"After reading the whole trilogy I must say that the first installment still has the biggest impact for the single reason that this is where the whole grand idea was conceived and presented for the first time.The best aspect of this story is, of course, the awsome interplay between technology, politics, religion, economy, and culture within the galactic periphery in the immediate vicinity of planet Terminus, the location of the so called First Foundation. This interplay is cleverly woven into a series of plots propelled by a handful of characters. That focus upon a few key characters in a sense brought the whole story down to earth (and for the better).The founder himself, Hari Seldon, is already long dead by the 2nd chapter but the plan he and his co-conspirators set in motion lingers on.Couple of problems are evident with the story and some suspension of disbelief is required to overcome them.First is the time scale in which the changes are set in. To put it simply, descend of parts of the galaxy encompassing hundreds of planetary systems into that sort of technological and scientific barbarism\\" within mere 50 years is not belivable. Establishing a religion based on technology within 30 years after that is still kind of on the less belivable side but it depends strongly on the magnitude of the technological difference between barbarians\\" and the foundationeers, so there is room for interpretation.Second is the technology itself. Nuclear fission has been known and used for 60 years and lost most of its appeal as the ultimate energy source of the future.In the meantime there has been countless ideas about alternative sources of energy much greater than fission and entirely possible (notably: nuclear fusion and matter/antimatter annihilation). To put it simply, the idea that nuclear fission will be powering everything at the point in time 12 millenia from now is archaic.Besides nuclear power, there are number of minor ideas introduced in the book that also did not hold well or at all since its writing (prevalent smoking, for instance). Together, the whole technological and cultural setting of the book has sort of a retro feel now... kind of like the Fallout games.All that, however, can be forgiven for the most part since it is often impossible to write about technology of the future merely decades from now let alone whole millenia from now. Asimov was a writer and a scientist, not a psychic.Striking is also the absence of biochemistry or genetics, since one would assume that those would be Asimov's strong points for the fact that he majored and worked in biochemistry.Third, while the passage of time had appropriate atmosphere of scale (more or less), the galaxy felt kind of small. The distances weren't shown or explained very well so a trip from the Periferies to Trantor or Kolgan(sp?) seems like a trip to an amusement park only some 100 miles away.Nevertheless, the best what Foundation has to offer more than makes up for its shortfalls."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Imagine an empire so humongous it stretches across the Milky Way galaxy. Imagine a mathematical formula that can actually prove future events. Then imagine that formula predicts this galactic empire will soon crumble and a new dark ages lasting at least 30,000 years will follow.If you can imagine all that, you get the gist of Foundation by Isaac Asimov and the beginning of a highly regarded series of books in the science fiction genre.What happens next is a group of people try to find ways to circumnavigate, though not necessarily halt, the new approaching dark age.Asimov isn't for everyone, and I can't admit to loving his prose. But his ideas for plots are top notch. This book, and the series of books that follow it, are proof of this.Asimov's writing is often considered too dense for the casual reader, and there's some truth to this. If you like your science fiction with lots of action and ray guns and alien spaceships flying about, Asimov isn't for you. But if you like hard science fiction based upon hard, indepth science, this Asimov is probably right for you, especially the Foundation series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I'd like to begin this review by saying that I typically don't particularly like most science fiction. In fact, I hate most of it. What Asimov did here was create an outline of continuity that seamlessly followed a logical progression, displayed memorable characters that begin and end as heroic figures, and never once does he insult the intelligence of the reader.The primary difference between Asimov and the Sci-Fi writers that I loathe so much, is that Isaac does not stoop to create melodrama; he doesn't exaggerate his descriptions or dialogue in order to convince the reader that the heroes are great, rather he let's their actions demonstrate their greatness.The only thing that does bother me about Asimov, is how many terrible authors who have clearly attempted to emulate his ideas and writing style only to create abominations of thought and literature. I'm looking at you, L.R.H."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"When I was a teenager, I was stunned by \\"The End of Eternity\\". When later I started reading the Empire and Foundation novels, I was unpleasantly surprised by the style simplification that seemed to accelerate with every novel. Now, when I've read them all, I think I understand what happened: there was no time for a better literature craftsmanship, new universes took all the time. Somehow, it resembled Federico Fellini's movies - same feeling of creation of the worlds just in front of you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A science fiction book where the science is more political than technological. Psychology had advanced to the point where mathematical models of mass psychology could predict large group social behavior far into the future ( rather like the meteorological models attempt to predict weather several days in advance). The predictions in this case extended over several centuries and predicted the galaxy would undergo a dark age in which civilized learning and behavior would decrease and collected knowledge could be lost. A Foundation was formed at the far edge of the galaxy with the sole job of organizing and saving all knowledge. Since the book takes place over a long period of time we follow the adventures of several heroes involved with the Foundation's effort to not only maintain knowledge (for the time when civilization will return) but to do so while maintaining peace. This was done first by creating a religion based on the fact that only the Foundation had technology, most importantly nuclear power. This source of power, needed by all, then became an object of worship, and priests were trained in how to present the dictates of the Foundation (Source of Power) as a reason for good behavior. When this sham began to fail, it was found that trade between the high tech Foundation and the low tech other nations was more profitable than war, and could maintain peace. This is the first book in a series of three, so most likely the next book tells how the trade idea worked out. Although my description does make it sound boring, I found it to be an interesting book, the politics of which sound familiar in today's world - I may read the next in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Oh how avidly I read these long ago. Just ate them up. After learning Paul Krugman was influenced by theses novels, I had to read them again or so I thought.

But let's say that it encompasses a future history spanning tens of thousands of years at it's most crucial time - when the very fabric of its society is about to plunge into a dark age. Only one man can save it, Hari Seldon, by writing an Encyclopedia Galactica that will redirect the knowledge of mankind into a small group of scientists who can rebuild humanity in just a few thousand years.Epic in proprtion, brilliant in detail, this is a must read for anyone who not only savors the salt of Sci-fi literatue, but anyone who just wants to read the best of the best of any genre."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Great book! First in the series of three novels, all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks.

I picked up the first one I found and it happened to be this one, so why not give it a go?I was intrigued right from the beginning, drawn into the story easily. Asimov's style of writing is fluid and engaging, easily allowing the reader to picture and understand everything. In addition the plot came together nicely and, in a simplistic complexity (oxymoron?), you were able to see the growth of the Foundation from a fledgling world to... well I won't reveal anything, suffice it to say the natural progression that Asimov portrayed fit together very nicely.My only complaints with Asimov, though, was that it did come together to nice and neat, never really engaging the reader to the extent of wondering, thinking, feeling and diving into the story. Instead you are almost lead from A to B to C without any guessing and wondering, without any involvement, with everything almost being a foregone conclusion. Add to this his style of writing is a bit simplistic, in that there isn't anything too complex, which isn't altogether bad because he backs it up with a fluid and believable plot that is more than enough to add credence to the story. In fact we've seen this in fantasy as well as David Eddings wrote simplistically but backed it up with a story that was enjoyable to read.I will definitely read Asimov again, especially the rest of the series, if only to what Asimov would do, being a pioneer of the genre. I would certainly recommend Asimov to anyone looking to start reading science fiction and/or a light, quick read. A recommend.3.75 stars."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire\\" by Issac AsimovTwo hundred years have passed of the 300 Hari Seldon predicted it would take for the Empire to fall. All things have gone according to the Seldon plan and the Foundation is one of the most powerful states in the galaxy. This might change though because there are 2 more Seldon Crises on the horizon.This is another good addition to Foundation trilogy but as is typically the case not quite as good as the first. Foundation and Empire covers the next period of time for the foundation when the Foundation is finally brought back to the attention of what remains of the Empire. The Empire has heard of the power the Foundation now wields and views them as a threat and two different generations of Empire men seek to remedy that threat...The Good: The same aspects that were good in the first are present in the second. The idea overall and the way each story unfolds is good. Foundation and Empire ends with a Cliffhanger of sorts or at least without true resolution which would appear to lead into the next book.The Bad: The characters are a little flat and though it isn't as problematic in Asimov's stories as it would be in others it is a little more problematic in this than in the first. It was a non issue in the fist book because there are 5 Seldon crises and hence 5 different groups of characters. The stories are event driven and not character driven so when 5 events are spread across one event driven book it works out. \\"Foundation and Empire\\" is similar in length to \\"Foundation (Foundation Novels)\\" but only covers 2 crises so we are forced to deal more with the flat characters and less with events in an event driven story. This in no way ruined the book as it was still very good but is just a highlight of one of the weaker points.Overall: If you liked Foundation you will probably enjoy Foundation and Empire. If that is the case pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov's \\"Foundation\\" was my favorite book in high school. I read the other 2 books afterwards, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\" right after, and by then Asimov finally finished what he started so long ago by writing new books to the Foundation saga, more Robot novels, and prequels. I am re-reading Foundation right now, only this time on my Kindle. It's just as good now as it was 20+ years ago. Asimov's novels remind me of Star Trek because the stories could probably fit in any time or place, including right now. My only issue is that Asimov is deceased for a number of years now. Other writers have tried to take on the challenge of continuing his stories but no one tells a story like Asimov!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Over the years I have read a great many books from many, many authors and yet the \\"Foundation\\" series pops back into my head somewhat regularly. I often wonder why it has not been made into a series of movies. After all in my mind it would rival \\"Star Wars\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\". Isaac Asimov was a gifted writer and I was fortunate to know his works while he still lived. Unfortunately I never got to meet the man. This series is some of the best stuff he ever wrote. It delves into humananity and how our unique abilities may sometimes stand out. In the case of \\"Foundation\\" it centers around one empire and it's unusual ruler that expands their domain beyond any other into the far reaches of space. It looks closely at how a handful of people truly make a difference in the scheme of things and what becomes of that empire. Another great series, the \\"Robot\\" series was later linked to this series and although I enjoyed the link not everyone may enjoy it. Nonetheless you should read the \\"Robot\\" series as well if you get the chance. I will be very surprised if after you set the \\"Foundation\\" series aside, it doesn't make you reflect on it the rest of your life. Excellent read from a master of SciFi."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"To me, the Foundation series is the greatest sci-fi series of all time. The earlier books are the best, as the latter books aren't as good. This is favorite of the earlier books.It's broken into two halves. The first half is pretty good, but it's really the second half, called The Mule, that's incredible. It's fantastic.It's style isn't like modern sci-fi, which is usually dark and action-packed. If that's what you're looking for, you won't enjoy this series. This series is much more about imagining a universe with a certain set of rules and how those rules might play out over time. To enjoy it, you have to think and imagine along with Asimov. If that \\"golden age\\" style sci-fi suites your taste, you will love this book.Obviously you can't read this book in isolation. You really need to read the Foundation before it and Second Foundation after it. The three togother make the best triology I've ever read. After those three, you can continue, but the quality of the books trails off from there.If you're a \\"golden age\\" sci-fi fan and somehow haven't already read the Foundation series, get the first three Foundation books. You'll really enjoy them, especially The Mule."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"You cannot help but be amazed while reading this book. A story than can hold 60 years and still feel like a believable future is simply astounding.This is the base and start point for many later science fiction stories, including Star Wars.Asimov was simply a genius. If you like science fiction or any book that is based on solid ideas, this one is an absolute must read.I waited like two minutes after I finished reading to get on-line and buy books two and three."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"If for whatever reason you were disappointed in Foundation, don't miss this book, it's so much better, more interesting, adventurous, and enteraining that you would really be missing out. This edition has battles, intrigue, humor, heroines, and just a real fun adventure."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov continues with his narration of the history of the interregnum between empires in pretty much the same anthology format used in Foundation. Actually, upon further thinking, there's probably no way really to tell the story of a 1,000 year journey on the part of humanity without doing it in snippets. More and more the series begins to read more like a history book with some dramatic events being highlighted for their importance as turning points. These turning points are called Seldon Crises, foreseen events by Hari Seldon, Psychohistorian, which impel the people of the Foundation forward to galactic dominance. Throughout the first book and a half, Asimov establishes a bit of fatalism - nothing can stop the foundation by historical imperative, and for that reason the people of the Foundation, especially it's leadership, become apathetic.Asimov throws a wrench into the status quo with the rise of a mutant, a statistical improbability and anomaly that could not possibly be accounted for in the creation of the Seldon Plan and therefore the first truly unknown quantity with the ability to destroy the Foundation. This mutant, called the Mule, has psychic ability and the great revival of technology in the Foundation is powerless to stop him from manipulating people and working his way to dominance. The Mule consolidates his power, takes over the Foundation and destroys the remnants of the former galactic empire and it looks like Seldon's prophecies could be wrong. That a single individual upset the 1,000 year plan to turn the Foundation into the Second Empire, in only 5 years.Asimov again explores the themes of individuality, stagnation, complacency and religion. Choice and free will are major foci for the novel. If the Seldon Plan is mathematically and psychologically accurate like a prophecy, if certain things are meant to happen, just because human beings will predictably react in the same ways in given situations, do we really have free will? What is the role of the individual in society in in the historical process? Asimov treats history like a Marxist, influenced by Hegelian dialectics. Conflicts and crises between opposing forces give birth to a third new status quo until it comes into conflict with an opposing force. These moments of intersection are the Crises predicted by Seldon and the focus of Asimov's 1,000 year narrative. But the Mule changes that. He challenges the notion of inevitability and proves the fallibility of Seldon's prophecies. But by doing so he introduces another free will paradox. The Mule has the ability to modify emotions and create complete loyalty in people. He wins victories by converting the opposing sides' generals and leaders into giving up and then serving him, destroying free will again by creating it out of the tight confines of the Seldon Plan. It's truly and interesting concept. How will the Mule be stopped? Enter: the Second Foundation. Established on the other side of the galaxy as a failsafe in case of the failure of the Foundation. But no record exists of where that foundation is or what type of society it will become. Will the Mule find it and destroy it? Does it exist after 300 years?My major problem throughout the narration is that it is assumed that the Seldon Plan represents the ideal in some way. Seldon was a human being, capable of manipulating and creating situations a millennia in advance and manipulating the fate of quadrillions of human beings. Who says his plan needs to be fulfilled? What if people don't want Seldon's future? What if they don't want to live in an all-encompassing empire? I would maybe believe Asimov wants you to question that, but he gives himself away in little asides in the narration, inserting emotional declamations against the upset of the Plan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read this as a youngster. I loved the idea, and the time vault opening at various times was brilliant. It's a bit slow, however, and there wasn't enough fighting for my tastes. I like the vast scale. This is space ships of the grand era, with galaxy-spanning empires. There aren't enough of these kinds of stories written these days."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"By now you should be familiar with psychohistory, and the exploits of Hari Seldon, Salvor Hardin, and Hober Mallow. If that first sentence just left you slightly confused then go pick up Isaac Asimov's \\"Foudation\\" before reading \\"Foundation and Empire\\". \\"Foundation and Empire\\" picks up where \\"Foundation\\" left off, with the First Foundation rapidly expanding throughout the galaxy. In \\"The General\\" (the first half of \\"Foundation and Empire), Foundation space bumps up against what remains of the old Empire, and the Foundation must square off with Bel Riose, the last great Empire general. This story is basically a continuation of the ideas started in \\"Foundation\\". \\"The General\\" is definitely the weaker of the two stories in \\"Foundation and Empire\\", however it is a necessary story to show the growing strength and influence of the First Foundation, as well as the decline of the Empire.\\"The Mule\\" (the second half of \\"Foundation and Empire\\") tells the story of the Mule, a mysterious galactic superpower who begins conquering planets in Foundation space. The leaders of the Foundation struggle against their new enemy, and try to figure what it is that makes the Mule so efficient and effective. Meanwhile, a small group of characters working for an underground group try to find the all important location of the Second Foundation before the Mule can beat them to it. The ending of \\"The Mule\\" is absolutely amazing, and the grand reveal at the end can be foreseen by an observant reader, which makes it all the more satisfying.In short, \\"Foundation and Empire\\", along with the rest of Asimov's Foundation Series, is a great science fiction story, beautifully blending advanced mathematical and scientific ideas with good ol' fashioned adventure. Some readers complain that Asimov's characters are not as deep as they could be, and they do have a point, but Asimov never wrote the Foundation books with the intent of having deep, realistic characters; it was all about the story and the ideas. If you are looking for strong characters in your science fiction then go read Heinlein, however if you are looking for a drop dead fantatic story propelled by great scientific speculation, then you can't go wrong with picking up \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and the rest of the Foundation Series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I have similar reactions to all of IA's books... that is simply that they are great fun, an easy and enjoyable read, but not terribly challenging in any respect.

Don't get me wrong- he does go after social issues and examines some things in interesting ways that can be somewhat eye-opening if you're the kind of person who never thinks that way, but it's just not earth-shattering.This sounds horrible... but I don't mean it to.

The series in all is great but this book tops them all. Imagine a combination of psychology and math used to predict the outcome of population mobs and how a man would apply it to an empire he sees falling apart (not really a spoiler cause that's a bit of what they tell you in first 2ish chapters). This book is great not just because of the idea but because the characters are relatable, face extremely difficult situations, and yet take what seems to be the only logical way out. I highly suggest you read this book and the whole series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The original Foundation trilogy is today revered as one of the best works of science fiction, by a veritable giant of the genre, Isaac Asimov. Begun originally as a series of eight short stories published in Astounding Magazine between 1942 and 1950, the first four were collected and published for the first time in 1951 under the title of Foundation.The Galactic Empire has ruled the galaxy in splendor, magnificence, and domination for the last twelve thousand years, but now its significant chapter is coming to a close; only no seems to realize this, except Hari Sheldon. Through the revolutionary science of psychohistory, Sheldon has calculated that in five centuries the empire will come to an end and the galaxy will devolve into a hostile, barbarian world that he has predicted to last thirty thousand years. But Sheldon has a plan to cut this time of the dark ages down to a mere millennium. It will take decades and centuries of planning, with the initial creation of the galactic encyclopedia, where all knowledge and record will be stored and kept for the future. To make this happen, he creates a small civilization on a remote planet that he names Foundation. Only through the years and decades, warlords rise up around the galaxy, looking to take down the Foundation, and it is up to Sheldon's planning for the encyclopedia and this small civilization to survive.In Foundation, Asimov doesn't focus greatly on complex character development (or female characters of merit, for that matter), but takes the sociological made-up science of psychohistory and has fun with exploring just what one can do with a world over a period of decades.Originally written on February 4, 2011.Go to[...]for over 500 book reviews and over 50 exclusive author interviews."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second of the first Foundation trilogy, Foundation and Empire was originally published in 1952.

It begins a thousand-year project that, through the cleaver acions of the protagonists, attempts to save humanity from a prolonged and chaotic interstellar Dark Age that was bound to follow the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Through the use of a mathematical application on history(as well as psychology and sociology) called Pschohistory, the founder of that field of study (Hari Seldon) developed a plan to truncate the Dark Age period from 10,000 years to 1,000 years.He begins this plan by setting up a colony on a planet at the rim of the galaxy called Terminus called the Foundation. From then on the inhabitants and their descendants of Terminus choose certain actions and follow certain policies that do not always make sense to the reader until or to other characters. Sometimes the Foudation seems to be self-desctructing or that the leaders are being treacherous. But not is all that it seems. Every once in a while, sometimes after 50 years, or 30 years, the Foudation is in a situation that either spells destruction or conquest by a neighboring kingdom. This is referred to as a Seldon Crisis. This is usually a turning point in the Foudation's path of history that was calcutaed by Seldon and part of his plan to bring about the New Galactic Empire after the fall of the old one. The important part is that Seldon Crises or the events thta bring them about are done through clever acts of political, economic or diplomatic manipulation. (Even psychological) What is most important to the plan is that Seldon needed the Foundation to be unaware of the path the people of Terminus must take. Thus, there are few social and psychological scholars to notice the trends and provide warning. THis way the actions taken are contolled for the sake of executing the Seldon plan.I did enjoy the book and will be reading and reportin on the sequels in the future. I thought it was cleaver and insightful on human nature as wellas a good understaning of history without hitting me over the head with it. The collapse of the Galactic Empire, which stretches into the sequels, is a clear reference to the long (relatively) fall of fthe Roman Empire. It seems that just like the Romans, the Galactic Empire will not be comquerds in on campaign liike Alexander did to Persia, but instead eveolve into another form of civilation with competeing factions comparable to the Catholic Church, the absolute (so-called) ruling kings, the nobles, the equestrians, and the outside threats such as muslim caliphs. The book was originally published in 1951 AD so it did not anticpate specifc technologies and the referce to nuclear power as \\"atomics\\" is a bit outdated. I would have hoped for nuclear fusion or the equivalent of such an epic transfornmation. Also, a bigger role for women characters other than the harpie wife of a foriegn aggressor in the book would have been nice. Maybe because I was reading Steig Larsson and some Star Wars novels recently I had gotten used to female protagonsts and antagonists. But FOUNDATION was written long ago and the audience for this genre was and may still be male dominated. There are sequels and prequels to for me to explore and for Asimov to redeem himself. JK. (Observe, I wrote one of those texting acronyms.) I just hope every character does not have sound like Isaac Asomov. (as much as love him) Out of a galaxy, I give it 878,124,550,100 stars. That is fairly good."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Slow on the pick up as many of the early characters are not developed very well making it difficult to sink into. However, about midway through, things begin to get going and characters are finally given time enough to develop. After that point is really when the book becomes a classic and hard to put down; even if it has aged. A classic by any accounts even with it's few bumps."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I liked this book. I don't really have anything profound to say, I'm only writing a review because for some reason Amazon is not giving me the option of rating the book without a review.Asimov seems to have an interesting twist on European history in this book, as the events that occur in it seem to parallel the fall of the Roman Empire, the successor Germanic kingdoms, and the rise of the merchant class in the Renaissance. Understanding the history of Western Civilization probably has given me a fun comparison to Asimov's fictional Galactic history."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation clearly deserved its awards and recognition for being a classic science fiction novel. The creative and unique story line presents the reader a sensation of the future. In the beginning of the book, Hari Seldon was introduced as a psychohistorian and mathematician who could chart the future of the human race for tens of thousands of years. He predicted a decline of the Galactic Empire, which had lasted for twelve thousand years, into a state of disorder and barbarism for the next thirty thousand years. Hari Seldon then established the Foundation to serve as the purpose of shortening the period of chaos into a single millennium or less.The book was extremely enjoyable and the pages went by fast. However, the only problem I had was that once I got to know the characters, the story went on to a situation a couple decades later with new characters. Though it bothered me, the way the author wrote his novel was necessary to put a whole century's plot into a book. Despite the many characters in the story, the author created a distinct personality for each. Yet, each of the leaders in the different parts of the book were similar in a way; they all dealt with conflict extremely calmly and ingeniously. They cleverly manipulated their enemies with their words and were always prepared against threats or opposition. They knew how to win the people's votes even when they were in a weak position to run for a government position. I could not help but to ponder about what I would have done in each of the situations. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone that likes science fiction or anyone who likes reading about how characters cleverly solve their problems."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I think this is a great book by itself and worth the time in reading it but if you have time I would recommend reading the whole series. If you do that you might want to start with &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; but you don't have to. Pick up this book right away!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Re-reading Foundation showed it to be rather dated in its depiction of an advanced galactic empire, rooted in its 1940s science fiction environment. The overall plot, such as it is, betrays the novel's origins as separate short stories, and the characters tend to be wooden. Foundation and Empire, the next book in Asimov's original Foundation trilogy, is a much better novel, especially in its depiction of the character of the Mule. However, the concept of psychohistory introduced in this work is fascinating and the key to the other books by Asimov and others describing past and future developments in the Foundation universe."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"For beginners into this serie of Asimov, know that their are other books before Foundation, and they are all tied-up.-----------------&lt;Robot serie&gt;:I, Robot/ The Caves of Steel/ The Naked Sun/ The Robots of Dawn/ Robots and Empire&lt;Bridging novel&gt;:Tyrann&lt;Foundation series&gt;:Foundation/ Foundation and Empire/ Second Foundation/ Foundation's Edge/ Foundation and Earth----------------Some highligths:-I, Robot: The beginning of the robots themselves-The Robots of Dawn: Early mention of psychohystory as a possible new field-Robots and Empire: The Earth starts becoming unlivable-Tyrann: A view between the two series ('Robot' &amp; 'Foundation').

We understand the ultimate fate of Earth, robots and humanity."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"On first reading of this trilogy, starting with Foundation, I was a bit bored by the politics. But all three books were in one volume, so I kept reading. I'm glad I did! Every time I've read them since, I discover something new to love. The ending of this book blew my mind! If there is such a thing as a literary high, I was on one for a week after reading this eight years ago. No book or movie you can name comes close to this kind of thrill or scope. And just when I thought Asimov couldn't take it any further, he does, with a character's last statement. By now the Foundation has gained dominance over its surrounding enemies. All part of Hari Seldon's (the Foundation's founder) Plan. And they are strong enough to face the Empire. The first half of the book is a power struggle of the leaders of the Empire, more politics, and a small band of traders, rebels, and scholars, who wait for the coming of the &quot;magicians&quot; to someday be their saviors. The second half of the book follows a small group of people belonging to the Democratic Underground who expect major political changes for the next Seldon Crisis. They hear of a man who calls himself the Mule. Generals surrender to him without a fight. His worst enemies become his most faithful subordinates. They seek him out, thinking he can help their cause. No one can explain the success of the Mule. Where did he come from? Was he planned by Hari Seldon? Hari Seldon appears, as before, as a hologram, explaining the crisis and the course of action. But he makes no mention of the Mule. Everything has gone awry, and Seldon's plan is out of whack, and the galaxy might revert to the 30,000 years of barbarism Seldon was trying to avoid. Hari Seldon counted on several things, that there would be no major changes in the galaxy's technology, such as something that could withstand any bombardment, or strange neurobiological weapons; and, that human reaction to stimuli would remain constant. If it's not the first, it must be the second-- the Mule has mental powers. How do they fight him? By seeking out this Second Foundation. Hari Seldon mentioned it vaguely, but there is no record of its purpose, and no proof of its existence. This same small band from the D.U., including a psychologist (as the Foundation considers one), set off to the center of what's left of the Empire, The planet/city Trantor, to search Seldon's records. The whole time managing to stay out of the way of the Mule's path of destruction, and ends with the awesome climax I mentioned. Does the Second Foundation even exist? What is their purpose? The psychologist, working on overdrive, seems to have found its location. &quot;It was so simple,&quot; he said. But he doesn't live to reveal his discovery. Did he really find it, or was his mind too distorted to make any sense? There are more surprises and excitement to come in the trilogy's third installment, Second Foundation. Some people have the gall to call these books wordy or boring. Keep in mind that Lord of the Rings had its slow parts, too, but the few exciting parts are what you remember and hold it all together. It's better to take these books as a whole. For that, one is not necessarily better than the other two, they are all essential to the whole story line. Perhaps someday we can look forward to a mutilated Hollywood version, then go back and re-read the books, and hold them dear to our hearts."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I thought the book was somewhat dull compared to the first &quot;Foundation&quot; novel, because there are no brilliant characters such as Salvor Hardin or Hober Mallow and no great accomplishments. The first part of the book about Foundation's struggle against the Empire is not impressive. The second part about the Mule was moving sort of slow until a brilliant ending. I was absolutely shocked at it and I thought that it was definitely worth reading the entire novel for the ending. In fact the emotion that I experienced must have been something like what people influenced by the Mule felt! I also realized I had a great affection for the Mule, it is fabulous that a person who is predicted to be a pathetic loser in life makes it beyond all expectations. I know that the Mule is supposed to be a bad guy, so now that I am reading &quot;Second Foundation&quot; I hope that its ending would not be overly dramatic for him."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This story is a very detailed, accurate and plausible one, with enough depth and complexity to remain entertaining even after many re-readings."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is one of the best developed and interesting books I've ever read"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is astonishing! Foundation was great, but this book was even better. I was hooked from the moment I started reading. It immedietly strung together details in the first book which I thought were meaningless. Although the war between Foundation and Empire was good, the best parts of the book was the story of the Mule. This was one kick-a** story! The moment when everyone found out that Hari Seldon's plan had gone wrong in the Vault was one of the series' finest written moments, and the end, oh don't even get me started about the end of the book. I won't spoil it for you, but it is a great plot twist!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"From Selvor Hardin taking power from the encyclopedists to Hober Mallow conquering Korell by doing absolutely nothing, I found this to be the best sci-fi novel ever. Ender's Game and Dune don't hold a candle to it. Each story is a 10 on it's own. The way the foundation grabs victory from apparent defeat is amazing. Even though Isaac Asimov (my favorite sci-fi author) has nuclear power be able to do anything, it doesn't take away from the story. It's the best book of the foundation series for sure. If you read sci-fi, you've got to read this."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"If you consider Star Wars as George Lucas's answer to Asmiov's \\"Foundation\\" then this is very much in the mode of Episode V. Asimov spent the first book building up his psychohistory paradigm just to knock it down in Foundation and Empire. A much darker and more intense book, downbeat in mood, and leading to the inevitable conclusion in Second Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is certainly an excellent \\"first\\" book in the Asimov series. Even if one has not read, Prelude to Foundation, you can pick up right up and enjoy the series. Sets the stage for the next books in the series, but also makes one think, \\"What would happen if America lost its power sources?\\""},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I feel that this is Asimov's best book. He is not known to let you get too close to any of his characters to feel for them in any sense of the way, EXCEPT the Mule. Out of all the Asimov books, I feel that this one is closest to being ready to become a movie (I am not sure why I, Robot and Bicentennial Man were before this one). If you have not read this one, you are in for a treat. If you have read this one, then you know it should be added to your collection."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the first book of the outstanding Foundation Trilogy. Asimov builds drama with believable characters struggling against bureaucracies and political manipulations on a grand scale. As a central government weakens, planets often show less respect for the core authorities and go there own way, sometimes forming their own alliances. Hari Seldon, master of Psychohistory, uses Psychohistory to make predictions far into the future. Hari Seldon does more than predict outcomes--he has a plan. Seldon does not expect to alter the eventual course of huge historical events, but constructs a strategy to minimize the length of time of the darkest days for the Galactic Empire.The emphasis of the book, and what makes the book a true science fiction classic, is the imagination that takes the reader through mind whirring possibilities for the future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The great thing about Foundation is it's scope. It's a bit unsettling at times that you don't really get to know a character considerably well as the parts of the book break down over the span of several generations, but reading everything unfold and the implications that the events have in the long term is really fascinating.Asimov's writing is a mixed bag. It's imaginative and has a great vision. But at times the people seem too... squeaky-clean to be people. Every character seems unrealistically eloquent and proper and the dialogue doesn't fall too far from what I'd imagine Asmiov may say himself. There are few differences between the characters in regards to linguistic tendancies. Also, and I know the book was first published in the early 50's, but there are hardly any women even mentioned in Foundation and they certainly don't play significant or visible roles.It's still quite imaginative and quite good, in spite of these flaws. I understand Asimov was my age (21) when he began writing Foundation, so taking that in consideration it seems like an even more awesome literary feat."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"\\"Foundation and Empire,\\" the second in a trilogy of classic science fiction novels by Isaac Asimov, is a must read for historians of science fiction. For those who like science fiction itself, this volume is also valuable. Asimov can madden, especially in his early novels, but his imagination is wonderful. His strength is conceptualizing systems (whether empires or cultures) and he often plays with big ideas.I first read the trilogy while in college, and was fascinated. This triggered a long-lasting interest in the fiction of Isaac Asimov (and some of his non-fiction works, as well).Those familiar with this trilogy know that the key character is psychohistorian Hari Seldon, who believes that one can predict the behavior of large masses of people via mathematical equations and, thus, predict how events will develop in the future.This book is a bridge between the novel \\"Foundation\\" and the third in the series, \\"Second Foundation.\\" And, of course, later in his career, Asimov returned to the Foundation well--with more interesting and literary results. Indeed, in one of the great tour de forces in science fiction, he ends up linking two classic series--the robot works and the Foundation series. But I'm getting way ahead of myself.This novel focuses on two instances--one, the rise of a youthful and talented military leader who goes after the Foundation. And, just as Hari Seldon's mathematical equations predicted, he failed. The logic for this is classic Asimov, and is why he was so entertaining to read, even though his characters have little life in these works and even though his writing style is, at best, functional in these works (he improved with time).Then, there is the case of the Mule, where Seldon's equations failed in prediction. And that itself is fascinating, as explained in this novel. Thus, the comparison of the correct prediction and the failed prediction add some real heft to Asimov's tale of the rise of the Foundation as the Empire slowly descends to its end.For those who have never read Asimov, the Foundation trilogy is a good place to get a sense of his talents, of seeing big pictures. His writing style is not great, but the images of this future that he developed are compelling. I still enjoy going back to the Foundation series, the Robot series, and their fusion as Asimov's vision evolved."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Any fan of science fiction needs to read this series. For lack of a better work, this is one of the foundations of the genre. Asimov is one of (if not the) best authors of SF and this is one of his best works.

The invention of the science of psychohistory captivated me the first time I read it. Basically, all those with an interest in SF should check this out.Asimov's intro gives some history of the evolution of this series with his editor, Campbell, as well as some entertaining silliness by the publisher Doubleday.

While I disagree with the unimportance of the individual (after all, wasn't Hari Seldon himself one person who changed history), it does show the travails as a small group of Foundationers try to stop the General, when he is stopped by the very corrupt bureaucracy he serves.In the second, he brings in a new factor. The Foundation, secure and dominant but not agressive, is threatened by the Mule, a person who can control the emotions of others, reshape them into whatever he wants. Part of a slightly more fantastic area of Science Fiction, he still pulls it off well. This time it does come down to individual effort again to stop the Mule, by opponents who could not defeat him one on one but do so by their determination and individual organization.This time, he did not labor under the false assumption that he had to write a limited number of pages, so he was able to flesh out the characters more and make the plot twists more intricate, and did a truly excellent work."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"First I will detail the faults of this book. It is too brief. Mr. Asimov was working under the assumption that he had to keep it under a certain length, and so abbreviated it unfairly, cutting certain amounts of plot and character development.That aside, this book is excellent, showing the struggle against adversity and brains versus brute force that is so lacking in most modern literature. It is true that Science Fiction is the Modern version of Romantic (the time period) literature, and Asimov carried the beacon."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"While the book does offer a promising premise, the necessary jumps from one point in time to another do not make for a pleasant read. The very first time I attempted to read the book, I was unable to get much further than the first part (The Psycho- Historians). As soon as you begin to get used the characters, a shift takes place. Unfortunately, this happens again and again. When you read Foundation, it becomes neccesary to think of each of the five parts as a short story.While the story was displayed in the best way I could imagine, the classic simply did not live up to my expectations. The emphasis is on the plot, and very little is put into the characters. While the book has it's flaws, I find it simply amazing when the date it was published is taken into consideration. Put simply, it's like the majority of 'classics' out there; while they were astounding in their own time, they simply can't stand up to the best of modern modern literature out there."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read this book when I was young, perhaps in my early 20's. I remember it as astounding, but recall little of it's content. In my early 30's, I went through and reread the entire trilogy straight through, which by then was a total of seven books. I believe Isaac is a true genius beyond most any man of our age. His insight into politics, religion, society, hope, hatred, love, friendship is beyond most anything I have known. And how he was able to incorporate these things into a series of books about the future of humanity nearly overwhelms me when I consider it. Most of what happens in the world, especially in the world of technology, has been shown in his books. It seems as if he must have has a direct link to the future."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Fifteen years ago, this book was the zenith of SF to me. Today, I know there are many better books. But you should read it anyway, it's a classic. You can't be taken seriously in any SF discussion if you aren't familiar with the great Foundation.Isaac Asimov is, of course, a very skilled writer. Most SF writers allow themselves embarrassing blunders that make their universes physically absurd. In this book, you're not likely to find anything like that. To really appreciate Mr. Asimov's genius, you should read other SF novels written in the same time. Nearly all of them look ridiculous in the year 2000. Mr. Asimov's books don't. If you wouldn't know, you couldn't tell that the book was written half a century ago."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"After the Seldon Plan was followed, without its followers actually understanding what was going on, the Empire, although falling, is still the mightiest force in the Galaxy and the only challenge to the Foundation.

A masterpiece... Isaac Asimov is the master writer. As for the book's plot itself, Hari Seldon's psychohistory plan, which can predict the future of humanity, is being used as the Galactic Empire falls. The Seldon Plan, if followed, predicts that the 30,000 years of barbarism with no Empire can be reduced to 1,000, but the Plan takes utmost wisdom to keep on track, long after Seldon is dead."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Despite all the hype and negativity due to popularity backlash none can honestly admit that Asimov made a mundane focus for his writing passions when he wrote and then published the stories that comprise 'Foundation'. Since I read this epic book in eighth grade it has stuck with me due to the relation of structural decay and rebirth in a future universe that mirrors our own rather perochial existance. The serendipity and foresight combining thought and action to build a better future for mankind in the Milky Way galaxy will leave the experienced, educated readers feeling they have witnessed the true future of our reality. This is a truely brilliant effort of science fiction as are many of Asimov's early works. Shame on the nay sayers."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A trilogy consists of three books so, even although &quot;Foundation&quot; (one of the true classics) is good enough to be a trilogy by itself, formally &quot;Foundation&quot; needed two more volumes to make up a trilogy. In these two volumes the level does not fall off too badly, although &quot;the Mule&quot; is rather weak.Unfortunately Asimov, one of the truly greats of SF, later succumbed to undue pressure and combined his Robot-series (already in itself continued too long) with the Foundation, with outright embarrassing results. The original three books were quite enough, thank you!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"So adictive that you finish it in 3 days, maximum. But the better is...

The invincible foundation is overrun, the land of your beloved characters is defeated!&lt;pr&gt;And THAT'S just the start of the fun! This book is so well written and Asimov's universe is so well developed, you fell as if your there when the troops of &quot;The Mule&quot; land. You want to scream as the Foundation is defeated, and when you finish this book, you want to fly to the nearest bookstore to get the next one in the series.&lt;pr&gt;This story is amazing. Asimov has long been regarded as the best there is, the foundation series has long been reguarded as Asimov's best, and this book is the best of the foundation trilogy. IF you don't read it, you should never forgive yourself."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov is often said to have a flat style and to be unable to create credible characters. It's my opinion. And Asimov is never more ridiculous than when he writes about feelings, especially about love (scenes seem to be described by a child or a thinking machine). But this writer is still gifted at setting clever plots every reader will enjoy, for instance in his robots tales (of course do not expect more than a quality entertainment, as often with sci-fi). However, Fondation is not really a clever book ; it is not boring, but it has poor content. You will finish it but probably won't read it again. First problem, it is impossible to believe in psychohistory, which smells like positivist propaganda from the 19th century. And because he has nothing more than an adventure story to tell, Asimov uses all kinds of tricks to grip the reader, including lots of surprises justified by unlikely and twisted arguments, some of which you may find hard to swallow. To conclude, Fondation is a kind of cartoon : a succession of sketches, rather funny but unlikely. If you still absolutely want to read the book, don't read Dune before. As regards depth, writing, and imagination the two books are separated by lightyears."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Right where a character talks about his old age of sixty-two years.Yeah, right. An advanced galactic civilization, thousands of years old, with FTL travel and turnkey exoplanets just right for human habitation everywhere, never bothered to find medical treatments for aging. That might have sounded plausible in science fiction 60+ years ago, but much less so today. The novel also suffers from a lot of faults which other reviewers have noted. Perhaps Asimov's stories blew geeks' minds in the 1940's and 1950's, but his work hasn't aged well.BTW, Asimov, Heinlein, Clarke, Carl Sagan and a lot of other scientifically knowledgeable people in the mid 20th Century accepted the existence of exoplanets based on NO evidence at all until the mid 1990's, while at the same time criticizing similar claims without evidence as woo-woo. Just by coincidence the exoplanet faith position happened to resemble observable reality somewhat - but it didn't have to. Even then, the existence of so many \\"hot Jupiters\\" surprised a lot of astronomers involved in the hunt for exoplanets. Exoplanetologists may not find plausible earthlike planets for many years."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Political space tales aren't really my thing, but I must say that, politics aside, I was astonished that Asimov was so young when he wrote this. Few writers can write such good prose before middle-age. The story itself is rather mundane for a true sci-fi enthusiast. You'll not find any great discoveries by astronaut explorers or the like, but what it does do, it does well. His treatment of religion is silly though, and like most atheist writers, it's not very well thought out. I've not read anything else by him, but one hopes his later novels were better developed in that area. The mystical hints that run through nearly all of Arthur C Clarke's stories are the most intriguing thing about them. Asimov would have done well to have studied them."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The time frame in which the book takes place can best be described as &quot;A Long time ahead, in a galaxy far far away&quot;. Yes, that is a cheesy Star Wars cliche. However, readers expecting anything star warsey about this should expect to be sorely disappointed. This book focuses primarily on politics. There is not one ounce of violence in the book, which is a good thing, it is a nice break from almost everyother contemporary scifi novel, which all seem to impress people with their space ships 'n' aliens. The book is very good, but sometimes does get a little boring. I suppose this may be my fault, as I do have a short attention span. Anyhow, this book does a few twists in it, as everything may not be what it seems with Hari Seldons dream!So if you've been on the fringe of being a sci fi fan, but detest the embarassment of carrying around a book with giant robots on it, this book is for you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is my all-time favourite book. It is so amazing, especially the science Asimov created. And it made sense too! The story is awesome, and leaves you wanting more. This book (and the next two) beat of Lord of the Rings for all-time sci-fi/fantasy trilogy. Hopefully it will be made into a movie one day. Might even beat out LOTR with oscars too. It is a must read for anyone who loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The greatest sequel ever! With a powerful storyline and surprise ending, the book leads right into the Second Foundation"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"But Asimov is one of the greatest science-fiction authors to have every lived. His massive work adding itself to works by other such sci-fi masters: &quot;Childhood's End&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; as well as the more modern cyberpunk works like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Prey&quot;, and &quot;Cyber Hunter&quot;. All are must-reads for any hardcore science-fiction and cyberpunk collector."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is amazing science fiction novel. Asimov's straightforward and simple way of writing presents the reader with a concise and well formed novel. The plot is amazing with its many twists and turns, although the character development isn't very strong. However, the lack in character development comes from Asimov's style of writing in which he presents the reader with several major characters. The entire book revolves around foreshadowing of a point in history where knowledge will be lost and barbarians will rule over an ingorant civilization. In order to shroten the period of ignorance and barbarianism, Hari Seldon forms the Foundation, a group of scholars on a planet at the edge of the galaxy. Asimov uses foreshadwing to great effect throughout the entire novel to form the plot. Another device well used by asimov is symbolism. One example is the Foundation, which is used as a symbol for hope for the future. The symbols placed throughout the novel bring about a sense of profound revelation to the reader. Irony is also used very effectively in one instance. When the encyclopedists realize that all their work was all in vain, Asimov reveals the fragility of the human intellect. He explains how the composition of human knowledge is not in one single person, but is spread out throughout all of humanity, and cannot be contained within one book or one set of books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is the best scifi, besides Dune. The book is so witty and so indepth. The story is great the writting is great, i strongly recamend this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The original Foundation trilogy won the Hugo for the best series of all time. It deserved it. For those who like &quot;hard&quot; (science-driven) sci-fi as opposed to emotion-driven sci-fi, this is a must. Actually, the premise is not as outrageous as it first appears... We can all vaguely predict the general reaction of the human race to a certain idea, which means it does follow some rules. It would be difficult, but not impossible, to find some generalised maths to describe it, but the rewards would certainly justify it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This review is intended for the entire Foundation trilogy and as such this series of books even though written in pieces in Science Fiction magazines is woven together in an astonishingly complex web of ideas and mystery. This series stands as the epitome of the science fiction classic, what science fiction should be about and how it should be written. As a classic it is only superseded by &quot;Dune&quot; and only a few others come close eg &quot;Ender's Game&quot; (Orson Scott Card) series and the &quot;Galactic Milieu&quot; series (Julian May). The whole series is epic and yet does not loose sight of the characters or the story which is all important in science fiction, without it the wizz-bang effect takes hold and the whole thing collapses, eg Terminator could not have been held together without the excellent storyline. Other examples of great science fiction stories include &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and &quot;Alien&quot; both of which had great stories without a reliance on effects which some films have done eg the extra added graphics to the original Star Wars and too much graphics in Episode 1.These stories also provide a fascinating tale of science yet to come such as psychohistory which totally fascinated me when I read about it and some other physicists I have known. The possibilities are incredible a science of probabilistic mathematics used to predict the future given historical events. In addition we are of course confronted with the politics and the usual human weaknesses including greed, corruption and the like, much akin to the degenerate aspects of the Roman Empire. The new mathematics of psychohistory developed by Hari Seldon working on Trantor and trying to set up the two Foundations to at least control the eventual collapse and fall of humanity into a dark age and the Mule the one person not predicted by the original theory who is the defeated through remarkable twists and turns in the story which is full of intrigue and mystery, simply unputdownable. I have read the books many times and will do so again although psychohistorical mathematics is beyond current attainability I believe, but then maybe not.Other books are judged next to this."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I've seen a few bad reviews of Isaac Asimov's Foundation and it grieves me, really grieves me. When Isaac Asimov first came up with the idea for his Foundation series it was planned that he would write the future history of our galaxy. It could be said that it was an experiment in a method of writing fiction.If Asimov's characterizations or scenery descriptions seem bland or garish to some readers, that's because Asimov's focus was on the story. Despite Foundation's original ad hoc nature, I have read no other series which has so intricately weaven the elements of the plot so finely together. Alone, the novel Foundation may seem mundane, and it may not be your best bet if you're seeking instant gratification. But together - together with the other two books in the trilogy, together with the two later written sequels, together with the later two written prequels, together with his other bodies of work which have been woven into an expansive interplay of stories and plot, together with three &quot;pre&quot;prequels written posthumously by outside authors, I know no greater complicated work that brings with it such depth and expansiveness.In short, Foundation, serves as a sounding board for a series of future historical accounts. And Asimov never fails to deliver suspense, drama, and surprise throughout them.But that's just my biased opinion ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"So, you're thinking about delving into Science Fiction and you just don't know where to start.Start with Asimov's _Foundation_. Simply put, this is where science fiction starts. You will be introduced to the concept of a vast, complex history of a civilization which is certainly not Planet Earth... and, get this, it was written several decades before we sent anyone to the moon.And there's more... Foundation leads to an entire trilogy which leads to another trilogy which, get this, actually leads you back to Planet Earth.Five stars. Possibly more."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I would recommend this series to anyone. Asimov is a great writer, who's very prolific (He's written over 400 books! ) This is the start of his Foundation series which is a well-developed series detailing the fall of a Galactic Empire and one man's attempt to shorten the dark ages that are to come after the fall. For those of you who like hard sci-fi this is the series for you."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"i loved this book and how the 2 great cultures of new and old me"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The foundation series isthe second best sci-fi series ever (clarke's rama series is the first) This is an awsome book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I put Asmimov's Foundation series among the finest science fiction ever written. Up there with Lord of the Rings. His brillance is amazing and he takes you into a world of the future that makes sense."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a reread for me (I read it way back when I was in high school), and to be honest, I can't decide if I liked it more then or if I liked it more now. Which probably means that I felt the same way about it both times.Which is that it is a well-written, intriguing work of thoughtful science fiction.When it comes down to it, Foundation is the type of science fiction that I SHOULD love. It takes place in a believable, scary future, Earth isn't remembered or maybe doesn't even exist, the entire galaxy is populated, and there are lots of cool future gadgets. More than that, it is filled with intelligent people who have to think in interesting, convoluted ways to make the things that happen happen. It even starts off with a mathematician - brilliance!And that is why I DID love this book - I loved trying to figure out how the people were going to think or how they were thinking and what conclusions this would lead them to. It was like a mystery, but one in which you just have to unravel intelligence. The narrative flows beautifully, and the plot is just complex enough to keep you exited and thinking without feeling like Asimov was trying too hard.When it comes down to it, Foundation really is the perfect science fiction novel, and it's no wonder that it won the Hugo and was named \\"Best Science Fiction Series of All Time.\\"But (you knew there was a but coming), I'm not the hugest fan of short stories, and Foundation is, essentially, a series of short stories. Granted, the short stories are so well-linked that you sometimes forget, but when it comes down to it, each chapter is a new story. In each chapter, at least 50 years have passed since the last one, entirely new characters are introduced, and the old ones, for the most part, are rarely mentioned again. The thing linking them is Harri Seldon and the Foundation that he created. It is because of this that, even though I loved it, I can't say that I LOVED it.Still, Foundation is one tight piece of work, and I would recommend it to any and all lovers of science fiction. I mean, when it comes to science fiction, this is it! And I know I'll be rereading the others in the series as well!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I've come to start with four stars as I note that no book is perfect; considering this is just a story, it can't be perfect. My giving a book much less this one four stars is no knock on it.Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clark are considered the beginning of 'hard' sci-fi. It's not strictly true as there were guys like H.G. Wells Jules Verne and might I add Johannas Kepler? There's also the Frankenstein story. A point I want to make here is that it seems that nobody has been able to follow in their footsteps! Why? They didn't necessarily mean to just be scientificaly accurate. Their message was scientific humanism. It's the philosophy of being scientific that is portrayed in their books and not just robots and spaceships.Something else that needs to be pointed out is the difference between Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke. Some would suggest that Arthur C. Clark was more technically sophisticated than Isaac Asimov. Was Arthur C. Clark really all that technically sophisticated in his books? He had guys shooting through a vacuum to get to an A.I. computer gone haywire! Isaac Asimov has faster than light travel by means of space folding in his foundation books(a prediction that may not be so far off . . . in either technical accuracy or time; meaning it could happen sooner than you think!); he has mind reading; we have the ability to plus computers into brains and read what they're thinking and saying now; it's not mass produced(yet); but, it's there. I for one only liked Isaac's first volume of his foundation books because he has this mind-reading which I didn't like; well, what do I know?What seems to continue to set Isaac Asimov's Foundation appart is that of a galactic empire and how it dies(human neglect of rationalism). It should be noted that Isaac managed to connect his foundation books with his empire and robot books; so, he shows how intelligence really grows to dominate a galaxy, and then shows social ways that it can crumble(inspired by the fall of the roman empire).Despite Isaac's reliance on nuclear power as the high technology of the day, his foundation books symbolizes the real issues facing humanity and not what you get on the news channels(actual politics channels; they just call them news channels); they seem to argue for the same things each election year but never solve the same problems! Meanwhile, the science world keeps on chugging(word?lol!) along."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"one would be hard pressed to find better sci-fi in the last 60 years than the foundation novels. what amazing insight these books had."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I like science fiction in a generalized idea, but sometimes in particular it doesn't work. I think this is mainly because I see two kinds of science fiction. One is what are essentially westerns in space. The second tries to give perspective on the current times by creating some sort of objective viewpoint on current events by giving it distance in space or time. Asimov is more of the second one. I haven't read much of his work as an adult, but I did like his short stories as a child in magazines. Genre stories, until lately, haven't had any pull in the academy so they don't get studied or legitimized scholastically. I like this second kind much better.I like this book, the first of a trilogy and the foundation for several others (pun intended). Asimov explores our relation to information and the predictability of the future based on full information awareness. I will read more of these books, perhaps the whole series because I enjoyed and was tantalized by the possibilities of action in the future of the series. However, one interesting thing is that although Asimov was looking to the future, he was still a product of his time. When he was writing, the technology was nuclear and the future was nuclear. Thus, the future Empire is ruled by nuclear technology. Compare, for example, the cyber-punk fascination with computer technology as a driving force. Computers are almost absent from the world of the Empire and the Foundation. Instead, there are still newspapers (96) and messages are transferred physically. At the very least, if you take this as a futurological document, humanity abandoned mythological superstition. So - you have to read this book as both a look into the future and a historical document. Asimov is a fantastic writer, but he couldn't overcome the limitations of his time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Parts of the book I really enjoyed. I appreciate the twists played by characters on one another. I felt that after reading through the entire bit, though, that not enough had actually taken place. I didn't feel I walked away with a story I could remember. I did read in one review that this was \\"serious science fiction,\\" so with that in mind, I still give it five stars. I only would have liked that the pace be quicker.I really really enjoyedThe Hitch Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy. I would recommend that over this book Foundation, based on my personal taste."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation series is one of the most renowned arcs in all of science fiction. Spanning several volumes, and thousands of years of time, Asimov provides us with a blueprint for our own decadent, ailing society--a prevention, if you will, against the society of the 21st century, as realized later by men like Stephen Baxter inTitan.In the billion-star inclusive Galactic government, Hari Seldon, a brilliant mathematician, devised a way to accurately plot the future by analyzing past events, trends, and movements in human history. Branded a madman, he and his followers are given a kind of half-exile, half-grant to the planet Terminus, to found their Foundation, which, it seems, is to be a focal point of knowledge for Seldon's predicted coming galactic catastrophe.But is that all the Foundation is? A glorified university?Asimov is the herald of a new age, filled with robots, spacetravel and weird technologies beyond our understanding, and sometimes, even our imagination. A thinker, philosopher, and theologian, Asimov's books are chock-full of singular personality and wit.I recommend Foundation as necessary-reading to any fan of science-fiction who has somehow escaped it thus far. You will NOT be unimpressed."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I never imagined it would have been so political. I also never imagined I'd enjoy a political story so much. The characters are brilliant and well written. I was concerned for them despite how quickly Asimov moved on to the next group. It's more realistic this way than to have just one protagonist that you know will make it to the end of the book. This story take place over a long period of time, though it provides for a surprisingly quick read. A good balance of action and brain stimuli. (Not for adrenaline junkies.)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the only book I have ever read twice. The second time around, I was shocked to realize that not much ever happens. There is something about this series that makes it one of the best I have ever read but I am not sure what it is."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Having always been a big Asimov fan, (after readingmany of hisshort stories, along with some of the Robot series) I was very excited to start reading the Foundation series. The Foundation series describes a world in which humans live on planets throughout the galaxy. In this world, the 12,000-year old Empire is in decline, and Hari Seldon has established a Foundation in the corner of the galaxy in order to reconquer and rebuild a new empire after the current one dies -- he estimates the intermediary period of barbarism can be reduced from 30,000 years to only 1,000.Going into the first book of the series, I have to say I had high expectations, but this book managed to exceed them. Many people complain about the character development in these novels, but while each of the five stories introduced new characters, I still found each set of characters to be interesting in very important ways. Throughout these stories, the question of individuality is touched on: are these characters merely following Seldon's plan with no ability to shape events, or are our heroes shaping their futures through their decisions? I have only read Foundation so far, but I expect this theme to continue in the other novels.Also, I have to say that Foundation is very easy to read, entertaining, and I would recommend it without question, even to someone who had never read Asimov, and also to someone who had no interest in the Foundation series. Though, anyone who finishes Foundation will likely want to proceed to the other novels in the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Being a science fiction fan for some years, I picked up a copy of Foundation after hearing wonderful things about this series and loving I, Robot. On the whole, I think I, Robot is a better read, largely because I got to know and empathize with the characters in that set of stories more, which is my main criticism of this book.Nevertheless, Foundation is still very worthwhile, and while I wouldn't recommend this book to everyone, there are certain friends who I think would love it - it's for a select audience who loves science fiction and/or Isaac Asimov. I am going to continue on with the series - and we'll see how it goes!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book was recommended to me for a writing exercise, and I was surprised to find that I enjoyed it as much as I learned from it. I had lumped Asimov in with Clarke as a boring SF writer, and I was quite wrong. This book also works amazing magic with the passage of time and circumstance, and despite how quickly characters drop out of the landscape of the novel, the reader remains interested. A masterful work from one of the great masters.If you don't know much about SF, this is a good book for you; if you are a SF fan who thinks Asimov has nothing to offer you, this is a great book for you. Pick it up."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"People like to throw five star reviews at just about anything. I suppose they feel that almost everything written is as good as it gets. Foundation is one that deserves all five stars.It's a classic. The premise is intriguing. The story unwinds brilliantly over three books. Don't expect to read The Foundation alone. It does leave you hanging. The next two books in the trilogy are a must.This is one of a handful of solid, enduring works that will be enjoyed long after other works fade off the lists..."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Ah Foundation, this is perhaps one of the best and highly original works of Dr. Asimov. I was impressed that a man of only 20 could come up with such a creative vision of the future, it was not only the very distant future but one aside from most of the common stereotypes. This books plot line was excellent, he sounded like he really knew what he wanted from the get go, and not make it up as he went along. If i had to change a thing, it would be; i would like to see some of these characters come to a complete close, I'm not saying that i would like to put a stop to the big gaps through time, but make the characters have a little more closure.I think that you will get a lot out of this book as far as understanding plain human nature, it shows that no matter how far you go into the future there are some human characteristics that will never go away such as faith and greed. Foundation really opens a door for science fiction, especially in the two books remaing in the trilogy, you should definatly read those, as for the other four, that is your choice, i would read the reviews before reading them.As for Foundation, it is an excellent book, the characters are as defined as well as can be for the time alotted for them to portray the story. This is a must read epic that spans almost a thousand years (if you read the whole series) ENJOY!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation. Arguably the greatest creation of science fiction to date, from the most prolific writer of the genre. Isaac Asimov's tour de force first graced the pages of the May edition of Astounding Science Fiction in 1942. By the time the last instalment of the saga was finished in 1992, (only a matter of weeks prior to Asimov's death), the story had gone full circle so that you finished almost where you had set off from. We are initially told of The Seldon Plan; A one thousand year strategy mathematically and statistically conceived by Hari Seldon, to potentially minimise the eventual downfall of the once almost omnipotent, but now crumbling Galactic Empire. Seldon's Plan is for a group of specially chosen settlers to emigrate to Terminus, an uninhabited planet in a remote corner of the galaxy, from where they will create the Encyclopedia Galactica, a definitive omnibus of information necessary to aide a new and even stronger Empire rise long after the anarchy of it's predecessors demise.Throughout five of the seven Foundation books Asimov wrote, the reader witnesses the unfolding of The Seldon Plan, and how the original settlers of Terminus evolve over the centuries, as the work of the long dead Seldon comes to fruition. The two 'prelude' books in the series tell of Seldon's life, and his initial realisation as a young man, the gravity of what must be done to save the people far into the future, while simultaneously trying to instigate his master plan.Upon reading the end of the last of the books in a chronological sense (Foundation & Earth), the reader is gifted with the biggest jaw-dropping, mother of all twists in the story, which turns almost all of what you have read in the previous books upside down. Read Foundation, and guaranteed you'll read the other six books all in immediate succession."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I am not a science fiction fan without being a fan of the big idea, but in the Foundation Asimov introduced galaxy-wide empires and a plausible new science. There's no new compelling themes in this book. Without that quality, you are left to Asimov's weaknesses: one-dimensional characters and stark writing style, but hey - its still Asimov and his stuff is always fun to read.Like the last book, this is a hodgepodge of short stories Asimov wrote separately. The first half of the book is about a rising general who fights against The Plan but gets swatted down because he can't fight the mathematical forces of psychohistory. The next part is the fun part. One factor was not counted for in his equation: a mutant who knocks The Plan off kilter. To some the identity of the Mule will be laughably obvious. Personally, I was uncertain whether I was on the right track or not.It reads like a mystery novel , though dry in style and severely lacking in the human quotient. Nonetheless, it is a continuing tale of the rise and fall of future civilizations, telepathic mutants, and psychohistory. This is THE classic sci-fi trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In this sequel to \\"Foundation,\\" Asimov continues to channel Edward Gibbon, charting the rise and fall of the Galactic Empire and the subsequent rebirth, like a phoenix from the ashes, of a new and improved federation.On its own, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" suffers from an acute case of Middle Chapter Syndrome--and this is somewhat surprising since Asimov originally published his trilogy as a series of nine novellas. The reader who isn't familiar with the first \\"Foundation,\\" with its extended prologue and four installments, will be at a loss. In the previous book, each chapter details a different interplanetary chess match between (on the one hand) the long-dead \\"psychohistorian\\" Hari Seldon, who had predicted the empire's demise and who initiated events that will accelerate the rise of a second empire, and (on the other) various individuals who struggle in vain to change the course of that inexorable future.\\"The General\\" and \\"The Mule,\\" the two episodes in this volume, will surprise the reader by departing from the pattern in the previous book. The first and shorter story is the lesser of the two; all the \\"action\\" occurs offstage, and the protagonists wait in suspense for a catastrophe that never really materializes. It's a bit of a letdown, but Asimov presents this incident to make a point: those who think they know when and where historical crises will next occur might miss out entirely on the real predicament at hand.The meat of the book will be found in \\"The Mule,\\" which is presented as a mystery of sorts (although I find it difficult to imagine the reader who won't discern the Mule's \\"secret\\" well before its unveiling). More successfully, this novella is an extended chase scene--it would make a great space adventure movie--in which the Mule's minions pursue our heroes through the far reaches of the universe. The unexpected appearance of a mutant species, represented by the Mule, throws into chaos Seldon's psychohistorical calculations--or does it?Asimov's prose style has always been a bane to language mavens, and the experimental qualities of \\"Foundation and Empire\\" serve to spotlight many of his most pervasive faults. Even by the loose standards of pulp fiction, these two stories suffer from more than their fair share of tautologies, pleonasms, comma splices, sentence fragments, and worse. (No chapter should open with a sentence like either of the following: \\"There was reason to the fact that the element known as 'pure science' was the freest form of life on the Foundation.\\" \\"The blockade was run successfully.\\")But Asimov's fans--myself included--don't turn to his novels for their literary qualities. Instead, we enjoy his ability to present a complicated story and tie up all the loose ends, to weave politics and philosophy and science into his fiction, and to make us think."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I have heard so much about this book over the years but didn't like Asimov's writing so I never read it. Well, I thought maybe this was different but no, it's the same poor writing. I love the idea of psychohistory but that's where the love ends for this book. And Hari Seldon dies before we get to know and like him. Dull, mostly pointless conversations between people you don't know as the story jumps quickly over time ruin this book. And how lazy of Asimov to not develop his ideas. At one point he gets out of this by having a character watch a movie that we can't see which describes something that would have been interesting and clever had it been developed.I guess I'll finish the series because I've heard the other books are better. Phew, glad I got this out of the way."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the first of three books in the original Foundation trilogy. It's a wonderful exploration of what might be if psychology, sociology and statistics could be melded together to predict the future with a high degree of reliability. I found it fascinating as a spiritual analogy, even if that was unintended by Azimov. Read it through the lens of Hari Seldon as a god-type, perhaps you'll find the same interesting subtext that I did."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Great classic Sci Fi. Loved it. It was fun to notice some of the technology that is already outdated, like microfiche and televisions, how nuclear power was so important, but this didn't affect my interest or enjoyment in the novel."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The first book of Asimov's classic Foundation Trilogy. It is a must-read for any true fan of science fiction. Like other great works of the genre, it has held up over time, and is one of those books that you'll find yourself going back to read again and again. I highly recommend it. Be sure to also check out the other two books of the Foundation Trilogy, \\"Foundation and Empire\\" and \\"Second Foundation\\"."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Here in the second installment of Azimov's fantastic Foundation epic, you have a continuation from the first that at first seems a let down. Then the Mule shows up and the action really gets going.The first part is about the General and the reason I say it's a letdown is that what you think is going to happen, and hope for the sake of action is going to happen, doesn't. It's important that it doens't and makes a good point.The Mule however is where the meat is as others have stipulated. He's a monkey wrench in the whole plan Hari Seldon put together to save humanity during the 'Dark Ages' after the collapse of the Galactic Empire. Well written and a definite must for any who claim to love sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read Foundation as a bored teen, with no idea what it was about. Foundation is a book which demands to be read quickly, and thus the impression, amidst the brilliant storyline, is often shallow.I read it this time in a couple of hours; I would've read it quicker without work and cafes and other impediments, but basically I devoured it. And because it read so fast, the impressions of the individual stories flickered past too.The sense of history as pattern is stronger in this book than any single narrative. Having read the brilliant new Foundation trilogy, written by the three Bs (Brin, Benson, and Bear) which tells the personal life story of Hari Seldon, the very brief treatment of Seldon in the first trilogy is more notable for what is unsaid. Hari is just another name in history for Asimov; the hero is the idea, even the fast-flow of the narrative of itself might be called the Hero, because the whole notion of story here is webbed against historical patterns so closely.Briefly, then, Foundation has the setup and three payoffs. The setup is Hari Seldon arranging exile to Terminus.Salvor Hardin's politicization of Terminus is the first payoff, and is especially brilliantly written.Smyrnian Trader Limmar Ponyet's chicanery on planet Askone's closed market demonstrates the limits of religion and is the second payoff.Then Hober Mallow's power grab and abandonment of religion for trade as a means for influence in the third.The story starts and ends with court cases, first against Hari Seldon and last against Hober Mallow. The ideology of the book is anti-violence and pro social and economic measures. In fact it may be the first really positive exploration of what has come to be called \\"soft power\\", of which the European Union is the present example.The great touches of image serve to cast a deeper shadow on the role of public morality in sustaining a civilisation. For instance, the ambassador from Anacreon presents the hilt of his gun as a symbol of peaceful intentions when he visits Salvor Hardin on Terminus.In the context of history the book is extraordinarily complex and sophisticated. Social and economic complexity is reduced and strained free of dense matter and difficulty, like consomme soup, made to be thin yet delicious and easily consumed. The very first thought I had at the end of reading Foundation was \\"how I wish there were a history of Rome so readable and fast and easy to consume!\\"Normally I read Foundation in a great hurry (as I have this time) in combination with the other two books, Foundation and Empire, and Second Foundation. But I only have a copy of the first book of the trilogy and must make do with it.The first payoff is quite brilliant, because it is delayed and played out indirectly, thus deflecting the thrill of emotional rush into intellectual wonder. Specifically, Salvon Hardin delays the confrontation between Terminus and Anacreon for thirty years, years which Asimov summarizes in a bitter and brilliant battle of words between the old Hardin and young Sek Sermak. Thus the reader feels that the payoff is deferred. The reader senses an even bigger payoff at the far end of the section, \\"Mayors\\". And Asimov does not fail us. For Salvor Hardin travels to Anacreon to personally entrap the evil regent there and defeat him - again, inevitably, with soft power. Hardin defeats his enemy on the enemy's territory, at the precise moment when it seems all is lost for the Foundation.One is left with the distinct impression that brains defeat brawn, skilled inaction and insight defeat busyness and boldness, and that the power of wisdom and foresight overcomes even a social collapse on the scale of the fall of the Roman Empire - as indeed they did. For the Fall of Rome resulted in the rise of Christendom, and with it a grand tradition - so Asimov's message, by locating a historical European lesson in the distant future - becomes a timeless affirmation of human excellence.Foundation thus stands virtually alone in the field of science fiction novels in excellence."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Clear intelligent prose marks this as well as Asimov's other books. The fact that there is hardly any action in this trilogy, and yet it is still fun to read, shows you how good Asimov is at writing just \\"intellectual\\" fiction.But the truth be told, Foundation is not \\"the greatest sci-fi series of all time.\\" Sure, it won the Hugo that said just that. But that was only about fifteen years after the trilogy was published, and, remember, only fifteen years after the Hugo Award was instituted. Fifteen years isn't long enough to be making grandiose all-time statements like that.After Foundation, Asimov was to grow as a writer. He said so himself. He admits its faults: lack of a strong cohesive story; weak characterization; hardly any females. It is also now extremely dated. You can just \\"feel\\" that it was written circa 1950.The books aren't even novels, but a collection of stories. That's how it was executed; he never set out to write a trilogy. It is not as complex as you'd think the \\"greatest\\" should be. It lacks a certain depth. Just look at Dune: how Herbert portrayed the religious mind, how religion and commerce and politics all affected one another. On the other hand, Asimov never really understood the religious. So in the Foundation trilogy, priests are like frightened children, driven only by superstition.It may be a classic, but it is not a timeless classic. Yes, Foundation is definitely not his best series. Try the Robot novels."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"You've already read the publisher's summary for yourself, so let me just add that this is THE classic SF trilogy. Book one, \\"Foundation,\\" creates the future world, its declining culture, and how a group of strong-minded individuals don't want to see knowledge die. How they do that drives this novel. In book two, Asimov introduces the mystery of the mule, and in book three Asimov pulls a rabbit out the hat called the Second Foundation.If you enjoy books that entertain, books that offer good mysteries, and books that make you think about bigger things in life, than this series is for you. It's too bad our political leaders don't read novels like this. Maybe we'd avoid the continual messes they get countries in."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov is a must read for any science fiction reader. Even though the writing style leaves something to be desired, the pure imagination of his writing is something memorable. It's hard to imagine Star Wars or any other sci-fi without this book. Asimov barrels through time and the universe passing through hundreds of years in the turn of a page in a way that is rich and convincing. He builds many worlds, characters, and ties it all together through Hari Seldon and his psychohistory (a previously worked out map of human reactions, and thus events, for generations to come) and the Mule (a mutant who throws a wrench in the plan and--like most bad guys, or in this case mutants--seeks world domination). What's incredible about this villian is his strange depth which the reader gets completely secondhand. The book goes on and on with one beautiful idea after another. For example, a strange jester/clown character, Magnifico, that the heroes--Bayta and Torie--pick up plays an instrument called the sono-visor. This instrument harnasses the alpha waves of the brain and mixes melody with image in each listener. Now how's that for cool? Asimov wows the reader again and again with clearly explained inventive ideas. This book is the first of a trilogy. A must read for anyone with an interest in literature or science-fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is timeless. Asimov is the master. No wonder it won a Hugo for best all-time series.It's the fall of the Galactic Empire and the rise of the Foundation guided by psychohistory (a scientific method of predicting the future) developed by the Foundation's founder, Hari Seldon.Classic Sci Fi!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"There are a lot of people reviewing this book on this website who give it low reviews because it's dated. Yeah, sure, it's dated...it was written in the forties, it's going to be dated, but that doesn't lower the quality of the story.Now that that's out of the way: this book is great. Asimov is unbelievably smart, and Foundation shows it. The story to Foundation is interesting: the Galactic Empire is crumbling and its demise will turn the entire galaxy to barbarism for thirty thousand years, if steps arn't taken to lighten the blow. That's where the Foundation comes in. Through a series of crises, the Foundation should be able to shorten the length of time of barbarism from thirty thousand years to only a thousand.Foundation just covers the first few crises, so the book skips forward in time. This causes the trouble with the character development that everyone complains about. When a character is given only a few chapters to develop in, they won't really develop.Asimov really is the master of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Ive been a long time sci-fi/fantasy fan. However, it has taken me many years to finally pick up a book Ive heard so much about. Through the first half of the book, it felt like the average sci-fi novel. However, as I neared the end, I found myself enjoying it. Asimov included some witty political resolutions to the puzzles and 'Seldon crisis' throughout the book. I kept wanting more of these carefully crafted shorts and was very entertained towards the end.Asimov could have executed the story a little better so that the timeline didn't skip fifty years after every short. The lasting effect of this piece is somewhat diminished by this fact. Also the repetition of plot will keep me from reading any more of the series. I think it is the tragic flaw in Asimov, too much of a good thing. He has books published about everything it seems. Search for 'Asimov' and you will see what I mean.Overall it was a good book and I highly recommend it. It was an enjoyment to pass the time with."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"These are just a phenomenal set of books. Asimov is and always will be the master of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I loved this series... couldnt put it down. I highly recommend these books to anyone who loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I was so disappointed in the first book, Foundation, I gave it two stars. I've been wanting to read the trilogy for years and I couldn't believe that that mediocre pulp was it! But Foundation and Empire is the saving grace. I look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"SPOILERS AHEAD!!!When I wrote the review for the first book in this series my review was number 336, this time I'm number 90, which probably means that most reviewers said what they had to say about the trilogy in their review of the first book. This is ironic considering this second book is where the real fun begins.I'm assuming here that you read Foundation, I'm HOPING you even liked it. If you did then you will probably notice that there are only two stories in this book as opposed to the five in the previous one. Don't let the lack of quantity bother you though, These stories are longer for the simple reason that they need to be.For me personally, there was always something that bothered me about the premise of this series. Simply put, I didn't like the fact that humanity is reduced to mathematics. That's TOO simple though, because I happen to think that if you try hard enough, you CAN reduce (or perhaps distill is a better word) humankind down to mathematics, but the Seldon plan makes no allowance for the individual.At least, that's what I thought after reading Foundation. As it turns out, these two stories deal with just that theme. Not only that, but they seem to state opposite views on the subject.The first part of the book finds the Foundation taking on the remains of the Great Galactic Empire. The heroes of this part are, as usual, simply the mouthpieces for the various viewpoints and have little personality of their own. They run about and try to save the Foundation with some daring do (but it's Asimov so the said daring do mostly involves people arguing with each other about stuff) while the Foundation calmly trounces the Empire and renders their whole storyline moot.Here, the group wins out while the individual is rendered completely impotent while the group kicks butt. So, group 1, individual 0Then comes the second (and significantly longer) story: The Mule. The Mule is notable for having the first attempt at creating characters that are in any way interesting. For the most part I personally don't think he succeeds, but as I said in my review for the first book, I don't read Foundation for that reason so there's no great loss there.The Mule is a psychic who comes out of nowhere and crushes the Seldon Plan to dust! Since the plan cannot take individuals into account, a weird mutant can do more damage than the old Empire could do. Here, the individual rules and the mighty Foundation is brought to its knees.So, group 1, individual 1. We'll have to wait for the next book to see who comes out on top.As much as I love this classic work, the ideas behind it seem muddled and somewhat contradictory. I would imagine this came from the fact that these were written as discrete short stories and not as a cohesive whole.Despite these criticisms however, this is still very readable if you liked the first book and I'm sure you can find some criticisms of your own in here. Also, keep in mind that there is another Foundation out there... \\"At Star's End\\"So let's head there shall we?"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second book in the Foundation series continues the narrative of the first; it chronicles the defeat of the decaying Galactic Empire by the Foundation, and its subsequent defeat by the mutant intelligence that is the Mule. Asimov's books are an almost perfect blend of suspense, action, dialogue, character-building, world-building, narrative, and plot. He knows how to keep the pages turning. Even the less interesting half of the book (the first-half) is still enjoyable - it's just that the second part is so much more interesting; the twist at the end is especially something to be savored. Like all his books, the joy comes from not just the narrative itself, but the situations that Asimov places his characters in, and how they ingeniously improvise solutions to their dilemmas. The Foundation series is, irrefutably, classic science fiction, and it makes one wonder why Hollywood hasn't taken these literary gems and processed them into something less fine and lacking luster.One minor grievance; some phrases seem to reappear in multiple books of the series. Asimov seems particularly fond of the adjective \\"sardonically\\" - but this can scarcely be deemed a flaw, just something that one might notice."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The second book in the original trilogy, and the fourth book overall, Foundation and Empire is the great sequel to Foundation. It's really two different stories set many years apart.The first story covers the empires attempt to conquer the First Foundation led by its last great general. The second covers the mutant known as the Mule and his attempt to conquer the entire galaxy. The mysterious Second Foundation comes into play for the first time at the end of this book.Like its predecessor, at only 320 pages it makes a quick and interesting read. As one of the few sequels I've ever read which isn't a let down from the book it follows, I highly recommend it as well as the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov has crafted a sci-fi masterpiece in this novel. It is this novel that takes the Foundation series to a new level of brilliance. While the original novel is strong, this book is stronger. One advanatage of this book over its predecessor is that it is a single story as opposed to a series of novellas. This yields greater investment in the characters as they develop throughout the book. Asimov displays here all the attributes that have earned him monolithic status among sci-fi writers--unforgettable characters, ahead-of-his-time technology, and an entrancing plot with endless twists and turns. Essential reading for sci-fi fans."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Great book! Second in the series of three novels, all three are worth the read. I read all three in about two and half weeks. It might be interesting to read them in conjunction with Kuhn's Structures of Scientific Revolutions. Every \\"Seldon Crisis\\" brings about a \\"new world\\". Really fun stuff. Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read the foundation triology in high school in the early 60's.Nearly 50 years later, reading it again was almost like reading forthe first time. Asimov added two more books later, but the first threeare the real classics here. The concept of psychohistory may be as importantas the novels are good. I haven't seen any movies made from thesestories, but it seems like they deserve that.Before there was ever an x-man there was the mule;that chance of genetic nature of a psi mutant who could change mens mindsas he pleased. The plan couldn't account for this, but the second foundationwas never found by the mule. I recognized in the mule a manvery like the French Napoleon who could take advantage ofthe weaknesses of others. In later life Asimov became verymuch 'hard science' orientated so that these early space operatype novels were actually rationalized into an artificial unified time linethat really does a disservice to their original intension in my view.I still like this book with age!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"...P>The story was very unique.The world he creates and the society therein is fantasic and dangerous.The protagonist is a mathmatician running around just doing his thing not realizing that destiny awaits him.I really, really recommend this book and the next. By the middle of the third book I did begin to loose interest as my male testosterome began to scream for more violence and suspense.Characters are likeable and the story resolution is very satisfying. This book was great and enjoyable in and of itself even if you don't continue on with the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Let's get started with one of the most celebrated science fiction sagas of all time: Foundation. originally Asimov wrote it in form of a trilogy: Foundation, foundation and empire and the second foundation, to be read in that order. Then Asimov expanded his \\"foundation universe\\" to tie it with his \\"robot universe\\" by adding 2 more novels to the series: Foundation's edge and foundation and earth. All these 5 books are a must read if you consider yourself a sci-fi fan. Besides there are 2 more books: prelude to foundation and forward to the foundation, which must be read before actual 5 novels. It's quite a complex maze. It will also help if you are familier with Asimov's robot series. But you can nevertheless read only the 5 foundation books as a standalone and still enjoy them greatly.So what is foundation (as in neo asks in matrix)? Well foundation is the fictional name of a futuristic society, which is founded by a great scientist called hari seldon. In Asimov's foundation, humanity has expanded over the galaxy, hyperspace travels have advanced and an \\"empire\\" rules over millions of planets in the galaxy. The \\"empire' has seen its best days and is living in the relic of its past glory, a.k.a. it is crumbling. However all phegmatic rulers, the rulers of the empire refuse to accept their weakness. However Hari seldon, through his scientific and mathematical eyes, predicts that empire will soon crumble and humanity will be reduced to abject barbarism for a long time.On the preset of this plot, hari seldon establishes \\"foundation\\" to save the humanity.Ok, let us not delve too much into the plot as I am not playing spoiler. Why should you read Asimov? Apart from foundation being one of the greatest sci-fi saga, you can find several refreshing ideas, which have been adopted ubiqutously by most sci-fi series later. Take star trek, star wars, dune, even the most recent matrix, everyone borrows heavily from Asimov. Asimov not only introduced scientific concepts of hyperspace travel, he also introduced the concept of \\"control\\", which is used heavily especially in matrix. throughout his foundation saga, one is left wondering \\"who is the ultimate master?\\" the answers come as you keep reading through the novel.Asimov also explains a futuristic society in its sociology, politics, power struggle and human nature. No other sci-fi writer has cared too much to explore how a society will behave in future. Asimov stands unique in that respect.I would highly recommend all 5 foundation books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"If you haven't read this or the other two books in the original trilogy, you're in for a treat. This series is almost 50 years old but still among the best SF stories ever"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Throughout the past 12,000 years, the Galactic Empire has been expanding from Trantor, its capital planet, throughout the galaxy. How humans found Trantor, or where Earth is (and other questions about Earth), are currently unanswerable. All that is known is that this empire, which controls billions of worlds, is in a permanent social and political recession -- in other words, it is dying. Hari Seldon, reknowned psychohistorian (AKA scientist who predicts future trends) has predicted that 30,000 years will pass before a second Galactic Empire will rise. To shorten the dark age to 1,000 years, he has created a Foundation - a group of people dedicated to preserving knowledge - on the edge of the galaxy in the hope that they will share their knowledge after the fall of the Galactic Empire and create a new, and greater, Galactic Empire. Foundation is divided into four stories, which go through history from Seldon's project through the ascent of the Foundation. Taking concepts from Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Foundation is an extraordinary book and is strongly recommended to all readers of science fiction."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"In a word, story. That's what this is book is meant, story. As a best-class story-teller, Asimov, leads the reader into an intrincated, labyrhynthical STORY, where mathematics play a role as important as human emotions, meanwhile, both are interlaced so closely and deeply, that psicohistory raises up to capitalize human knowledge in &quot;favour&quot; of the final survival of the galactic culture.Despite the general opinion of classical criticism , that Asimov was not quite a good SF writer, but a fantasy one with no base to be considered in the universe of &quot;hard&quot; sci-fi, I should say that it's a long way walk between writing and simply reading a book, and this may not be the most-spectacular guide to science and techno-details, but it's in a way (a very particular one) the best ever writen"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Many of the ideas and terminology is very old time, and retro.

The story of the last years of the Trantor Empire helped me understand a lot about our society. Even though I read it in College I still have Harry Seldon name stock in my mind. Isaac uses this story to present his theories on how science and religion influence our society. It is a marvelous saga of a loooong story of a new Empire (USA?) build after the fall of an old one (Britain?). More or less this will be a very entertaining textbook on social science of history. A must for a serious SCFI reader."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The fall of the Galactic Empire having been foreseen by the great Hari Seldon through his Psychohistory, a colony, of sorts, of scholars was established on a planet far from the center of the Empire.This Foundation, as the colony is referred, is intended to limit the chaos sure to follow from the Empire's eventual fall. Proceeding the fall, various small dominions erupt, and for a time the Foundation treads water as a neutral entity, but things soon come to a head, and action must be taken. Unfortunately, scholars are not the best equipped to handle such situations.From the outcome of these events, the political structure of the Foundation is altered, and from there again does a conflict occur. As there was such a concentration of intellectual beings in the Foundation, there was no decline in technology as in the rest of the former Empire. And so might superior technology aid in the well-being of the Foundation, as well as its regard from neighbors.This book is actually several separate stories, taking place at different times in the early history of the Foundation, as the citizens try to fulfill the goal of Hari Seldon, now long dead, but nonetheless still influential. These stories are very well written, and obviously had a great deal of thought put into them as to how the collapse and restoration of such an entity might proceed.

It won the Hugo award to prove it, spawned many sequels, and even a couple of prequels. I was excited to read this book, expecting it to live up to its many accolades.Boy, was I disappointed!The basic idea of this novel is fascinating: Hari Seldon foresees the demise of the galactic empire using the science of psychohistory. He puts a plan into motion to lessen the catastrophic effect of this collapse. Will it work?This is a good concept to work from, and I liked the plot. It's classic SF.What I did not like was the writing.Asimov relies too heavily on dialogue. It reads like a play. The only narration present serves as &quot;stage direction&quot; to indicate that someone moves, or smokes, or exits, or whatever. I was not able to imagine most of what was going on, as Asimov never adequately sets the scene for us. People simply talk back and forth. Everyone talks excatly alike, and none of the dialogue sounds natural. With little attributions (he said, she said, etc.), it's often hard to tell just who is talking, anyway. It's an extremely frustrating experience as a reader.The other problem with &quot;Foundation&quot; (perhaps, its central problem) is that it tries to cover too much in too short a period of time. This is unfortunate, because, again, the premise is so good. A story like this must cover a great period of time to achieve its goals, of course. We have to find out if Hari Seldon was on the right track. Asimov introduces a host of charcters, but none of them stick around. Consequently, there's no one in the entire book that you know or care about. This is a major failing. A great SF novel cannot be just a clever idea. The great books of the genre have great characters who help us to understand and appreciate the clever idea. Look at &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ender's Game&quot;, &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Dune&quot;, or &quot;Brave New World&quot;. Each of these features great ideas and great characters.If this book were fleshed out a bit more with better descriptions and deeper characters who were actually given time to develop, I would like it much more. As it stands, it feels too thin -- it's the kernel of something really great.I recommend this only to die-hard SF fans who are getting back to the genre's roots, or those who value ideas over writing quality.I believe you must have both to be a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"... but that didn't prevent me from intensely disliking it.

You mention that Foundation is dated. Of course it is, it's 60 years old! You'd be surprised at how badly dated some of the stuff being written today is in 60 years. You say a galactic empire can't be made with 'atomics'; you call it good old nuclear fission. Well, not all nuclear power is fission; there is also fusion, which was not a bad idea for space travel in 1941. Strike one. You also mention that Asimov writes in the old 60's detective style of writing. So this dated book is writing in a style popular 20 years in the future. Strike two. You ask if anyone edited the corny dialog; you call it tripe. Of course it was edited; it was made into the editors idea of what would sell in 1941! Remember science fiction wasn't taken seriously then; it was supposed to be rather childish. One need only read later Asimov work (something you admittedly haven't done) to see that he wrote for the market at the time. Books such as 'The Gods Themselves' even have (gasp) sex in them, something that would never have gotten past any editor at the time of Foundation. And guess what? It was written in 1972, a time when society as a whole was more tolerant and ready to accept such topics. 'The Gods Themselves' would have been banned as obscene in 1941. Strike three. To answer your query - Why in the name of antimatter would a galactic civilization be organized along the lines of a fuedal system as were the Middle Ages? - why not? Just because it isn't very popular nowadays on Earth doesn't mean it can't work elsewhere. Besides, the story is a retelling of the decline of Rome - shouldn't there be obvious parallels? Strike four. You mention that the plot doesn't go anywhere. How would you know? You've only read one book. Asimov does a brilliant job of reconciling the original trilogy with the robot novels - especially considering he began the fourth novel 40 years after the original trilogy was written. At a minimum, to really understand the story you would have to read at least the next two books. Strike five. You say the book is pointless. Well, ask yourself this. If that were true, would it have near-unanimous rave reviews? Are you one of a select few that have been able to see the book for what it truly is - a piece of junk? No, the reality is that the state of science fiction in 2001 is that it is generally read by intelligent people - thoughtful, well-read and informed.

This Armageddon is foreseen into 3,000 years of barbaric emptiness. Dr. Seldon comes up with an idea that a group of psycho historians will need to work together with Seldon so that they can compose an Encyclopedia of the Galaxy's history to prevent about 2,000 years of political unrest. A Foundation is created. This Foundation represents the community of these historians to produce enough updated volumes of this Encyclopedia every 50 years so that the rivalry that will occur between the time Seldon dies and this Galaxy destruction occurs, it's ready to be of service to those struggling in the future. I found that the most interesting piece of this whole story is that as the struggles get stronger between the Foundation's cycle leaders and the surrounding planet's \\"prefects,\\" the leaders of the Foundation start to create this religion amongst the science involved with the Encyclopedia. These religious \\"high priests\\" become the power and influence amongst these interplanetary societies. It's so great to see how the higher power called the Galactic Spirit is slowly becoming a widespread belief amongst the psychohistorians and their counter parts.I keep thinking about the impact of these thoughts and ideas on our own society and how similar some of these reactions would be. I see a lot of conflict between our country, the United States, and Middle Eastern countries where we are planting ourselves on other's territory so that we can suck from their few and far between plentiful resources that are of high value to us, so we make these deals that are appealing to 2nd and 3rd class countries and once that is started we ultimatley have all of this say over what that country is up to. I feel like Foundation shows how this peaceful and well- intentioned planet is working to create righteous things and there are these outside planets wanting control over how they are going about this and need some sort of power over a smaller community in a self-serving way. The character development is my favorite part of the book because of the different personalities that Asimov creates to work out the story line of the book. The different leaders are these very he-men type characters that are young and self-righteous, working towards the destruction or protection of their homeland.Clashing righteoussness is all over this book and I think that it definaltey symbolizes some of the conflict that exists in our own country today. I did not however feel like Asmiov gave women any role at all. I can't think of one woman that played ANY major role in this book, and when there was a mention of a woman she was nothing but a secretary or a mediator of some sort. I felt like there were just too many hormones flying around this book and I kind of wonder what this says about Isaac Asimov and his life. A great writer but maybe needs a love life? All around this was a great book and I recommend to all of you die hard SF fans!!! If you're a hardcore gal that is in to SF I would pass on this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"After somehow assiduously avoiding Asimov's seminal \\"masterpiece\\" for over 50 years since I began reading sci-fi, I decided to dip into this ponderous tome.Oh, forsooth, the ancient bard's Shakespearean language came alive once more, only this time, more than 12,000 years into the future.But, lo, some things have never changed: women are little more than pawns to the men who run the Galaxy -- still concerned with \\"housewife\\" duties.Distance is still measured in miles; microfiche and paper still reign supreme; the priesthood flourishes; folks still haven't learned that smoking kills.Not one to espouse elucidation, the new bard Asimov floods pages with convoluted dialog that fails to eschew obfuscation.The five barely connected stories that comprise this mess are loosely thrown together in homage to Hari Seldon, as we are seldom harried by logic.While I realize that it's easy to criticize the grand master of sci-fi after his passing, someone must raise the cry that the emperor was born with no clothes."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"F&amp;E shows in marvelous guise the slowly growing power of Terminus, the inevitable clash with the still powerful remnants of the Galactic Empire, and the downright weird occurrances that follow the conquests of the Mule, a Telepath who can shape other people's minds to suit his permanantly, and who aspires to dominance. Great stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This was my first Asimov book. Based on the reviews I've seen for this series, I was expecting a more captivating story. However, another reviewer's comments has convinced me not to give up yet. That reviewer notes that this is an early work of Asimov's and the sequels are better. I'll give the next one a try."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is the complete book of adventure. Brilliantly written by Asimov (as usual). This book is a must-read for all readers!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"A true classic that never grows old. Asimov's highly original plot and concise prose makes The Foundation a facinating experience for young and old. While the rest of the trilogy intensify and make for exciting reading, I feel the first book makes the best impact."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is definetly a CLASSIC of all times(not only in SF).A must read for all SF lovers.I have read the book some 20-25 times so far and its simply mind-blowing.The whole concept is well thought of and pararells can be drawn to imperialism(religion and trade).You are made to realise the futility of trying to avoid destiny and realise that its the best to do the obvious in any situation.Definetly the best of all times."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I feel sorry for anyone who read this book and felt it wasnt good. They obviously missed the boat big time. This book is not for those who have a short attention span, who need action &amp; blood &amp; guts violence or for people who cannot read between the lines. This book is a powerful commentary on the state of OUR world, that, as a society, we will not stay stagnent forever. It is also a very powerful commentary on the absurdity of religion. Read it if you would like to be educated and you like to think."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I started reading this series with the original &quot;Foundation&quot; and was very disappointed with it. After all the acclaim it received, I was expecting something truly exceptional. Instead, I got a historical narrative that is closer in style to something you would read in the Brittanica for a school assignment. It is really a kind of &quot;mutant&quot; between a novel and a documentary. What's more, it is exceptionally boring. What kept me going was the Asimov name on the cover and the hope of better things to come. This is not to say that it is a really bad book. I must confess that it has some interesting parts and of course, the series as a whole is an absolute classic. Every other novel in the Foundation series is so brilliant, that they cover for this disappointment. It must also be remembered that Asimov wrote this book in the early 50's when he was still a young and inexperienced writer"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is an awesome book, but if you're looking for battles and Star Wars style action, the sequels to this story have more. This novel spans the first 100 or so years of events that take place after the fall of a Galactic Empire. It's a very thin book and a quick read. Some terms such as \\"Gallopin' Galaxies\\" appear in the book, but be mindful of the times in which this book was written...and the intended audience.What is entertaining and interesting is how the characters solve Hari Seldon's predicted problems throughout the book. How cool would it be to have an entire planet of scientists (make that two)...a tiny portion of the galaxy that is pretty much responsible for running it. As a fantasy, it's as fun to dream of scientists in charge as it is to imagine winning the lottery. You might even glean tactics for handling dopey managers, or solving problems without going into combat. Asimov's wit and intrigue throughout make for an entertaining and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I like Foundation because it's a solid piece of sci-fi from olden days. (George Lucas's stealing of Asimov's city-planet for his Coruscant - tsk tsk, Georgie - amazed me most.) Foundation does have peculiarities. People hundreds of thousands of years in the future speak like us. They use phrases like us. They also have the same atomic technology as people did in the 1950s. Asimov got a bit lazy here; he could've imagined something cooler than nukes. The galaxy is a metaphor for a crumbling Roman empire. Perhaps Terminus is Ireland. As for A's style, I found his use of long adverbs rather funny. In sum, a good book if you can ignore this stuff."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is a good book, but is only a must read because the 2 books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are must-reads. It's a shame that few lists of his books include Foundation and Earth, but if you like science fiction, that is the best novel ever."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"this is the first book i read by asimov. of the 7 books in the &quot;trilogy&quot;, i found it the most gripping.

Of the fourteen books in the Robot, Empire, and Foundation series, I have seven of them. I just need to find the final of the Foundation series &quot;Foundation and Earth&quot;. I just wish Mr. Asimov was here to keep the series going. Each book holds your attention with the drama and suspense of what's going to happen next. The imagination really soar's! Recommended for every Sci-Fi reader!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"It was my first Asimov book, and I can't stop to read all of his books about Fundation and Robots. I think, it is Epic. It is not a fast-read book, it has little dialogs, but it is great !."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I do not read science fiction, generally, but Asimov's fantastic tale of the future was so accesible, so fascinating and original, that it just blew me away and before I knew it I was hooked on the series. OK, OK, it's kinda dated; some characters are caught using &quot;the futuristic version of the slide rule&quot; and there are apparently no women at work on the Foundation Product, and EVERYTHING is powered by nuclear energy, but cut Ike some slack! This was the 50s, after all... Anyway, the series gets far more...progressive...as it goes along. And, to me anyway, the dated bits were more amusing than anything else. Anyway...in a genre convoluted by over-used lasers, aliens, and so on, Asmiov's FOUNDATION stands out as a story about the evolution of humanity. You don't have to be a sci-fi fan to enjoy this series, just a humanitarian. This is one of those books that should be long to everyone's private library!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"If you think you might even possibly like science fiction, this is a must read book!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is my favorite American Sci-fi. There are almost none of the crudities of most other American sci-fi. I prefer the Foundation and the first novella of Second Foundation to the latter half of the trilogy; Asimov grew a little tired of his main theme as he progressed, although he still has some memorable scenes, such as the description of Rossem. The French translation of this is itself a classic, and irons out Asimov's occasional 'mass-market' juvenilic elements into a very high level of literate expression. But the English is far from bad to begin with, and has, if not a Gibbonian, at least an H.G. Wellsian flavor. Asimov's later Foundation novels are far below the three volumes of the Foundation trilogy proper. They resemble the common run of American sci-fi - aimless plots, flavorless language, etc. I am always puzzled that some people don't think Asimov has convincing characters. Who remembers, or cares, about the characters of a Heinlein or Clarke? But Asimov has at least a dozen characters that are known to every sci-fi fan. Asimov possesses a masculine vigor of language and an episodical manner of imagination that pleases me very much."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The best example around of Asimov's work. It is intellectual, interesting, and just plain entertaining. reading it, you can feel the danger that the fledgeling Foundation is in when threatened by its aggeressive neighbors and there are unconventional solutions. I have only two complaints. The book is dated and there is little action. Get past those and you're sure to enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"One of the problems with the original Foundation was that Asimov seemed unsure of where he wanted to go. However, in Foundation and Empire, he finds his way. The story of the Mule is pure genious. With psychic powers being a cliche in SF today, it is hard for the modern reader to appreciate. The part when the Mule's identity is revealed gave me chills, even the second time."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I really liked this book, but I want to give you some warnings about my tastes &amp; what I found odd about it. First I used to read history books for fun &amp; sometimes I still do. Second there were absolutely no female characters in this one. This struck me as bizarre then &amp; it still does (by the way I'm a male &amp; most definitely not a feminist)The later foundation books ,especially those written in the 80's &amp; 90's, are better characterized &amp; women are much better characterized. Also this is a 1940's view of the future. That doesn't mean it's dated (are Dumas or Poe dated?) it just means you have to put it in context. Why did I like it then? My love of history, the ideas, the grandness, &amp; unrepentant sentimentality. I think if I read it again I might not like it as much, but the memory of it's great. If you know a teenager reading star trek books do what my dad did &amp; give them this."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book, the first in a series, is all about the origination of the Foundation, an orginization based on the idea to shorten the period of decay of the galactic Empire. Everyone who likes Prelude to Foundation MUST read this."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"No matter how many times I read this book, it is impossible to get tired of it.

Two very superb stories, which show that you don't need a million word novel to produce a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Being an avid sci-fi fan, I've read many books of the genere, but Foundation was the first Asimov that I had read. Foundation was an amazing book, in what I imagine is an incredible series. (I haven't read the others yet!) Asimov hooks you with a flawless story-line and personable characters, and reels you in with superb twists and turns and a way of resolving things that is limited to only his intellect. His visions of the future are as or more astounding then Orson Well's and his story-telling ability ranks among the best. It might be a &quot;Seldon&quot; crisis if you don't read this book. In other words if you are looking for a well crafted, enthralling, completely enjoyable novel, this is it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is truly one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written.

Isaac Asimov has shown himself to be a true Grand Master."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The spectacular universe created by Issac Asimov in Foundation is excellently complemented by the second in the series.

I hope Asimov has some better books, cause he has to be acclaimed a good writer for something (or book)!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I tried to listen to this story on CD, and aside from the story not being terribly interesting, I was surprised at Asimov's attitude towards religion. I suppose I shouldn't have been. He is a sci fi writer, after all. But I thought he was supposed to be a smart guy. He's not -- at least on this point.The basic outline of the story (at least the beginning -- I didn't make it all the way through) is that some guy predicts that the galactic empire is going to fall, so he tries to make provision to preserve technology so that the succeeding dark ages don't last as long as they otherwise might. Toward that end he gets a select group of scientists onto this relatively isolated planet where they can carry on their work, which becomes the invention and maintenance of a religion that's supposed to preserve certain technologies through the coming dark ages. In this religion the high priests understand the theory -- the technology and all that -- but the local priests and the people are duped into believing in some mumbo jumbo.It's as if you're supposed to picture some priest waving incense and saying prayers while he adjusts the knobs on the nuclear reactor, believing that it's God doing something while it's really just technology.I know that \\"technology as magic\\" and \\"religion = magic\\" are common themes in the sci-fi genre, but for some reason I expected better from Asimov. It shows a rather alarming lack of thought.Religious rituals are always geared towards the chaotic and the mysterious. There aren't religious rituals to cause the sun to rise, because it's regular and dependable, but there are religious rituals for storms and floods and harvests and childbirth and whatnot. Religion is also used to explain hidden things -- psychology, forgiveness, etc.IOW, religion is subject to criticism (\\"it's not measurable\\") in precisely the area where Asimov is trying to squeeze it. He's trying to make religion the mystical cloak for something that's regular, predictable and logical. It just doesn't work that way.If religious rituals had precise, measurable results, people would suspect that there's nothing religious or mysterious about them and they'd look for a material cause. Anyone who doubts that simply doesn't understand the religious mind, or hasn't been paying attention. Sure, there are gullible religious folk out there who'll believe anything, but the majority have half an eye out for tricks and deceptions.The very idea that you can hide technology behind a cloak of religious ritual is a rather silly science fiction writer's fantasy.Anyway, the story wasn't that compelling, and this \\"religious cover for nuclear technology\\" business was so incredibly stupid, I couldn't finish it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"What more can I say? The Mule? Give me a break. How can anyone consider this to be great fiction? Go read something else...."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"As an avid sci-fi reader, I felt I had to rectify an oversight and read the book that really is a foundation of much of today's sci-fi. When I started the book, I planned to read the entire series. I was so completely let down that I don't know if I'll ever read Asimov again. Foundation simply failed to ignite any spark in my imagination. The characters are poorly developed, largely because of the huge leaps in time throughout the book. In addition, the inability of a person writing sci-fi -- which by its nature looks to the future -- to envision any role for women in that future is deplorable. I thought Asimov's work trite, boring, and completely lacking in the sort of foresight that makes books by authors like William Gibson and Tad Williams so amazingly captivating. Kudos to Asimov for opening the door for better writers but too bad his work (at least this early work) is terrible. Don't waste your time reading this one. Go straight to the many better post-Asimov authors."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I hate this book. I don't just &quot;not like it,&quot; I hate it! Such a bad book. Do not read it!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book, along with Frank Herbert's Dune are the two cornerstones of science fiction. Many subsequent writers owe a debt to Foundation, which is best read within the original trilogy (Foundation, Foundation and Empire, Second Foundation. It is extremely exciting for anyone with a sense of the 'epic' questions of the fate of mankind, or for that matter, any large society or culture. A staggering achievement.It is hard to get to the end of this work and not want to pick up Foundation and Empire.Now I might add that I did not personally enjoy very much the subsequent \\"interference\\" with the books created by the subsequent novels - Foundations Edge, Foundation and Earth, and Prelude to Foundation. I think Asimov's idea for the story changed as he got older (certainly the \\"robot\\" angle is increasingly emphasised, which I think is to the general detriment of the series) and while I have not read much literary criticism on this topic, I would suggest the original idea was better."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read these books when I was in high school and althoughI almost never read fiction, and don't particularly like sciencefiction (even though I studied geophysics in university andwork as an engineer), these books made an immense impressionon me. As I began to study Judaism, I finally discovered thatAsimov, a non-observant, yet knowledgable Jew, was using theformat of science fiction to describe the Jewish concept of theredemption of mankind. A careful reading of the BiblicalProphets shows that the ideal world that history is leadingmankind towards has universal peace between nations and ade-emphasis of technology in favor of the development of man'sinner, morespiritual side. However, this development of man's spiritualqualities and move towards universal harmony is accompaniedby upheavels and wars. Jewish tradition also says that theworld is sustained by 36 \\"hidden\\" righteous people whosegood deeds and spritual superiority are vital from preventingthe destructive forces in the world, both natural andman-made from overcoming everything and leading the worldto chaos.Asimov used the two Foundations as his vehicle for describingthis cosmic process, and an important part of the story isthe necessity of the Second Foundation to remain \\"hidden\\" toallow the process to work itself out.As far as the story itself is concerned, it is true that it isdated...for example, Asimov places the capital of the GalacticEmpire on the planet Trantor which \\"is at the center of theGalaxy\\". Today, it is believed that the center of the galaxyis full of black holes and lethal amounts of radiation, so itis unlikely there would be life as we know it there. Also,Asimov posits atomic energy as being the ultimate form of powerbut physics has advanced beyond that point to fusion and otherexotic forms of power.On the other hand, Asimov wrote these stories in the wake ofthe Second World War and so he is quite aware of how so manyinstitutions created by men...including governments and religiousestablishments, even starting with the bestof intentions, seems to run into crises. Thus the GalacticEmpire, which brought centuries of peace and prosperity tomankind, is brought inevitably to a point of degeneration, andhow the (First) Foundation itself, founded by idealistic,intelligent people who are at least partly aware of theirimportant role in shaping a better future for mankind, rapidlydegenerates into a repressive dictatorship.As others have pointed out, these stories have almost no \\"action\\",which is fine with me (my favorite movies and TV shows alsohave no action, e.g. Twelve Angry Men) and in spite of thefact that these stories are 60 years old, I recommend themto anyone who wants a deeper look at mankind's natureand its destiny."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I do not know much about science fiction. For this reason, I read &lt;Foundation> just as I read a fiction. Although so far I read only the first one of the trilogy, I liked it.What is interesting and strange at the same time in this book is that, in every chapter, a new main character appears. It takes time for a reader to develop familiarity with a character and to get interested and affected by the character's thoughts and actions. By the time one forms such a tie with the character, however, the chapter somewhat abruptly ends and the character is finished! The chapters of this book, therefore, could be seen as self-contained short stories loosely connected by the theme of the development of the Foundation over one thousand years.One thing about this kind of way in which each chapter unfolds is that it may well have been inevitable for the author because he had to cover so long a time period. The other thing is that somehow it leaves a lot of room for a reader to think back more about what a character did in each crisis and how history set the stage for the crisis, whether this effect was intended or not by the author.This book was a good read both entertaining and thought-provoking."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I always enjoy reading Isaac Asimov's writing, and foundation was no exception. The plot is imaginative and original, like much of Asimov's writing. Foundation is set in the future, a time when our galaxy is ruled by a failing empire. Hari seldon, a psychologist, must prevent the galaxy from falling into anarchy and barbarism by creating a foundation of scientists. Foundation is fun to read, and provides ample entertainment. I recommend reading it."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first book in the famous Foundation trilogy. The story is simple. It's over 50,000 years in the future and humans have spread throughout the whole galaxy, with millionsof worlds and quintillions of people united by an Empire. However, the empire is crumbling.Enter Hari Seldon, the pioneer of psycho-history - a kind of complete, mathematical social science that uses statistical averages and modelling to predict social trends in large populations for thousands of years to come. Hari's studies show that the collapse of the empire is invevitable. However, if he takes action now, the period of suffering before the next empire might be decreased from 30,000 years to 1000. So, he establishes two foundations on opposite sides of the galaxy to follow his master plan. This book is the story of the first foundation.As a work of literature, expect no marvels of prose or metaphor. Most of the chapters are dialogue between people. There is also little characterisation and a blatant disregard for the &quot;show, don't tell&quot; rule of writing. All of these things are there because the trilogy covers hundreds of years. As such, this novel is divided into 5 books with a gap of decades or centuries between each. The whole text is very episodic as we watch an entire civilisation emerge from a modest group of scientists to a powerful force in the outskirts of the galaxy.So, the concepts of the book were what I found interesting. Of course, the whole premise that human history can be mathematically be mapped out as a kind of law of averages seems ridiculous to me. I don't think that Asimov believed that either - he just saw it as an interesting idea for a story. The great Hari Seldon maps out the future history of the Foundation, ensuring that it basically has one cosmic path to follow - one which will end in laying the seeds for the new Galactic Empire.The first book details with around the first 200 years of the foundation, as several crises are encountered by individuals as forces of history. With few military resources, the leaders are forced to rely on their wit. I'm onto the second book now so should find out if that wit was enough.A great read in that you'll find in interesting even if you aren't a great science fiction fan - it has very unique perspectives social &quot;science&quot; and what makes a civilization."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov was one of the incredible path-breakers for science fiction, and the Foundation books are thought by many to make up one of the best and most far-reaching series of the entire genre. While Asimov was a biochemist by trade, he certainly understood the circular pattern of human history, regardless of the amount of technology available to mankind.Foundation is about the fall of the Galactic Empire that has ruled for times immemorial (so long, in fact, that the memory of the legendary \\"Earth\\" is but a myth). The Empire's fall will obviously result in much chaos as the wheels of law struggle to beat back the inevitable barbarians who rise to loot and pillage (rather than rebuild) the riches of the old Empire. All of this seems a rather bleak future for humanity, yet Asimov is a hopeless optimist (at least in my eyes) in that he sees the resilience of people as ever reaching. The Foundation series is therefore a group of novels about the ways in which humanity restores itself even after all seems lost.&quot;Foundation&quot;, the first novel in the series, focuses on a colony formed by one who foresees the destruction of the Empire, a man named Hari Seldon. Seldon therefore attempts to minimize the effects of the collapse by building a community made up of intellectuals called the \\"Foundation\\". The book is divided into three separate stories at completely different times in the history of Seldon's paradise, one at the formation of the Foundation, another at its troublesome infancy, and the last at the time that the Foundation becomes economically independent (it becomes internally capitalistic and externally somewhat imperialistic). Each story rather stands alone and, while the last is somewhat disappointing, each is worthy in its own right.Highly recommended; if you don't read this book, you can't understand science fiction as a genre."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Hari seldom, the man who predicted the fall of the empire in the first book, established foundations on each end of the galaxy to prevent the rise of a dark age. The fallen empire from the first part of the book has incresed it's strength and with that strength, it plans to seize control of the foundation. With an ambitious and skilled general, and dozens of battle fleets, the foundation faces it's greatest enemy.Personally, I liked the second part with the mule better then the war with the empire, because the main characters have nothing to do with the foundations victory, which makes the plot not a major factor for the story, but this also leads the reader into more surprises for the end of the section.\\"I am the mule\\". As the reader discovers the identity of the speaker, all loose ends are tied up while creating a great twist for the end. Even though Seldon's predictions guide the foundation to overcome the first four crises, this is the book where his predictions turn the foundation into a disaster. A mutant is born, having the power to fight against any great power of the galaxy, a man that is able to defeat dozens of battle fleets, with the intelligence greater then any scientist of the foundation. .The second part of the book is full of surprises, so please finish the book if you have started it or you might miss one of the best plots in science ficiton. While reading the story of the two couple's adventures, the reader needs to think deeply in their every move. Isaac lets the reader feel the negative consequences in prediction. The more hope the foundation has on Hari Seldon's prediction, the greater fall they will need to suffer. Although the plot of the couple's is resolved, the foundations destiny is discovered in the third book, the second foundation. I believe any reader that has read this book will definitely also need to read, the second foundation, so I recommend buying both books."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is truly a defining book for the genre of science fiction. The beauty of this tale is that Asimov began penning it when he was only twenty one years old. The story centers around a falling empire and the many characters throughout its history that define it. It also deals with a sort of scientific prophecy in what is termed &quot;psychohistory&quot;. This is the manner in which the future can be predicted using scientific evidence and the laws of probability. This is truly a masterpiece of the genre. A standard which all sci-fi authors should hope to attain. I would recommend this read to anyone that is a science fiction fan. Many readers are familiar with Orson Scott Card. This is the novel which prompted him to become a writer. That this novel is a cornerstone in the genre is an understatment."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This was the first book I have read by Isaac asimov and I can say it was worth the wait. While this book is very old it is still an excellent read. Asimov presents a very convincing future for humanity. The book is broken into several sections that were originally short stories in a sci-fi magazine. They gel togethor perfectly and the overall story is wonderful. This book details Hari Seldon and his prediction of the fall the galactic empire and the rise of barbarism for 30000 years. He however thinks he can avert the disaster and only have 3000 years of barbarism in the galaxy. Based on this he sets up two seperate foundations that are supposed so achieve this goal. This book is focused on the first foundation and it's trials as the fall of the galactic empire begins.THe characters in this book are good. While each section is short you really empathize with the characters and their lives. The plot is excellent some of the suprises he throws at you are quite extrodinary. My only complaint is some the terminology in this book is quite old and often times is quite funny to read. However the ideas, characters, and plot make up for the archaic wording in the book.I would recommend this book to any science fiction fan!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The story of Foundation continues in F&E;, with the stories in this book taking us through the final fall of the old Galactic Empire and the power vacuum left in its wake. The most known aspect of the second book however, is the idea that psychohistory is limited in that it is not able to predict aspects caused by wild chance-- and in this second Foundation book, wild chance threatens Foundation in the person of a powerful mutant called the Mule.Well-written, as Asimov always is."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I loved reading the Foundation novels a long time ago and was glad I found them on Kindle.

Asimov's &#34;Foundation series&#34; novels are classics of the science fiction genre. Some of the foundation novels drag on a bit but &#34;Foundation and Empire&#34; moves along well. The Asimov style emphasizes interpersonal relationships as opposed to showcasing gee-whiz science fiction apparatus. If you like science fiction you should read the foundation series novels as they are the basis of a lot of subsequent science fiction novels. Indeed, Star Wars may have been based on the Foundation novels or at least influenced their development."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I bought the complete series of the Foundation for my husband, because he hadn't read it before.

Certainly, the original trilogy is high on my list of \\"must read\\" science fiction.The Foundation Trilogy presents us with a universe controlled by the Galactic Empire. The Empire has governed the known universe for tens of thousands of years and appears to be at the zenith of its power. But the Empire is burdened by the weight of the bureaucracy needed to govern millions of worlds. Trantor, the administrative seat of the Empire is a planet completely covered by buildings. A vast, planet-wide city, it houses the millions of functionaries necessary to administer the Empire. As wealthy and as powerful as the Empire seems, disaster is just around the corner. However, only one man, Hari Seldon, is able to recognize the Empire's impending doom.Hari is a mathematician who has developed the breakthrough field of Psychohistory. Psychohistory is the mathematical process by which the actions of people can be predicted in advance. This science does not work for predicting individual behavior, but instead predicts the behavior of a mass of humanity (billions of people). By analyzing the Empire with Psychohistorical methods, Hari has determined that the Empire will crumble within 500 years, plunging the known universe into barbarism that will prevent a new Empire from arising for 30,000 years!Fortunately, Hari has developed a plan that, if executed, will curtail the period of galactic decay to a mere 1,000 years. However, it is unclear whether Hari can persuade the Emperor to allow him to move forward with his plan. Can Hari and his fellow scientists save the universe? Or will the shortsighted aims of a greedy, grasping Emperor derail their plans?Although these works are science fiction, they would probably not be classed as \\"hard\\" science fiction. There is some necessary discussion of scientific principles, but not enough to bore any \\"technophobes\\" who may be reading the novels. The trilogy focuses mainly on the people involved in the Seldon plan, as opposed to the technology being used by them. Asimov always enjoyed speculating on how people would evolve and react to advanced technology and he lets his imagination run wild here.Two significant milestones were achieved with this work. First, Asimov became one of the first writers to theorize that atomic power would revolutionize society. Second, I believe Asimov was the first to present a planet that was entirely covered by buildings. The universe he creates is engaging and filled with fascinating, believable characters. Since the books were serialized, many chapters (especially in the first volume) contain complete plot lines and make the book easy to read if you need to break up your reading time into small increments. Lots of political intrigue and maneuvering keeps the action flowing through all three books.Foundation sets the stage for the rest of the series. Hari Seldon is introduced and his theories of Psychohistory are explained. Then Seldon's Foundation is established on Terminus, a remote planet at the edge of the Empire, with the goal of shortening the period of barbarism the universe will experience. However, there are no Psychohistorians located in the Foundation... only scientists. The planet has very few native metals and virtually no defenses. The scientists must figure out how to rule their world and fend off avaricious neighbors as the Empire begins to crumble. The majority of this first volume contains vignettes chronicling the Foundation leaders responding to various crises that Hari Seldon predicted centuries before. The crises are varied and plausible. The solutions to the problems that arise are not solved by any miraculous means, but by tough, clever political maneuvering. Watching the crises and their solutions unfold is very enthralling and keeps you turning the pages at a rapid pace.There is something here for everyone to enjoy. If you have never read this fine trilogy, buy a copy today. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov has always been a better science writer than a science fiction writer. He does not have the turn of phrase, the poetic endownment, the ability to have characters change and grow and become interesting...but, his ideas have always been cutting edge without being over the top.The vision of the breakdown of the future empire, of Hari Seldon and the school of psychohistory, the idea of setting up two Foundations at each end of the galaxy...great elements of a story. There has been talk that Asimov &quot;borrowed&quot; these ideas from Campbell but if so, he gave them a polish and a new direction that completely transformed the otiginal ones.One must grant literary, historical and scientific license to the writer in that many of the inventions we take for granted were only glimmers in the eye of a teenager in the 50's. The ideas are stunning in scope if not in execution. I would have loved to have seen a Heinlein or Pamela Sargent with this material. Still, it retains the reader throughout...and sets up the next novel in the trilogy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I first read the Foundation series many years ago and made the mistake of loaning the books to a friend - of course, I never got them back. Recently I decided to buy the series again and once again I was amazed with how ahead of their time they were, considering how long ago they were written. The central premise of the story is imaginitive, and the plot devices by which Asimov drives the book forward are cleverly thought out.I'm not a fan of &quot;laser guns and spaceships&quot; science fiction, and I hold to the idea that people living hundreds of years from now will fundamentally be the same as us. We won't be wearing silver suits and living on a diet of vitamin pills. So it's refreshing to read a &quot;sci-fi&quot; story that doesn't get bogged down with high-tech stuff, but focusses on human development. I'd recommend it to any one, whether you're a sci-fi geek or not."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The 'Golden Age' of science fiction (typically defined as the period shortly after John W. Campbell took charge of Astounding magazine to the late '40s) produced many of the seminal ideas now taken for granted (and almost cliched) by the SF genre. Foundation was certainly part of this era, defining two major ideas: that the entire galaxy would be populated by humans (no aliens around - an early look at the idea that we might just be unique), and that mass human behavior can be codified in mathematical algorithms and to a certain extent is predictable. These ideas, along with several other lesser ones, form the background basis for Foundation, where the galaxy-spanning Empire (closely modeled on the Roman Empire) is in decline and Hari Seldon has created the initial equations of psychohistory, which predict the eventual complete collapse of the Empire and an ensuing 'Dark Age' lasting 30,000 years. Although Seldon can see no way to prevent the Empire's collapse, he does see a way to reduce the resulting Dark Age length to about 1000 years, by setting up a Foundation in the far reaches of the galaxy, whose nominal mission is to preserve man's accumulated knowledge in a repository called the Encyclopedia Galactica.With this as the background, the story revolves around particular points in the Foundation's existence where it is in danger of being destroyed or overrun. Originally written as separate stories, each crisis episode's (all foreseen via the magic of Seldon's mathematics) resolution progressively moves the Foundation forward from a backwater, isolated, and ivory-tower society towards an active political power, capable of dominating its surrounding stellar mini-empires, becoming an island of light in a sea of darkness and ignorance.Viewing each episode by itself, none of them are representatives of great writing, marred by weak characterization (a typical Asimov failing) and almost hackneyed plotting. The massive shift in viewpoint and background at the start of each episode is also jarring, as the reader must readjust to a whole new set of conditions each time. However, the power of this book and its two successors is in the grand scope of the entire story line, very typical of stories of this era, as they are far more idea centered than character or plot driven. This book almost cannot be evaluated by itself, isolated from the rest of this set, because the full panorama and scale of the complete story far outweighs the individual contribution of each piece of it.As an introduction to the Seldon universe, this first book is adequate, with surprisingly little dating, given that the separate pieces of this book were written almost 60 years ago. Yes, there are places where vacuum tubes still reign, but they sit right next to the use of holographic images, which weren't even on the scientific horizon when this was written. But the technology here is almost irrelevant, as the focus is on how to guide and shape a society of humans, to develop a proper government within which individuals can grow and be creative, while at the same time there is a background thread that asks if all human actions are pre-ordained.Take the time to read this; ignore some of the blatant examples of '40s pulp-level style. Look instead for the great ideas and their interrelationships; feel the sense of wonder. But to fully experience why this is considered one of the best classics in the field, Foundation &amp; Empire and Second Foundation are immediately required follow up reading."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first book I have read on my own and really fallen in love with. I am in 8th grade, and I found it very easy to understand and tremendously engrossing. I just couldn't put it down after I started it. Sometimes I would laugh out loud as the characters would pull such amazingly witty and ingenious double-crosses on their enemies. A definite must read for any sci-fi fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is just about the best SF series ever, and this book is the best in the series. If you want to get into Asimov's universe this is the place to start. Just as good are his Robot series. Every one of Asimov's characters are expertly defined and easyly remembered. One of the best reads I ever had. Excellent (that's why I won't spoil the plot)."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Isaac Asimov's Foundation is one of the most extraordinary books I've ever read. Its brilliant plot, minute detail and far-ranging scope are unequaled. Another plus for this book is that you realised it didn't focus on 1 main character; it's focus was on the evolution of the Foundation as a whole. More, it's the first book in the most famous science fiction series ever. A must-read for any serious SF fan."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov's entire line of work, and namely the 'Foundation' novels, have long been considered by some to be the gold-standard of science fiction. As an avid reader of the genre, I felt implied to give the series a whirl, to see what all the fuss is about and to finally spend some time with one of the grand-daddies of the golden age. So I bought 'Foundation', along with the other two novels in the original trilogy, and away I went.Very boring. Very dry. Very forgettable. The problem here, I think, is that while Asimov had some very fantastic ideas floating around in that pioneering noggin of his, he was not exactly the best at nurturing them into full-form on the page. Thus, we have a series of novels that read much more like outlines of a stronger and more fleshed-out epic. The setting is grand, the characters are intriguing. The plot is one for the ages. The final product, however, does little justice to these ideas and I found that to be vastly disappointing. All throughout, I wanted more. I wanted more world-building - not necessarily technobabble and meandering Dickenson discription, but at least more insight into the nature of this vast civilization apparently on the brink of collapse. Very much the same with the characters - I wanted to sympathize with Hari Seldon as he worked to keep knowledge alive in the face of ignorance, but it was so hard to do so when he was presented as little more than a piece of animated cardboard. I was thinking constantly about what could have been, and that put a damper on the overall effect.I think the ideas and character tropes Asimov put forth in his trilogy have been worked with by other authors and brought to life far more successfully in the years since its initial release. Novels that come to mind are Dan Simmons's awe-inspiring 'Hyperion' series and Neal Stephenson's bulky 'Anathem'. In these books, great ideas are coupled with great writing. The results, as much as it hurts me to say it, put Asimov's original to shame.'Foundation' is a great series to read if you want to witness science fiction as it was in its infantile and supposedly-golden age. But I think that it#s nevertheless important to understand that pioneering ideas can further develop and be presented in far-superior ways as the years progress. Such is the case here. Imaginative, but slow and dated. Should most certainly remain in print and continue to be read, but I do not think it is the gold-standard classic it has been made out to be. Others have done much better."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation is set about 12,000 years in the future where the weakening grip of the galactic empire is showing strong signs of decline.Enter Hari Seldon, key figure in the book, whom, as per his psycho-historical mathematics claims to bring 30,000 years of barbarism down to a mere 1000 by setting up two foundations at the opposite ends of the galaxy. The story about the first Foundation follows and here asimov attacks typical sociological issues and how the infant society deals with them.It is more of a series of well-connected snapshots over several decades, rather than a contiguos moving story/time line. The only weakness of the book, if you want to call it that, is the lack of good character development... but it doesnt impede the reader from following the twists and turns of the plot.Foundation is the first book in what is perhaps Sci-Fi's most imaginative and complete series by Issac Asimov. It's almost a sin to not finish the series which include (in order)foundation and empiresecond foundationfoundation's edgefoundation and earth &lt;-- best book of the seriesTo get most thrill out of the series, i highly recommend reading the robot series (the caves of steel, the naked sun, the robots of dawn, robots and empire) before moving on to foundation's edge and foundation and earth."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This book has flaws, yes, as some of the earlier reviewers have pointed out, but they are seriously missing the point if they give the book fewer than 2 stars. Asimov was a man of great ideas and scientific knowledge, but I do not believe that he ever took a creative writing class. He was writing back in the days when a writer wrote, rather than talked about writing. So, OK, some of the characters talk as though they are in a cowboy movie. So, OK, some of the dialogic phrasings are awkward or stilted. So, OK, there is only one teeny tiny female character (as a black man myself, I might aslo point out that we of the African Diaspora are noticeably absent from the futuristic roll call). The whole idea of psychohistory is so engaging that you sit there for hours pondering it and thinking, and he was so young when he wrote this. So young. This is a great book, a true classic."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I doubt I shall ever come across a better writer of history or Science Fiction in this lifetime.Asimov was a great student of history, psychology, and science. Unlike most students and academics, though, Asimov also was a superb writer in each area and could distill the essence of his knowledge into entertaining non-fiction or fiction. Read his books regarding history of civilization or about Black Holes or about religion and I'm sure you will appreciate his knowledge about such diverse topics and his ability to keep you awake at night reading!I'm not saying you will agree with his every point - only that you will be exposed to a well-articulated discussion.In the Foundation series, it is clear Asimov has combined history and psychology to an extraordinary degree. The question is, was this young man of Russian birth writing of Russia's future or was he merely writing of England's past?You see, a great civilization has encompassed all the known world. Then, inevitably, it will begin a collapse. As in other empires, collapse begins in part due to the burdensome administrative hub (Moscow, Washington DC or London?), combined with a recession at a time when the outcast and downtrodden are fed up with unemployment and unfulfilled promises of a better future (Eastern Europe or the inner cities of America or Britain). This dilemma is further exacerbated by revolutionaries and terrorists in the hinterlands.Enter Mr. Seldon. Clearly he is based on the alter ego of Asimov himself, for the man is a student of mathematics, psychology, religion and history, as well as of politics.I could write a book to dissect the brilliance of the writing and the lessons for all leaders, but will simply say that Foundation, Foundation & Empire, and Second Foundation make up my favorite all-time trilogy. No knock against Lord of the Rings intended. LOTR is terrific but not quite as good."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Having suffered the derision of fellow sci-fi fans for many years, I recently picked up the Foundation Trilogy for the first time; I was actually pretty disappointed by my first exposure to Asimov's longer works. Obviously the man is one of the renowned masters of science fiction because he got there first: he wrote about a Galactic Empire long before it became cliche, speculated about the limits and triumphs of science, etc. That said, what struck me most about this beginning to the Foundation series was that Asimov's story exactly parallels Hari Seldon's theory of psychohistory: only movements, not individuals, are significant in shaping history, and even the main characters in the book are accordingly underdeveloped to the point of being forgettable. I enjoy world-building as much as the next sci-fi/fantasy buff, but I also appreciate well-constructed sentences and good characterization, both of which I found sorely lacking here. Also, &quot;Foundation&quot; is clearly a man's world, setting a tradition of male adolescent sci-fi in which strong and/or interesting female characters have no place.I give the novel three stars only because it sets up the background for the next two in the series, which overcome some (but not all) of the faults in this first effort. But I think that I will return to my personal favorites among the old masters, including Robert Heinlein and Theodore Sturgeon, who have always delivered philosophy, wit, and imagination along with excellent storytelling."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The story is one of the most detailed, most thought-out stories ever.

I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"I read this book based on overall good reviews of the series and Asimov in general. The story had some interesting moments and actually started off quite solidly. But then, the politics took over and the Sci-Fi aspect was completely lost. This book felt like a drama class play that could have taken place anywhere and almost at anytime. I never felt like I was in space or that anything related to Sci-Fi was present. I didnt mind the story so much but being a Sci-Fi book means that I expect some technical \\"sciency\\" details and didnt get anything in this book. I also did not like the huge jump from each major chapter regarding time. Just when you feel that the plot and characters are \\"settlling-in\\" you jump 80 years and have to start all over again. Lastly, there was very little scene setup. I rarely knew where the dialog was taking place or what the surroundings were...hence the comparison to a stage play.If you like Arthur Clark's style of Sci-Fi like me and prefer the Science aspect of Sci-Fi to be featured in books you read then I would not recommend this book. It is somewhat over-rated and isn't really Sci-Fi In my opinion...."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The first time I tried to read Foundation, I was six years old, and it was simply too complex for my developing mind. Just a few months ago, however, I was cleaning out my attic and came across the same old book. To ascertain it's actual nature as interpreted by the adult mind, I read it again. I was amazed not only by the sheer brillance and ingenuity of the ideas contained within it, not only by the grandiose size of the subject matter, but mostly by the writing, which I regarded as absolutely horrid. The plot is clunky, the conversations roll off the tongue like sandpaper covered in peanut butter, and the descriptions could have been written better by some obscure species of mosquito. As a book, it could be improved by changing the title from &quot;Foundation&quot; to &quot;How Not to Write a Book&quot; or &quot;Please Steal These Ideas and Rewrite Them in English.&quot; I highly reccomend it to people for use as a very expensive and ineffective paperweight."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation came to me highly recommended. I am not new to science fiction, but I have not read that much of this genre. I was looking forward to something that would really blow my mind away. though I admired several things about the book and thought it was a nice read, I am not going to read the other books in this series. Coming away from this book, I felt it was good, but not much more. There were several ways in which I clearly found the book to be lacking. Though Asimov's style is surely concise and highly readable, he views plot as the central element to his writing, at the expense of other aspects of great fiction that really should have been incorporated. I will outline these at length because it appears that the book's praises are already sung widely.First, there is not much character development. Characters are presented merely to accomplish a historical event in the flow of the story. We get a feel for the characters not as real people, but as actors on the stage of world history. Though the reader admires the nerve and intellect behind each of these heroes, there is little else that makes them interesting. While this kind of presentation of characters may work in movie adaptations or history textbooks, I like to view my characters as a little more than men at work. Everybody is always scheming, there's not much downtime or description of what day-to-day life is like with these guys so far in the future, such far-off planets.Secondly, there is a lack of real meaning or symbolism that defines great books. The closest we get to intrinsic meaning is the description of the false religion that Salvor Hardin invents. And this only helps us understand what the author probably thinks about organized religion. The all-importance of nuclear energy also seems like propaganda to get ther reader to &quot;understand&quot; how important it will be in our era, with no attention paid to other kinds of fascinating technology that may exist in the future, such as super-intellect, robotics, biotechnology, etc. I don't know if Asimov was just lacking in creativity, because with the exception of his brilliant description of the mother planet Trantor, the only thing different between this far off future and nowadays is the ability to jump through space.Thirdly, romance does not play a role in the book. There no women in the book, which means there can be no romantic intrigue, or world events influenced by a woman. Also, there is no sense of wonder and excitement that a reader surely hopes to get when they enter an author's imagination. The landscape of these far off worlds is sparesely and hardly described. We spend much of our time in staterooms.On the other hand, if you like books that are centered on brilliant leaders of nation-states and how their decisions affect the course of history, you will like this book. If you are fascinated by the economic, political, and sociological macroforces that shape history, you will like this book. If you're more about the game than the players, you will like this book."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation consists of five stories separated by several decades each. The Trantorian Empire has lost its hold on the outer perimeter of the galaxy. Hari Seldon, founder of the predictive science of psychohistory, knows that the Empire is doomed to collapse and that thirty millennia of barbarism and anarchy will ensue before a second empire will rise. But Seldon claims to know a way to shorten the dark ages from 30,000 years to a single millennium.The stories in Foundation chronicle the infancy and development of Seldon's Foundation society initially established on the remote planet Terminus. Seldon's psychohistory predicts several crises that the Foundation must survive in order to bring about the desired drastic shortening of the dark ages. Four of the five stories each describe a crisis that confronts the Foundation.So far I've read the Robot series, the Empire series, and the first three books in the Foundation series (Prelude to Foundation, Forward the Foundation, Foundation). I find the epic story so far to be extremely engaging and imaginative. The stories in Foundation are a bit disconnected and not fleshed out enough, but nevertheless do a more than adequate job of describing the fall of the Galactic Empire."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The trilogy is essential, but since Asimov also capitalized on his own genius by writing what seems to be hundreds of lesser Foundation stories, it can all get very confusing and a bit draining. This is the second book in the original trilogy, so it is from a science fiction point of view essential reading. The trilogy itself comes up with two highly memorable characters, Hari Seldon, the psycho-historian, who uses Mathematics to predict the future and establish a \\"Foundation\\" that will limit the dark ages after the fall of the \\"Empire\\" to a single millenium (as opposed to ten.) He reappears as a hologram at certain points in the story with more or less accurate takes on what is happening in \\"History\\" at that point.The other very memorable character is the Mule. He represents the variable that makes predicting \\"History\\" mathematically a tricky business at least, not to mention impossible. He is a nasty totalitarian character who strangely in Asimov's hands manages to elicit some sympathy. Asimov is playing with the idea of predicting human behavior scientifically (or controlling it scientifically,) but this character is also a humanistic meditation on how masses of people get overwhelmed by evil social forces like fascism and soviet communism. You can see that Asimov lived through the era of Hitler, Mussolini, Franco and Stalin and that these cult of personality tyrants and the submission of masses of people to their destructive and sadistic wills profoundly affected his view of human nature. Foundation and Empire seems to be an attempt to come to terms with that experience, and so has something to say about the specifics of twentieth century history, as well as about historical philosophy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation trilogy (three first books) and the Foundation series (all seven) are often regarded as the greatest set of Science Fiction literature ever produced. The Foundation series won the one-time Hugo Award for \\"Best All-Time Series\\" in 1966. Isaac Asimov was among the world's best authors, an accomplished scientist, and he was also a genius with an IQ above 170, and it shows in the intelligently concocted but complex plots and narrative. There are already 331 reviews for this Science Fiction novel, however, I still believe I have something unqiue to contribute which is stated in my last paragraph.This book and the rest in the series take place far in the future (allegedly 50,000 years) at a time when people live throughout the Galaxy. A mathematician Hari Seldon has developed a new branch of mathematics known as psychohistory. Using the law of mass action, it can roughly predict the future on a large scale. Hari Seldon predicts the demise of the Galactic Empire and creates a plan to save the knowledge of the human race in a huge encyclopedia and also to shorten the barbaric period expected to follow the demise from 30,000 years to 1,000 years. A select people are chosen to write the Encyclopedia and to unknowingly carry out the plan to re-create the Galactic Empire. What unfolds in this book and in the books that follow is the future history of the demise and re-emergence of a Galactic Empire, written as a series of adventures, in a similar fashion to the Star Wars series.Even though this is arguably the greatest set of Science Fiction novels ever written, I do not recommend it to those who are only mildly interested in Science Fiction. Character development is not the focus of these novels and the large amount of technical/scientific details, schemes and plots can become both confusing and heavy for the unitiated Science Fiction reader. If you read this one you will feel the need to read the others which may take a long time. If you are new to Science Fiction start with something lighter and when you are hooked you can continue with this series. Also, in my opinion the second and third books were better than the first."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"[The quotation is from Salvor Hardin, Mayor of Terminus.]Let's say it's around 1940 or so; you're studying chemistry in grad school but your true love is history; you've read Edward Gibbon's _The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_, but writing a historical novel set in the _past_ would require just too much research; you get the bright idea of writing a historical tale set in the _future_, about the decline and fall of a _Galactic_ Empire, and you suggest as much to John W.

Do you:(a) drop the idea and write something else?(b) write the story just as Campbell describes it?(c) use a little imagination, make Campbell's idea a bit more intellectually presentable, and crank out, not just a single story, but a Hugo-award-winning series?If you picked (c), congratulations; you're Isaac Asimov.The Hugo didn't come until 1965, when the Foundation series won for best all-time series (defeating even Tolkien's _Lord of the Rings_ books). By then Asimov had long ago tired of the series; you can tell by the first part of the third book. (But the _second_ part of the third book is probably the best part of the original three volumes.)And heck, even in order to keep it going _that_ long, he had to introduce a radical departure from the Seldon Plan, in which the Mule initiates not just another Seldon Crisis but a new element altogether, one that wasn't accounted for in the Plan. (And in even later installments, it becomes pretty clear that Asimov isn't exactly thrilled by either the Plan or the Empire it's supposed to bring about.)But in the first volume, all of it is still fresh. Here we meet Hari Seldon for the first time, get slightly acquainted with his mathematical science of psychohistory, and learn what he's done to keep the decline of the Galactic Empire from leading humanity into 30,000 years of barbarism. He can't avert the decline, but he's got a way to reduce the period of barbarism to a mere millennium.He's set up two Foundations at opposite ends of the galaxy. And he's carefully set the ball rolling so that every so often there will be some sort of sociopolitical crisis, to which there's only one possible resolution. All the Foundation has to do is wait until the crisis narrows everything down to just one option, and then figure out what the heck that option _is_ . . .Well, I think you can see that the pattern leaves some room for the exercise of intelligence, but not a lot for individual initiative. No wonder Asimov let the Plan start going awry; the story might have lasted a thousand years, but the dramatic possibilities wouldn't.Anyway, it's a great, great series. This is where it begins in realtime, although the later novel _Prelude to Foundation_ is \\"first\\" according to the chronology of the Foundation universe. (And the Empire novels -- _Pebble in the Sky_, _The Stars, Like Dust_, and _The Currents of Space_ -- take place even earlier. So do most of the robot stories.)If you haven't read it yet and you think you might be an SF fan, you'll want to get around to it pretty soon. Start here, and enjoy."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"The Foundation Trilogy is my favorite sci-fi book series, and also my favorite work by asimov. The first book in the series, Foundation, is concerned primarily with two concepts. The first is the concept that history repeats itself over and over again, and that just as great empires fell in the past, the same problems will in the future aflict empires once they become too big. And naturally after the fall of a great empire, chaos ensues. The other concept this book describes is the theory that science and mathematics are capable of predicting the trends in complex systems such as large groups of people.I am going to be honest. This book was revolutionary for its time, and a great many famous sci-fi writers were inspired after reading this book. I know that I personally could never look at world governments the same way after reading this book. It truly opens your eyes to tendancy of people to make the same mistakes over and over again, repeating the same patterns on a large scale. And not only is this book easy to read and greatly thought-provoking, it is also great fun. It uses Asimov's trademark style. Little violence, even less sex, but a great plot and lots of cool technology. If you take science fiction at all seriously, you owe it to your self to give this book a read."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Foundation (1951) is the first SF novel in the Foundation series. Although originally a series of novelettes published separately in Astounding, it was later combined into this novel.\\"The Psychohistorians\\" (1950) was created as an introduction to the series with the publication of the Gnome press novel. It describes the political maneuvering by Hari Seldon to establish the Foundation on Terminus.\\"The Encyclopedists\\" (1942) relates the first of the \\"Seldon Crises\\" when the Foundation is caught between the retreating empire and the growing Anacreon kingdom.\\"The Mayors\\" (1942) tells of the second crisis when Wienis, the Prince Regent of Anacreon, decides to take over the Foundation.\\"The Traders\\" (1944) depicts the third crisis after Askone arrests a Foundation agent trying to spread the Scientism religion.\\"The Merchant Princes\\" (1944) recounts the fourth crisis when a Foundation trader discovers a market for his advanced technology devices.Although the empire portrayed within this novel was actually based on the Roman empire, technology itself became a major force in the story. Thus, slavery was not a problem in this empire until it began to decline and lose its technology. This decline also allowed the Foundation to spread its influence through advanced technology.When these stories were written, computers were only laboratory toys. Thus, the original Foundation series didn't incorporate computers as such. These stories seem strangely old-fashioned without household, business and embedded computers. Nonetheless, the author did foretell the use of electronic hand calculators.The author did include computers in the robot stories written during this timeframe, but they were massive devices used in the factories to design and manufacture robots. The emphasis was upon positronic brains -- something like neural nets -- rather than true computers. Maybe our industry just hasn't yet caught up to his technological projections.This novel is one of the most famous works of science fiction. While it describes future sciences far beyond current capabilities, it still inculcated a sense of the methodology underlying real science and technology. While the author went on to become a major writer of science fiction, he also became one of the best elucidators of popular science in the world.Still, this tale contains all the flaws of Campbellian science fiction. The major characters are always male. The dialogue is somewhat stilted and old-fashioned. In addition, the story contains more ideas than action. Of course, this tale is also outdated because of all the imitations and stimulations resulting from it.Highly recommended for Asimov fans and for anyone else who wants to read classic works of science fiction.-Arthur W.

I am totally incapable of writing an unbiased, objective review of this book, just as I am unable to say unbiased, objective things about my first girl friend. This was the first SF novel that I read (actually, I bought it for a friend and then read it before I gave it to him -- the beginning of a life-long nasty habit) when I was 14.The scope of the story is breathtaking, the pace is good -- especially for Asimov who tended to be pretty wordy -- and the details engaging. Asimov wrote this as a series of connected stories for &quot;Astounding&quot; magazine, and this shows in the oddly repeated facts that allowed the 'zine readers to follow the plot even when they missed earlier stories. It also adds a certain pulpy flavor to the text, which I think works well. SF about grand civilizations that are galactic in scope doesn't need to -- and probably shouldn't -- sound like Great Fiction. I think the gritty, quick style of Asimov's pulp writing works well.One of my favorite things about the whole &quot;Foundation&quot; series (you need to real all three of the originals, by the way, the newer ones are optional) is the way they presaged certain now-routine SF conventions. The most notable, of course, is the globe-encovering city/planet of Trantor, most recently replicated by George Lucas in &quot;Star Wars: The Phantom Menace.&quot; (The less said about SW:TPM the better...)You can also see in my signature above that Asimov has had other influences on me. Salvor Hardin was a character in this novel: a trader and an agent of the First Foundation."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"Asimov had an active and brilliant imagination - truly, a scientist writing fiction. This series is science fiction on a grand scale. When you keep in mind that this story originated in 1951, it is easy to see how much Star Trek, Star Wars and yes even Heinlein's & Clarke's later works borrowed from these ideas.Anyway, Asimov at his best was a creator; he had amazing ideas of the universe, how it worked, and how to structure stories that manipulated the readers expectations.The Foundation series is like a spider web that continues to become more intricate and complex with each chapter. The intricacy of the plotting is amazing, although honestly it's not self-evident in the first few stories of the first novel, given that they were published independantly, as serialized short stories told one at a time.Only with the second book did this change.The basic premise: The rise and fall of the roman empire, told on a galactic scale from a historian living in the 2nd empire a thousand years later.The setup: One man creates a science, called Psychohistory, a fictional precursor to Chaos Math (a real statistical science today). This psychohistorian, Hari Seldon, predicted that the vast Galactic Empire is about to crumble, dropping humanity back into the dark ages. This dark ages was due to last 30,000 years (I believe), and while it is too late to prevent this horrible breakdown of society, Seldon believes he can use this new math to shorten the time period between empires.To do so, he establishes two \\"Foundations\\" made up of scientists, one at the outer edge of the galaxy, and the other at \\"Star's End\\". In advance, Seldon plots out the future (using the math of psychohistory), and sets in motion a series of \\"domino\\" events. The Foundation faces crises and problems, forcing change in both strategy and focus for the next several hundred years. But Asmimov continues to modulate the story throughout each of the books, and building upon the previously-understood structure.In fact, once you think you've read enough permutations on the same idea, Asimov starts tearing the structure down, introducing variables into the story that further complicate matters.A caveat about the most often-touted complaint about Asimov: His writing style (or lack thereof):In 1951, when these stories were first published, Asimov was not a great writer - as in, a writer of literature. His descriptions, characterizations and storytelling technique all left a lot to be desired. His technique got better with the passing years, such that any of his fiction written after 1970 or so reads easily.But that is not the point, here. Asimov didn't create great characters (save for his robot stories) - he came up with mind-bending ideas and subsequent permutations.The litmus test of whether or not Asimov is for you: Read 'The Last Question'. It's a 12-page short story. Not brilliantly written, but a fantastic story with amazing ideas contained inside. When you get to the last sentence of it, you will probably be blown away. If you are, Foundation is for you.Read them - and commit to all of them, because they get better as they go, generally speaking. The first three were written in 1950 - 53. But the fans demanded that he someday continue the story, so he continued with a fourth book in 1983, and the last in 1986. Some complain that the last book is overlong - and I agree - but the last sentence of the last book is...amazing.The books:FoundationFoundation and EmpireSecond Foundation (contains the best story - Search By The Mule)Foundation's Edge (best overall book)Foundation and EarthAfterward, Asimov went back and wrote prequel novels (Prelude to Foundation, Foundation's End) taking place prior to and concurrently with events from the first book. He later admitted that he wrote prequels because the main story had gotten so complicated, he felt he'd taken the story as far as it could go.The prequels aren't too bad, but they are completely non-essential."},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"First I should say that this is a great book. It is the second book in the Foundation Trilogy. And if you need some help on the order of the books, here tis : 1)Prelude to Foundation 2)Forward the Foundation 3)Foundation 4)Foundation and Empire 5)Second Foundation 6)Foundation's Edge 7) Foundation and Earth. #s 3,4, and 5 are the original trilogy. I have reviewed all of them. They're all good. This particular book has two parts. In the first part the Foundation is faced with the dying but still strong Galactic Empire, and in the second, more interesting part, they face the rising Mule. A few words bout him, he's not what or who you might think he is. The next sentence might be considered a spoiler, so choose to read it or not. The Mule is actually Bobo( this word only appears once in the book, and might be missed). Well, have fun reading!"},{"Title":"Foundation and Empire","review":"This is the first published volume (which was originally published as four short stories in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; magazine, 1942-1944, with an introductory section written in 1949) of Asimov's famous trilogy, which affected many later works. This trilogy, which won a special Hugo Award in 1966 for the best science fiction series of all time, was later expanded into further volumes by Asimov (in fact, two prequels are Asimov's &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;; after Asimov's death in 1992, other authors [for example, Gregory Benford's &quot;Foundation's Fear,&quot; Greg Bear's &quot;Foundation and Chaos,&quot; and David Brin's &quot;Foundation's Triumph&quot;] have contributed to the series [note that there are now five novels that serve as prequels to Asimov's first published Foundation book!]) . In these stories, spacecraft travel over large distances via &quot;jumps.&quot; The ships spend most of their time in a form of hyperspace, each jump being aimed at a certain target star. The central character, Hari Seldon, is a psychohistorian. Psychohistory is the mathematics dealing with the reactions of very large masses of mankind to social and economic stimuli (and the recent advances in chaos theory in advanced mathematics lends credibility to Asimov's psychohistory). His calculations predicts an end to the Galactic Empire (an empire remarkably similar to the Roman Empire on Earth). Two Foundations are set up to ease mankind through the dark area predicted (or else, the dark period will last 30000 years) and, after a thousand years, will join together to form a second Empire. Although Asimov's early writing style leaves much to be desired (recall this was all put together in his early 20s during World War II when he worked for the U. S. Navy and when he was finishing his graduate work at Columbia Univ.), it is still fun reading; I enjoy every time I reread it. It is particularly enjoyable in the context of the other volumes. This first published volume has five parts. In &quot;The Psychohistorians,&quot; an introductory tale (which begins about 46 years after the events described in &quot;Prelude to Foundation&quot; and thirteen years after the events described in the last story of &quot;Forward the Foundation&quot;), Dr. Hari Seldon and a young colleague are arrested on the planet Trantor (the governing center of the Galactic Empire) and tried for treason. Seldon's group are to be exiled to the planet Terminus on the galactic rim where they will form a scientific refuge. Seldon also plans to set up another group somewhere else. We later learn, in Part III, that this other group (the Second Foundation) is located at a place known as Star's End at the other end of the galaxy. In &quot;The Encyclopedists,&quot; taking place about fifty years later, a large number of members of the original Foundation are on the planet Terminus and are compiling a massive encyclopedia to prepare for the upcoming dark age. But, why were no psychobiologists and only one psychologist present among the original colonists? The remaining three parts continue the development of the Foundation on Terminus."},{"Title":"Paddington Goes to Town","review":"It's very hard to figure out who this book is for and when they should be reading it. What I mean is, the writing, humor, and storyline is for a more advanced reader, but the vaguely arch teddy-bear character and treatment is for a younger kid. So the ones who might most like it could have trouble reading it and the ones who can read it might very well find it too childish. So far that's been our experience, at least, with our readers.That said, the book is a good read-to. Some of the humor is over the little ones' heads, but the charm of the character and of the situations he encounters comes through clearly and seems to satisfy. I don't think this is a library essential, but it certainly is a fun option to have available when the mood strikes."},{"Title":"Paddington Goes to Town","review":"Liked by my young son.

This book has the potential for helping a child in Foster Care cope with his or her tragic situation. However, this book is fairly long and probably best read by the child instead of read to the child. So, the child needs to be higher functioning. Also, the setting of the story may be hard for a child in North America to relate to (a Vietnamese war orphan in Austrailia who spends sometime working in the restaurant owned by the foster parent.) Last, this story may be more appropriate for a girl to read or listen to. Nevertheless, it is a potential intervention that could be considered for kids who are either orphaned or legally orphaned to address bereavement."},{"Title":"More Deaths Than One: A Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"Someone gets killed on-air during a radio show.

Portrait of a Sea\\" is probably the best homage ever paid to the \\"Mare Nostrum\\": passionate, informed and attentive to the many colors of its shores. Also his \\"The Great Siege: Malta1565\\" reveals this same passion.Unfortunately this book is just the average list of islands arranged in roughly geographical order and enlivened here and there with a colorful touch.Nothing more - nothing less.As a traveler, I have toured extensively in the Mediterranean and enjoy as well reading about its history and traditions.If you are reading this review, there may be a chance you're looking at this book because of my same reasons and could be interested in similar travel-related books I had the chance to read (and enjoy) about this argument:- Predrag Matvejevic - \\"Mediterranean. A Cultural Landscape\\". Nostalgia over the shores of the dark wine sea (if interested, I have written a review on it).- Ernle Bradford - \\"Mediterranean. Portrait of a Sea\\". Possibly the best book I read on history, culture and traditions of the Mare Nostrum.- John Ash - \\"A Byzantine Journey\\". A poetic, fragile and luminous evocation of the Byzantine past.- Stephen Minta - \\"On a Voiceless Shore\\". A travel on the footsteps of lord Byron: passionate, poetic and hugely learned.- James G. Frazer - \\"Pausanias and Other Greek Sketches\\" (1900). Yes, this is the author of the famous \\"Golden Bough\\". It is a collection on short sketches about archeological walks and visit on mainland Greece. Today everything is changed, but you still can catch some of the fascination described in this book.- Patrick Leigh Fermor - \\"Mani. Travels in the Southern Peloponnese\\" (1958). Deservedly praised for his sensibility in describing a vanishing Greece, this is one of the most touching homage ever paid to Greece. The remoteness of the Mani region is nowadays gone, but still you can enjoy the unique landscape and imagine how it must be at the beginning of the XX century.- Robert Byron - \\"The Station. Athos: treasures and Men\\" (1928) - by the same author of \\"The Road to Oxiana\\", it is a report of a trip to Mount Athos, written by a lover of Byzantine civilization. It cast a glance on some of the less known traits of modern Greek culture, the Byzantine heritage and the orthodox faith.- Henry Miller - \\"The Colossus of Maroussi\\". Listed here only because I read it, this is a book I greatly disliked: at least this is not the Greece I know and like... read at your own risk.- J.B.S. Morrit - \\"A Grand Tour. Letters and Journeys (1794-96)\\". Letters posted during the author's travels through the Aegean Sea. Very colourful and passionate, it is a testimony on how Greece was before the War of Independence.I do appreciate feedback.You are truly welcome if you can suggest other readings or just share ideas and comments!Thanks for reading."},{"Title":"Aeschylus' Prometheus Bound Greek Commentaries Ser","review":"There was a point at which some critics contended that \\"Prometheus Bound\\" was not actually written by Aeschylus, arguing that someone else, perhaps his son Euphorion, who was also a dramatist, The argument hinged on the portrait of Zeus in the play, which is highly critical of the king of the Gods and at odds with the wise and just Zeus of the \\"Orestia.\\" Since we have only a half-dozen complete plays of the ninety Aeschylus is believed to have written, it is difficult to make a judgment regarding his entire body of work. However, we do have fragments from the other plays in the trilogy, \\"Prometheus Unbound\\" and \\"Prometheus the Fire-Carrier,\\" which suggest that what happens in this first play sets the stage for an evolving Zeus, who eventually finds his better nature when he achieves a reconciliation with the rebel Titan. Given the dramatic scope of the \\"Orestia,\\" with its evolving notion of justice, it seems to me reasonable enough that Aeschylus was attempting something similar with this trilogy.\\"Prometheus Bound\\" finds the titan, who defied Zeus and gave humanity the saving gift of fire (among other sins), bound on a remote mountain peak with iron spikes driven through his flesh by the unwilling Hephaestus and his assistants Might and Violence, allegorical figures who define the source of Zeus's power. The scenes of the play consist of a series of dialogues between Prometheus and the ancient god Oceanus (the chorus consists of the daughters of Oceanus), Io, a woman turned into a cow because of Zeus's attentions, and Hermes, who wants to know the secret held by Prometheus that threatens the power of Zeus. Prometheus (whose name means \\"foresight\\") refuses and is then cast into the underworld to be punished further. At the heart of the play is the conflict between the immovable will of Prometheus and the irresistible force of the power of Zeus.Clearly this tragedy speaks to an archetypal human condition, wherein physical power seeks to break the mind of an individual to its will. The audience is caught in a dilemma, for on one side is the king of the gods and on the other is the savior of humanity, for without the gift of fire early man was doomed. Indeed, that was clearly the intent of Zeus. Consequently, like Prometheus, the audience is caught between their own rock and a hard place. Fortunately, by the end of the trilogy Aeschylus gives his audience an out, for the Zeus who is represented in this play is transformed into a more acceptable deity in the end. Even without those plays and knowing the innovative brilliance of Aeschylus as a tragic dramatist, we can certainly appreciate the overall story arc that begins with this play. For teachers who do not want to contend with the entire \\"Orestia\\" or have to contend with editing it down for students, \\"Prometheus Bound\\" represents a single work by Aeschylus that is equally as pivotal to our understanding of classical mythology."},{"Title":"Documents of Texas History","review":"The collaborative effort of Ernest Wallace, David M.

The girl gets advice from her grandfather, and thus the tale is set in motion. What sets this apart from the traditional tellings is the strong character development, as well as the point of view.Cooper's expressive illustrations set the mood for the story setting, as well as the images of the characters, beautifully.

From its humble beginnings as a Spanish fort (1770-1822), to the Mexican occupation (1822-1846), and into the United States (1846 to present day), this little spit of land has seen a lot of activity - and a bit of fame.James Doolittle (of the Doolittle raiders) was on-hand at The Presidio in April of 1988 during a WW II commemoration ceremony. And with him came Brig. General James (Jimmy) Stewart (you know him, right?).If you've ever wondered how certain roads in and around The Presidio got their names (Giggling, Bolio, etc.), you'll get some keen insights about where they came from. If you've ever wanted to know what The Presidio looked like before 1950, this book will show you some great images; including soldiers in full dress.My only beef with the book was that I felt it was a bit too heavy in pictures and didn't have enough historical information. I know, I know. The title of the book is \\"Images of America\\". But still, I would've liked a tiny bit more detail about the area to round out the flavor of the times.But great images.

Stories told to children.But now dragons have returned to Krynn. The darkness of war and destruction engulfs the land. Hope dawns with the coming of spring.Armed at last with the dragonlances, the heroes lead the people in the final desperate battle against the dragons. Knight and barbarian, warrior and half-elf, dwarf and kinder and dark-souled mage; they must overcome their own doubts and resolve their won conflicts before they can hope to defeat--Takhsis, the Queen of Darkness.\\"And so my journey into the magical and now dragon filled world of Krynn continues in \\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\" the third and final book in the (original) DragonLance Chronicles series written by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman and commissioned by TSR, the folks responsible for fantasy role playing game Dungeons & Dragons. The fourth book in this series the Dragons of Summer Flame was released in the winter of 2002 and is whopping 608 pages. I have not read it yet, but rest assured I shall.As it was in the first and second installment of the Chronicles series, the story centers around a group of eight companions (plus minor supporting characters), who separated and have now come back together because evil is afoot in the land once more. The evil is personified in the guise of the Goddess Takhisis, known as the The Queen of Darkness, one of the three God's creators of the world. Takhisis has begun her unleashed her plans to incarcerate the world under her flag and dragon of blackness. Meanwhile, Paladine, the God of Light, attempts to hold her back and appears in many guises throughout the story, but his most noble persona is that of a gold dragon. The Third God, Gilean, remains neutral in all conflicts, using his powers to keep the pendulum that swings between darkness and light in check; his persona is a white dragon.\\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\" culminates in the main event: the Companions, out reluctant heroes against the evil dragons and the Queen of Darkness. The Companions--Tanis, twin brothers Raistlin and Caramon, Sturm Brightblade, Tasslehoff Burrfoot, Flint Fireforge, Goldmoon, Laurana, and Riverwind now armed with the magical dragon orbs and silver Dragonlance of old face down the evil Takhisis has unleashed upon Krynn at the iron works of Pax Tharkas. Having mastered the both the Orbs and the Dragonlance, our heroes are bolstered by the return of the good metallic dragons (Platinum, Gold, Silver and Copper). But before the band of old friends can face down the demon's from below, they have to face those with reside within each of their own souls and within the group.What unfolds within the pages of \\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\" is a inviting descriptive narrative, more solid character development (Tanis and Laurana are one again given a large role, and at times their interplay is very exasperating, but nonetheless necessary to tell the story), tons of great combat, and of course some humor courtesy once again of our resident kender, Tas. Did mention that Tas--Tasslehoff Burrfoot--is my favorite character? I have never run across a character quite like him before.Add to this a smattering of betrayal, treachery (Kitiara), infirmity, and weakness that threatens to destroy all the companions have accomplished thus far, and you have the makings of an all too human adventure, one that captivates and enthralls.One the cover of the original paperback (there has been a re-lease of the book and as well as a hard cover edition each with different cover art) artist Glen Angus, has beautifully rendered, Rastlin, the dark mage, Caramon, his warrior twin brother, and Luarana. And oh yes a pesky green dragon menaces in the background. His cover illustrations in which he wonderfully captures the characters that fill this great saga adorn every book in the series. And of the books in this series is graced throughout with beautiful poetry and songs by Michael Williams.\\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\" like the books that preceded it, is a beautifully written tome that continues in the rich tradition of the first two books of the series. Although I knew that good would triumph in the end--because it always does--I was nonetheless in it for the journey, to see how the Companions were going to win and what scarifies they would have to make along the way.Weis and Hickman (not married by the way) who have weaved dozens of tales together, are a gifted writing team and they have crafted a series of books that take the reader to Krynn and make them part of that world.The heroes, whom we get to know even better in this installment, are flawed and quintessentially human--well except for the Kender and Dwarf of course--and are vested with as much emotional baggage as any human would be; that is the familiar the hook. The unfamiliar is the world in which they reside. A world populated by color coded dragons (gold, white, silver, copper, bronze, red, blue, brown and black) that denote their nature, good or evil. Unfamiliar as well are the Elves of Silvanesti, Qualinesti, and Kagonesti, the mountain dwarves of Thorbardin (love that name), the hill dwarves, the gully dwarves, and the wizards, both good and evil.If you enjoyed Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and Dragons of Winter Night, you will enjoy \\"Dragons of Spring Dawning\\" equally as well. I have of course only skimmed the surface of this seriously marvelous book; no review can do justice the sweeping vista that unfolds with the pages of the book, and indeed the series; it must be read, they must be read, again and again in order to fully appreciate the depth of its tale. Over the intervening years I have read each book not less than three times! That is a measure of how much I enjoy the series, and why I still tote them around with me every time I move.Other Books in the Series:Dragons of Autumn Twilight (DragonLance Chronicles, Vol. I)Dragons of Winter Night (DragonLance Chronicles, Vol. II)Dragons of Summer Flame (DragonLance Chronicles, Vol. IV)"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"The final book in the Chronicles Trilogy.

We lose some friends, gain others, and are suprised by the identities of a few.I cried, I laughed, and even though I knew the outcome from past readings, I held my breath and prayed the good guys would win.After finishing this book, I remembered why it is one of my all time favorite series.

The Authors did a very good job of adapting the novel script into comic form and I reccomend this series for anyone, dragonlance fan or comic book fan. Deffinately worth picking up at your local comic store or from Amazon."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"The third book in the series, it picks up a little bit from there the second book fell off.The characters, who have now had a chance to have fairly large development arcs, are very well fleshed out with solid personalities. Some of them, like Tanis and Tas have really evolved from their original one-dimensional nature. Both are much darker, as one would be if they went through what these guys have, but still seem to have hope. Others changes have been simpler, but still as important to the character. The one character who was intended to change the most, Raistlin, seems to have the least amount of change (for his arc, its better to look at the Twin sereis).What helps lift this book from the second is that most of the characters come back together. It is always difficult to follow a story if everyone is to split up, and thankfully most of the group comes back together.The story itself is a bit rougher then the previous two, with several of the sub-plots feeling very rushed to conclusion. The Raistlin plot is also somewhat tiresome, as they have been devoting a lot of time to it, without much happening.There is one very large bright point, and that is the Weis and Hickman are excellent at writing death scenes. The way the character that dies in this novel is written really choked me up.This is an excellent fantasy novel and a definite pace setter for the genre."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"SPOILER ALERT!!!!Dragons of Spring Dawning is the final volume in the Chronicles Trilogy. At the beginning of the book the forces of good are in disarray and headed for defeat at the hands of the evil Dragonarmies. However, since this is the last book in the trilogy you just know that things are going to turn around. First Laurana is named commander of the Knights around Palanthas and then her brother, Gilthanas, returns with the good dragons. After the good dragons are equipped with the dragonlances they drive the dragonarmies south in disorder. However, the blue Dragon highlord Kitiara has a trick up her sleeve. She preys upon Laurana's love for Tanis Half-Elven to capture the elven general; Kit plans to sacrifice Laurana to the evil goddess, Takahsis, and then give her soul to her death knight Lord Soth. When Tanis learns of this dastardly plot he leads the other companions to Nereka to free Laurana. Tanis also has an ace in the hole as he has managed to find Berem the Everman, who has a strange jewel in his chest that is preventing the evil goddess from returning. In the end, Tanis manages to rescue Laurana, Berem returns his jewel and prevents the return of the evil goddess and Raistlin turns to the dark robes.For the most part this book is a very satisfying conclusion to the series. We reach a measure of resolution with all of the major characters (some sadder then others) and we get a glimpse of what their future will be like. However, in some ways the ending is a bit too...neat. Why does Berem's jewel hold such power over a Goddess? How does his sister's death effect anything? Is it because of his sister's love that the entrance to the world is blocked? I don't get it and it is never completely explained. Also the fact that Fizban, the bumbling wizard who has been following them around for almost a year, turns out to be the god Paladine. That's a little too good to be true. And if he was a god, why not have some more powerful magic or something? Other then that this was a good book.In conclusion, I am giving this book four stars. The one star that it lost is for the ending. A better ending would have put a better cap on a magnificent trilogy."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"An amazing series.

It makes me want to read more about Raistlin."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"The battle of good versus evil with neutrality balancing the scale. This is one of the greatest triologies ever and it ends all right here. After building it up for two books, the story concludes or does it. The Companions are reunited and are in a sorry state. Tanis is a mess, Caramon distrut over Rais' betrayal, Flint is sick, Tas beginning to know what fear is and Laurana still selfishly loves Tanis. This story really deals with Tanis and him dealing with his issues that divide his love, body and soul. The book is a great read, easy but keeps you enthrawled the entire time. The descriptions of the world of Krynn and its creatures is so perfect that you feel as though you are in the world yourself. I say go read this book but make sure you read part I & II. I cannot say anymore about this book except that this triology has really changed my outlook in life even though I have read it about ten times or so."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This was an amazing book.

It is awesome."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"After the setback at the end of book two, hope finally dawns on Krynn. For the rediscovered dragonlances and the return of the good metallic dragons are finally turning the tide of fortunes against the forces of darkness in the War of the Lance. In the north, under the leadership of a new general, none other than one of our familiar companions, victories follow victories, cities are retaken, enemy commanders are captured, and for a time, evil seems to be on the verge of defeat. Nevertheless, the Dark Lady has a devious ruse of her own that would deal a devastating blow to the forces of good from which they may not recover. Meanwhile, the other half of the sundered fellowship struggles to bring back the Silvanesti dragon orb and reunite with their friends. Their efforts are meaningless to Raistlin, who already have found a way to wield the power of the orb and whose mind may have turned to darkness. The end comes in a frantic rush as the companions fight to rescue their friends in the evil lair of Takhisis, prevent the Queen of Darkness from gaining corporeal existence in Krynn, and finally escape with their lives. All the while, the nightmare that they all shared in the twisted woods of Silvanesti would come back to haunt them in the waking world.The thrills are not diminished from book two. One of the hallmarks of this book, and perhaps of the series, is unpredictability. Character make decisions out of love, fear and remorse, that seem to be unwise from the reader's standpoint; yet at the same time, these are the very marks that make them human (or otherwise). On the flip side, while some antagonists may come off as irreconcilably evil, the Dark Lady is more complex. Her insatiable thirst for power makes her callous, yet there are times when one can't help but feel some sympathy for her.The climax takes place in several places at once and comes in a frenzy of actions that are as exciting as I've seen. Despite the somewhat happy ending, there is still a dark overtone. Evil is not wholly defeated and still reigns supreme in some parts of land. Victory is paid for at great costs, and there is little cheer and much poignancy as the companions gather for the last time before going their separate ways. The sweetness of victory is tempered by the memory of those who are gone and by the knowledge that those who remain are no longer the same. Nevertheless, the end is also uplifting by the realization that true friendship and love can endure.The Chronicles has left a legacy of memorable characters. It's unfortunate that, despite the many DragonLance sequels, many of them won't play a major role again. Thus the Chronicles can be said to be unique and special in this sense. Other fantasy works have left me impressed, awed, even shocked, but few have been as moving as the Chronicles. If any work can be said to have captured the spirit of Tolkien, the Chronicles would have my vote."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"An Excerpt from the novel:\\"Insane, desperate rage twisted Tanis's face. Somehow he'd make Raistlin listen to reason! Somehow they would all use this strange magic to escape! Tanis started forward, then stopped. From nowhere - - - seemingly - - - had come a small silver dagger, long concealed, fastened to the mage's wrist by a cunningly designed leather thong.\`All right,' Tanis said, breathing heavily. \\"You'd kill me without a second thought. But what about your brother? Caramon, stop him!Caramon took a step toward his twin. Raistlin raised the silver dagger warningly.\`Don't make him come near me, Tanis,' Raistlin said. \`I assure you. I am capable of this, truly. What I have sought all my life is within my grasp. I will let nothing stop me. Look at Caramon's face, Tanis! He knows! I killed him once. I can do it again . . .'The War of the Lance nears its end . . . for good . . . or for evil . . .- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -Long years of desperate warfare are now nearing an end; the eternal battle between good and evil has long been waged over the face of Krynn and now the tumultuous emotions of a lifetime are crashing around our beleaguered cast of characters. Some will be tempted to join the ranks of the dark side, others will loose their life warring against the forces of evil, and still others will continue to fight against the minions of Takhisis, goddess of destruction. Along the way, our characters must overcome treachery, despair, and one of the bleakest winters of their lives. Will the power of good overcome, or will the dragons inherit the eart?. For good or evil the dye is cast and all of Krynn must pay the eternal price.Once again, the reader reunites with their favourite characters. Tanis, Raistlin, Strum, Caramon, Tas, Flint, Laurana, Riverwind, Goldmoon, and the delightfully doddery old mage, the enigmatic Fizban all meet once again to battle the forces of darkness and console each other along the way. However, there are many surprises in store for our careworn group of heroes. Tanis is torn between his love for Laurana, the gentle elf maiden and Kitiara, the ambitions dragon highlord and follower of Takhisis. Meanwhile, Raistlin has discovered a new magical talent that could be the key to his future, or the destruction of everything. Loyalties are stretched and breached, love is tried to the utmost, hatred is kindled, as the entire force of Krynn is rallied to fight the coming onslaught of dragons, our characters must not only confront these beasts of doom, but their own inner turmoils and disloyalties as well. The war is not only for the salvation of Krynn, but for the redemption of the soul. Nothing will ever be the same again.Not only do we, the public of readers, become drawn into the story by the fast paced action and the stunning revelations, but the sheer emotional depth and the realistic nature of the cast of vivid characters is what truly makes this tale classic literature. While the war rages on the outside, we are allowed to not only witness its irrevocable destruction of Krynn, but to see first hand how this degeneration of the world effects the characters we have come to love as family. How can we not weep as Raistlin begins his long fall from grace? How can we not experience Tanis's emotional turmoil over his love life? How can we not respect and admire Laurana, the Golden General, who risks everything for a man who no longer loves her? All these things and more culminate to produce an astoundingly complex and highly emotional tale that will leave the reader crying during many segments. Unforeseen betrayals, love lost, hopes destroyed, magic discovered, all these things must have their toll on the characters that we have come to love and admire. While they may not all be human, they have distinctly human emotion and desires creating what can truly be called modern literature at its finest. It would be impossible for the reader to remain unaffected by the emotions of Dragonlance. It would also be equally impossible for the reader to even begin to guess what outcome, whether good or evil, would come from our characters' actions and reactions. Truly, Dragons of Spring Dawning is as emotional as it is unpredictable. This is one story that cannot fail to draw the reader in.The sheer ingenuity of the plot and the extreme emotional depth displayed, is complemented by a rich and complex storyline, edge-of-the-seat action and suspense, and a terrifying cast of vitriolic villains. While the protagonists are deeply cherished by the reader, the villains make an equal, although opposite impression, truly engaging all of the reader's emotions, both love and hate. What could be more epic! Once again, we are treated to modern literature at its finest.Also, Dragons of Spring Dawning, is complemented with a wonderful rich and descriptive writing style that brings the magical world of Krynn vividly to life. Yet another virtue that Dragonlance can boast.In Conclusion: This is to be Krynn's bleakest hour. An hour when the decisions of a moment will affect a lifetime. An hour when sides must be chosen forever. An hour when love and hate, desire and despair, culminate into one heady brew to create an unforgettable epic that is just as emotionally demanding as it is imaginatively captivating. All of Krynn hangs in the balance and it is up to our beleaguered group of heroes to save their lost and dying world. Rich in characterization, writing, imagination, and epic in scope and storytelling, this is one tale not to be missed.

(even thought its fantastic) The Chronicles and The Legends trilogies are the pinnacle of what any writer should strive for...Characters that we all care about... I can honestly say that i wept when 2 main characters fall... (they shall remain nameless in case someone has been hiding under a rock for 20 years and hasn't read these books)The Great thing about this series is that there is so many prequels and tangential tales published that one could delve into the magical world of Krynn for years... but we have to remember that Krynn would not be as magical (both figuratively and literally) if it were not for the companions...Buy this series if you haven't read it... No one can love dragons without knowing this story...Thank You Tanis, Tas, Raist, Strum, Riverwind, Caramon, Flint, Goldmoon and the people of Solace...Oh yes, and Thanks to Mrs. Weis and Mr. Hickman"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"There is no time to mourn the loss of old friends for the struggling companions. Spring has arrived, and with it the final battle for Krynn. Over the grueling winter they succeeded in finding the legendary dragonlance, and the dragons of light have finally joined the fray. From the tortured forests of Silvanesti and across war-torn Ansalon, the heroes continue their crusade against both the forces of evil and their own personal demons. Tanis is torn between two tempting women, Raistlin struggles with his lust for power, and Tass... well.. he just makes me laugh, but none of the companions will ever be the same after this change of the seasons and there are many sacrifices yet to be made before Takhisis can be thwarted.In &quot;Dragons of Spring Dawning&quot;, Weis and Hickman provide an action packed finale for their now-classic Dragonlance Chronicles, and beautifully set the scene for the equally grandiose Legends series. High adventure and memorable heroes have made Krynn one of the most beloved fantasy worlds available, worthy of repeated and frequent visits."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"What can I say? Another great book in the Dragonlance series to read and read over again. This is the final enstallment in the Chronicals trilogy. This books is great but of course it is. It's action packed and the characters again come to life, not like they haven't been on your mind since you last put a Dragonlance book down. So read this, you'll enjoy, and don't forget to save room for another series."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"In a land of elves and dragons, magic and wonder, nine friends find themselves committed to a quest they cannot refute; a quest to save the world. These companions face the final challenges in their valiant attempt to preserve the balance of good and evil in. Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman wrap up their exhilarating Dragonlance Chronicles with the final installment, Dragons of a Spring Dawning. Although the story's plot, based on the good versus evil forte, may be considered a clich&eacute;, the outstanding character development and the intricate setting produced an exceptionally well-written adventure. Weis and Hickman's primary focus in the story is placed on the development of the main characters. From the beginning of the first Chronicle, the main characters possessed tangled threads of personal thoughts and emotions. As the trilogy progressed, some questions were answered while many others were left unanswered. With the conclusion of Dragons of a Spring Dawning, many of these threads were untangled allowing the relationships between characters and readers to become more intimate. Another main element of the story was the setting. The fitting descriptions of the setting aided by Weis and Hickman's use of personification enhanced the emotion and detail of the story. The importance and benefits of quality character development and setting is clearly shown in this book. Although many questions were answered, there were enough questions left open to ensure the continuation of the battle for the preservation of the balance between good and evil."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Dragons of Spring Dawning is the final book in the Chronicles Trilogy. It ties up all the the loose ends that have been floating around, and creates some more that become the Legends Trilogy. This book sees the death of another of our friends, and the final epic battle of good and evil. Except, the good guys and the bad guys don't always do what we expect. Tanis is in love with two women, which one will he choose. What else is Raistlin willing to sacrifice for power? Will evil come into the world forever, or can goodness prevail? All these questions are answered. I loved this book, it is what all the other stories have built towards. And at the end, saying good-bye to our friends, some of them forever, it is hard. But we can alwasy start over at the begining, or read the other 200 books that are set in the Dragonlance world. There is something special, however, about the Chronicles. These books are worth the time you invest, and should be on any self-respecting fantasy lover's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I remember staying up ALL night until like 2:00 or 3:00 in the morning to finish this novel. This brings many threads and questions/mysteries from the first two novels (see my reviews of other Dragonlance and fantasy stuff, incl. Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night) to a close. You find out the mysteries of what exactly the Green Gemstone man and why he's important and what happens to Raistlin. Also this epic fleshes out Raistlin to be the amazing character he is, portrayed at the end as one with way more influence and power than any of us thought. Also relationships triangle Tanis-Kit-Lauranana will end with Tanis choosing one over the other. I wont exactly spoil any of it for you. This saga has an excellent ending where divine influence is involved and brings about closure but raises new and exciting questions and mysterious on the world of Krynn. After this comes the Legends Trilogy (Time of the Twins, War of the Twins, Test of the Twins) which is just as amazing as Chronicles. If you read both Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night you MUST buy this book!"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This was the best of the Chronicles series. It was the most interesting, yet almost the most sad. I think it gave a great ending to the triology and made me want to read on to discover what happened to the rest of the characters. I think anyone who is interested in the Dragonlance world, needs to read not only this book but the other two books in the Chronicles trilogy."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"...how beautiful this book is! But i'll try.This book picks up right after Dagons of a Winter Night unlike the end of the first book, Dragons of Autumn Twilight. Here is a short summary of the book.Tanis has seemed to betray his friends for his former lover who is now an evil Dragon Highlord, but soon comes back to his companions to venture forth to find Laurana, Tas, and Flint to try to reunite the original party. They board a fast rouge boat built to soar out of danger, and cross the Blood Sea of Istar in hope of finding his lost friends. While abord, the party is in danger and a powerfull mage slightly escapes and the rest of the party is forced into a raging whirlpool by a dragon, and accidently fall upon a hidden city under the sea. The sea elves save them and put them in a dry town. Finally on land, the party finds out Laurana is captured, and that Tas and Flint slimly escaped. They must venture to the stronghold of evil in hope of saving their dearest friend!This a great book for people 12 years and up, and for those fantasy fanatics ( like myself )!!Thank you for reading my review and may the force be with you!!Frans, ( SnArf )"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This book is good classic fantasy in its own right, but as the last book in the Chronicles trilogy, it is not exactly what I hoped. There is an excellent subplot involving Raistlin, and as usual, good Flint-Tas humor, but I could see the twist at the ending coming easily--if you've read The Seventh Gate (last in the Death Gate cycle), you'll know what I mean."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"After the several books that I have read involving Dragonlance, I expected more of this seminal series. I had hope. The second book had some potential. This book dashed those hopes, and squandered that potential. The characters are entirely too transparent. If I have to hear one more time how kenders never feel fear, but in that instance Tasselhoff felt something that equates to fear, I swear I'm going to scream. Raistlin is so ambitious for power that he has to constantly remind everyone, including the reader, of this, and oh yeah, by the way, he's Fistandantilus. What? Could that have come from any farther out in left field?This series is a poor example of Fantasy writing. The only reason that this book rates two stars is that it may serve as a whirlwind introduction to the world of Dragonlance. However, a book of short stories could have served that purpose better.All in all a disappointment."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"There is nothing in the description to indicate that this is a comic book and not just a regular paperback in the series. I will be returning it."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I have read quite a few of Wies and Hickman's books and this one was by far the most intriging!! The last parts at Neraka still leave my shivering with delight. Tanis was one of my favorite characters in the whole series. He kept a cool head and stayed focus (until Kitiara showed up, but hey she tricked me too with her charming crooked smile!) Kitiara was one on the most intense and evil characters. She had her way with men which (I hate to say, I saw right through her)made her a very devious person. Wies and Hickman definately left the end of this book open for another series (That series is the Legend series made up of The Time of the Twins, The War of the Twins and the Test of the Twins) I think people everywhere should try this incredible series which left me spellbound for months. Even if you don't like fantasy i think you should give this a try. Hey, you really might enjoy it!!"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Books you should have already read : Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night.The companions are separated and even though they won an important battle against the evil armies of the Dark Queen, have silver, gold and brass dragons to help them and have mastered the art of using dragonorbs and dragonlances, the final battle has to be fought hand to hand(sometimes literally!).The end is not as predictable as it sounds. Friends will die or worse, turn enemies!Who will rule Krynn in the end is not obvious.So my dear friends, read on. Take a plunge in this high adrenaline finale to the triology that keeps you on the edge and makes you a part of the victories and defeats of the valiant warriors fighting to save Krynn from eternal darkness."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Weis and Hickman can sure end a series. It feel for me like the end of one of the D&amp;D videogames. With the final conflict with the Dark Queen at hand the Heroes must do everything to stop her. Even with some of the deaths of my more favorite characters I still had to read on to find out if the Dark Queen was going to be defeated or not."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This is one of the few series where the books kept getting better rather then having trouble living up to the first. During this third book I surprised myself when I was brought to tears when one of my favorite characters dies. It was done in such a poignant, refined and memorable way.I feel that Tas is the best character. He seems to be the character that ends up evolving the most throughout the books. I tend to cheer on the underdog so Tas' unflagging innocence of his crimes and Flint's constant mumbling were very refreshing and entertaining."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Dragons of Spring Dawning is a great book, but you should not read it without reading Dragons of Autumn Twilight, and Dragons of Winter night first. This would confuse you as well as ruin some of the story. But overall Spring Dawning, is one of my favorite Dragonlance books, as well as being a core book in the series."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"First, let me say that this review is predicated on my [positive] review of the first two books, where I address the series as a whole. This one addresses this [the third] book only.This book is the bittersweet conclusion to the story of the war of the lance. Continuing the trend of the first two, this volume gets darker as the companions struggles become more significant. We again find ourselves exploring new parts of the world with the characters and the death of Sturm in the second book has given us a hint that this isn't all going to end on a high note. At the end of this book you can sit back and think about all the characters you liked, and sure enough there is probably another entire novel or series (or more) on them, even the minor characters. Raistlin, the most complex character, doesn't really drive this story as he did the prior ones, and actually becomes a little simpler towards the end as things get wrapped up. Overall I thought this book was a great conclusion but was a little bit dry. A rating of 4 seems to be adequate, but if you've read the first two (which you should), then the rating of this one is fairly moot..."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This book was great, it brought together the perfect end to a wonderful series. The chronicles series is highly popular all around the world, and if you havent bought, and read these books, then you are missing out on a wonderful world of fantasy. Weis and Hickman make you feel for the characters, make you feel their pains and their sorrows, their love and their happiness. This is definately a wonderful book and a must read. If you buy this book, i garauntee that you will not second guess the decision."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"this was one of the first dragonlance books i read and after i read this one, i continued. when u first start off with the first book of the chronicles about the WAr of the Lance, it seems a bit confusing, but by the time u get to this book, it all comes together beautifully. the way the author describes everything in the book is great. its a good book for most ages i think, but tends to be long, so i recommend it for 12 and up. after reading this book, you should definately get Dragons of Summer flame and continue collecting other chronicles and sets. this book is really good especially for people interested in fantasy stuff."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This trilogy was actually the very first set of books I ever purchased. It got me hooked immediately to the fantasy genre. I don't claim to be any expert especially during the time I first read this third volume, but I must say that it is one of the best out there. It is not your a-typical conclusion to a good vs. evil plot. It left me with a feeling of, the best word I can think of to describe it, contentment. It had a sense of closure, but at the same time it makes you excited for more.Every page was/is a new twist, a new turn to the story. It never fails to grab your attention and make you want to get to the next page NOW! I believe I've read this book, and the previous two, at least 20 times throughout the years, and it just gets better every time.From Raisltin's fate (or the beginning of it) to Tanis' realization of his true feelings at the end of this volume, it lets you feel like you're a part of what's going on and enables you to relate and feel for the characters. If you've never read this book or the Chronicles trilogy and you consider yourself a true fan of fantasy, then consider this an awakening."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"A perfect conclusion to a perfect trilogy! The ending is why I love the Dragonlance novels. The bad guys didn't win but the good guys didn't either. The balance was restored. Nothing more, nothing less.The ending with Raistlin is great. I love him but he gives me the creeps."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I couldn't wait to finish it, cuz it was so good, and I had to find out what happened at the end of the war of the lance. It is a great conclusion to the 3 boooks. Compared to the other dragonlance books, I'd say it was average."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"What? Not worthy of Laurana's love? What does a guy have to do to be worthy of the love of a woman? Tanis saved Laurana's life on more than one occasion condemning his own in the process. He would even give up his soul to eternal darkness to save his quisala. The guy also ends up saving the world and the world in return takes away his two closest friends. Admittedly the character does deteriorate somewhat in this book, but we see his genuine characteristics come through in the end. Besides, you don't think I would give Wyrmslayer to just anybody now would you? So cut the guy (and the authors!) some slack please.This by the way is a great fantasy trilogy and I too wish there were more DL books involving the elven enchantress."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I feel a little cheated by what the authors do with Tanis in the latter half of this novel. Though not my favorite character, much of the story revolves around him. I guess they were trying to show that he is only human (half-human!), but it could have been portrayed without demeaning the character. At the end, you're left thinking that he is not worthy of Laurana's love. Fortunately the same could not be said of Laurana who is my fave character. She becomes an incredibly strong (mentally and emotionally) person who more or less ends up saving the day. I just wish there were more DL stories written about / including her."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I simply love this whole series! I find Raistlin do disarming that it hurts. He a a truly duplicitous being and one cannothelp but love all the more for it! Tasselhof Burrfoot is charming in his own irritaring way.Like a rash on a sensitive spot if you will. Cannot wait to see him die a horrid deat! Loved the book, loved everything - have nothing more to say! Thanks"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"You gotta admit the book was pretty good. I could see worse endings to the trilogy. However, most of the characters were pretty much ruined by the 2nd part. I just can't imagin Tanis like that! The only two chars to successfully live through the book was Raistlin and Laurana. The mage proved to be truly fascinating. Laurana (my favorite char) finally proved her courage and strength. Two stars goes to each of these two chars. As for the rest... *sigh* well, at least Flint was killed before he could suffer any of the changes."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I thought that this book was great, in fact it was the best out of the three in my opinion. It is well worth buying for all of you who loved the first two!"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Yeah well I am sick and tired of all you &quot;these books keep getting worse&quot; people. If you think they could be better you write your own DragonLance novel. Oh and I don't want to sound weird or anything but why do you people like Raistlin so much? All he does is drink his cough medacine and gets rests.Oh and before I forget the thing that really gets to me is the characters always making faces at each other to show their emotions."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Though the whole series seemed a bit clich&eacute; to me (too much of the good vs. evil thing), it was still excellent. I read it real fast, which is a good sign. I don't see what's wrong with what happens to Tanis: it's quite dramatic and it's good to see characters have their flaws. Raistlin rules, as always.

I could name off hundreds more examples but I don't think I can fit it into a thousand words."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This is buy far the BEST DragonLance book I've read so far. Not that Second Generation wasn't good either. I am now reading Dragons of Summer Flame. I think that's the next book after Spring Dawning. I hope it's as good. I hated when Flint Fireforge died.

I also liked it when Raistlin appeared and helped Caramon and how he summoned Cyan Bloodbane and disappeared again."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Let's just make a statement here: The Dragonlance Chronicles are BETTER than The Lord of the Rings. For some unknown reason, everyone seems to have put Tolkien's works on a platform and declared them untouchable. Yes, the Chronicles do take elements from Tolkien. But this is simply a better story; the characters are much more well-realized, and the series as a whole is just plain more compelling. And of course, Michael Williams's splendid poetry only helps matters."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I almost didn't even read this book, because I was so mad about Sturm's death in the Dragons of Winter Night.

The book started off great with Laurana kicking ass and Raistlin's background story finally coming out, but once this was over the middle of the book was awful (Laurana after the festival and Tanis n'companies journey from the elf place to Neraka). Here's how the twenty-or-so chapter's went; \\"Tanis where do we go?\\" says Riverwind\\"Stop asking me! Why do you think I should know?\\" Tanis said with a snarl. then Riverwind or Goldmoon would be shocked then tanis would realize it wasn't very nice and say his sorry. This happened all the time! I know Weis and Hickman wanted to show the turmoil going on inside of Tanis, but they just took it to far. Oh yeah, and then they would get captured, for the millionth time, and of course escape, with all there gear, of course.The ending was O.K. a few twists which were pretty cool, but at the same time predictable and not to dramatic. What other people have said and wrote about this book I was wanting something more, I guess. And what the hell, why did Tika go on the journey to Neraka? I wished her and Tasslehoff died. what the hell dude, Settle down, it's just a story. I know, it just made me mad that she went, anyway the story is dark and fun, filled with a number of different character's which are exciting, boring, malevolent, decitful, annoying, bright, and unforgetable. give this series a try, it's not bad."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I tried to order the hardcover edition of this book three different times.

This is not an example of that - this is an excellent work that can only be fully appreciated by reading the novels that preceeded it. Excellent writing by Weis and Hickman make this book a real winner. There are a few spots that could've been better - an ending that is pretty much a plug for the next series of books, and the rushed write-out of two characters is disappointing to say the least.

A great series, I'm going to download the Legends trilogy next."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Well delivered story, great characters and lots of fast paced action. Skipping the last book in the series which I started to read but quickly realized it was boring and rambling. Its like the authors just got bored with the characters and quit trying."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I read through the original three Chronicles when I was eleven or twelve years old. They immediately captured my imagination, and I found myself enraptured by the adventures of the strange fellowship of characters (with the goofy kender, Tas, being my favorite). The authors, Weiss and Hickman, did a fine job of crafting a vivid tale that was perfect for engaging the mind of a young boy, and I read the entire series several times through my teenage years.Recently, at the age of 32, I listened to the entire trilogy on audio book. I was happy to find that the adventures of the companions were still enjoyable, although not nearly as much so as when I was a child. There were a few too many cliches for me to rate the series as \\"amazing\\" by contemporary standards (one of the villains is even named \\"Verminard\\"... ugh), but this by no means makes the series a poor one. By all measures, the Chronicles is still a staple of literary fantasy, and it packs more action than most of its brethren, with far less filler. This, in particular, is one of the things that I think makes this Dragonlance series so enjoyable for young readers (plus, they're only about 400 pages each, as opposed to some of the obscenely lengthy fantasy tomes). I would still strongly recommend the Chronicles for young readers who are interested in fantasy."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I loved the 1st book in this series. This one didn't capture me like the 1st volume. I think it is because the great cast of characters were split up and therefore the \\"strength\\" of the story was diminished. I thought the characters were delightful together and when separated the book lost some of its snap. That said, it was still intersting and a fair read. If I had it to do over though I would stop after reading book 1 of this series."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Truly 5 star writing? Probably not, but I've read this title easily 15 times between 1989 and now!

A treasure which is a find of a lifetime. A cataclysmic tour de force.For many a years I had settled for mediocrity fantasy deep in the belief that nothing could excel Tolkien. Now, I honestly do believe that anything is possible. This isn't just another fantasy novel. It truly is the greatest fantasy saga of all time. Several of the other readers have made comparisons to Tolkien. Tolkien set certain standards with his novels. Weis and Hickman have developed this further (and no, I didn't think that could be possible either), setting their own universal standards in the process. They certainly are the masters of the fantasy cosmos. I could not find a single flaw or make a single criticism of the entire series. I have nothing but acclamation for it.This powerhouse has incessantly urgent plot development and intrigue, and every consequence of that plot is clearly thought out. The characters are so comprehensively defined and developed that you feel as if you know them personally; thus truly adulating or despising them. The authors achieve this by probing deep into the characters' minds and their very souls. Tanis, the tortured central figure in the universe, weighing problems upon him with the stakes of which no mortal being should ever be demanded. Laurana, an elven enchantress of eternal beauty and pure of heart, suffers as deeply as Tanis. Kitiara, an alluring yet complex presence, is chillingly captivating. The tragic loss of two key figures adds greatly to the affinity. The authors put their characters into uniquely dark situations and get their responses so correctly that the spell is never once broken.Both the subtle and apparent use of several themes throughout the novel is flawlessly executed, and harmoniously tied together at the end. Although the style of writing remains consistent, the pace and scheme of this novel picks up greatly from Winter Night, with a suspense/thriller feel to it. The disquieting tension as the plot races to its conclusion is a reader's thrill ride. On one hand you want to read hastily and gleefully to see how the perilous tale unfolds, but on the other hand, you want to slow down to fully appreciate the authors' work; one reason why this merits a second reading.I disagree with some of the views that Dragonlance is purely for the younger generation of readers. I believe the classic series appeals to all readers regardless of age for different reasons. As an example, when I first read the Chronicles back in the 80s, I was only 10 and I thoroughly enjoyed it for the spectacular battle scenes and the fantastic adventures our heroes go on. I read the series again not so long ago and was captivated for an altogether different reason. This time it wasn't the majestic dragons or the mythical world of Krynn that enraptured me, as I no longer have a child's imagination. Instead I was spellbound by the characters themselves and how they developed throughout the course of this trilogy. The emotional turmoil and complex relationship between Tanis, Laurana and Kitiara, culminating with the shocking twist at the end, is perhaps the best example. I failed to appreciate this during my first visit to Krynn.At the end of it all, when you close the book and come back to reality, there is a real sense of despondency as if you cannot believe Krynn is not real. Hats off to Weis and Hickman who have written a masterpiece that allows every reader to take away with them something endearing and unique."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I must say I agree with John from Cambridge on the first page. I read this book for the first time in 5th grade, and was captivated by all the battles and the dragons. But now as a senior in high school, I thought it would be fun to reread it. I liked it for a entirely different reason this time. The intense emotion of all the characters, the overwhelmingly &quot;human&quot; aspect of them, the bitter realizations at the end....all of it combined to make one of the best books I have ever read. I am going to Harvard next year, and with all the classics I have read in school, I have not read a book with as hauntingly real characters as this book. They'll stay with you longer than even the Baggins and Gandalf will."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Definitely a great fantasy epic and one of my personal favorites, The Chronicles Trilogy- Dragons of Autumn Twilight, Dragons of Winter Night, and Dragons of Spring Dawning, brings to life the ultimate battle between Good and Evil in the World of Krynn. The books are so incredibly well written that the reader feels that they have been transported to another plane of existence and are actually present among the characters, seeing what they see, feeling what they feel, sensing what they sense. The authors Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman have truly outdone themselves and have presented us with a masterpiece of literature the likes of which we have seen only in JRR Tolkien's work and RA Salvatore's The Dark Elf and Icewind Dale trilogies. A GREAT trilogy indeed and a must read along with Margaret Weis' Legends trilogy! Duty, honor, bravery, magic, dragons and heroes are all about. One should seriously start thinking about maybe turning them into movies!"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This is a very good book. You find out a lot of vital information, like who Fizban is. You need to read the other books in this series though, they are Dragons of Autumn Twilight and Dragons of Winter Night. Margaret Weiss and Tracy Hickman are very talented authors. They created wonderful books. They are very descriptive and I thing these books are action packed."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Co-authored by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, Dragons Of Spring Dawning is the third volume of DragonLance, a best-selling role-gaming fantasy trilogy about an epic war between mere mortals, mighty dragons, -- and an utterly malevolent goddess queen. A handful of heroes strive against darkness and bloodshed, yet betrayal threatens to destroy them all. As enjoyable now as when this outstanding series first introduced readers to the land of Krynn and its once-quiescent dragons, Dragons Of Spring Dawning is quite confidently recommended as an outstanding fantasy action/adventure saga."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This was my first DL novel ever, picked it up in a store that had a going out of buisness sale, so i wasn't able to get the first one, Ever since i haven't been able to stop reading DL! This was great, it hooked my interest in the first paragraph and wouldn't let me put the book down until i had finished it. Although its not the first in the chronicle series its gives a strong introduction of raistlin and caramon, tas and the others, without boring you or going into to much detail. This is what DL is all about!"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"If you like to read fantasy series, read the Dragonlance: Chronicles v.03 Dragons of Spring Dawning by Margret Weis and Tracy Hhickman.But if you do, be sure to read the first two books, Dragons of Atumn Twilight and Dragons of Winters night. If you don't, you will miss a lot of important details, about the characters and the setting. You always want to read any series from the first book to the last one.The plot in this book is very interesting and not the typical good vs bad story line. This one has a couple of interesting twists. For example, some of the main characters fight for good and have hearts and souls of evil. In this series, the characters are believable if you keep an open mind. There is a wide variety of charracters: A Dwarf, a Half--Elf, a Kender, a fighter, a magic user, a barmaid turned fighter, a cleric, a plainsman, and two Elves. There used to be a knight but he died in the second book. This keeps the series interesting to read.The setting is very important in this book, it influences what the characters do and keeps the book interesting. The writing is very easy to follow and has great dialog. The fighter and magic user are twins, the fighter supplies the magic user physical stregth. But in the end the magic user saves his twin and then leaves, symbolozing that even the strongest bind can be broken, and the toughest obstacles can be over come.I recommend this book only if you have read the first two. I really enjoy this book I keep rereading the entire series just to reread The Dragons of Spring Dawning."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I personnaly think this is an excellent book, except it doesn't deal with Raistlin enough. But it was still a good book and a perfect way to end the Chronicles trilogy and a good introduction to Legends.For those of you who have read the first two books and are dying from anticipation, Tanis finally chooses which woman he spends his life with. Tas and Flint continue bickering until the end, in more ways than one. Raistlin shows off his real personnality (something I was waiting for). Fizban loses his hat (again). And Caramon beats up some draconians.If you are a Raistlin and Caramon fan, like I am, this book is necessary. As I have mentoined before, this is where Legends gets started (I know Legends takes place 4 years after this but everything in Chronicles leads up to Legends).The best part of the book was the very end when Raistlin fulfils the prophecy. Out of everything in Chrocicles those few pages are what realy stood out.&quot;Someday you, with all your strength and charm and good looks,you, all of you, will call me master&quot; Raistlin, Dragons Of Autumn Twilight"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This is the comic adaption of the third part of the Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy, first published in 1984. Unlike the first two adaptions, this one was split up into two parts, and this is the second part.Unfortunately this graphic-novel was drawn by people with only average artistic talent.Nevertheless the story adaption is as excellent as before and everybody who owns the previous 3 books of this adaption will want to have the final one."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"There is an expectation of a happy ending with every fantasy novel and series. Dragons Of Spring Dawning, the conclusion of the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy, presents a more realistic ending which leaves much room for the saga and the heroes to roam.With death, destruction, discovery and desperation looming and lurking at every turn The Everman, Tanis, Laurana, Tas, Flint, Caramon and Raistlin take centre stage to play their part in a drama which now actively includes Kitiara in a surprise twist. Wars rage and sorrows reign as Raistlin's prophecy regarding the death and separation of the fellows comes true.Spring Dawning does have major flaws, as did its two prequels, in that coincidences flow illogically at every turn (the dismissal of the dragons by Fizban, the defeated magic of a Dragon Highlord at a crucial time or the appointment of Lauranathalasa) and the book still cannot rid itself of allusions and comparisons to The Lord Of The Rings (the metaphysical presence of The Dark Queen is just one instance) trilogy. Nevertheless, the ingredients for an exciting and satisfactory read are present here in more potent quantities than in volumes one and two.The book does answer many nagging questions and puts to rest several mysteries, although there is much that still goes unexplained. Mystery, magic, myth and mages come together in an expansive and enchanting land and become sources for more fantasy trilogies to come."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I have read all three books in this series and find them very thrilling and action packed it the type of book you can pick up and find very hard to put down from begining to end the series is packed with action and keeps you wondering whats going to happen next all the caracters are wonderfully potrated to where you feel like your part of the group of heros margret and tracy put a lot of hard work and time in to this series and it shows i hail the talent of these two great writers and look foward to reading more of there novels if you are into the world of dragon lance this is a must read series"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This book I believe is the 2nd best in the Chronicles series(not including Summer Flame, I haven't read it).

I hate books, I play sports and stuff like that and one day a book report came up and the librarian recommended Dragons of Autumn Twighlight, I was hesitant but I figured why not. At first I didnt really like it too much it was first DL book I had read and didn't know anyhting about it. But after about an I caught on and I kept on reading and reading and then before I knew it, I was on the last page of autumn twighlight. Believe me I was mad. So I got the rest of the chronnicles ( did I spell that right?). And I couldn't put it down. I read for 20 hours straight. I stayed home from school the next day because I was exhausted from staying up till 5 in the morning. And I read it all that day too. I got all 3 books dome in 4 days and Im a slow reader. It completely changed my aspect on alot of things believe it or not other than books, life maybe. I felt as if i was running from hobgoblins at the Inn, and bashing heads with Draconians. I emerged into thier world the instant I picked up the book, and any time I wasn't reading it, the need to know what happened next was tearing me apart. Although I wish the ending wasn't so suddle it was still great.I know your wondering why I told you all this, and you probably couldn't care less so Ill get to the point. There was only one thing HORRIBLY wrong with the Chroniccles, and that was that it...ended.

Visiting Krynn again, and meeting all my old friends: Tas, Raistlin, Caramon, Tanis and the rest of the gang is always great, and I love these books more and more as I get older.&quot;Dragons Of Spring Dawning&quot; is in my opinion the darkest book in this 3 books series (I don't consider the 4th as a part of the chronicles, in my opinion it ruins the perfection of the other 3). All the conflicts that are only hinted in the other 2 books are floating into the surface, and creats one of the most facsinating plots ever written. We discover darker sides of the characters that we fell in love with, and in the end, it only makes, me at least, love them even more.I ended this book, again, and I almost cried. For some reason, the goodbye was harder this time. I found myself wishing, in somewhat childish and naive way, that I was really there, in Krynn, not only visiting, peeping through the keyhole of a book, but actually there. This is, I believe, the sign of a truly great book (Or books, in this case, the Legends are also highly recommended) I know that it is not my last visit to Krynn and not the last time I meet my favorite party.

In order to pull this off the entire plot has to have been planned out well in advance (indeed, well before starting to write) to avoid a meandering making-it-up-as-I-go-along feel that leaves the reader with the suspicion of being jerked around. Thankfully, authors Weis and Hickman seemed to have avoided this. If forced to guess I would posit that the first book in the trilogy was meant to stand alone in case sales did not warrant sequels. Once it was clear that they had a hit on their hands the next two books were plotted together.The book has many strong points. A few of my favorites:1.) The moral ambiguity of Raistlin. Yes, he generally aids the good guys but it is clear he has an agenda of his own. Very well handled and kept me guessing throughout the book.2.) Kitiara. Utterly ruthless. But does she still have a weakness for Tanis as Lord Soth suspects or is she just toying with Tanis as she claims? Does she even know?3.) The \\"hangers on\\" getting a chance to shine. Caramon, Tasslehoff, Flint, Tika, and Laurana all have integral parts to play and are not there for muscle, comic relief, or as a damsel in distress.4.) Well thought out and entertaining sequences featuring Astinus and the library in Palanthas, the sea elves and the city of Istar, and Fizban.On the debit side it seemed that Goldmoon, Riverwind, and Gilthanas fade from the story in this book.The Kindle version is flawless except for the sparse chapter marks on the progress bar. The map is also near useless.Highly recommended.

The story of Raistlin is amazing, and keeps you reading so you can start the Legends Trilogy, which is all about Raistlin after the Dragon Wars.

Even though the obligatory climax somewhat spoils the atmosphere, the first two volumes are rich with details and memorable scenes. Especially Autumn Twilight has that nostalgic feel of a good old roleplaying adventure - you never know what lurks behind corner. As the story reaches more epic heights, something of the magic gives way for forced clichs, but still I have fond memories of the series."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"I recently re-read the entire Dragonlance Chronicles Trilogy. Even though I hadn't read them for more than ten years, ever since high school ended, I really fell back into these books and enjoyed them as much if not more than when I was a teen.Dragons of Spring Dawning is a great conclusion to the trilogy and leads nicely into the next trilogy, Legends, which focuses on Caramon and Raistlin.The highlight of this book for me was the characterizations, not so much the action. There isn't too much action on the grand scale involving armies of metallic and colored dragons fighting against each other, and to be honest the Dragonlances are not really even used at all in this book. Some characters, like Goldmoon and Riverwind, bow out early. I tend to think this was done because they didn't really have much more to do in these books. Their story was really told in book one, and halfway through book two it seems the story had left them behind.The lack of major battles and the withdrawal of some major characters was fine with me, because they may not have advanced the story. There is still a lot of more intimate action sequences, including the climax that takes place inside the Dark Queen's temple at Neraka. The characters, like Tanis and Laurana, become even more textured and you can really see the good and bad in them. They are not shallow but come across as very genuine. Caramon, Tika and Tas also are written very well, and Raistlin's short storyline and the \\"Homecoming\\" at the end of the book are intriguing and lead perfectly into the next trilogy. The death of a major character was handled well, and did spark genuine emotion.Fizban was better in this book. His true identity, while obvious to readers since book one, becomes known to the other characters and the ending was intersting. The overall theme of these books, that good and evil need to coexist in balance, was pulled off pretty well.There are some inconsistencies that really didn't bother me, but I think that they should have been picked up on. Some of the characters are rescued during the course of the book and find themselves washed ashore near the city Kalaman. At first they act as if they can't remember how they were rescued or who rescued them. But later, they seem to remember just fine. I was a little confused by that but it is nitpicking and did not take away from the book at all.All in all, I enjoyed it as much if not more than when I was younger. It is a great conclusion to a really well-written series."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Dragons of Spring Dawning as state above, is simply an outstanding conclusion to the Dragonlance Chronicles trilogy! As you will see from the first two novels, these two outstanding authors will have you thoroughly enthralled in this epic story from the very first page of Dragons of Autumn Twilight to the very last page of this exceptional conclusion! For myself, as I drew to within a hundred pages or so from completing this novel; I experienced a strange sense of sadness, knowing that I was almost done and strangely enough would miss the majority of these characters. I say a majority due to the fact that a few of them are in the follow up trilogy, Legends. Margaret Weis &amp; Tracy Hickman have such a compelling writing style that will completely enthrall you into the lives of these fine characters.The premise: MINOR SPOILERDragons of Spring Dawning picks up right where the dramatic conclusion to Dragons of Winter Night left off, where a major and beloved character is killed, leaving the reader and the other characters with a major sense of loss. The suspense for the Chronicles trilogy is brought to an even higher level than the first two novels, as it is all coming to the remarkable conclusion and the ultimate meeting of the beloved characters and the forces of darkness which have brought war to the magical world of Krynn.The Dragonlance Chronicles is, simply stated, one of the finest fantasy trilogies ever written and these two authors deserve all the accolades they have received and will continue to receive. I highly recommend this to any and all fans who have either already read this trilogy or to any newcomers. Once you're finished with this book and the Chronicles trilogy as a whole, I highly recommend the Dragonlance \\"Legends\\" trilogy. {ssintrepid}"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"This book plus the first in the set, Dragons of Autumn Twilight, have to be the best books I have ever read.

Boy, what an ending"},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"The title of my review says it all. If you're in junior high and have attention deficit disorder, then this book might be for you.If you can't ponder life in all its subtlety, if you will miss anything that is not made obvious, if you can't tell what a story character is thinking unless the narrator supplies his thoughts word-for-word, then you should probably read the Dragonlance Chronicles from start to finish.To be fair, the book has an excellent plot. If you've read Tolkien's \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, you'll probably recognize it. An archfiend of some description, while trying to conquer the world and bring it under the shadow of his/her evil, searches for some sort of artifact that can either magnify him if he obtains it, or destroy him if, instead, the heroes of the story get their hands on it and dispose of it properly.In order to carry out their purpose, the heroes have some sort of meeting and at some point there is a big war, which, ultimately, is a distraction from the true quest of finding the magic artifact and disposing of it properly.So, yeh, Dragonlance Chronicles uses basically the same plot as The Lord of the Rings. But Tolkien did a vastly superior job with the storytelling, and LOTR is part of the finest and most definitive literature of the 20th century. DL Chronicles is a hack job. As hack jobs go, it's not too bad. But the characters have a toy-soldier quality, and the story is told in such a way that you can imagine Margaret Weis pushing the Tanis toy-soldier here and saying \\"Bang-bang, die you villain\\" while Tracy Hickman pushes the Kitiara toy-soldier there and saying \\"Not so fast, bring me the crown.\\"I've heard it said that Dragonlance Chronicles reads as it does because the authors were trying to follow Dungeons & Dragons gaming rules. If so, then it would appear that there is limited crossover value between games and novels.Readers under age 13 will probably enjoy this series. The story has a fast pace, lots of (inane) emotion, many (cheap) action thrills, and just enough sex to flatter teenagers into thinking that they're grooving with the grown-ups. And it's because it DOES have THAT audience that I give this book three stars, rather than one. But readers over 20 will find their eyes rolling much, and they will soon become impatient with the characters' introspective shallowness, their repetitively knee-jerk hyperemotionalism, with the way the narrative revelations too obviously come from a narrator, and with the frequent shifts in viewpoint.Older fantasy readers will want to avoid Dragonlance and choose Feist's Riftwar Saga, or Modesitt's Saga of Recluce, or George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire, or David Eddings' Belgariad."},{"Title":"Dragons of Spring Dawning (Dragonlance Chronicles, Vol. 3)","review":"Horiffic book.

If you have read the first two you HAVE to read the third. Think about all the time you will have wasted only reading the first 3! Furthermore, for those still reading, you can look forward to a good ending. Some series (most notably Douglas Adam's) end very disappointingly, but this is not true of Dragons of Spring Dawning. The War of the Lance is brought to a satisfying end.I further recommend the &quot;Legends&quot; saga.

It is an authoritative guide on the subject. With that stated, this book assumes the readers have very little knowledge in content management. It is written into 6 parts and follows a &quot;unified&quot; content strategy approach. It initially describes the pitfalls within content management, namely content silos.As an architect for content management systems, I have a vested interest with increasing my experiences and knowledge in content management. It would have been nice to see real life examples and situations throughout this book. Chapter 10 did provide some mocked up scenerios for content design. Furthermore, the writing style was too dry. Without the real life examples, it was more like the theory of enterprise content management.It's an excellent study in content management, but I prefer a first person writing style and some solid real life examples."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"I was disappointed that the book was really focused on how to create reusable elements that go into product information such as data sheets, marketing collateral, technical support, etc. It focused on auditing the content, finding the reusability elements across departments, then designing an appropriate hierarchy on top of a content management system. It assumed that content drives the information architecture when in most applications it is the business processes that drive the architecture. It ignored the majority of enterprise content like email, word docs, design specs, forms, etc. that make up the real information content of the enterprise.If you are someone who creates lots of documentation deliverables in paper, electronic and web formats and need to get costs under control, this is probably a good book. If you are considering a Content Management System to better manage a number of business processes and all the documents that make them go, this is a poor choice for those efforts."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy delivers on the title's promise--it provides a solid overview of content management including analysis, design, development, implementation, tool selection, and maintenance. The book is strongest in addressing big-picture issues--calculating a return on investment (ROI) for a project, what questions to ask in information modeling, and how to make a transition into content management.The introductory chapters describe the basic content-management challenge--ensuring that content is consistent and accurate across an enterprise. Rockley et al. do an excellent job of describing typical departmental content &quot;silos,&quot; where content is hoarded by each department and little or no reuse occurs. They describe how reuse can break down the silos, reduce the amount of content creation that needs to occur, and ensure that content is consistent across the enterprise. The chapter that describes how to calculate ROI on a content-management strategy is particularly strong. Several examples show the factors that go into such an analysis, and most readers will be able to perform their own assessments based on the examples provided.In Part II, the book describes how to analyze an existing workflow and determine how best to establish a content-management strategy that replaces or modifies the current workflow. This is interesting reading, but suffers from a lack of illustrations. Many of the workflow proposals are outlined in lengthy, difficult-to-follow tables; they would have been much more effective with accompanying illustrations.Part III focuses on design of an enterprise content-management system. There is good information here about information modeling, metadata, and the like, and this part will provide a useful overview to readers who are not familiar with these concepts.The Tools and Technologies section (Part IV) of the book is problematic mainly because the information is too general. The authors provide lists of criteria and evaluation methods for tools, but they shy away from making specific recommendations. A series of case studies that describe best practices and implementation decisions given specific project scenarios would make the information presented here much more relevant. Furthermore, the book stumbles in discussing the rationale for XML as an underlying storage format. XML is emerging as the de facto standard for shared, reusable content. Managing Enterprise Content does a good job of describing how XML fits into content management efforts. But the authors overstate the case at the beginning of the chapter, when they attempt to differentiate between XML solutions and other solutions based on the idea that non-XML solutions require complicated scripting and XML does not. A cursory review of an XSL file would tend to debunk that statement. Nonetheless, an XML/XSL-based approach makes a lot of sense for other reasons, and the authors go on to describe its advantages in some detail.Part V describes how to make the transition to a unified content management strategy. Here, the real-world experience of the authors becomes apparent as they describe implementation plans, likely problem areas, points of resistance, and strategies for avoiding and overcoming the inevitable problems. The chapter on collaboration does an excellent job of describing collaborative authoring and the required changed in mindset.The publisher, not the authors, are to blame for some editorial and production problems in the book. There are numerous lengthy, complex tables that are poorly executed. The publisher should have made adjustments to the tables to make them more readable. The text itself reads as though it has not been copy edited--there are numerous grammatical errors, typographical errors, and awkward sentences. No writer produces error-free prose on the first (or fifth) draft; it is the publisher's responsibility to edit and polish manuscript text to produce final copy. Especially in books written for professional writers, it's disappointing to see this lack of quality control from the publisher.Managing Enterprise Content: A United Content Strategy delivers the first comprehensive overview of enterprise content management concepts. It should be required reading for anyone involved in creating, managing, or publishing content.-Sarah O'Keefe"},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"This book's title has probably attracted those interested in Enterprise Content Management. ECM has increasingly become a major buzz in business strategy circles as the information age tidal wave spills over into organizations and floods them with content. We're literally drowning. \\"Managing Enterprise Content\\" does not discuss ECM in broad terms, such as structured and unstructured content, email, scanned documents, OCR, ICR, etc. Instead, it focuses on content reuse. To take a simple example, a product brochure, a website, and a press release all include descriptions of a product. Why, the book argues, rewrite that description three separate times for each medium? Why not write it just once, store it in a content management system, and then reuse it over and over again? \\"Content Modularization\\" or \\"Content Reuse\\" probably describe the goals of this book less confusingly than \\"Managing Enterprise Content.\\" But, in fairness to the authors, the current title isn't inaccurate, it just lends itself easily to misunderstanding. To reiterate: those looking for a course in Enterprise Content Management conforming to the Association for Information and Image Management's (AIIM) guidelines should look elsewhere.Nonetheless, those looking for a strategy to manage distributable content throughout an organization should take a look at \\"Managing Enterprise Content.\\" The focus remains on implementing a \\"unified content strategy,\\" which translates essentially to an efficient reuse of content. Here the word \\"content\\" has a specific sense relating to verbiage authored for a specific use. Product descriptions, mission and vision statements, disclaimers, compliance and regulatory announcements, anything widely distributable qualifies. How does one efficiently manage the creation and the evolution of such content across an organization? This obviously implies some form of centralization (although this pregnant term gets strategically avoided for obvious reasons). And this further implies a software system. But prior to purchasing an expensive application, the business must align itself process-wise to enable content reuse. Otherwise the costly program will sit and rot. The first three parts of the book (I - III), comprising its first twelve chapters, discuss these necessary preparations and walk the reader through to implementation. This progression mirrors, for good reasons, the project management and software development life cycle processes. First, determine the concept or the \\"why?\\" of the project (Chapters 1 & 2). Then perform cost benefit analysis (Chapter 3 discusses ROI for content reuse), analyze and prioritize the current content infrastructure, the \\"As-Is\\" (Chapters 4 through 6), look to the future by modeling and designing the elements of the system the \\"To-Be\\" (Chapters 7 through 11), and finally implement the reusable content infrastructure (Chapter 12). Evaluation of software tools and technology should come before implementation, but the book instead covers these topics in Part IV (Chapters 13 to 18). So it's that easy to implement a unified content strategy? Well, no, not really.Part V, the book's final section, outlines the inevitable issues that face organizational restructuring. Implementation of a unified content strategy will probably necessitate fundamental changes. Roles will get changes, people moved around, departments will get realigned or reorganized. All of this can sap morale or cause anxiety amongst employees. The author is not an authority on such issues, so this section of the book remains somewhat cursory and high-level. Conflict management gets deferred to a website (the book contains an out of date URL, but the book's website[...] has an updated address), and the advice presented here will probably not surprise anyone. Still, managing change remains an important part of any new implementation and this section, though rudimentary, will at least raise awareness.Lastly, the appendices contain a grab bag of information. Appendix C, on vendors, has probably suffered from age (these days, a lot can happen in three years), but it may provide some good leads. Appendix B, \\"Writing for Multiple Media,\\" probably could have appeared in the main body of the book; it contains important details not covered elsewhere.Overall, the book does give a plausible outline for implementing the proposed strategy. Some of the chapters may seem overly simplistic or overlong to those experienced with system implementations or business process management. At the very least, \\"Managing Enterprise Content\\" may introduce some readers to the concept of enterprise content reuse. That concept remains a challenging one that will likely mean different things to different organizations. So this book does not provide the final word on the subject, nor does it intend to. An organization can only use this book as a blueprint or a guidepost for implementing its own unified content strategy."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Pundits have guesstimated that, depending on the industry, anywhere from 75 percent to 90 percent of a company's information assets are stored in monolithic documents. And as recently as five years ago, most company executives and technical administrators would've said, &quot;so what?&quot; After all, Microsoft Word was (and still is) ubiquitous, the dominant paradigm had always been to store content in an unstructured manner, and most companies saw little value in managing content any other way. Some of the larger software development companies were exceptions because they had to create online help files consistent with training manuals or computer-based training systems. Except for these environments, managing information assets on a sizable scale wasn't common.Then in 1998 the World Wide Web Consortium released its specification for the Extensible Markup Language (XML), a technology that opened the doors for pulling enterprise content out of proprietary formats and converting it into manageable data. Nearly five years later, it seems that every mid- to large-sized company is scrambling to put its information assets into a structured content-management environment before its competition does.If you're wondering what all the hoopla is about, check out Ann Rockley's new book, Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy. This book contains more than 500 pages describing a systemic method for defining, evaluating, and preparing for an enterprise-wide content management program that actually benefits a company's bottom line.Note that I said &quot;content management program&quot;; this book outlines a business development process, not a &quot;one size fits all&quot; IT project or &quot;buy and try&quot; software implementation. And even though Ann owns The Rockley Group and her two contributing authors are company employees, Managing Enterprise Content isn't a thinly disguised sales pitch in book form. This book outlines how to analyze corporate information assets, develop business processes to better leverage these assets, build technology systems for managing the assets, and prepare employees to recognize assets, follow the processes, and use the technology.The book's sections contain chapters related to the section topic. Section I defines the fundamentals of a unified content strategy. Sections II and III are excellent, detailed descriptions of the content auditing and modeling processes -- the keys to success in any content management solution. Section IV is an overview of tools and technologies that support a large-scale content management implementation, and Section V describes how to manage the implementation. Section VI contains valuable resources such as strategy and tools checklists and an informative segment on how to pick the vendor or vendors that are right for your organization.Don't let the book's structure fool you, however. Managing Enterprise Content isn't a high-level introduction to content management for a senior vice-president. The book reads as a road map for implementing a content management solution. It's not a book expressly for IT managers, although I think most would benefit from reading it. It's also not just for the business manager. Managing Enterprise Content is for the person who manages both the technologies and the processes for developing and distributing the information assets of an organization, because the book deals with the technical and business challenges in an implementation.This duality of business and technology is part of the underlying theme of the whole book: A content management solution cannot be successful if it is approached as simply a &quot;technology problem&quot; or a &quot;business problem.&quot; The business people have to begin by understanding how the content they create is reused elsewhere within the corporation, and they have to change the way they write to support reusing the content. Likewise, the technologists can't just interview two or three business experts and then go off to create a viable content management solution.But many books on this subject have this same theme. These other books state that it takes a concerted effort from the business community to identify reusable content, create a usable workflow, and define the lifecycle for various content types, and it takes IT resources to evaluate the tools and delivery systems to support the effective creation, management, and archiving of content assets. What differentiates Rockley's book from the rest is that she describes the intersection of business and IT in creating a viable solution, and the bulk of her book defines this middle ground.As I said earlier, the keys to success in content management are the content audit and the content model. The audit and model together define the essential components of the knowledge assets managed within a company, and taken together they're the foundation for every other process in developing a solution, including the evaluation of tools and vendors. In Chapters 4 through 12, Rockley takes the reader through the steps and products of the audit and modeling exercises, and then describes how information from these exercises define the metadata, workflow, and systematic requirements of a comprehensive, robust implementation. It requires business acumen and technological expertise to navigate this &quot;no man's land&quot; in creating a content management solution, and Rockley proves she's up to the challenge.Personally, I found the passages described above and the resources in Section VI to be the most valuable parts of the entire book. If you understand the potential value of a unified content-management solution for your organization but are having trouble selling it to management, Chapter 3, &quot;Assessing return on investment for a unified content strategy,&quot; and Chapter 4, &quot;Where does it really hurt?&quot; are worth the cover price. Those chapters describe a methodology for determining the ROI for implementing a content management solution within an organization and the ways to uncover &quot;hidden&quot; opportunities and challenges addressed by a unified solution.If you're currently involved in bringing content management to your enterprise, or if you're getting ready to implement soon, you'll certainly want to pick up a copy of Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy. And if you're just starting to think about what an unified content solution could mean for your company, this book is an essential resource for understanding the entire process from conceptualization to implementation."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"In &quot;Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy,&quot; Ann Rockley explains a very complex subject in refreshingly human terms. Like a physician, she believes that pain is information. Acute problems in your content management and authoring processes cause pain. &quot;Deadlines are missed, content is inconsistent, content is missing ... and customers complain.&quot; Rockley helps you systematically identify &quot;where it hurts,&quot; then walks you through the recovery process. This process leads you to a unified content strategy, which ensures that &quot;information is created, managed, and delivered consistently, in the way that users need it, without duplicating your efforts.&quot;Rockley succeeds in making a very complex subject appear simple. She clearly commands her material. Despite the encyclopedic level of detail found in the book, it is obvious that Rockley is not reaching for information. Rather than pointing to abstract paradigms from a safe distance, she matter-of-factly breaks them into bite-sized scenarios that can easily be understood by readers new to the subject. Rockley drives each point home with concrete example and case studies from the real world. Many readers will recognize their own companies and departments in her examples. Rockley does not present a &quot;one size fits all&quot; content strategy. Instead, she shows you how to ask and answer the right questions for your organization. And she provides straightforward checklists that make it easy for you to implement each step of the process. In so doing, she presents you with a flexible and scalable framework you can use to solve your own problems.Before you spend a lot of money on content management systems or consulting fees, buy this book. Rockley provides you with the kind of expert consulting that results from decades of experience, and normally comes at a very high price. In effect, she gives away the store."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"When I began to read the book Managing Enterprise Content, I had certain questions about what a unified content strategy was. Was it simply a repackaging of the old concepts of knowledge management or one source? Or was it something more?I also had the expectation that the book itself would address technical communicators only as its primary audience. This in itself is not bad, but in terms of &quot;evangelical changes&quot; to corporate documentation and training strategies, often &quot;how to&quot; books of this genre do nothing more than &quot;preach to the choir.&quot;By the time I finished reading Managing Enterprise Content, I was excited! For me, the book answered questions about a unified content strategy on two levels: Not only did it address unified content strategy as a strategic business objective; it also unified the strategic directions that the umbrella of technical communication and training professions have been moving towards over the past decade: single-sourcing, corporate branding implementation, critical involvement in software or system development life cycle (SDLC) methodologies, and even implementation of ISO9000 compliance. Please allow me to explain further:* Unified content strategy is the next evolution of &quot;one source.&quot; Unified content strategy itself is a &quot;single-sourcing umbrella solution&quot; to ensure timely, consistent, and cost-effective communication at all levels for your company's goods and services. Consistent means just that: the development and implementation of consistent communications, regardless of the number of creators (authors) or the number and types of output media.* Unified content strategy is about brand implementation. In today's marketplaces, I believe that effective branding can &quot;make or break&quot; a company. You may have the better proverbial mousetrap, but if your customers do not know it, it won't matter. VHS versus Beta illustrated this.* A unified content strategy merges the single-source concepts and the driving tenets behind ISO 9000 into a single, cohesive strategy.* Interestingly, a unified content strategy provides the methodology for developing the typical methodology deliverables required of a SDLC (software development life cycle). Until this, typical development projects let design drive content consistency, which would only be a byproduct if the project was lucky enough to have information designers as part of the team from the &quot;get-go.&quot;The book Managing Enterprise Content does a beautiful job of defining the premises and corresponding values of a unified content strategy. But it does not stop there. With this publication, finally there is a book that defines one source (as a unified content strategy) holistically, answering all of the basic journalistic questions of who, what, when, where, why, and most important, how!* The &quot;how&quot; itself is through easy-to-follow step by step instructions supported by examples that encapsulate very typical business scenarios.* The &quot;how&quot; is about getting buy-in within your company of not only management, but of all the players. It provides tables and lists of questions to be answered, objectives to be met, and pitfalls to be avoided.* The &quot;how&quot; is also about getting the best mix of tools and technologies to meet your company's needs, especially by helping you ferret out the real strengths and weaknesses of third-party tools in terms of meeting your company's business requirements.In my opinion, here is the real proverbial &quot;bang for your buck&quot; offered by Managing Enterprise Content. The book itself provides a cohesive tool for technical communicators, instructional designers, and related publications and project management to help demonstrate the cost benefits of a unified content management strategy.In short, this book tells you not only how to do it, but how to get buy-in. Or, in terms of the vernacular of the book itself, it tells you how to qualify your goals (something that we typically have always been good at doing) and how to quantify your goals (something perhaps that most of us have not been so good at doing.)This has often been the stumbling block for authoring teams in the past? We knew what was needed and understood the values, but never translated the benefits into the languages of middle- and upper management - that of cost savings!More importantly, by taking all of these items into consideration, the book helps you realize that there is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; unified content strategy solution. Instead, the book focuses on your attaining a derived understanding of the best-unified content strategy solution for your company! In other words, the book &quot;sets you up to succeed!&quot;In summation, Managing Enterprise Content clearly defines what a unified content strategy is, how to develop one, and what the complete spectrum of benefits of its implementation would be in terms of deliverables quality, development time efficiency, and cost savings.This book provides a comprehensive business process that integrates technical communication, instructional design, and workflow into an easy-to-follow package that will provide a consistent and cost-savings family of content products. This book &quot;practices what it preaches&quot; in that it addresses the needs of all the players: management at all levels, technical writers and trainers, product designers, developers and testers, marketing and IT staff, and most of all - customers.Sincerely,Mark Hanigan,Principle Consultant - On the Write Track2000-2001 International President - Society for Technical Communication"},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Ann Rockley, in her book &quot;Managing Enterprise Content&quot;, clearly demonstrates her infinite experience as a domain expert in the content management arena.

I thought the content was timely and useful, well-stated, and easy to incorporate into my existing mental knowledge base. There were also plenty of truly usable ideas, laid out both conceptually and practically. I enjoyed that the book made me feel like I could implement some form of single-sourcing and content management even on a small scale, without acting as though only an all-out, full-scale solution were the only real choice.I have to also give kudos to the physical layout of the book as well. Its modular TOCs at the beginning of each chapter and its pleasing visual layout made it one of the easiest books I've ever used, from an information foraging perspective. Rarely do I see books that are this useful for both linear and non-linear reading."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"I just completed teaching a course on single sourcing and content management at Richland Community College in Dallas, Texas. I used this book as the text. Ms. Rockley, a recognized expert in the field of content management and technical communication, has broken the implementation process down into very logical activities. She includes excellent examples and case studies to illustrate each step of the process.Her discussion on calculating the return on investment is straight forward and comprehensive. She doesn't pull any punches on the realities of implementing a content management solution. There are no short cuts. She emphasizes the planning that MUST be done and explains every aspect you need to consider.My entire class agreed that this book is destined to become the industry standard for implementing content management.Thanks, Ann, for spending the time to write this book."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"One of the last great leaps in corporate productivity will be to bring repeatability, consistency and automation to capturing and sharing intellectual assets, whether they're in the form of documents, Web pages, Palm Pilots, or other media.Ann Rockley has written the definitive guide for people who want to steer their organizations to take this leap. Whether you're from the business side or from the technical side, Ann's book will help you build your business case, re-engineer your processes, design your data models, select appropriate tools, implement the new system, and avoid the many dangers that lie along the route.Most people think that content management systems will deliver all of the benefits they seek, but Ann Rockley's book shows why you have to think well beyond a single tool or a single process in order to achieve significant and sustainable success. With more than one-half of IT projects failing to meet expectations, someone equipped with Ann's book is well prepared to beat the odds.For example, if you're hoping to sprinkle some new software over your existing processes to deliver the full potential of a unified content strategy, then Ann shows how futile and unproductive such an approach will be. If you want to achieve substantial changes in your results, then you'll have to make substantial changes to your processes. Ann's book not only lays out which changes you'll need to make and the impact of those changes, but also describes how to introduce those changes to minimize resistance.Ann and her co-authors bring enormous real-world experience to bear on the contents of this book. For example, Ann points out where tools and systems are not enough when she writes about how authors must change their approaches and writing styles in order to create information that can be easily and automatically reused and repurposed."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Managing Enterprise Content is an excellent addition to the literature on content management. The focus on a unified, enterprise-wide content strategy makes this book a must for anyone in a company that is contemplating content management. That includes executives, managers, writers, and subject matter specialists, as well as tools and technology people.An enterprise-wide strategy requires getting out of what Rockley and her colleagues call the &quot;content silo trap.&quot; Anyone who works in a large company will recognize the content silos that Rockley and her colleagues describe and will identify with the problems that content silos can create. Managing Enterprise Content will help you move beyond those silos to collaborative authoring and a phased content management strategy for the company.You don't have to be part of a large company to benefit from this book. With 22 chapters, an excellent glossary, and several appendices, Managing Enterprise Content provides sound advice for all types of enterprises.Rockley is an internationally known expert in content management, content reuse, and the tools and technology for working with large volumes of information. This book draws on her extensive experience and knowledge of information modeling, workflows, metadata, dynamic content, and XML.

Written clearly and quite easily understood."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Are you overwhelmed with the need to create more content, faster, customized for more customers, and for more media than ever before? Do you consider storing documentation on a server as an effective a content management system? Do you want to learn how content management will empower your organization? The answer to these questions and many more is covered in Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy by Ann Rockley with Pamela Kostur and Steve Manning of The Rockley Group. The Rockley Group is one of the leading providers of content management methodologies.Managing Enterprise Content provides concepts, strategies, guidelines, processes, and technical options that will prepare you to meet the increasing demands of creating, managing, and distributing content. It describes techniques that will help you define your content management requirements, build your vision, design your content architecture, select tools, and overcome obstacles of managing enterprise content. It will help you to visualize the spectrum of enterprise content, the requirements for effectively creating, managing, and delivering content, and the value of developing a content strategy for your organization. That&iexcl;s a lot of information for one person to understand. That&iexcl;s why the book is written for three audiences: content managers, information architects, and authors. Managing Enterprise Content follows the same methodical approach that Rockley uses to teach content management in seminars and workshops.I was expecting the book to jump into the technologies to implement a content management system. But that&iexcl;s not how Rockley presents content management. She begins with The basis of a unified content strategy and describes how content is created, who creates it, why authors work in isolation, and the consequences of isolation and centralizing content. The solution is to consolidate content in a definitive source, and a process that encourage authors to work collaboratively. The next step is to assess opportunities for content reuse. If you have never heard the term &iexcl;reusing content,&iexcl; you may know it as single sourcing. You probably already reuse content (i.e. copy and paste), which works well until the information, and everywhere that it appears, must be updated. Content reuse involves using existing content components (e.g. paragraphs, sections, and chapters) to develop new documents. Implementing a unified content strategy is a costly investment: tools, technologies, and training are not cheap. Investment costs are incurred in technology, training and consulting, and lost productivity.Examples are given to calculate the cost of authoring tools, content management systems, training and consulting&iexcl;Xa content management system is not a plug and play, one size fits all solution. The return on investment is achieved by reduced time to market, reduced cost of product content development, improved accuracy and quality of content, and reduced manufacturing defects. The examples are especially helpful because you will need to create a proposal to convince budget holders and management on the return on investment of a content management solution.Are you ready to buy a content management system? Not yet, read further. &iexcl;Performing a substantive audit: Determining business requirements&iexcl; begins with an introduction on how to determine goals that you want a unified content strategy to solve, for example:h Reduce the time to plan, write, review, approve, and publishh Create flexible content that is easily reused to create information products for multiple products and multiple mediah Reduce the cost of translation by reusing existing translations.h Make content more accessible; separating content from format makes it possible for content to be displayed automatically in a format appropriate to the disability.Rockley describes how to identify opportunities where a unified approach of content management (i.e. planning, design, authoring and revision, version control, access control, publication and delivery to its audiences) is beneficial.You are probably wondering how this all fits together, and Rockley explains how. &iexcl;Design&iexcl; describes information modeling and metadata, how to personalize content, how to design a workflow, and how to implement your design.An information model is critical for a unified content strategy because it provides a framework for documentation. It's the 80/20 rule: 80% of your effort is planning and analysis, and 20% of your effort is implementing the solution with whatever tools are selected to accomplish the goals the organization has set for itself. The level of detail of your information model depends on the level of reuse you want to achieve.Many desktop publishing tools can dynamically publish personalized letters and forms by matching elements such as names and address&iexcl;Xa content management system can do the same. I was confused why design is given so much attention. Why not conduct the audit, buy the tools, and worry about design later? You can&iexcl;t. The design of information, reuse models/maps, meta data and workflow are all tool independent tasks. Regardless of the tools selected, you must first analyse and then design a content or information model so that it can be presented to IT staff and software vendors. Doing this in advance makes it possible for you to ask vendors to respond to a request for proposal and document how their tools can help you satisfy your specific challenges. Analysis provides an opportunity to collect metrics. From your information models, you can identify how much of your content could be reusable and where.Educated on how content is used, where and how, you are better prepared to match the tools and technology to the origination&iexcl;s goals to deliver a unified content management solution. &iexcl;Tools and technologies&iexcl; offers guidelines for evaluating tools. With so many tools and technologies to choose from, selecting the one that best satisfies your goals and budget is a challenge. Your best advantage is to be an educated consumer before you shop around. Rockley recommends that you identify your needs, and criteria for evaluating product options in terms of usability, training provided, supporting documentation provided, technical support, upgrades and enhancements, implementation time, cost, vendor viability, partnerships the vendor has to provide an expanded solution, and references. Where do you being looking?Some good sources are conferences where vendors present authoring solutions such as the annual STC conference, electronic mailing lists, technology magazines, Web sites and online discussion boards and newsgroups. A supplement to &iexcl;Tools and technologies&iexcl; is Appendix C, &iexcl;Vendors,&iexcl; which is an overview of products, features and vendors. Appendix D, &iexcl;Tools Checklist,&iexcl; which lists sample questions to ask a vendor. When you have narrowed your list of potential vendors, Rockley suggests that you either contact the vendors and request onsite demonstrations or send vendors an RFP (request for proposal).&iexcl;Tools and technologies&iexcl; covers XML because it provides interoperability between applications. XML is not a set of tags that you apply to documents; it is a specification that sets rules for the creation of tag sets that you apply to documents. For instance, if you selected tools first and then designed your content, you might find that some of the content does not behave the way you expect it to. One solution would be to use XSLT to transform the content and move it around where you want it. While this may be an acceptable solution, it&iexcl;s not. The conversion costs time, money, and resources. There is no need to convert or transform content if it&iexcl;s modelled in XML from the start.Rockley describes strategies for collaborative authoring, how to separate content from format, how to manage change and transition. An example is given to illustrate how the same product description is reused effectively to create a show catalog, brochure, press release and Web site. It&iexcl;s easy to understand that people find it hard to believe that content somebody else created could possibly meet their needs. After all, Rockley notes, it was written for a different purpose and media, and the author could not have known their customers/audience/requirements. However, if content is written for a different purpose, audience, or media without considering how the content can be reused, it&iexcl; won&iexcl;t work.Don&iexcl;t be optimistic that everybody will be willing to convert to a better way of authoring and managing content. Rockley presents issues to consider when planning your change management strategy such as overcoming resistance from opponents and descriptions of new and modified roles. She recommends creating a role for an enterprise project coordinator and information technologist; a change to existing roles business owners or analysts and information architects; and new skill sets (p. 413-415). Unintentionally overlooked are system administrators to maintain the content management system and to ensure that users adhere to standards.Don&iexcl;t be overly optimistic that everybody will want morph into new roles and change their authoring habits. An XML system is best suited and ideal for a large documentation department for all content authoring or an organization where every author uses the XML authoring tool. A team of ten or fewer will be constrained to balance XML implementation and documentation project duties, and learn how to use the (new) content management system. Even if you assign the complex task of XML implementation and creation of information models, workflows and DTDs to a consultant, the consultant will require guidance from the team. These are only a few of the constraints to overcome to assure a successful unified content strategy that Rockley expertly describes how to overcome.Managing Enterprise Content concludes with a checklist for implementing a unified content strategy, suggestions for writing for multiple media, sample questions to ask vendors, a checklist for the tools required to implement a unified content strategy, and the importance of content relationships in version control. Pay close attention to usability. The rollout of a content management system, authoring tools, and authoring standards affects every member of the organization. If it&iexcl;s not easy to learn, easy to use, easy to support, and easy to maintain, authors will revert to the traditional way of writing and managing content.Read Managing Enterprise Content before you invest in a content management system and consulting fees. You will be an educated and informed customer and user when you begin shopping for a content management solution of your own."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"We've heard the buzz about content management for some time now. And some of us have ventured into the content management waters, only to emerge more aware of the problem than the solution. Organizations, especially smaller organizations, are looking at content management and looking away. Few have the funds - or the staff - to sponsor content management and realize the results in a reasonable period of time.Managing Enterprise Content addresses content management in six sections. Each section builds upon the previous section as it presents the rationale for content management in what the authors term a \\"unified content strategy.\\" Rather than presenting the tools and technology commonly used for content management, the authors save those for a later section of the book. Instead, they begin in the first section by explaining \\"the basis of a unified content strategy,\\" then move to \\"determining business requirements\\" through a substantive content audit, followed by a section on design that addresses the fundamentals of information modeling and design of metadata, dynamic content, and workflow. With these concepts established, we are then offered a broad overview of the related tools and technologies, which include XML and the various systems for authoring, content management, workflow, and content delivery. In the final substantive section of the book, the authors recommend process changes necessary for a unified content strategy. A healthy resources section that includes, in addition to a glossary, index, and stout bibliography, other useful tools to aid the implementation of a unified content strategy follows this section.Part I, \\"The basis of a unified content strategy,\\" offers a good review of the concepts surrounding this topic and presents a clear statement of the problem. In addition to presenting the standard phases of single sourcing in technical publications groups, the authors explain how other industries reuse content as well. The detailed analysis of the types of content reuse includes examples that I found helpful in gauging the status of my own organization's problem. The chapter covering return on investment (ROI) is a substantial contribution to the field. We now have solid figures we can attach to labor dollars to estimate what our organizations can expect to realize as a result of content management.When you reach Part II, \\"Performing a substantive audit: Determining business requirements,\\" you'll agree that Part I was just a warm-up. Chapter 4 is where the authors really touch our points of pain. The dangers, opportunities, and strengths covered here give us a niche to begin dialogue with executive sponsors. These authors arm us with specifics we can use to make a solid case for a unified content strategy. Combine these arguments with the ROI details addressed in Chapter 3 and we've got a foot in our decision-makers' doors. But the authors go even further. Once we understand the problem and know how to convey it up the chain, they lead us in visualizing the unified content strategy that suits our organizations.From problem to vision to design, Part III leads us mentally to the place where we can begin to see the \\"how to\\" of content management. Many advocates of content management confront us with metadata and information models right from the start, but not this book. If the authors had begun this way, they would have lost their readers before they ever got to the checkout. There is plenty of material on metadata available today, but only the XML geeks and programmers really understand it from the outset. This book is about the journey, and the authors have to get us out of the driveway before we can comprehend the horsepower under our hoods. This section on the nuts and bolts of what goes into the design and implementation of dynamic content and related workflow is right where it needs to be - after we've bought into the solution.Part IV, \\"Tools and technologies,\\" tells us how to use what we learned in Part III when we go shopping for tools and systems. There is an excellent section on dealing with vendors, which offers sound advice for vendor selection and management. Point by point, the authors offer ways to navigate around the \\"gotchas\\" that have proven fatal to many a content management effort. I applaud the recommendations on page 276 to \\"ask for a content-specific demonstration\\" and \\"conduct a proof-of-concept.\\" I wish the authors had included brief cases in point - real-life scenarios of organizations that have learned the value of these actions. We can take the authors' recommendations at face value; it sounds like wise advice. But there's nothing like a true example to drive home the lesson.Part V, \\"Moving to a unified content strategy,\\" is where it all comes together and we're challenged to apply what we've learned. Each theme expressed in this section clearly links back to messages conveyed earlier in the book. But this is where the \\"rubber meets the road\\" in content management. How are we going to go about this? Who is going to do what? How will our customers perceive this? What is our transition plan? This section helps us think it all through and put solid shape to the decisions we've made thus far. And the resources in Part VI equip us even further. I expected this to be a book that would speak to many of my questions and puzzles about content management, but I didn't expect a step-by-step implementation checklist, or a detailed list of criteria for matching content management tools to my organization's specific needs.I've been tempted to give up on content management, and possibly single sourcing altogether. Perhaps Managing Enterprise Content was published just in time to persuade me otherwise. It provides a roadmap to content management, acting as a guidebook to the steep cliffs and sharp turns along the way. If there is a route to define or a known course to navigate in the quest for content management, this book speaks about it. Consider it a tutorial in grappling with the entire breadth of the content management problem."},{"Title":"Managing Enterprise Content: A Unified Content Strategy","review":"Actually implementing a content management solution, even for a small company, is a daunting prospect. Not only do you have to consider a myriad of concrete tasks in order to audit, centralize, and reuse your information. You also have to \\"sell\\" a major work-style change to numerous players. Even knowing where to start can be overwhelming, and that's where Ann Rockley's book Managing Enterprise Content comes in.Authoritative and experienced, Rockley acknowledges that enterprise content management is not for everyone (a refreshing change from those pushing cookie-cutter solutions). In cases where content management could solve business problems, Rockley makes her case with calm conviction, breaking the subject down into logical chunks. In particular, her chapters on designing metadata (the \\"information about information\\" that is key to effective and scalable content management) and workflow (the designation of who does what, when) are lucid and comprehensive.Whether your objective is to get a grasp of the subject, sell an implementation to your organization, or just digest what an impending implementation will mean to you, you'll want Rockley's book on your desk."},{"Title":"Eagles (Zoobooks)","review":"I am 6 years old and my mom got me a subscription for Zoobooks.

In addition, leaving students alone for periods of time with an uncertified aide and a high school student is not a lawful practice in my state.

Now I have to get my hands on the sequel..."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I found value in the reviewer who related the history of the eugenics movement to the gifted child movement. However, we're all biased. Perhaps the issue was that if Sheila wasn't gifted she may have been institutionalized. I seldom read books cover to cover for various reasons of time and life situations. I was hell bent however at being a social worker or something of that nature at one point, and I ate this up. I read it all, and I cherish the emotional bent that keeps these women fighting for kids and loving when it's hard. This is essentially a beautiful story whether you buy it or not. I don't find it strange thAt Torey would seek out Sheila if only for her second book about it as it can't be so really: It must be so rewarding to see someone flourish that you helped and who cared for you aNd vice versa."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is the first time I've read a book by this author, and I must say that i have become a fan. I could not put this book down, it just captivated me. You get drawn in by this little girl, that no one can reach. And it goes to show you what patience and perserverance can get you. I am truly inspired by what this wonderful woman has accomplished, and I hope that I too can one day make such an difference."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read this book several years ago and it still is one of the best books I have ever read. I love Torey and I love her books, but this is by far my favorite."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I thought Torey Hayden's book, One Child, was sooo good! I couldn't put it down. In fact, I just ordered The Tiger's child (also by Torey Hayden) because I'm sure all her books are as good as One Child. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes awesome books!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book was a gift from a friend and truly the subject is outside my area of interest. However, I read it in good faith and did enjoy it. The book is simply written and is a very fast read. I must admit that I was able to skim over some minor details and pick up the story without missing a beat a paragraph or two later. I've no doubt that those missed lines were interesting - just not vital to the storyline and ...it was a story that really did not interst me at first.I was horrified by the abuse this poor little girl suffered but inspired that ANYONE would have the patience to deal with these troubled kids. Honestly, after hearing what she did to land in that class, I'd have been afraid to be near her. It is good to see that there are better people in the world than I. I can not begin to describe the step by step process of teaching this little girl the meaning of \\"safe\\" and \\"love\\" and \\"friendship\\" - things that a child of six should simply take for granted. It was also nice to see that the father stepped up to the plate in the end and tried to be a stand up kind of man. I only wish there had been a final note from the author to tell me that everything turned out ok and the child is now grown and educated and happy."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Torey Hayden's books impress on readers the success of her vast body of work with disturbed and troubled children. However, as you read, do not assume that you are reading facts and biography. You are reading parts of the truth, spiced with generous helpings of poetic license. These accounts are greatly fictionalized, and perhaps conflate a variety of cases.According to Hayden's official website, one can figure out a timeline of her career. Her \\"biographical\\" writings are based on work done in the states, and, again according to her official website, she came to England in 1980. Yet, judging by her date of birth, it is highly unlikely that Hayden graduated from college before 1972, and that was with a science degree. Her graduate work was in special education, which means she was unlikely to have graduated with a Master's degree before 1974. In the US, a PhD is a long hard slog. Hayden did not finish hers, but one can easily deduce that she spent a great deal of time in college, and probably fitted in her work with disturbed children as part of her college field experience requirements.So from this we know that her entire collection of \\"biographical\\" works was, at the most, based on experiences between 1972 and 1980. But even then the timeline is way off, especially when one considers Ghost Girl, and Hayden's claim of meeting her again when she was a college student.Reading her accounts, one imagines a life's career. No. The fiction is the life work. Keep writing, Ms. Hayden, you do it well. But be honest: don't present your teaching experiences with these children as autobiographical and biographical."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I've just finished reading this book. It says that it is a composite of different children that the author has worked with and not an actual child although it reads as if it was one child, 'Sheila'. The little six year old has a horrible life and then is badly abused by an uncle. If this was a true account it would be wrong for a teacher to be pushing a disturbed child to learn. Her emotional well-being should be taken care of first. In England social workers would remove her from her highly inadequate home. I recommend the books by Virginia Axeline."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I would recon\\\\mmend teachers to read One Child. The book gives a real insight to how a special needs classroom operates. The author does not try to cover up the negative aspects. Howver, the author deals withthe negatie situations in a very positive and uplifting manner. After reading the book, teachers would be motivated to deal with and handle any uncomfortable situations that arise in their class. I think this book helps teachers see the good and the bad parts of a class in an inspirational way. I strongly belive that all teachers can learn or gain something by reading this book. This book, in a sense, is a recipe for teachers to follow on how to care formstudents with special needs. This book would be for personal use and not for use in a classroom."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"i chose this rating beause i read this book all day it was that interestingits so terrible that this child went thru such horrible tratment"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book is one that will grab your attention and never let go. This book really shows the lives of children and their amazing ability to survive in a cruel and abusive world. Shelia, a troubled, abused, and yet brillant child, is one of the main focuses of the story. Torey Hayden, is the exceptional teacher that is trying desperately to reach her. The story exemplifies Shelia's remarkable transformation and how this change came through the abilities and concerns of one teacher. The idea that this book is a basic story about an abused child and the teacher that saves her is a complete misconception. This book is a song to the soul, and a testament of true human courage, determination, and willingness to care about others. This book also offers a renewed appreciation for those dedicated teachers, such as Torey Hayden, and their concept that when trust exists between teachers and their students, anything is possible. This is a remarkable story that will unfold the changes of an extraordinary child through the eyes of a very special teacher, and it proves that there are not any children that are hopeless or unreachable. This is a compelling story that will make you laugh, cry, and truly beg for more. The only negative aspect about his book is that it is so true. Children all over our world face the same abuses that Shelia did in this story. Although this statement may seem to give off a very negative connotation about the book, the fact that Torey Hayden possessed such determination and devotion, the positive aspect shines through, and we can see that there truly is light at the end of the tunnel."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is the 2nd book I've read from author Torey Hayden and it is the most emotionally riveting book I have read in a very long time. In this book we read about 6-year old Sheila temporarily sent to Hayden's special ed. class. Sheila comes in as an angry revengeful little girl and in a period of 5 months, blossoms into a flower full of joy and happiness. Hayden's book shows much of the ups and downs with her relationship with young Sheila. Nevertheless, it still shows positive progression. It lends credence that when dealing with emotionally disturbed children, the issues aren't always black and white, for I was clearly appalled with Hayden's accounts of Sheila's actions. However, as I continued to read, I discovered the reasons why Sheila acted as she did and this was due to her background situation with her mother and father.One thing that I did not like is that I felt Hayden's departure to pursue academics was in a sense, abandonment on Sheila's part. While I can understand the reason for it, I felt that it left Sheila too vulnerable into eventually thinking Hayden left her as well. With the Tiger's Child as the sequel to Sheila's story, I'm sure my reasoning will probably be addressed.And I agree with Hayden in the beginning: Sheila is a survivor."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"... I noticed my friend reading [this] story, a book about a young child that had been abused physically, as well as emotionally. At first, I waved it off, uninterested. But, after a day or two, I finally persuaded myself to read it. I only regret I didn't read it sooner. \\"One Child\\" is a very compelling story and my heart aches for anyone that has to go through what any of those children had to. I am not a nieve child. No, I know that our world isn't a perfect one and I know that a lot of terrible things happen. But this story really opened my eyes. Things like this probably happen everyday. Also, I am not a church-going person. I hardly ever pray or do any 'do-gooder' things. Now, I'm not saying I am a devil-worshipper, no. I'm simply saying I believe in the Lord and the Bible, yet sometimes I lack the conviction. But, tonight...I will be praying. I will pray that anyone that suffers like young Shiela, finds their Torey."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I am 17 years old and one of my teachers told me about this book. Usually I don't finish books but this one I did. It is very touching. I would recomend this book for anyone that has a problem finishing books as well as others that read them in a day."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I agree with all the favorable reviews.One reviewer wanted to know about the movie. The movie stinks and does a disservice to the book. Sheila is called &quot;Caitlin Eldrige&quot; with an IQ of 168 in the movie. It is a poor, pale ersatz version of the book and isn't even worth watching. Torey is portrayed as a martyr. The movie is really bad and poorly done. Forget the movie.The book is first rate and nothing can take away from this amazing teacher's talent, courage and perseverance. Stick with the book instead."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Working in education, I find Hayden's books a good read. It's always interesting to know how other professionals deal with the most horrific cases of abuse. I find her quite self-deprecating as well, able to admit when something just didn't work or when she made errors of judgement.One Child is my favourite of her books; the emotions involved in educating this child are very intense. However, some reviewers' comments about the level of attachment, confidentiality laws and physical contact with the child (lots of hugging etc) are justified. I believe she did get far too emotionally attached to this girl (and vice versa as a consequence), causing further problems. That simply would not be allowed to happen these days. Remember she is recalling events from the 1970s, when things were very different. I would be around Sheila's age then, and I remember similar affection and cuddles from teachers.I am from the UK and although I am bearing the era in mind, I am still shocked at the poor quality of social work in this story. Migrant workers in our country would receive a council flat and benefit payments, and their kids would probably be the best dressed ones in class! Maybe, after reading this tale, that wouldn't be such a bad thing. How can children be allowed to live like that?Perhaps we do need to change the laws and allow teachers to be surrogate mothers again. It seems some kids don't have anything else.If you loved this book you will probably already have looked at some of her others, but I particularly recommend The Tiger's Child (the sequel to this) and Ghost Girl, which will leave you wondering about the sanity of this world."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read this book years ago when I was in elementary school because I wanted to understand WHY people do this to children, sometimes including their own children. I wanted to rationalize it, to figure it out. At that time, it was nice to know that someone out there who experienced hurt and pain was being assisted by an adult - in this case - Torey. Sometimes, no one ever helps children but themselves, and sometimes, they must wait until adulthood and/or a time when they are in a \\"safer\\" situation to do so.As an adult, I remembered this book and searched for it on Amazon, finding it, ordering it, and reading it immediately. It caused many mixed emotions within me, including feelings of fear, abandonment, betrayal, hurt, pain, feeling unloved... It made me feel very sad. But, I also felt happy for the girl since Torey was helping her.Torey did the best she could while trying to maintain her professionalism and not get overly involved, though it was difficult for her not to. For most teachers, it is easy and preferrable not to get too involved. I know because I have been a teacher. Administrators generally frown on teachers and staff becoming too involved or familiar with students, and sometimes, for good reason.I have read all of Torey's books since ONE CHILD, as well, and have enjoyed reading each and every one. Torey is an angel, and I am glad that she has been able to help as many children as possible through her profession."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This was a beautiful story, illustrating the perseverance and courage of young victims of abuse and neglect. It's funny though; after reading it, I conjectured that Sheila rebounding the way she did at age 6 was hard to believe. After undergoing severe abandonment from her mother, ongoing physical and verbal abuse by her father, and right after surviving severe sexual molestation, she accepted the leave-taking of the only person who had ever loved her, her teacher, Torey. She did not take it easily, and she clung to the story of the Little Prince, which helped, but still! I thought that either the story wasn't true or Sheila's acceptance was actually a self-injurious defense mechanism that would later be exposed. Researching the book after I read it, I realized that the book is a true story. In a sequel titled, The Tiger's Child, I learned that Torey again re-entered Sheila's life and continued to support her. Yet the abuse Sheila incurred had been serious and despite her high intelligence, we learn that she struggled greatly after Torey's departure and on into her adolescence.Reading the reviews on Amazon, I noted that a few blamed Torey for leaving Sheila at the end of the year. They said that it was her fault that Sheila experienced such turbulence later in adolescence. I feel that those reviews may well have been written by people who themselves never completely healed from abandonment and still ache inside. The truth is that Sheila's fear of abandonment was caused by her early childhood trauma of being left on the side of the highway by her mother. It does no good to blame one who loves such a wounded bird, even if it was in the context of a short-term relationship. Because of the nature of Sheila's wound, even if Torey committed to staying with her for life, Sheila would have still continued to struggle with a false sense that she is prone to getting abandoned. Healing from that type of wound requires a long-term process that involves recognizing the deception of the false beliefs and emotions and using truth to fight them.Though Torey made some mistakes, her time with Sheila was overall positive because, like a flower, her love allowed Sheila's heart to be opened to the possibility that her emotions and false beliefs were wrong. In the last few chapters, it appeared that Sheila was able to understand Torey's departure cognitively, if not emotionally. The only aspects I would have changed about Torey's approach would have been to ensure that Sheila knew well ahead of time that she would be leaving. I would never have let her call me \\"mother\\" or \\"father\\" because it is not true; children can easily mistake fantasy for reality. Also, from the very beginning, Sheila should have been seeing a child therapist who could keep helping her on a more long-term basis.What an incredible story, more so because Torey really is the loving teacher she wrote about, and because Sheila is the child whose resilience inspires us all! I ask God to give me the courage to love abused kids unconditionally as Torey did, yet also the wisdom to know when to employ healthy boundaries to keep those children safe."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is one I could not put down. Possibly Torey's best book!Shelia, a bright 6-year-old girl who tied up a 4-year-old and set him on fire and was put in Torey's \\"crazy kid\\" class until a space opened up in the State mental hospital for her. She had a high IQ, was a bed wetter, had an abusive, alcoholic father and was abandoned on a freeway by her mother who kept her younger brother. She was quite a terror, but Tory \\"tamed\\" her and became very attached to her. She was cut bad by her uncle who raped her and was in the hospital for a month. She was able to enter regular classes again. Very good book, but left you wondering what happened to Sheila. Have to read the sequel:The Tiger's ChildKaren Arlettaz Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\""},{"Title":"One Child","review":"As a victim of extreme child abuse and experiences not dissimilar to that experienced by Sheila, and as an adult who has become consistently drawn to helping children who struggle with various aspects that block their progress, I am compelled to say that I found both One Child and The Tiger's child to be an incredible journey and an amazingly cathartic read. I am grateful that I was privileged enough to share it with these two amazing people.On the one hand, I could relate to Sheila in so many ways - and reading about her helped me to understand my own strength and courage, and through her, to respect what I have managed to achieve in my life, against the odds.I also related strongly to Torey, who shows what it means when an adult truly tries to understand the child behind the behaviour. She shows us what it means to look below the surface, what it means to truly care enough to have an impact. She shows us what it means to choose to love and take a chance.The risk of doing harm in this context pales in comparison to the chance of adding some sense of self worth to the psyche of a very damaged child. I cannot praise Torey enough for what she managed to do for Sheila. The value of what was offered far outweighs any cost.Torey admits openly in The Tiger's Child that she discovered that her own disappearance from Sheila's life caused harm. She is very honest about this. She also expresses her own angst and regret at this fact. Sheila was definitely hurt by Torey's disappearance. However, she also benefited from the encounter in ways that nobody can understand unless they have been there and experienced it.In my childhood, there was a psychologist/social worker who spent a short time sharing space with me when I was about six years old. I have always missed her since we parted ways and would still love to see her again - but the fact that she was there, even for five minutes, matters enormously to me, because she made me realise I had value, that I was important enough that I deserved help. I have never been angry at her for moving on in her life, and in fact never thought about it from the position of feeling abandoned until I read Tiger's Child.In the end, it is a matter of choice of perspective - I chose to value the good that was offered to me and to hang onto that and find strength in the memory of it. I imagine many other children would make that same choice.What Torey added to Sheila's sense of identity by being there for those five months when she was so small, was an idea that she had worth. She also showed Sheila that her life had possibility, that she could have a future - that it was okay to hope for something better. Without this hope, Sheila may never have survived for so long.At a crucial time in her development, Torey gifted Sheila with an alternative view of the world, and let her know that she wasn't ever completely alone. It seems distinctly plausible that by doing this, she averted disaster and probably prevented Sheila from heading down a path of potential sociopathy.The focus on IQ was, quite simply, on two levels - firstly, that Torey was so surprised to discover that this firey little ball of dirt and fists had such potential, and secondly, that it was an attribute that could be used in \\"the system\\" in order to achieve a new chance at a future for Sheila. In the era described, IQ carried great weight, and I know if I was trying to save a child from what I considered to be a harmful future setting, I would use whatever positive attributes that exist within that child as much as possible. The beauty of IQ in that context is that it is something which can be measured and demonstrated - and it works in a court of law.Torey made no judgement of any of her other students who had lower IQs, clearly loved them all and was passionate about assisting each and every one of the to a better quality of life. It just happens that this particular child had a huge impact on her teacher, and in the end, that is what this book (and Tiger's Child) is about - the teacher's admiration for the courage, strength, endurance and tenacity of a young individual who is struggling against massive life obstructions.I urge everyone to remain open to the idea that Torey's efforts, while possibly not perfect, were by far better than the consequences of no efforts being made at all."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book was wonserful.

There's no doubt in my mind that this book helped me reach out and get past all those secret hurts.

I thought the ending was great as well."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I am a 17-year-old senior in high school. When assigned to write an essay for my AP Lit class about the book that has impacted me most, One Child immediately came to mind. Here is the essay I submitted to my teacher, for any of you who would like to read it.\\"I curiously scooped One Child up from my mom's dresser; little knowing that so would the masterpiece consume me that I would spend all night and the next day finishing it. By the time I picked up this book I had long since decided that I wanted to be a social worker. Placing children in adoptive and foster homes, my work will consist of working with many disturbed and neglected children. I am always interested in reading books and articles on the subject; how their traumas manifest themselves, how to deal with their fears and behaviors, which kind of approaches work and which don't. But those reads are usually factual, bland and boring. One Child is different. It is the story of a remarkable six-year-old who'd had her childhood innocence robbed away from her forever by unimaginable tortures, but, through the love and patience of one teacher thrived and grew to prove herself. Right from the moment Sheila walked into Hayden's classroom for emotionally disturbed children, she wouldn't cooperate, she wouldn't listen, she would barely speak for the first few days. She acted on impulse with violence, hostility and defensiveness, terrorizing even the school's staff. But Torey saw a spark of intelligence in the child's eyes, and was the one person who wouldn't give up on her.It was through reading this new favorite book over the summer that I had an epiphany about so much of what I need to change about myself in order to reach my goal of being a social worker. There were so many times in the book, where Sheila was acting atrocious, when I thought to myself how badly I would've wanted to give up were I in Hayden's shoes. The brilliant and amazing woman is almost always able to assess and react to the situation in the smartest way possible. She is firm and consistent with Sheila as far as discipline and behavior reform goes, and yet still recognizes when she needs to step back and be loving and gentle with the her -- something the child had never experienced before. The book demonstrated to me what a delicate balance it is having relationships with children like these, how carefully you need to weigh the pros and cons of your responses and really pick your battles. Children who have endured horrific trials, although many times incredibly strong, also tend to have extremely fragile trust. I was struck strongly by just what a pervasive role this fragility plays in the real-life interactions in One Child, something I will always hold in my heart while I work with disturbed children.This was Torey Hayden's first book, and after reading many more of hers, I've realized a trend that is ever-present especially in One Child: honesty. Hayden not only describes all her triumphs with Sheila, but all her failures, making her writing extremely human. She tells us how much she regrets having blown up at Sheila for the girl's separation anxiety. She explains how stupid she felt for imagining she was Sheila's mom. Unafraid to admit that she isn't perfect, that she too experiences the parts of being human that we all try to cover up and ignore, Hayden has an immensely approachable writing style that makes me feel almost as if she is confiding in me as a close friend. Torey is as down-to-earth as you can get, and I've tried emulating her humbleness not only in my writing but in my personality and behavior.As I grow and mature, more and more I find myself remembering one of the many lessons this woman has taught me: that being human and acting as humans do is nothing to be ashamed of. The honesty in this book has evolved the trait in me that lets me be more accepting of my own mistakes and remind myself that they are part of the process of learning, the way Hayden's mistakes were part of her process with Sheila.Her narration seems almost third person, the way it contradicts most non-fiction authors' ways of describing themselves in a favorable light. She makes Sheila the champion; omitting nothing from the story that serves to let us know just how amazing the little girl was. She never sells Sheila short of her unbelievable success. While the story does end happily, Hayden manages to recount her phenomenal feat of reaching this unreachable child without ever casting herself as the heroine. It was precisely this avoidance of praise, along with her admirable patience and incomparable skills with children, that has made Mrs. Hayden my heroine and my role model.Through Hayden's recap of the incredible six months she and Sheila shared together in class, so much can be learned about the resiliency of the human spirit and the power of just one person caring. Sheila's past presents a daunting task for Hayden: to be the very first person to love her, to show her that not everyone is bad and wants to hurt her. Such a feat seems impossible with the way the little girl won't let anyone into her vicinity, much less her heart. Yet young Hayden is up to the challenge and the two form an incredible, unbreakable bond, the details of which Hayden lets us in on intimately. The woman is not only a firm teacher, providing constant guidance for the lost little girl, but also embraces the role of being the one to provide her with the love, care, reassurance and gentle contact she desperately needs. Someday I would love to be this type of person in a child's life when they have no one else to go to. Hayden has inspired me to have the type of patience, endurance and stamina it takes to make a relationship like that work.Through Hayden's short book I recognized how disturbed children, while still children, are so different from most their age; the way they need to be approached is specialized and unique. There is so much to absorb between the pages of this captivating and unforgettable read that I could go on for hours. Although there is still much I need to learn, Sheila's story undoubtedly started me in the right direction and made me realize that I don't know it all yet. Hayden's One Child converted my view of how I'm going to approach social work. If it weren't for her, I never would have realized that such a career can not and will not ever be an exact science. Hayden was a special education teacher, whereas I will be a social worker, but the lessons she teaches can apply to anyone with a heart for helping people. I will be forever grateful to One Child for all the insight it has given and will continue to give me."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I don't know why as I sit here glancing through books this evening I'm drown to the memory of a book I read repeatedly through my teens and 20's. This book and the depths of mental, and psychological hell still resound within my soul. Although after a few decades, I can't remember the details, I can remember, that it's a book worth paying to own again. I remember the beaten up copy of my paperback that is falling apart if I still have it packed away somewhere. I was so excited to see that that the author comes from a psychological background, and I'm excited to re read One Child and start into the other two books that she has written. What a blessing I ran into this page tonight. If you haven't read this yet, at least use the take a peak feature or see if your local library has the book. You don't want to miss this one."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. If you've never read any of Torey Hayden's books, I'd recommend starting with either this one, or Ghost Girl.

For all of us, who manage to complain about...oh my clothes are not the most trendy, or my mom did not make it on time after school, or the food did not taste \\"right,\\" this is a must read.

Hayden's books are wonderfully written, almost to the point where you feel like you are HER experiencing the situations.This book made me so sad to realize what is going on in our so-called perfect America.This little girl has been through hell and back and everyone, except Hayden, sat back and ignored it.I believe there is a special place in heaven for Hayden. She is the reason I hope to one day become a foster mother. She makes you believe that you can and will make all the difference in the life of a child who needs you. She's an inspiration...and this book is proof of that."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I was given this book by a high school teacher 21 years ago.

IF I can reach 'just one child' today my life has been a success.Inspirational to anyone who is considering a career in education."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"ONE CHILD is my favorite book in the whole world. I first read it when it came out in the summer of 1981 I believe it was. Since then I have read it no less than 5 times. ONE CHILD has altered my life because today I am a foster mother and the way in which Torey dealt with 6 year old Shelia has influenced the way that I treat the lives which are entrusted to me.What can be said about that remarkable teacher that hasn't already been said? The formula that God poured into that woman's heart when he was creating her was the stuff that changes lives, that make people better, that rescues drowning souls! The steps that she took to help that child were small and seemingly ordinary but the power and results of those choices were the type that moved the mountains within the souls of those she helped. Torey Hayden is the kind of human being that God sends, if you're lucky, to people who never knew that a thing called LOVE ever existed. Buy this book and I dare you to not be moved and changed in at least some small way."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This has got to be the most haunting book I've ever read. From the moment I picked it up I could think of nothing but the next few minutes I would have to read more. This book really grounded me. Whenever something gets me down, I think of this book and it reminds me how good things in my life have been. I wish everyone could be so lucky. This is a must read for anyone who has a heart. Torey is a wonderful woman, and Sheila is an amazing girl to have survived the torment she lived through. I read reviews before purchasing this book about those who read the book being inspired to work with children, especially those with special needs, and now that I have read it, I agree. I can think of nothing else that I should do with my life than to be able to help children who have nothing realize that there is such a thing as love, and that they can feel it and that others can and will feel it for them. I really can't say enough about this book. I cried often at Sheila's hardships, but also rejoiced when good things came to her. I just ordered the sequel, and can't wait to find out what has become of this remarkable little girl. There should be more people in the world like Torey."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I thought &quot;One Child&quot; was a great book i read it for my book report and i loved it.

Being undecided in a field that I wanted to study in, after reading this book I have no question in my mind that I am going to pursue a Masters degree in Clinical Child Psychology. My hopes and prayers are that I might be able to help one child that is being neglected or abused. I would challenge anyone who reads this book to take an active part in a child's life so that another child does not have to be tortured by the silence."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"after reading this book i have deciced to be a special ed teacher. i espically want ton work with autistic kids. the autstic kids in this book touched me in a special way. anyway back to the man story with sheila it is very good. i have made a buch of pepole read this book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Like all Hayden's books, this one grabs you and never lets go. The children are truly amazing in their ability to survive in a world that treats them like property. They have a level of insight and soul that is rare in adults.

I like to read books about things that have really happened. Torey Hayden a special ed teacher/ psychologist does a great job with this book.In this book she writes of 6 year old who comes from a rough place and has alot of horrible things happen to her. It shows how much she really made a difference in this girls life and how great a person she really is. When your done reading this one you really want to know what happens to this little girl \\"Sheila\\" later in life. I just finished the sequal to this book called \\"The tigers child\\" and it was also a great read. Shocking to think all these sad things could happen to a little girl but the bond she has with Torey is unbelievable. I plan to read more of her books."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I first read One Child over a decade ago, and have read it dozens of times since, as it is the most beautiful and captivating book I have ever read!One Child is Torey Hayden's first book, a non-fiction narrative of her experience teaching Sheila, an abused, emotionally disturbed, and highly gifted 6-year-old. Sheila is labeled \\"unreachable\\" and is destined for the children's ward of the state mental institution, and is basically just dumped in Torey's classroom temporarily until there is an opening in the institution. Torey, being young (early 20s) and idealistic and stubbornly so, puts her whole heart into building a connection with Sheila, refusing to let Sheila be locked up to rot in some institution. In her relationship with Torey, Sheila experiences love and trust and stability for the first time...The book raises many questions about boundaries, and about what it means to be an effective teacher, since it is precisely Torey's emotional involvement with her student that new teachers are often warned to avoid.Torey wrote One Child for herself, as if writing in a journal, and it wasn't until after she finished writing it that she realized it was a BOOK! As a result, Torey's writing is incredibly honest and real, and draws you right into the story. I especially love how descriptive Torey's writing is, how vivid her words are. It makes it possible for me to experience the story with all 5 of my senses and then some!One Child is a book that appeals to such a diversity of people, not just teachers or people interested in children...I don't know a single person who has read One Child without being touched by it; everyone I have given the book to has stayed up late into the night reading it. The book's wide appeal can be explained by the way in which the book is not just about teaching or education, it's ultimately about the experience of being HUMAN. Torey is able to reach Sheila when so many others had failed, and form a strong connection with her, based on love and trust. But Sheila touches and changes Torey just as much as Torey touches and changes her, and it is a beautiful thing. That's what life is all about.I promise you that despite my review sounding increasingly like a Hallmark card, the book itself is not Hallmark-y! It is a very difficult book to read at times, and parts will enrage you - for instance, having to read about the abuse Sheila endures. But the book will also make you laugh, make you cry tears both happy and sad, and make you think, and I cannot recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"this book is amasing it was very outstandingly writen i suggest that if you love to read about this stuff this book is for you"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I'm from Japan. I don't Know the Movie about it. Please tell me."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I gave this story 3 stars because I found it enjoyable to read but much of the details are strange and doubtful. In the first place, A child as neglected and abused as this would have ended up in foster care especially after the incident with her uncle. The incident with the uncle certainly could have happened but she would have ended up in a facility or foster care. A school system would never have a child waiting 2 hours at school for the high school bus. High school kids get out much earlier than grade school kids so I don't know where that all came from. A school district could not have a teacher stay 2 hours with one student because of liability and the teacher contract. A pricipal would never tolerate the professional boundries Ms. Hayden crossed. This certainly may have been an intelligent child but an IQ of 182? Come on. I guess it sold the book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Torey Hayden's One Child is sad, but in a way it's also interesting. It makes me want to keep on reading even after I've put it down.I don't really like how it just keeps talking about one thing, and very intricate details for a page or two long. There is a part in the book that I really liked, where one of Torey's students ate rabbit poop thinking it was candy.In the beginning of the book, a man named Ed Somers, who is in charge of the special education, ask a teacher named Torey Hayden if she could teach a mentally disabled class. Torey accepts, and that was what began a big part of her life.As she watched her students enter the classroom, she noticed that all the students were afraid of something, either blood, or and some of them wouldn't talk. She is asked if one more child could join her class, and she just couldn't say no, so she accepted.This little girl was named Shelia, and was very disturbed and needed some help. Shelia destroyed some classrooms, and poked out the eyeballs of the fish in the classroom with a pencil. Torey helped this little girl with her problems, and she also gave her the courage to cry.I would recommend this book to people who enjoy children, and can handle sad things."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One child by Torey Hayden was very sad and depressing.A little girl named Sheila was left on the freeway by her mom. Sheila's dad doesn't think she's a good kid because she always destroys things.

I also admire Torey for her amazing writing skills! I hope to write books like her someday. :-) Her writing is so descriptive, detailed; it is magic.

This is a great book for anyone to read. Some of the words are pretty big and techniqual but it is all good you understand what is going on."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read One Child by Torey L. Hayden. This book was mostly drama/young adult. One Child is a story of a teacher who instructs a class of children with serious problems, and who are very disturbed. The story tells of a various group of children (who've had it rough) growing together and growing up. The main focus is on one child in particular who touches the teachers heart. I've read many drama's and many young adult novels. I can't make any comparisons though because I have never read anything this heartfelt. So in a way the feelings and virtues that vibrate from this book are something that I have never encountered or experienced before. It was way more sentimental and serious than I expected. My personal feelings however were interperted very easily. While I was reading this book I was amazed at the describtiveness and the story. I got really into the book, to a point where I actually wanted to meet the characters. The book taught me a lot about friendship, and that people who are different are still people. &quot;'I didn't mean it when I said I would be bad. I'll be a good girl.' she looked up solemnly. 'For you.'&quot; Page 219. I loved this part because it was after Shelia had come back from the hospital and had realized that it was May and the school year was going to end. She had promised to return to her nasty old ways, and then at the last minute she changed. I love this part because it shows how one person can affect another so powerfully that they'd be willing to become a differnt person just for a friends sake. I enjoy the thought that people can change for the better just by making a single friend. All in all I just like to believe that everyone has a dream and that everyone has good in them. I really enjoyed this book, I really got into it and really felt its words. Although this was an exellent book it's not for everyone. It deals with some serious topics that a reader must be mature enough to handle. It also tells about children with disorders and handicaps that could be unsetteling to certain people. So I guess this book isn't for everyone but it taught me a lot and I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I cried at the end of this book,I was touched, it was excellent,and I didn't want to put it down. I was appalled at the fact that this girl's mother left her behind. I wish that mother would learn her lesson for leaving this defenseless child behind. She doesn't know what she was missing, she was missing out on an opportunity to get to know her child, who's very intelligent for a six year old girl. This girl was a miracle, and so is Tory. Tory is a good example to all teachers dealing with difficult, yet, very intelligent students. She was patient with Sheila, and wasn't going to give up on her. She saw potential in Sheila that gave her the self esteem that she needed. I would've been a runaway child if I had a father like that. I was angry at the girl's uncle. all in all, this book deserves an award, and five stars, it was excellent, I recommend it to everyone!!

I usually choose a book to read depending on my mood. Ever since I got married last year, my husband and I are discussing when to have kids. We are still young and have not much money so we thought it could wait for a few years. When I was single and living in a nice studio apartment by myself, I didn't have much chance to encounter young children and I had never been bothered too much by the news of any incidents involving child abuse. I just thought it was a bad thing to happen but that was it. However since I got married, this sort of news started to bother me a lot and it made me think not want to have my own kids because of the fear of getting them hurt in any way. After reading this book, I felt kind of released from the fear a bit. Then I read the sequel of this book, &quot;The Tigar's Child&quot;, and it just made me think I could deal with it. These books really changed my point of view toward children in trouble in a good way."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Captivating book that I've read too many times to count! Fall in love with Sheila, she's worth it!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is one of my favorite books that I have ever read. It really big difference in the way I look at things. This is a great book for any kid to read because it tells a story of one girl who was able to overcome her difficulties."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book is unlike any other I have ever read before. It tells the tale of how Sheila, an abused, neglected child, is put in teacher Torey Hayden's class only because the hospital doesn't have room yet. Torey first feels frustrated then comes to know Sheila and shows her how to deal with all her extreme emotions. This book was so well written I cried at points, and it was definitely the most emotional book I have ever read. Now, when I compare it to my favourite book, my favourite book seems wimpy. Perhaps this is indeed my new favourite. It was absolutely amazing. Torey Hayden is a remarkable person and a wonderful writer as well. I am looking forward to writing the sequel."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"The only awful thing about this book is that it's true. This little girl is so strong. The book is proof that one person can make a difference in someone's life.

Is that a documentary ?"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book made me realize that helping others overcome obstacles is about the most important thing you can do for anyone else ever in their lifetime. They will be greatful and you will feel stronger. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to help people and who has a very open mind. In the book you grow to love the characters and you start to feel as though you are right there with them. I had to read it twice because you just can't imagine what the characters are going through. It almost made me feel like I wasn't helping people enough. Or even that the help I was giving wasn't enough. After I read it the second time I realized that this is not what Ms. Torey Hayden was trying to occomplish. She was trying to get us to understand that you aren't the only one out there that has problems and that you can't do it alone. You will always need someone!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book tells of the things that abused children go through, and shows that they're not all the same. I think this book should be read by High school english students."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I am 14 years old. I just got done reading &quot;One Child.&quot; I was speechless. The thought of what happened to Sheila and what she went through at such a young age was shocking to me. Also, seeing that this was in Iowa, and that is where I live, made it even more realistic. I could never imagine that. This book proved to me that you should never give up and that there are people out there, like Torey Hayden, who deserve the most respect you can give. This book is right up there with &quot;They Cage The Animals At Night.&quot; Everybody should read it, and tomorrow I am going to hurry and go to our school library to find &quot;The Tiger's Child.&quot;"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I loved it! I don't usually like to read, but I couldn't put it down! People know about what happens to children in abusive homes, but they never do anything about it. The teacher in this book, Torey, is different because she cares about the children in her class. She has all the children rejected from all other classes that have turned away. They were rejected for reasons from not talking, to being severely mentally retarded, to one child, her most recent inductee, who has committed arson. There seemed to be no helping the children until they were finally placed in a loving environment, that of Torey's. I recommend anyone with a heart to read it. It will make you laugh, but at the same time want to cry for these poor little children that have had to go through so much already and are so young. It's an all around great book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Sheila was a disturbed and abused child who never thought she would be loved. That is until she walked into Torey Hayden's classroom. She started out as an enraged, untrusting child, but ended with being an intelligent, lovable little girl. Sheila started out without a real family, but found a place where she belonged.Torey Hayden, through this book, inspired each of us to try and reach every child without giving up. She proved that with hard work and determination any person can turn an awful situation into an experience that will last a lifetime!We loved this book!!!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is an inspirational book, especially for individuals who work with children. Just when you thought a child was unreachable and hopeless, Torey proves you wrong.

This story of a troubled young girl, and the special ed teacher who manages to reach through to her, is amazing, inspiring, and so completely memorable.I cried more than once while reading their tale, was horrified, and proud, and a jumble of other strong emotions--because, not only is the story an amazing one, but it is written so well, so engagingly, that you lose yourself in their lives and struggles, and feel a close connection to them when they succeed and fail.I recommend this book highly, but warn you to have Kleenex handy when you read it!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read this book many years ago when it was first published and I am still drawn back to it now and again. My aspiration is to be a teacher of special needs children and I think Torey L. Hayden had a major influence on me in that regard. This was the first book of hers I ever read, but it is by far her best, I think. The way the story unfolds and the evolution that you witness through her eyes of this extraordinary child is something that has haunted me since I first read this book. The follow-up book to this one is good too, but this book is maybe the best one I have ever read..by her or anyone. Can't say enough about it really."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"When I read this I realized what specail educations teachers go though and how emotional it is. I think it's great Torey helped her kids so much. I'd recommed this book to everyone. My friends already want to get it because I told them it's such a good book. You'll be missing out if you don't read this book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"When I was first assigned to read this book, I was prepared for a story of an abused child and the teacher that saved her, but that was a huge misconception. Shelia suffered every possible abuse a child can endure, but still found an inner strength within herself to survive. I gained from reading this book a renewed appreciation for dedicated teachers like Torey, and the knowledge that when trust is shared between teacher and student, all things are possible."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read this book when I was twelve and I haven't stopped reading since! Not only did it inspire me to love reading, but I also gained an appreciation for the developmentally and physically disabled. After reading, &quot;One Child&quot; I read everything else Torey Hayden wrote. She has had a tremendous impact on my life. I ended up studying Biopsychology and worked for an Autism Research Center in College. Since then, I have become a healthcare administrator with the hopes of one day having my own facility for the developmentally/physically disabled. I owe Torey Hayden much thanks -- she has truly touched my life!!! I highly recommend &quot;One Child&quot; for readers of all ages. In fact, I recently gave this book to a friend studying to be a special education teacher. I know she will be inspired as I was when I read this book 14 years ago!!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"The Torey Hayden's book, One Child, is one of the best books I have read so far. It is about children who have problems getting along with others, being very big trouble makers, and having problems in their household. This book made me realize that reading is not dumb or stupid. This book is actually fun, entertaining, and educational.When I was in about eighth grade, I dreaded reading books, it was the last thing I wanted to do. After I was done reading this book I could not believe how much I loved reading. The beginning of this book didn't really interest me, but I thought maybe it could get better. The climax of this novel really caught my eye. Whenever I told myself that I was going to be done after the chapter I was on, I would get done and realize that I could not put it down. It made me keep reading and reading until I was done with the book, because it got better and better every sentence.This book was really fun to read and kept my attention. I recommend this novel to anyone who wants to read a very good book that will keep you interested and very entertained."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is truly one of the most inspiring books I have ever read. Torey Hayden has truly raised the bar in working with children and has, in pioneer fashion, blazed new trails and set new standards.Sheila, a 6-year-old girl living in grinding poverty and raised by her single father faced some daunting odds when she entered Torey Hayden's special needs class. Abandoned by her mother, beaten by her father and facing a court ordered sentence to a hospital after a particularly violent episode, Sheila was extremely aggressive and wary. Since she had no bathing facilities in the home she shared with her father, Sheila was often dirty and underfed. It is a true testament to her courage and Torey Hayden's belief and persistence that Sheila began confiding in her within 3 days of her classroom placement. I like the way Torey Hayden started a grooming routine for Sheila, which positively impacted her behavior and interactions with others.Sheila entered that classroom under very inauspicious conditions. The court ordered that she at least be educated until the state hospital opening was available. In that class, Sheila flourished and even made overtures to her classmates, some of whom functioned well below age level.Luckily for all, Torey Hayden was able to recind the court order; Sheila stayed in that class for the remainder of the year and made quantum leaps and bounds. During an early testing session it was determined that Sheila had an IQ of 182. This highly gifted little girl was able to express herself eloquently. Quick to assess people and situations, Sheila had developed a survival mode early. In that class she used her natural endowments to her advantage.The gifts this child had to offer and the gifts she received in that class are a song to the soul. There is a poignancy about her courage. She is, to a large extent, accepting of her life conditions and makes the best with available resources.This is a book that will evoke just about every possible emotion, from sadness to anger to cheering gladly. The close of the term is indeed bittersweet; the parting of teacher and pupil is very moving indeed. One sees the progress Sheila has made and marvels at what this child unknowingly had to give."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"It has been quite some time since I read One Child , yet I can say that among the hundreds of books I have read, that was the most striking among all. Its the type of book that makes you want to become a better person and try in your own way to make a difference in the world, just as Torey did to those children. I know I did! I tip my hat to her, and I am very grateful that there are still people like her here in the world who REALLY love, especially the most unlovable. I have an autistic cousin too that's why I was really able to relate to the story. Now I know why they are called special children, it's not a euphemism people use for abnormal or dumb, they really are SPECIAL in every meaning of the word. I believe everyone should read it, especially on days when they are down, because although this book is a real tear-jerker, it has a lot of fun moments too. Most of all it makes us realize how lucky we are for not having to go through all the hardships these kids went through. In the end, we feel uplifted and very touched, that we forget about griping and self-pitying."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Torey Hayden's book was extremely well written and very emtionial. Torey is an exceptional teacher, as well as a compassionate and patient person. She feels for these children and is willing to stick her own neck out to save them. Her strong desire to help these children, especially Sheila is indeed the making of a true teacher. To see Sheila's behavior change was truly remarkable. How Torey got Sheila to respond to schoolwork and other children was amazing. I enjoyed every moment of this book. It made me cry at times to read how Sheila was treated and it also made me mad for the way she was neglected, abused and rejected. I was so happy when she finally accepted the fact that she would have to move on in life, but still could hold on to the memories that she would always have from Torey's Special Class. This book has made me want to read the sequel, as well as other Torey Hayden books. I would recommend this book to anyone, who has any dealing with children."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This story is about a teacher and one child. It's heartaching and touching from the moment Sheila walks into that classroom. It almost wanted me to become a teacher, because if you could save just one child it would be worth all the troubles you might have. Mrs. Hayden's way of describing the story and girl is very vividly and you can see Shelia standing right there in front of you. I recommend this book for everyone who is a bit interested in children, especially the need to care about kids. The way it makes you feel when Torey reach into Sheila...it gives you a very joyful moment and you wished there were more persons like her and less child abusers. This book gives you all the emotions, anger, despair, hope, love, makes you smile, makes you want to do something. So please read it!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I am 14 and I read this book about a month ago, I really touched me in a way no other book has ever done before! I hardly ever cry but when I read the end of this book I couldn't hold back the tears!!!I think Torey Hayden is an amazing author and I really want to get the sequal to this book.Everyone should read this, it will touch even the toughest people. I have always wanted to work with disadvantaged kids and now I do even more!!Thank you Torey for writting this book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I have just read Torey Hayden's One Child in one sitting. It is the most moving story I have ever read. Sheila's courage against so much adversity is simply breathtaking. I have to thank Torey for bringing this story to the world. Maybe it will give courage to others in a similar position to Sheila."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I am a first time reader of the author, Torey Hayden. I had never heard of her nor her books until I was reading another book and it mentioned one of her books. As I began looking, I saw the reviews for this book and was intrigued.The book is an autobiographical account of Torey Hayden's experience with a special education class of eight children that no one else wanted to teach. Then, a six year old girl that had severely burned a three year old child was placed in her class to await a state mental hospital placement.This book chronicles Ms. Hayden's frustrations and triumphs with her class, in particular this young girl, Shiela. I was impressed with the author's candid explanation of what happened. I did not get the impression that she was trying to show everyone what a good teacher she was.Rather, she was helping the reader feel the pains of her experience and the struggles she went through in trying to make a difference in the experience of a young child who had already suffered a lifetime of hurt. In the process, she demonstrates the power of perseverance and never giving up on people, even when they may do everything in their power to push others away.I gained further insight into the power of love and the importance of empathy in considering other's situations. Until we begin to understand what they've been through and see things as they do, we will never unlock the power to love even the most \\"unloveable\\" person.I give this four stars, as it did not reach the level of perfection warranted by a five star rating. The writing, while intriguing, is more frank than truly literary. In addition, there are a number of typos that inhibit reading a bit. I would recommend this book to most everyone who works with children in any way. It will open your eyes more to their experience and the need for patience, empathy, and caring."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Imagine being left abandoned on the side of the highway by your own mother. Well, that was the case with shelia in the book One Child by Torey L. Hayden. I really liked this book and am eager to begin reading the sequel The Tiger's Child. The reason I like this story was Shelia, herself. During Shelia's short life, she already has to deal with many problems that I am not even sure i would survive through. For one, she has to take care of herself for the most part because her father is either too drunk or too high to take care of her. Second, she has to learn how to take control of her own life because she is going around hurting many young children. For example, at the age of six she tied a boy to a tree at a nearby woodlot and burned him. I believe that she has many mental problems to deal with, including being abandoned by her own mother. I can only imagine how terrible I'd feel to know that my mother does not really love me as much as she should. Shelia grew to be a really strong person. She never gave up on learning, even though she may not have seemed eager to learn anything, but she was afraid of losing. On many occasions, she would just rip the paper up if she did not know how to do something. Another situation that Shelia had to go through was trying to show everyone that she was actually a veryt bright student. The book said that if people are below normal IQ they are classified as being mentally slow, but if they are above normal IQ, they are placed usually in a controlled environment. Then, they get bored and therefore are more capable of causing trouble. That was the main case in Shelia's situation. No one ever considered her as being very bright kid because she never talked with any intelligence. She always used the word &quot;be&quot; on many accasions instead of &quot;is&quot; or &quot;was.&quot; I believe that a little more schooling would cure this problem that everyone just thought was a dialect. In handling shelia and her problems, the teacher, Torey Hayden, proved to be a very strong person, in my opinion. She worked harder at trying to help Shelia make something of herself and to prove to the world that she was actually a very bright little kid. I am not sure that I would necessarily work as hard as Torey did with her. I would feel like I was getting nowhere with her as a student. Torey had the patience and the heart to keep going, which proved to be a very important matter for her to realize. When Shelia would refuse to do something, Torey would let her be for awhile but then would be eager to reapproach her again. This happened when she would refuse to do any written work. Torey would leave her be until she had time to think about what she was actually doing to herself by not doing the necessary work. This teaacher left an ever-lasting impression on Shelia. She would return to Torey whenever she needed help on anything in life. I would be grateful for a friend or a teacher to keep trying with me when I did not get something, but many people would probably just give up on me. Overall, if anyone is looking for an exciting book to read, One Child is the book to read. Torey Hayden will leave anyone spellbound for the majority of the time. No one will ever believe the outcome of Sehlia. Shelia will give you the strength to keep going when the going gets tough. If she could survive a lifetime of hurt, anyone can deal with everyday stresses because no matter what his or her life will not ever ne as bad as Shelia's life once was."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Torey Hayden seemed to have placed a lot of stock in the book the \\"The Little Prince\\" in rationalizing why she and Sheila could no longer be together. However, she was more than a teacher to Sheila; she was her surrogate mother. At the end of the book Torey included a poem that Sheila wrote at a later date. I believe the poem was written by a child who longed for her surrogate mother. Sheila may have thought that if she was good enough Torey might come back. She no doubt blamed herself when Torey left. This is a good book to read if you are looking for an example about a teacher crossing boundaries and re-traumatizing a student that has been abused. I found it ironic that Torey only sought Sheila out again when she wanted to write another book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One Child is a very good book about a girl named Sheila. She was 6 years old and was put in a class for \\"crazy\\" kids. Torey was the teacher, and she really helped Sheila become a better person, while their relationship grew.Throughout the book, Sheila goes through many hard situations. She had to deal with her mom gone, her fathers drunk acts, and the way everyone looked at her. By the age of 6, she had been through more things than most people. She was beyond her grade level, though she didnt like to do work at first. Towards the end she learns what it really feels like to have somone truely love her. Her father and Torey both make a big impact in the way Sheila acted and her life was changed forever.Sheila is a 6 year old girl. Her mom took her brother, Jimmy, and left her on a highway when she was little. She lives with her father in the migrant camp.I highly recomend reading this book. It is good for all ages, and it's a true story. It made me think more about how some kids are treated. It is a very emotional book, but it's amazing how true it is, and you can almost imagine and see it in your head while your reading.I would rate this book a 8 out of 10 stars. I only would rate it an 8 because some of the words that Sheila said made it hard to read and understand. I really like this kind of book, that makes you feel bad for the characters. The genre is very emotional and there are many themes. Some themes would be neglect, abandonment, voilence, abuse, intelligence, and fear."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"My second book by Torey Hayden, but definitely not my last.ONE CHILD is the story of Sheila, a young girl who was abandoned on the side of a highway by her mother. Now the charge of her drunken father, Sheila is wild, sometimes crazy, and never cries.What follows after her arrival in Ms. Hayden's classroom (following an incident that is truly chilling) is the relationship that grows, in a short period of time, between Sheila and Torey.A very good but emotional read. I highly recommend it, and also recommend picking up a copy ofThe Tiger's Child, which is the continuation of Sheila's story."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"At age six, Sheila had already endured a lifetime of horrors. Her mother abandoned her on a highway at age four; her alcoholic father neglected and traumatized her. Thus, it was scarcely a shock to anyone when the coarse, hate-filled child attacked a three-year-old boy, nearly burning him to death.At such a tender age, Sheila's fate seemed inevitable - a lifetime in a psychiatric ward. Yet while the state awaited placement, they decided to put her in Hayden's special needs classroom.Initially skeptical of a child with such a background, Hayden nonetheless did her best. Quickly, she glimpsed an intensely intelligent child, who longed for love and acceptance.This wasn't to say it was an easy job. Nor was there any fairy-tale ending. Often, Sheila went into uncontrollable rages, damaging property, once even throttling pet gerbils when she perceived she had been wronged. Yet after glimpsing the inner Sheila, Torey Hayden refused to give up on her.Then one day, several months after Sheila arrived in Hayden's classroom, the teacher received a call -- the psychiatric hospital was ready for Sheila. Despite having made a breakthrough with the child, would Sheila's life really be taken away before she had a chance to start it?As always, Hayden's stories about the children with whom she has worked are deeply moving and memorable. By no means does she attempt to portray herself as a miracle worker; she freely admits her mistakes along with her triumphs as she merely dedicates her life to helping turn young lives around.Readers interested in learning more about Sheila may be interested in the sequel, The Tiger's Child, which picks up when the girl is 13 and recently reunited with Hayden."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book is amazing. It will have you laughing, crying, and everything in between as you learn about a little girl who due to the insight, love, empathy, and dedication of her teacher overcame great odds. It will also introduce you to what a teacher of emotionally impaired students might have to deal.I have used the book in a speed reading class several times and the students have loved it. I am now going to use it in another reading class to broaden the students' point of view and cultural awareness. Everyone I have shared the book with, has loved it and shared it with others. The read will keep you involved and make you want to read other books by Torey Hayen."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Adam HobbsOnce ChildTorey HaydenAvon Books1998354 pagesTeacher and literary genius Torey Hayden hits a high note with her captivating book, \\"One Child.\\" I have been blessed with the opportunity to read this story and it truly is a masterpiece. The words set forth to paper in this story are more powerful than a Boeing jet and have the strength to move you on an emotional level.This is the story of young special education teacher Torey Hayden and her quest for higher knowledge to the handicapped and disturbed. She is given the task of teaching a class deemed impossible that is full of misfit kids with bizarre backgrounds of abuse, poverty, depression, and mental handicaps. She fights against the odds to reach the kids on a deeper level, when a seven year old girl with a disturbing past and animalistic behavior is placed in her class to await transfer to the state mental hospital. Torey uses everything within her power to help this girl and break her from submission.Torey Hayden has a style a writing that will not only give you mental pictures of the vast scenarios set forth in this story, but she will also give your mind a ride it won't expect. I'll be honest, when I first starting reading this book my expectations were very low, but once I got into it I couldn't set it down. Torey Hayden has great word choice and can describe any situation down to the detail and still keep the story going. Her fluent, in depth descriptions are beautifully written and kept me engaged through out the whole book.This story, along with its powerful words, has a strong, meaningful message that everyone should read. This story speaks of tolerance for those who are different because they are a direct result of their environment and it is not their fault they act the way they do. It also tells that you should accept peoples little quarks and disabilities because it is what they want to be like and it is better to be different then to blend into a world that does not accept them anyways."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book is great!

What Hayden was able to do was create something so emotional so heart breaking yet hopeful that you almost wish it wasn't true. The events this book touches upon digs deep inside you and pulls out so much more than a peace of fiction ever could. I read this during the summer and I am so glad I did because I would have been able to just read a few chapters and go to bed i would have had to read and then miss classes from a lack of sleep"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One Child was definatly an eye opening book. It was the first book by Torey Hayden that I had read. I have only read her books since. This is the best one that i have read so far.Sheila is a 6 year old girl that has been abused profoundly at home.(both physically and emotionally) She comes to Torey's class as a temperary placement until a spot in the state hospital opened up. Sheila would not communicate in any way with anyone to begin with, but she made durastic improvements as time went on. By befriending Sheila, Torey found out about her past. Sheila had lived a very hard 6 years of life. this included her mom kicking her out of the car on the highway, phycal, emotional, and sexual abuse.This is still in my mind about every day although I read this book over a month ago. If you read one book this year, read One Child."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I will be retiring from the military in 5 years. I have thought about what I want to do for work when that day comes....as I'll only be 39 and still young. What Torey has envoked in me by her book was that feeling I once had. That I might want to teach. To be that one teacher you always remember.....for me, it was Mr. Mathias in 4th grade at Wishon Elementary in Fresno, CA. This is my first review of a book on Amazon, I was so moved. I only closed the cover 2 minutes ago. I was touched by the human spirit, and the power of love. How Shelia broke free from her shell, she was \\"tamed\\", to put it in her own words. I looked at the date the book was originally written....1980. Shelia would now be about 30. I wonder where she is, how she's doing? I was so moved that I know I will be thinking about her in the next few weeks. I love the part about the mysterious colored \\"candies\\" her classmate vomited up at home. I won't tell you to outcome so as to not ruin it. I laughed out loud, though, truly. I originally bought this book to sell on Amazon, but I wanted to read it first. Now, I'm keeping it. I'm glad I have another book by Torey as well."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One Child, written by Torey Hayden, is an outstanding, inspiring book. Sheila, a six-year old girl, was left by her mother on the side of a highway when she was four-years old. From then on, she lived with an abusive father. After an act of violence on another child, Sheila was temporarily place in a class of \\"crazies\\" with other kids that have behavior problems.The amount of love expressed to Sheila throughout her stay in Torey Hayden's class is absoulutely amazing. Hayden shows such patience and determination to not give up on this \\"hopeless cause\\" as the government, others, and Sheila's father, would see her as. I believe this book was written to dedicate it to Sheila for what an impact she had on Torey's life.

I think she is one of the loveliest being ever created & I'm sure Torey would agree with me. Just because, a little girl like Sheila could be TRUE to HERSELF despite the harsh realities of life.Cry if you must, Laugh if you must, Get angry if you must, Love if you must, but never deny yourself of your own light, your own truth...Too many of us live life accustomed to its atrocities & superficiality & monotony that we forget ourselves. We forget who we are, what we are living for & why we are here...I'm sure that Sheila (though she seems like the child that was being transformed by love of Torey) was actually put in Torey's path to teach Torey love & understanding. Taming & growing...I teach children everyday & I absolutely adore each and everyone of them. I see children as lives. An empty canvas that has yet to be painted the most beautiful piece of painting...Thank you Sheila, for teaching me to learn through joy. Thank you Sheila for touching my life with your love.

First six years old Shelia never spoke, never cried, when she looked at you her eyes were filled with hate. She was abandon on the highway by her mother, and was abused by her alcoholic father. Next she was placed in a class for the mentally and hopelessly retarded. This was because she committed an atrocious act of violence on a boy 1 year younger than her. Finally Torey her teacher fought to get through to Shelia. She spent many months trying to find the way through those hate filled eyes. Truly this is a great book, I really recommend this book, and if you want to know more read \\"One Child\\"."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"The main thing about this book is its lesson for teachers that they should not let their initial gut reaction to any child influence the way they treat them or teach them. You never know just how important the smallest things you do may be to some of your students."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is a story about the author Torey. Torey teaches eight challenged kids and one child named Shelia reaches out to you through his book. You learn about Shelia's life and why she needs Torey. Shelia is really smart her IQ is 180. When Shelia first came to this class she was ambushes. She throws stuff everywhere and gets picked on by the other kids. Through the story Shelia and Torey form a special bond together. Shelia wants Torey to be her mom, but Torey says she can't be. In the different chapters you see this child bloom. Something happens to Shelia and it isn't good. Read this book to find out what happens.I liked this book because it's a true story and on every page it touches you. This book make you think? Could I be this kind of person? Could I help a child in need? This book is just really good and I absolutely love it. It makes you read on and on.I disliked this book because it only focuses on one child. I mean it told about the other children not as much as it did on Shelia. Well considering the title says one child it still makes since to talk about one child.I would recommend this book to people that like the David Pelzer series and people who want to teach little kids. Also people would who like to read about little kids and the things that they do. I would also think that teachers should read it because it would help them see what a good teacher they can be.If you like this book try reading the sequel: Tiger's ChildNote: for mature readers"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"One Child is a clear and precise look at a child of abuse-sexual and child. The reeling life of pain and disappointment. The long journey to come to the other side.

I was given his book as a gift and read it in a single evening. I have been where Torey Hayden has been. Her classroom could have just as easily been mine, and vice versa. There are literally hundreds of Shelia's in this country and every fall I get 8 of them. Shelia remided me so much of two of my formner students I had to remind myself that this book was about Shelia and not them. While this is a beautiful book, there is so much more went on in that clasroom that Touet Yaden doesn't mention-remember, she had 8 other studentrs in thhat room who were also ED. I too remember the feeling of relief in seeing one of my students actually cry. Part of the prologue to this book hangs in my classroom as an explination to why anyone would want to teach these children. Anyone who is considering special education as a career NEEDS to read this book. The Shelia's of our world are not covered in any college course, but Torey Hayden does a beautiful job of explaining them to us."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I've never read such a touchable book!Actually I've never read a book written by English more than 300pages,but I could finish reading it in under 3weeks because it was so interesting and amusing.I was taught by this book that there are many many different people who I still don't know all over the world such characters in ONE CHILD.

One Child will touch your heart and is a must-read."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"There comes a point in a person's life where they will fight for one child. Well that's if you work in any of the professions that deal with children. There is just one child who will grab you like no other, reach in, take your heart, and never give it back. This was Mrs. Hayden's one child. Or so it feels. At you can tell the little girl thought her teacher hung the moon.To be honest most people wanted the one thing that didn't happen, a fairy tale ending. Of course this is reality not fantasy so I'm glad she wrote the truth. This book really touched me. It touched me so much in fact I spread it around where I worked and watch it worked it's magic on my fellow employees. They really liked it and it's still making it's way around our worrk."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I have read this book twice and every time I have been moved immensly by it.

I pray that God may continue to bless Torey as she continues to reach out to those in need."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I really enjoyed this book a lot. Not only did it talk about the abuse that a six year old child endured, but more importantly the impact of a teacher in the child's life.

How terrifying to realized what some children must endure, right here in the United States of America. As a college student majoring in elementary education, this book has inspired me to no end. Thank you, Torey Hayden, for your enduring faithfulness to all of the &quot;crazy&quot; children in this world."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book was a sad and true story. It was a heartwarming story of a teacher's love for a student that everyone (including her own family) had given up on. I would recommend this book to anyone!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I found One Child to be an eye opening book. It is about a young girl who the courts have decided to put in the State Hospital, but they are awaiting an opening. As they are waiting for an opening they place the girl in a \\"BAD class\\" where she causes problems throughout the first few weeks. Torey Hayden is the teacher that has Sheila as her new student. Torey and Sheila work together to prove to the courts that Sheila is not crazy. The question is can they convince the courts?"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I absolutely loved this book by Torey Hayden. It was so impresive to me, that I didn't know how to start this review. This story reaches the heart through the unlikely bond between a teacher and a troubled child, a child so troubled she poked the eyes out of the class fish on the first day of school. The emotional bond that grows between Torey and Sheila seems to grow in your heart as well. You feel as if you were a part of that connection as you get deeper into the story. This book teaches tolerance and unconditional love. When you read this book, you feel enveloped in the story, even when you hit some troubling parts. You can also see the story through two perspectives, even though it is being written from one. You know what Torey is thinking, but you can also feel what both Torey and Sheila are feeling. I adored this book, and would reccomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I liked this book. It was good, but a little upseting in someparts. It was truthful and honest. I can see these children and how hard it must be for them. They're isolated and people are so ignorant, I think that that is tragic. Our society is too ignorant.Its amazing how this teacher is really dedicated to this cause and really wants to teach these kids. Its totally awesome how she can relate to them. Shiela is really troubled and she's really difficult. You can see from the beginning that she is stubborn and it would be difficult to deal with her, but Torey does a wonderful job at getting through and dealing with her. ITs just really heartwarming wathing their relationship grow. Its just really nice to see this girl who seems like a devil on the outside open up and reveal her little self. She has dealt with really grown up issues and its really damaging, but she tries really hard to deal with it, and be normal. This is just really heartwarming and inspiring!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"My 13-year-old daughter first read this book and was so moved by it that she encouraged me to read it as well. Like my daughter, I was riveted to this book and could not put it down. The main character, Sheila, just enters your heart and being. You are horrified and heartbroken by her experiences, but inspired by her innate goodness and many other special qualities. Equally so, you are fascinated by Torey Hayden -- the author of the book and the teacher who believed in Sheila so fiercely and never gave up on her. Through Hayden's words, you learn to see past the superficial aspects of Sheila's behavior.My daughter & I went out and bought all of Hayden's other books as well, incl. the sequel to this book.This book is for anyone who cares about, and believes in, children. I especially think this should be required reading for politicians or education administrators who are contemplating the cessation of special education programs!"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This compelling books shows one teachers dedication to make so much more of a troubled little girl. This little girl was never given a chance and her teacher did. Instead of neglecting this little girl like everyone else the teacher brings out the best in the girl to find out she's a genius and not as destructive as everyone else thinks. This book was a page turner and a hard one to put down."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I read this book as a request of a friend of mine. I was not teaching at the time, but was working with troubled children as a social worker. I had been thinking of making a career change to education. After reading this book and all of the rest of Torey's books, I went back to school and got my degree in special education. I have had all of my special ed coworkers read these books and all we can say is that we want more to read from her! I can't say enough about \\"One Child\\" or any of her other books. This book is a must read for any educator or anyone who works with children."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This is a story about a troubled child named Sheila, who was abandoned on the highway by her mother and is abused by her alcoholic father.

I don&#65533;t usually like to read, but I couldn&#65533;t put it down! People know about what happens to children in abusive homes, but they never do anything about it. The teacher in this book, Torey, is different because she cares about the children in her class. She has all the children rejected from all other classes that have turned away. They were rejected for reasons from not talking, to being severely mentally [challenged], to one child, her most recent inductee, who has committed arson. There seemed to be no helping the children until they were finally placed in a loving environment, that of Torey&#65533;s. I recommend anyone with a heart to read it. It will make you laugh, but at the same time want to cry for these poor little children that have had to go through so much already and are so young. It&#65533;s an all around great book."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"I have just finishd reading this book. I have to be honest, I absolutely hate reading. Since I want to go to college this fall, I'm probably going to have to read a lot of materials so I decided one day while I was in my school library that I would try to find a good book to read. I was fiddling around with the computer looking at whatever titles struck an interest. What I typed in was something along the lines of problem child or depression. I wanted to read something on this because of the fact that I am bipolar and before I was diagnosed I was a bit of a problem child. I displayed much of the same behavior that Sheila had displayed. In fact I can somewhat relate to her. I also had been abandoned and abused by my mother and father. I wish I had had someone like Torey too. I connected with this book on a more personal note, but I had never appreciated reading so much in my life. So in that case I say this is the greatest book ever written. This book had me bawling my eyes out. It was really good. I am left wondering however, What ever did happen to Sheila, Where is she today?"},{"Title":"One Child","review":"Hayden brings us into the life of 6-year old Sheila, who came to her special education class while awaiting placementin a mental hospital for a horrific crime.

Torey Hayden is one of the best authors that writes about her own experiences working with special needs or difficult children. This child in the book, Shiela, comes from a neglectful background. She doesn't speak. But Torey works her magic, as well as uses as much tlc and patience with her as she can. It is a great book, but it is sad because you read what this young child has to go through in her young life. Torey also has other books out there too that are about her expereices and learning journeys. There is a followup to this story about Sheila, it is called The Tiger's Child . Both are really good."},{"Title":"One Child","review":"This book is a one night read. It was so compelling I couldnt put it down.

Sheila and Torey becomes great friends and their relationship is very unique between a teacher and student. Their ways gets seperated but eventually they meet again.

I quickly found my seat, but found myself scanning the faces in the room. Who were these people? Sure I thought I knew them...but did I really? This is the situation I found myself in after reading one of the many tense scenes in this book. Heart pounding excitement throughout the book. Yet this easy read also has a tender side. I found myself in a love-hate relationship with Dr. J.P. Mcknight. One minute I would be thankful for his presence, and the next huffing under my breath. Sharon McCoy, the typical girl next door, grabs your heart from the moment you meet her. You will travel a journey with her that leaves a lasting impression. I highly recommend this book.

She had a loving husband, a beautiful home, and a good job in an accounting firm. But, all of that suddenly changes when she makes a shocking discovery. That, along with a secret she has kept turns her world upside down. I don't want to give away any of the plot twists, but this book has some of the most incredible twists. Sharon faces displacement and very real danger as the story unfolds. She faces a mental dilemma as well with her 'mental iv'. Fate plays a major role when she goes to her newfound friend, Doctor John Knight.

There is no basic grammar section in the book even to conjugate the verb \\"to be\\" \\"hona\\" in Hindi. Verbs change in Hindi according to the gender of the person if I am speaking or a woman is speaking. The Hindi print is very small, so a magnifying glass is a tool you might need.

Stuart Pimm's &quot;Balance of Nature&quot; is intended for an audience of professional ecologists and (like most academic texts) demands patient, thoughtful reading, but is well worth the effort.Why influential? Throughout my rather lengthy graduate school &quot;career,&quot; I've been struck by the tension between simple academic ecological theory and the stunning complexity of real-world systems. Pimm tackles this condumdrum by focusing on the relationship between species richness and system stability, explaining why the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.If your ecological education has not already made you suspicious of popular (but naive) concepts of &quot;natural&quot; stability and balance, then this book will open your eyes.

Even at those rare moments when the music appears not quite so excruxiating technically, there are endless harmonic and melodic nuances to take into consideration. Fast, furious, and often seemingly impossible, even the best of pianists have trouble with the genius that is Liszt. That said, this book is my absolute favorite. If you can survive the inevitable shock and frustration which come upon first seeing this book, you will find a treasure well worth all your effort."},{"Title":"Mephisto Waltz and Other Works for Solo Piano (Dover Music for Piano)","review":"This book is excellent because it features &quot;Grand Galop Chromatique&quot;, a piece virtually impossible to find anywhere else.

The curious Kanata opens the casket to find a young man, remarkably preserved. As Kanata wonders if the man is really dead, the man springs up and literally tears Kanata's heart from his body. Kanata wakes thinking it was all a dream until he again meets up with the dark-cloaked being from the crypt.He finds out he really did have his heart ripped out yet due to a powerful sequence spell on the casket and its inhabitant, Kanata now finds that he and the apparent vampire named Kamyu Titi now share one heart and soul. Kanata learns that Titi was sealed in the casket by the priest who raised him on a distant, hidden island. Kanata now finds that that large crucifix is now a powerful weapon that can change it's size to be worn around his neck, and used to battle demons, referred to as \\"walks\\". When several female students disappear Kanata and Titi find themselves having to battle a Shadow Demon. But what do these sudden appearances by demons have to do with the pair? And is Titi a boy or a girl? And how can they find this secret island where the answers will be revealed?Sequence was a very enjoyable Manga which while introducing several supporting characters, mainly focused on the symbiotic relationship between Kanata and Titi. They learn that if one of them dies, both of them will and so, sometimes reluctantly, have to make sure that they cover each other's back. Meanwhile the question of Titi's sex is a running, comedic theme throughout, especially when he/she shows up in a frilly dress because he likes wearing them! Saenagi does a nice balancing act between the dramatic, action, and comedic elements of the story and it defies classification as any one genre. The art is first-rate and for me, much easier to follow than some Manga. Well done and I'm looking forward to the next volume!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"This volume is actually not a one shot, it is actually labeled as Volume 1 but the Mangaka has yet to create a Second arc to this story, and who knows if we'll ever see one.Also, let me get this off the first question you may have, Titi is a boy. It's obvious. But it does come into question among the characters just because he's pretty and cross-dresses. He has a flat chest, and basically looks like any other male character; he has no female figure whatsoever.Sequence was a little basic at the start; it begins as with Kanata at the church. And everything falls too quickly into place but the story slowly even itself out. Titi is a vampire (revealed halfway through the book) who lived with a Priest on a secret island, but the Priest betrayed Titi and sealed him in a cross, the cross that Kanata carries when he releases Titi.Bit confusing? That's how the story goes. Kanata controls the powerful cross that he can shrink when he doesn't need it (like Cardcaptors and Sakura's Sealing Wand).Silly thing was that many of Kanata's 'friends' (I doubt they really are, they don't seem like real friends to me) know about his so-called 'secret' and defeating Walks (Demons) and his connection to Titi. Doesn't make it really special if everyone knows.Yes and this Manga is Slash. The class president even tries to kiss Titi, making it more obvious then some. And it shows more when Titi and Kanata worry about one another but claim it's just the 'Sequence' working.Overall, I think Sequence is a good lighter story. It's not serious to me and more of a lighthearted read. The art is nice and the panels flow. I recommend this book to anymore with a Slash and Goth (toned down) fetish."},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"Sequence was a lot better than I expected. I devoured this in one sitting. The story is more complex and interesting than the summary on the back indicated. An underclassman named Kanade rings the bell of a haunted church as an order from an upperclassman. Kanade falls through the floor and finds a vampire. The vampire attacks Kanade, believing him to be the priest who sealed him. The two are joined in a manner called a \\"sequence:\\" if one dies, so does the other.Titi the vampire is cute and androgynous, though he is also formidable. Sheer delight is how Kanade's upperclassman friends (two HOT GUYS) join forces with him and Titi, and how one of them is turned on by Titi's feminine looks. In fact, Titi is evasive as to which sex he actually is.I cannot WAIT for volume two. The art in sequence is good, but I would have liked some author notes. Maybe next time?"},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"This story is so entertaining. It started out kind of slow and it was a bit confusing in the beginning, but towards the end it really started to pick up. The book says nothing about there being a sequel, but I hope there is because the ending was very inconclusive. But besides that it's a great read."},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"I really like this manga. I just wish the creator could have finished this. I read some scans off the internet after the first book but still, it's not finished. But I do look forward to her other works. This is a very good read!"},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"~3/5[Also available on my blog.]So, I actually kind of enjoyed this book. It was a pretty straight three stars, and I would have liked to read more, had it not been for the fact that this is the first book in a series and I didn't know that. I almost want to rate it lower because of this.Now, my main problem with this being the first in a series, is that the book does not say it's volume one. It does not have a number on it, leading me to believe that it's a one-shot, stand-alone manga. It's not. There's even a bit of a cliffhanger.And this wasn't even a newer release by Tokyopop, like before they shut down; it was apparently released in 2006 and they shut down in 2011. I don't understand why they would have released one volume, without even putting it on the book that it's volume one, when they could have released more. That just doesn't make any sense to me.And there are apparently sixteen chapters, this volume includes six, and the author has maybe stated that the series isn't finished.The fact that I bought this book recently, assuming it to be a one-shot, and found out later that it's actually part of a series, upsets me.And, I don't really have much else to say; don't even know what else to say. I mean, the book was actually a bit interesting; the story line was interesting, I wanted to find out more about Titi and where he came from, this maybe vampire who I'm not totally sure is a boy, and wouldn't mind knowing more about the other characters as well: the main character, Kanata, and his three friends. It didn't leave me dying for more, but it did leave me wanting to know more.But, just, what's the point? It's not all translated online and it was last updated in 2008, and Tokyopop didn't even bother to put it on the book that it's not a stand-alone. It might not even be finished in Japan.I would have liked this book, but the way Tokyopopt went about it just angers me so much; I wouldn't suggest anyone pick it up, just for the fact that you're not going to get any sort of ending."},{"Title":"Sequence","review":"I had been looking for a book to buy in the manga section... And this looked interesting, so I picked it up. After reading it, I fell in love with it!With the action-ish things, comedy... And the pretty boy ((Titi)) which is always needed.. ^__^I hope Ryo Saenagi continues this series! Maybe we'll find out what Titi's sex is...This is a really good book!"},{"Title":"The Fourth Widow (A Carl Wilcox Mystery)","review":"\\"The Fourth Widow\\" is the fifth installment of the Carl Wilcox series. In this mystery, Carl and a substitue cop named Orrie Buford(Joey had his appendix removed in this story) try to figure out who killed a waitress, while trying to clear Carl's name. As the mystery deepens and it is clear someone has it in for Carl, more people die and the motive becomes more clear. Carl finds that the son of one of his former lovers figures into this, and there is quite a climax as justice is brought to the killers."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Often times we forget that it is the women that carry the history of the family. In today's time, filled with busy lives and families living thousands of miles apart, it is easy to lose the family history. But this book is an example of why history is so important and why we should make the time to just be with our sisters, mothers and aunts. The book takes a minor character from the Bible and tells her story. The Bible looks at the life of Dinah only as it is a catalyst for giving up the gods of old and converting to God and the bloodshed that the mixing of 2 familes has caused. But her life did not begin nor end in one moment. This is a very rich book filled with hopes and dreams. It shows us the men of the Bible in a less then flattering light, but also the tenderness that comes from being a husband and father. It is fiction, but I could believe that Dinah, daughter of 4 mothers could have the strength to live even after the horrific murder of her husband and his family. I purchased the book on a recommendation of my sister and thought it would be a light summer read, but it is much more and now our Book club has selected it for this months book. I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When a friend gave me this book to read and I saw the glowing reviews from all the christians on the back cover, I thought, why would someone who knows me, think I'd enjoy such fiction? I see now, she had given it to me as a read that would inspire me spiritually. Whatever your faith, I think this is a worthwhile read. I can see why some believers may take offense at Dinah's characterizations, but remember, it is fiction! I see the bible as enlightening fiction as well, so I feel no hostility by reading a bit more with a feminist slant. It made me remember both the insignificance and the importance of my existance in the world anew. Yes, indeed, thought provoking and inspiring!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is without a doubt one of THE BEST and most satisfying reads I have read in a long long time. I love this book for four main reasons:Whereas many authors(read women) of her generation go on and on with verbose and pretentious dialogue. Anita Diamant simply cuts to the chase and tells it like it is. She only takes 300+ pages to her story whereas most other authors would have taken a story like this and turned it into a door stopper of 1000+ pages.Ms. Diamant is the kind of woman writer I have been praying for. She writes with a forcefullness and a bluntness that I can admire without comming across as angry or self-pity. Which is unfortunetly the case with too many women authors out there. Which is one of the reasons I tend to stay far away from modern female literary authors who write fiction. Her prose is exquisite she is the kind of author I aspire to be.So many authors who write Biblical fiction do it as if they are preaching a sermon on morality. Too many of the Biblical characters are treated as holier than thou and saints. Not as flesh and blood human beings. Who have faults and foibles. I actually picked up The Red Tent as a result of Orson Scott Cards Sarah. I promptly dropped 'Sarah' after being turned off of his characterization of the Egyptians being stupid and hedonistic. While the Cananites (the Hebrews) were pure and upstanding people who could and did no wrong. This is a patronising and condescending (if not also racist) attitude. Not so with Anita Diamant. She shows all the characters warts and halos. There are good members of Jacobs family and there are good Egyptians. Diamant that there are many aspects of the human condition. Yes and even those who are in the Bible. One of the things which I found surprising and original is that the women in the story do not worship El (the God of Jacob) they still adhere to their own gods. I thought that was really original.Normally when I read a &quot;sex scene&quot; in a book I quickly skim past it. But Diamants love scenes are so tender. And so are the men in the novel always attentive to the needs of women (we should all be so lucky!) Diamant is one of the few women out there who can really dish out this kind of scene without it being clumsy or gratuitous.I have only one minor quibble, it is beyond me how/why she saw Joseph(my favorite biblical character) as a homosexual. In all my reading of the Bible and research into other sources I saw no evidence of this. Unless of course one wants to consider the fact that he rebuffed the advances of his bosses wife on account that it was wrong. A terrible stereotype if there ever was one.In short this was an excellent book and will definetly be added to my top ten favorites. Pick it up you won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"To approach &quot;The Red Tent&quot; as a Bible story really does the book an injustice. It's really falls more into the category of a historical novel (though some might argue that the Bible is not &quot;history&quot;).The author takes the basic elements from Genesis, throws in a bit of historical anthropology and a healthy dash of Lifetime Television for Women to create a story that is enjoyable, engaging and thought-provoking.To say that this book &quot;misses the revolutionary nature of Abram's and Jacob's practice&quot; is really missing the point. This is not a book about the roots of Judaism or any religion for that matter. And it's not about Abram or Jacob or Joseph. It's just a story -- more precisely, one based on the &quot;what if&quot; wonderings of an imaginative and learned author.Keep in mind that if they made this book into a TV show, it would be a mini-series not a documentary. Enjoy it for what it is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant has created a masterpiece here. Her prose is straightforward and overwhelmingly honest, and the story she weaves is one that makes the book nearly impossible to put down. Dinah, the narrator, although living in the times of the biblical characters Jacob and Esau, shares the universal sentiments felt by all women today. Reading the book is like being invited into a sacred circle of womanhood, where secrets are shared freely and each person is a member of a greater family. It's a great read and one that leaves you thinking afterwards."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is extremely well written and a tribute to the author. From page one the writer captivates the reader and the story lines get better and more interesting. The author has great insite to biblical history and has fictionalized an intriguing web of characters and story lines. It all ties togather very well. A must read for the avid reader. Put down those dull novels and pick up this great story. I wept for Dinah!!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a fascinating tale of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob and her other &quot;mothers&quot;. Since she was the only daughter she was adored by the women. Her &quot;Aunties&quot; who were also Jacob's other wifes. She was also given the responsability of remembering the women's lives and the importance of women in Jewish society. I'm sure there was research done by Ms. Diamant not only to bring her characters to life but accuracy to make this story meaningful to the reader. It made me realize how we are becoming a people in this country without rituals and everyday civilities that make life rewarding. We are losing what makes life worth living: our interconnectedness with each other and the universe. I have heard complaints that this didn't really happen. No, of course not, this is a novel. Bibical literalists will not enjoy this narrative."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent opened my eyes to the women of the past - whether you are a religious person or not, this story holds true of a women's endeavour in life against all odds. It is hearbreaking, heartwrenching and heartwarming all in one - a truly wonderful story which should be read and remembered by women of all ages and beliefs. I found it to be a superb lesson in the suffering of womanhood throughout time with one who suffered but remained strong - Dinah is one with who we can all connect and admire even though her life is far, far removed from ours at present."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book tells a fascinating tale, to be sure- but it is so much more than that! The Red Tent will leave you inspired by &quot;our mothers&quot;, the women of Biblical times, and celebrating the precious gifts of womanhood."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really enjoyed this book.I read it at one sitting and was sorry when it was done. I would like to see the author write similar novels about other biblical characters. This one actually led me to look up the characters in the bible!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I found the book The Red Tent to be boring beyond belief. I had been told it was interesting from a biblical history veiwpoint and was disappointed with the treatment Anita gave the history of that time. Her telling of the story of Jacob was lose enough I found myself wondering if this was the Jacob I thought I knew from the Bible. I simply wasn't sure I was thinking of the same man she was writing about.I did not intend to read a book that had as its' main focus the monthly cycle of women. I found it simply boring. This is not a subject conducive to excellant fiction!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This author attempts at deving into the Biblical story of Jacob, Leah and Rachel. The Author has Laban as an old bumbling inhospitable person BUT the Bible tells us in Gen 29:18 &quot;he (Laban) ran to meet him (Jacob)&quot;. The author also says that Leah had eyes two different colors, the Bible says &quot;she was tender-eyed&quot; in Gen. 29:17. In the author's version Jacob only worked 7 months for Rachel and then Rachel convinced Leah to go first because she was afraid. Wrong! Jacob worked 7 years for Rachel and because Leah was the older, Laban her father, made a switch and gave Leah first to Jacob and he was NOT happy. He then worked 7 more years for Rachel. The account of this real story is in Genesis 29. This book is not appealing to me, because I know the Bible story, but unfortunately those who do not will believe this is the truth."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book does not qualify as historical fiction; the author's research for this soap opera is practically non-existant. Ex: Dinah was not the only daughter of Jacob, Rebekah was not a witch, and the Valley of the Kings did not exist at the time of the Patriarchs. Her portrayal of Isaac, Jacob and Joseph as ignorant weaklings is offensive to Jew and Gentile. If popular Jewish taste in pseudo-midrash is as lacking in truth and respect for their own patriarchs as this author indicates, it's no wonder that they as a people have suffered diaspora for 4 millenia."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Having read other excellent nonfiction works by Anita Diamant, I looked forward to this novel. Unfortunately, I found The Red Tent to be filled with cardboard characters many of whom appeared to have escaped from various romance novels. The male characters in particular were two-dimensional. It's one thing to dymythologize biblical heroes but shrinking them to cartoon size is overdoing it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm very disappointed how much of the Bible Anita Diamant changed to make up a fictional story. She would have been much better off not using any of the Biblical names and claimed the whole story fictional.It would have been a much more interesting story had Anita told the story how Jacob worked 7 years, not months, for Rachael - his favorite wife (not Leah as Anita claims!!!). Those are the first of many, many distortions throughout the entire book.Several of the critics noted on the cover stated that she did such an outstanding job writing about women that had very few words written about them. That's very true. It's just very sad that Anita didn't bother to use those few words to tell the real story. I've never seen such a secular version of Biblical truth.God warns His followers they are not to change one word of His bible. Evidently Anita must have missed those verses, too!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book for my book club - and I wish I didn't. It is written at about the fourth grade reading level. The liberties this author took with the bible is astonishing! Why don't we just all rewrite history to suit our feminist whims and be done with it!? This was hugely disappointing. I would have preferred she make this a fictional story about that period of time instead of insinuating it is a woman's version of the bible. What dribble, what gall! Consider this a badly written romance novel with a great PR machine out there trying to sell it. Horrible!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In a sense, a biblical novel is a historical novel. The writer must not inject her own theories that run perpendicular to the grain of history or to the Scriptures. A writer of an American Civil War history, for instance, would be doing his readers and history itself a great injustice if he portrayed Abe Lincoln as a pacifist. The Red Tent does just this sort of thing. Joseph married and had two sons, both blessed by Jacob and both becoming patriarchs to a half-tribe of Israel. He was a heterosexual, but Ms. Diamant portrays Joseph as a homosexual. This is not only historically innacurate but offensive to Conservative Jews and to others who take the Torah seriously. Not only is the book not based on good history or the Scripture, it is not a very well written book-- quite boring in fact. I give it one star because the cover illustration is beautiful."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I paid $25+ for this item so the least they could have done was to take off the Goodwill price of $3.06 that was still on the torn, taped up box. Definitely was not \\"like new\\" as it was advertised."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ordered July 2nd - cancelled order 7/14. Took too long to deliver. They did however refund my money."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant is a great writer. The main character's voice is unforgettable and truly entertaining. The fictional account of this character is full of imagination and very well could have happened. But, as to the religious practices, don't seek to find anything Biblical or Jewish about what happens in the red tent. I think the story could have been just as good (and maybe better) if Diamant had stayed true to the Jewish religion. I didn't like how she portrayed Rebecca -- very negative and not fair at all. Again, this was a good story and she is a great writer, but I wouldn't recommend it to my Christian friends."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was very well written and I found much to like in the characters. The one thing I don't understand is why the author felt compelled to rewrite history as far as the men of the Bible are concerned. I can see embellishing a historical person from the Bible....but to totally change the stories and character of strong positive role models (ie: Joseph) didn't make sense to me. She could have used fictional men and made them out to be whatever she wanted them to be. Instead, she chose to alter the characters of what I accept to be real people and made several of them into petty, lustful, lying sloths. And yes, many people in those times were pagans and idol worshippers...and throughout the Old Testament God condemned such practices. I'm sure that some of the women in that time were pagan, but Ms. Diamant seems to portray a polarized religious atmosphere where men worship their male deity and women worship goddesses and the earth. Sigh. Still, I really enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a powerful and beautiful book. I finally understand bibical times from a female point of view. Usually we hear all about the male's role in daily life. Through this amazing book I came to understand life as it was then and now. It is not a book about religion. It is a book about life, love, shame, forgiveness, sin, fear and most of all, hope. Read this book if you want to see the world through the eyes of Dinah. You do not have to even believe in the Bible to believe in the messages of this novel.I know another reviewer said that the author wants us to see this as another Bible. I disagree with that. And once again, he (the reviewer) is a man upset that a female author even tries to make the point that women played an important role during those times.How is it possible that there is so little of them mentioned in the Bible. The words are somewhere just waiting to be heard.This is also a great book club read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Biblical fiction has never been as mesmerizing as it is in this exquisite tale of Dinah, only daughter of Jacob. Anita Diamant's extensively researched epic, twists and turns as readily as the Nile River from whom Dinah supposedly derives her strengths. Adored as an only daughter by loving mothers, betrayed in marriage by savage brothers, forced to bear a burdened cross throughout adulthood, Dinah emerges as a dynamic character of courage and tenacity. The sweeping tale is educational as well as entertaining......the perfect combination. This flawlessly written prose will linger in the reader's mind and heart long after the last page is turned. Dinah's story will never again be just a blurp in biblical text thanks to this most brilliant endeavor!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"But not this one. I read this in two gulps and could hardly tear myself away from it. Being pregnant, some of the birth scenes were a little intense for me but this is one of the best books I've ever read. I despair of ever writing such amazing characters!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent was deeply moving to me. For a long time I have wondered where women's stories are told in the Bible. Anita Diamant has told a powerful story that is many of our own stories as women. She has told it powerfully, in such a way that I felt connected to women everywhere--past and present. I want Anita Diamant to have other women come alive for us as Dinah is for me."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm a midwife, so this book ought to have been a natural 5-star review from me....but I just didn't like it anywhere near as much as I expected to.First, what I liked: I loved the beginning, actually about the first 2/3 of the book, which interweaves known biblical tales with 'facts' and characters of the author's invention to flesh out the story of Dinah, daughter of Leah and Jacob. At puberty, she enters the Red Tent, the inviolate space among the tribes of Israel in which the women gather for menstruation, childbirth, and the initiation of the girls into religious and sexual knowledge. All that was good stuff. And I loved, of course, the scenes in which midwives played a major part.What I didn't love was the last third of the book, in which Dinah is in Egypt, separated from her son, working as a midwife (the only part of this section that I DID like), and living as somewhat of an outcast on the fringes of royal society. I felt this part went on waaaaay toooo looooong, for no purpose that I could discern.Love came at last for Dinah, late in her life, and its portrayal, along with her marriage and married life to a good and loving man, was beautifully rendered. Her death scene at the end was spectacular - think about it: a death scene told from the point of view of the dying person. Masterful.But overall, it could have been a much shorter book and been better for the editing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an intriguing piece of work that makes you understand more of what the women of the biblical times went through. Diamant has mastered the skill of creating a \\"page turner\\"; the imagery she uses draws you into Dinah's story from the beginning, and will not let you go until the very end, which came much too soon. It makes you feel as though you are walking in Dinah's shoes. Diamant brings Biblical characters to life in a way no other has before.I am not an avid reader, but I could not put this one down and will read it again someday. I would recommend this book to any women. If you have ever thought about how women used to live, then this book is for you. The Red Tent is a brilliant novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We recently read this book for our book club selection. Everyone in the group loved it. The discussion we had about the book is one of the best ones we have had in a long time. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was sadly disappointed with this book. It is FAR from historically accurate, and the author seems to be rather fixated on sex and variations of sex. I was really excited to read a book from Dinah's viewpoint, I thought that was a very original take, and I really enjoyed the prologue. After the prologue, the novel's redeeming value ended. I was hoping for something even remotely edifying, but ended up feeling a bit sick. Hopefully someone else will read this review and not bother reading this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book. The back cover made it sound like a wonderful tale with an interesting perspective. Well, what it really was, was continuous tales of sex, sex with other species, incest, etc. I found it repulsive. I cannot find that beautiful or inspiring. I felt like I was reading a kinky porn set in Biblical times.I'm not against sex in books, but this? This was ridiculous.Sorry, I know that some people loved it... I just can't understand why."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book took a lot of liberty with their interpretaion of the life of Jacob in the Old Testement. I do not believe there was this type of sexual introduction to virgin women. I think the author has a large imagination."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Historically accurate and engaging. It helps make sense of the roles of women in biblical history along with appreciation for women. Actually it made the bible stories surrounding this story look more logical."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Since I love the stories about the patriarchs in the Old Testament, I enjoyed the first part of this book. Reading about how the women lived, trying to visualize them as real people, was fascinating. However, as the book moved on, I was disappointed. The main character Dinah is a victum who needs to be constantly rescued. She never stands on her own two feet. Her life is sad until the end when she is again rescued by a man. She never makes an effort to have her own life until a man saves her. I also found the description of Joseph as a weak egotist who needed her to go with him to visit his father Jacob, hard to believe. Also, Jacob was described as illiterate. That may or may not have been true, but was she any better?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"But it is an enriching read that brings to life the ancient ways in which women's &quot;nature&quot; was dealt with in primitive society."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book! The fact that it was based on the bible was a very good idea! You will fall in love with the character and laugh and cry with her!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I JUST ABSOLUTELY LOVED AND ENJOYED THIS BOOK. IT MADE ME THINK LONG AND HARD AND I FELT I WAS THERE WITH THESE WOMEN. I FELT LIKE CRYING WHEN I WAS DONE BECAUSE I WANTED TO GO ON WITH THESE WOMEN IN THEIR LIVES. PLEASE READ, YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was reminisent of Memoirs of A Geisha. If you loved that book you'll probably love this one. Although I'd give both books a 5 for the beatiful imagery and exceptional character development, both books disappointed me by taking on an unexpected romance novel flavor about 2/3 of the way into them.But don't let that deter you. Dinah's voice will move and soothe you. It's a beautifully written book and I'll be anxiously awaiting more wonderous works by this author."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent appears tells an interesting story about a family that could have lived in hte times of Jacob and Joseph. Unfortunately, there are discrepancies between the portrayal of this family and values that would be consistant with prophets of God. Instead of being uplifting and inspiring it was at times dark and discouraging. I would not recommend this read to others."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was disappointed with this book, primarily because it deviated so far from the Biblical account. In fact, there were so many deviations, some relatively small, some major, that I had the feeling the author was trying to write her own version, just for the sake of being different. I wouldn't expect this to be a Christian telling, of course, since the author is Jewish, but this wasn't a Jewish version either. As others have mentioned, she emphasized paganism very heavily and implied that the God of the Bible was only worshipped by males who were too stubborn to see the superiority of the goddesses. I was especially annoyed with Joseph's character who had affairs with both Potiphar's wife and Potiphar, and was made rather nasty at the end. None of the women believed in God, and Jacob was supposedly an idiot because he half-heartedly did, and because he believed he wrestled with an angel and saw visions.From a story point of view, I also got a little tired of the menstruation and childbirth scenes. I did think the prose was well-done. It just was a different story than I had in mind.I think that whether or not you enjoy the book might depend on your outlook. If you think of the Biblical account as a myth and enjoy seeing it from a different perspective, significantly changed, then you would like it. If your view is more conservative (as mine is) and you want the plot to follow the Biblical account, then you may not care for it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent lacks many things that would make it a good book. One of the most important is some sense of purpose. The story is long and, apart from a few incidents, incredibly boring. There are only so many ways any writer can describe labour and childbirth. The main character is colourless and bland. She has momentary flashes of personality but in general I did not care what happened to her. Her aunts are far better developed and although interest in them ends abruptly they hold the first half of the book together. The second half of the book is a convoluted plot to get Dinah to the right place and time to reunit with her once beloved Joseph. By the end of the book I had no interest in any of the characters and was annoyed with the insipidness of the book.As an attempt to flesh out the role of women in the Old Testament the book is a partial success. As a work of literature it falls far short of being a well written and a work of merit."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved this book and cried at the end (and I actually do have a life). I really felt it changed my life and the way I will mother my children.I've never written this about anything before.Though well familiar with the story, I felt the characters and motivations enlivened in surprising ways.When I finished it (at 2:00am) I just wished I knew someone else who had read it to call them and discuss it. So I've been telling all my friends about it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is compelling and riveting. I felt as if I was living Dinah's life with her as she recounted the story handed down from generation to generation, of her family from a woman's perspective. Anita Diamant has done her homework and created a wondrous tale that will inspire and enlighten. A must read for women, and an education for men. I simply couldn't put it down.Betty Kirkland"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Bears no relationship to any actual history of the time period. I just laughed out loud when the author had a Semitic tribeswoman from southern Syria calling on a non-Semitic Sumerian goddess, Ninhursag, for succor. To the author, one female goddess is just as good as another since all are \\"empowering\\" -- geography, culture, time frame, and social history be damned."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The beginning of the books does indeed capture some very good images of female bonding. The storytelling is bland and general but does miraculously infuse life into the female characters. I was very disappointed and horrified at the extreme misguided liberties this book took. Why does the author feel she can blantantly rearrage history to fit this so-so story she told of Dinah? She could have atleast wrote a more interesting subplot to a story that was already half way written. The chapters pertaining to Jacob in the Bible are far more interesting then this narrative which loses steam halfway through.It is also a stereotype to say that only a fundamentalist would object to this book.That is pure ignorance just as the author displayed when writing a very mediocre story. Of what revelance is it if someone sends money in to Pat Robinson when the book is the subject of opinion here?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really loved this book. Maybe because I understand that the story is fiction and only based on the characters of the bible. It is written so well that even I was having dreams of how the story would surface. (dreams are a large part of how this story is played out) Read this book only if you are looking to escape the 21st century for a short time. A little romance, hardship, and a feeling of well-being will surface."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In \\"The Red Tent\\" Anita Diamant uses the voice of Dinah to tell not a biblical story but a timeless story all women can relate to. Dinah, herself explains from the start how she, \\"became a footnote...my story a brief detour between the well known story of my father, Jacob, and the celebrated chronicle of Joseph, my brother.\\" But Dinah's story is told from the heart, and her life seems to be lasting journey instead of a detour.Dinah begins telling of her life in the \\"red tent\\" where she and her four mothers first lived. Due to the fact that I have only read of Biblical times through stories told of and by men, Dinah's story -- for the first time -- painted a very clear picture of the unmentioned yet touching stories of womanhood during that age. But this is not so much a story of Biblical times when told through Dinah's voice. By this I do not mean that women were not important during Biblical times. I mean that I was able to finally read a story about a Biblical female in the voice of one, and we all know that different details and perspectives are brought about through the voice of a woman.I do not consider myself to be very religious, nor do I consider myself a feminist. Yet Dinah's story is more unique and interesting than most stories about a female's coming of age in the early ages. The story of her life is one of mothers and daughters to remember and to pass on...Dinah speaks of her mother, \\"One of my great secrets was knowing that I had the power to make her smile.\\" Isn't that a secret that all daughters want? As Dinah grows up, she learns secrets of life that we all learn as we grow older...the most important one being, \\"There are no secrets to immortality.\\"Dinah's story is a story of love, hatred, betrayal, and, ultimately how we must all learn to live with these things -- and to live as happy of a life in spite of them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In the &quot;Red Tent&quot; you will immediately be pulled into the fictional life of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, from the Holy Bible. Dinah starts out by recounting the stories of her mothers. Yes, Mothers, as in plural. Astonishingly, Dinah's mothers were also all sisters.(This is the Holy Bible?)The author, Anita Diament, let's you feel as these sisters felt when Jacob becomes a part of their isolated lives. Dinah's emotions slowly simmer as she tells of her coming of age and adult life. Perhaps like the current situation in Afghan, this was a time when women had very little control over their lives and were mostly pregnant. As the narrative unfolds, you are elated for the occasional joy or accomplishment.Strange customs are a way of life. Beware. The most often discussed setting of the book is the Red Tent, a tent where women sat together alone from men while they menstruated, gave birth, or recovered from childbirth. This book is filled with ironies. Although it seems such a strange and revolting phenomenon, the Red Tent is a not a place of suffering. It is a respite from hard physical labor and marital demands. Experience the sisterly bonding in the Red Tent as they &quot;celebrate the harvest moon&quot; when they all have their periods at the same time each month.(Can that be real?) Revel at how sisters forced to share one man struggle to overcome jealousy.Though the story is set during seemingly simple times, starring illiterate women who have superstitious beliefs in many gods, Dinah shows us a cynical nature, and we conclude that these women are more sohisticated than most men. Dinah endures, despite brutal events which are, as always, out of her control.In the end, readers feel grateful that Dinah's strange story has been told and may even start to think this is not fiction. Any rock-solid notions about that slice of history being thought of as &quot;holy&quot; are now one huge question mark. This book is like no other."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Our book club read &quot;The Red Tent&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed it. We are made up of Christian women, and while &quot;El&quot; the God of Jacob doesn't act as a character in the book, we found the Jewish and pagan perspectives insightful. Most of us hadn't thought about the harsh life women during Dinah's time would have endured and were especially pleased with the fortifying relationships the women had with one another. I liked the romance between Jacob and his wives and relished the birthing stories. Dinah's encouraging relationship with four mothers inspired me to be more positive with my own daughter. Diamant definitely brings the passions of Dinah to life in a way that the Bible totally leaves out. We found the ending satisfying as well. I've recommended it as a very good read to my friends. Don't expect the typical Biblical characterizations here - Diamant reads deep into the character's circumstances and creates motivations and dialog based on them. A worthwhile read and purchase!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"We recently had a book review at our Temple by the Rabbi. This event was well attended and there was not a person there who did not enjoy this book. The book has some interesting twists and turns. The book is well written, easy to read. The story is thought provoking and may give you new insight and a new vision of Women's roles in Biblical times. Diamant's interpretation of what might have been relates well to areas of the Bible,that are extremely limited in explanation relating to women. Focus on the message of what really is the spiritual and symbolic meaning of The Red Tent. Read it...you will like it....If you are a Biblical Scholar and not open- minded then find another book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant has done what the patriarchs failed to do: give life and purpose to the women of the Bible. This wonderful and delightful tale, told from the perspective of Dinah, is haunting, funny, touching, and most importantly, it's thought-provoking.What if the women of the Old Testiment were Goddess worshippers polytheists who honored the Gods of their ancestors, instead of monotheists as we've long thought? It opens up a whole new realm of women's spirituality that can not be ignored. For too long, we have listened to the stories of the Bible, told by men, about men, and with the perspective of men. The same story told by two different people could very well be two different stories, as evidenced by _The Red Tent_.Those who believe the Bible is 100% true, and not open to interpretation should not read this book. Those who are open to new possiblities can't afford not to read it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I got one-third through the book before I quit reading it. It was not because of the development and furtherance of the Bible story, but I got tired of reading about a woman's time of the month, birthing, adventures with sheep, and jerky men. If the author had taken the story and made it into an allegory or a separate story, but her re-writing of Bible bothered, plus the fact that she made so feminist. Nothing against feminism, but one must take into context the time when this story happened and not compare it to today's standards. There were bad times back then, but there were good times also. Basically, though, I just lost interest in this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The problem with this book is that it takes too long to read. Oh, I don't mean it's a long book or anything: it's only 320 double-spaced pages. Normally, you could knock off a book like this in about three days. What takes so long is that you always find yourself avoiding it; looking for something else to do. Like mowing the lawn or watching TV or something. Or clipping your nose hairs.Go ahead and laugh if you will, but when you get to be my age, this nose hair thing is a real problem. My wife actually had to buy me an electric trimmer. You turn the thing on and it makes a little buzzing noise and you shove it in your nose and twirl it around. The point is, I found myself doing things like grinding away at my nose hairs rather than read this book.It's the story of Dinah, very minor Old Testament figure in the story about Jacob. The biblical story has her \\"defiled\\" by a member of some local ruling family, which caused her family, Jacob's family, to exact brutal revenge. In the novel, this turns into more of a modern-day love affair, with Dinah willing to marry the guy, but, true to the times, Jacob's family kills them anyway. The novel is Dinah's complete story, including the stories of her mothers and aunts.I like the premise of the novel: the Bible would seem to be a pretty good place to mine for historical fiction. And the fact that the author changed the central plot around a little doesn't bother me a bit. It's fiction, by goodness; we expect if not desire this kind of thing.But the writing is so pedestrian and so shallow that it is very difficult to remain interested. The first third of the book is about Dinah's mother and aunts--her \\"mothers,\\" as she calls them, because they all were married to Jacob, and because they all had a hand in raising her. It is written in the first person by her, so she obviously wasn't around for this part of the story, and she relates these events in a the very dry, narrative-summary style. She tells of an event, then shows us what her mothers had to say about it, instead of showing us the event itself. It kind of makes your eyes swim.The pace picks up a little bit when her own story begins, at least to the extent that she shows us events as they occur, but the problem here is that there is nothing new. Oh, she shows her family living in tents, and raising goats and animals. The town she first visits is dusty and large, to her provincial eyes, and there are jugglers and other strange personages roaming around. She describes the Egyptian town she finally ends up in pretty well: there are artisans and masons, and she also gives us a good idea of the food and drink available there. And this is good, but it doesn't take that extra step. One gets the sense that she didn't do more than the most rudimentary research into these times; most of what she relates are such things as one could have imagined right off the top of his head. There is just not enough detail.There is no insight into religious matters either, which is something one might reasonably expect when reading a fictional account of biblical events. For example, Abraham's story is briefly commented upon by one of Dinah's mothers thusly: \\"What kind of mercy [God's] is that, to scare the spit dry in Isaac's mouth? Your father's God may be great, but he is cruel.\\" This is the extent of it. Now you can think whatever you want to about the Abraham story, but you can't deny that there are many interpretations of the meaning of this event. The rather biased, twentieth-century, Marxist view presented here adds nothing. The circumcision thing left me scratching my head also. When Jacob had his first son, all the mothers were horrified that he was going to perform this rite. So was I, for that matter. Which led me to wonder, how in the heck did this become a custom in the first place, 4,000 years before Christ? But nope, no light is shed on this. We learn nothing.In the end though, the overriding disappointment here is the writing style, which is grossly sentimental, humorless syrup. The main characters, all of whom are women, seem to do nothing other than run to each other kissing and hugging and tasting each other's tears and celebrating the love they have for each other with song and dance, especially while they give birth to babies, zillions of them, in events which are described in excruciating detail about every third page of this witless mind-deadener. It is a great relief to be done with it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The only reason a person should read this book is because that person likes porn. I'm not really into porn, so I did not enjoy this book based on that, but rather had to judge the book on other factors.The character development in this book was so forced and poorly done. There was nothing real about the characters, but I guess that's one of the hallmarks of porn.The plot was interesting, but then again, this author didn't actually write the plot, did she?In some of the positive reviews of this book they talk about the beautiful bond between these strong women. In this book we have a group of women supporting each other through various different types of child bearing woes, menstruating together and sharing a bed with the same man, but it fails to take that extra step into something beautiful. I don't know how she could have failed at this.There were scenes in the book where one of the characters supposedly said something \\"funny\\" and all the women in the book rolled on the floor laughing. There was not one single even slightly amusing part of this story...not funny or even charming.Just to recap...if you always wanted to know about Jacob's sexual encounters, then this is a good book for you...If you want to read a good read or even a mediocre one, don't bother and, for crying out loud, don't buy it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a great book. Everyone in my book club agreed on this one. I really must respond though to the women from Ithaca N.Y. She didn't like the birhting experiences of these women in the book. New York woman gave birth twice at home with out any drugs. Well yippie! Try giving birth without your precious telephone next to you, or midwife or doctor (with all the experience that I'm sure you demanded). Try being a young girl of 13,14, 15 or whatever age and not having all the modern day conveniences. Well, I roll my eyes whenever I hear women like New York woman talk about their birthing experience.Talk about uninformed! This is fiction by the way."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a person who has studied the bible for fifteen out of the nineteen years of my life I am slightly disappointed in the author. Her writing is superb and I didn't want to put down the book. However, since most people don't know many of the details of Dinah's story and the lives of jacob and his wives people will get the wrong impression. It is so far from the story in the bible. The book made it seem as though Jacob and Rebecca were two egomaniacal psycopaths who were the only ones on the planet to believe in a single G-d. I thought it portrayed the biblical family in a very disrespectful manner. Even if you don't believe that the bible is accurate Ms. Diamant went a little too far. I comend her though on her writing. Maybe she should have just gone the whole nine yards and use completely fictional characters."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The story that I most enjoy reading in the Old Testament is Genesis' Joseph-a.k.a. Zaphenath-Paneah. However, in good faith I must dispute the portrayal of him in THE RED TENT. It is one that is at best flawed and at worst blasphemous and mind polluting. The author's supposition was this: Joseph was illiterate and a bitter, unforgiving man-especially towards his brothers who sold him into slavery. THE BIBLE, however, states that Pharaoh appointed Joseph governor of Egypt-hardly a position a ruler would entrust to someone unable to read or write. As governor, Joseph's brothers come before him to purchase grain during the famine. Instead of exacting revenge for the wrong done to him, he reconciles their relationship and rescues them and his father-relocating them from Canaan to Egypt. His forgiveness hits the reader with such an emotional wallop that one immediately wants to strive to emulate him. Joseph was, is, and continues to be a paragon of virtue. The author should spare readers from her skewed opinions and stick to the facts of this man's exemplary life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I loved the idea of the red tent when I first heard about it because it was a measure taken to protect the fellowship between women as well as give them a place to recover from childbirth and to rest during menstrual cycles.But what I found in this book was far from refreshing - in fact it pained me to read such a negative account of the events of the Tenakh. Though it is obvious that the voice of women is not often heard throughout the Tenakh, this book went overboard in terms of creating feminist, pagan, backbiting, spiteful characters who don't relate well at all with the men in their lives, nor with the G-d they are in submission to.It was a lewd and thoroughly disappointing read. Not biblical at all, this book should not even be considered close to any kind of a historical account - metaphorical or otherwise."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Unlike &quot;As a driven leaf&quot;, where statements from Talmud were woven in a Midrashic sense into a good entertaining story, &quot;The Red Tent&quot; is more like watching &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;: beloved characters are modified (and sometimes trashed) to fit the authors agenda.Every male character (excluding the rapist, and Esau), are treated with disdain. Abraham is degraded in title, Isaac is a silly old man who has more interest in his hairlip concubine than his religion, and Jacob was supportive of paganism and died senile and incontinent.In the acknowledgment page, the author indicates her relationship to a women's studies foundation, which sheds light as to why the Matriarchs are portrayed as high priestesses of mother-earth worship. (From there, we are given long and exacting details of such worship, something that emphasises one's interest in those areas). In fact, her acknowledgment to Rabbi Lawrence Kushner is simply to Lawrence Kushner, not even giving that man the title of respect.In the book the men never pray. The only prayer we are given is one by a priestess of some goddess cult. Dina discoveres the the world of women is clean and caring, and returns to the world of men which is smelly, loud, and demanding.Joseph is a self-absorbed man whose ability as a dream interpreter was overestimated. Esau was a kind man who only wanted the best for his brother. The sons of Esau who (in Torah) attacked and robbed Jacob were really nice guys after all. Jacob blessed the wrong grandchildren because of senility. Jacob left his father-in-law with only a few things and did not have much wealth, and was embarrassed by Esau's wealth, which is why he wouldn't move in with him.While the author thanks (Rabbi) Kushner for intruducing her to Midrash, it's too bad she wasn't introduced to Torah.My only dielemma is to what to do with this book. After reading some of the other saccharine-laden reviews, I shudder to donate it to the library, lest someone else be inspired by such desecration.Well, trash day is Wednesday."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I read this book and thought it was really good becasue it showed you what it was like a long time ago and how hard it was for women, to have to live.

The women have to go thought so much hardsiph and do things to please the men you will be glad you live to day.

I hope this helps you decied to enjot this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I gave up on The Red Tent, although I was supposed to read it for a book club meeting. Despite the beautiful style, I found it desolate. The womens' plight always seemed so hopeless. I tried, but could not find anything to appreciate about women depicted as property and second-class citizens, lying on soiled straw during one's period, taking a girl's viginity with a piece of wood or vague descriptions of &quot;pleasuring&quot; &quot;animal noises&quot; describing sex, and &quot;his sex&quot; and &quot;her sex.&quot; Worst of all, after we suffer through two-thirds of the book with Dinah, her mate is slaughtered in the most horrible way. This book has a problem--it's trying to be an imaginative account of the Bible, and that may be a contradiction in terms. The author's style and imagination just don't cut it here."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When I finished The Red Tent, I thought I would rate it with 4 stars. However, it still lingers with me after completing it a week ago, so I gave it 5 stars. Dinah, Jacob's daughter is a fleeting name in the book of Genesis in The Bible. Like most women mentioned in the B, she matters only as a brief catalyst, someone who has been &quot;defiled,&quot; an interesting word since even the Bible indicates she adored her princely lover. Anita Diamant blow's life into Dinah just as Eve was created from Adam's rib; but with a woman doing the creating, we get a full blown character with real life images. Diamant's Biblical women really breathe, think, talk, and do interesting things in this beautifully imagined sojourn into the desert with Rachel, Leah, Dinah and other women who silently populate the Bible, a man's book, if there ever was one. I would be delighted, if Anita Diamant took every book of the Bible, starting with Eve, and gave life, from a woman's point of view, to all of the women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I've read the Red Tent twice! That's how good it was. I'm waiting with bated breath for another of Anita Diamants book's. Being named after such a heroic woman made me proud. She brought to light many unanswered questions, which I have used frequently. I now understand so much more of my heritage and am proud not only to be a jew, but to be named Dina. I highly recommend this book to woman and men of all ages and think that this book gives us an explanation of bible theories, without the difficult wording."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Women have come a long way in this world, and I believe it's always important to reflect on where we've been. \\"The Red Tent\\" takes us back to a time when women were a commodity, their main purpose being a child-bearer. The red tent refers to a place where women would stay during menstruation, illness, or after giving birth. It was a rite of passage of sorts, for a young girl to be included in this band of women. Diamant spins a most beautiful and haunting tale of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob. She is only briefly mentioned in the Old Testament, but Diamant elaborates an engrossing fictional story revolving around Dinah, and the women of the red tent who help shape her life. It is a fascinating view into another life, so different from our own, and the descriptions are so vivid, you truly feel a part of it all. I was impressed with the author's knowledge of the times and customs, but what I liked the most was how she brought Dinah to life - her experiences, her joys and trials. This was one of those books that I simply could not put down, even after I turned the final page. A must-read for every woman!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My future daughter in law gave me this book along with \\"The Plot Against America\\" and \\"The Infinite Plan\\" thinking that it would be my least favorite. It turned out to be the one I enjoyed most, (not to slight the other two at all). I was enthralled by the vivid, graphic nature of the lives of Dinah and her family. The intimacy of the women's lives initially made me squirm a bit but as I came to know Dinah's strength and accompanying helplessness in a purely patriarchal society I cheered her triumphs and admired her capacity to endure. I am a big fan of historical novels and this one stands out as the culture and landscape are slowly revealed through Dinah's naive observations and the brutal reality of her times. I feel as though I knew this woman, and admire her greatly."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"When checking THE RED TENT out at the library, it seemed as if it was a departure from my ordinary reading choices. I enjoy romances, mystery, intrigue, historical fiction and humor. I was enchanted with the fact that the book contained all of these. I found that the women's' trips into the red tent were indeed, something of an interest.The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is an engrossing, well-researched story with compelling and believable characters. It is especially gratifying to find a sympathetic, detailed, and believable account of an Old Testament woman's life set in this era and part of the world. The story is told from the point of Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob and Leah, written in her voice. This compelling story brings the women of the Old Testament out of the shadows of the patriarchy and allows us to become intimately acquainted with the matrilineal lineage of Genesis. We are invited into the \\"red tent:\\" the dwelling where women spend their moon time, give birth, and recover postpartum. She is raised by four different women, all wives of Jacob and becomes a midwife. We follow Rachel and Dinah through their careers as midwives. We experience Dinah's sorrow when her brothers avenge the \\"disgrace\\" of her royal marriage. And we follow Dinah into a new life in a new land and her subsequent happiness and fulfillment.The book was a pleasure to read and probably even for non-religious feminist to read. The images are riveting. The characters are memorable. I wish I were a screenwriter because the Red Tent would make a good movie."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I first heard of this book from someone that was talking about it at work, and I remember distinctly that she said, \\"I don't usually like to read... but I couldn't put this book down.\\" That was all I needed to hear. I went out and bought it right away. The book got a tremendous amount of word-of-mouth recognition and I understand why. It's a rare gem.THE RED TENT is brilliantly based on the story of Dinah, Jacob's only daughter. I thought the author did a great job of incorporating the known story from the Bible into the telling of Dinah's story. While the Bible mentions Dinah it gives focus to Jacob's sons. Given that, I thought writing a fictional account of Dinah was just brilliant.While the story is based on a biblical character, the book is more about the bonds of women. I loved reading about the interaction between the four main women of the story that help raise Dinah. The story goes into detail about all things pertaining to women, including childbirth, wifely duties, sexuality, and menstruation. While some may balk at the frankness of these subjects, I felt it added to a story that is uniquely feminine. I feel women from all walks of life (whether you are familiar with the Bible or not) will be able to enjoy their great work of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"In choosing a time period so rarely addressed by historical fiction writers and by focusing her book on the gender the early Old Testament chapters scarcely touch on, Diamant has given her novel a unique perspective. Polygamy creates a most unusual family structure for her the heroine, Dinah , who is blessed with 4 mothers! Exactly how frightening and deadly an event childbirth could be in those days is well depicted in the book's midwifery scenes. The continued mingling of polytheism with monotheism into the second and third generational descendents of Abraham and Sarai demonstrates that the change to montheism was not immediate in the Jewish faith and that there was a mingling of cross cultural traditions in this early time period.Poetic license with its deviations from and contradictions with the Biblical record clearly make this book a fictional account.The effect on the reader is confusion. Which parts were indeed fact and which were fiction? The answers can obviously be found in the original Biblical text or for a more readable accounting- in the chapter called the \\"Rape of Dinah\\" inJonathan Kircsh\\"s anthology of rarely discussed Old Testament stories entitled The Harlot by the Roadside. The really astonishing surprise comes when the most far fetched portions of this novel (which this reader was absolutely convinced were fictional) proved to be true events ! The circumcision of all male inhabitants of a town as the terms of Dinah's bride price and the duplicity of Jacob's sons\\" in inflicting subsequent annihilation on the weakened and recovering inhabitants who had just paid this awesome price- come right out of the pages of Genesis.Cahill's book Gift of the Jews attributes radical changes in Western thinking to the unique concept of montheism which originated in the Jewish faith. This book portrays the early Jews as divided between monotheism and polytheism along gender lines. Only the male members worship El ( oheim) . All females are universally polytheists and even Rebecca, Isaac's wife, is cast as a diviner. Despite cultural intermingling and intermarriages, it is difficult to fathom so a universal a division, especially along gender lines into the fourth generation of Jews. Since the novel focus on women who are all polytheists, the people in this novel hardly seem to be the iconoclastic early Jews Cahill describes.Enjoy this book its glimpses of an ancient world in transition and read it for a good historical rendition of womens' lives - but take this tale with a grain of salt. It is what it purports to be: a work of fiction."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I really can't understand why so many reviewers got so upset about this book.It's NOT an exerpt from the bible-it's a novel!It's a celebration of womanhood and all its mysteries and, although I found the first half to be a bit &quot;bloody&quot; with its very descriptive passages of girls growing into womanhood, the close bonding of these women of different ages is very warming and real and the tender care that they give each other denotes a true sisterhood.I enjoyed the second half more as it seemed to flow a little more smoothly but I'd recommend it to any female of a certain age as a guide to what a real and caring relationship can be between women."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is one of the most fascinating reads that I\`ve encountered in the last 5 years! I suppose that I am kind of its target audience. After all, I\`m female, I love the Bible and history, and I like learning about women in different cultures. But there\`s plenty in this story to interest you no matter what your gender and personal likes [though it does help if you\`re into anthropology a bit]. It\`s all about an ancient Hebrew woman called Dinah, who is mentioned briefly in the Biblical book of Genesis. Diamant fleshes out her tale quite extensively, giving us both an individual woman\`s life story and a well-researched view of an ancient women\`s culture which celebrates every stage of the life cycle. The most vivid and well-written section, I feel, deals with the history of Dinah\`s mother and aunts, which segues into an account of her idyllic childhood spent under their tutelage. Each family member has a special quality or skill which she emulates, and she evantually becomes a talented midwife like her aunt Rachel. In Dinah\`s world, menstruation is not a shameful secret or galling inconvenience, but instead is celebrated as a joyful entrance into womanhood. It also obtains one\`s admission to the Red Tent[although Dinah, as the only girl in her family, is allowed to stay there from childhood]. There is a role for every female in Diamant\`s ancient society. Dinah, Rachel, and Dinah\`s friend Meryt are midwives; her mother Leah is a skillful weaver and baker;Werenro is a singer and mystic. There are disturbing forebodings of how these matriarchal ways will be eliminated and absorbed into the male culture, as in the story of Werenro, raped and mutilated because she serves female deities. But there are also signs of hope that the original kinship among women will be regained. The male characters in the novel also must undergo rites of passage and of emotional growth: for example, Joseph, Dinah\`s half-brother, has to deal with his sense of displacement in Egypt and with bitterness toward their father and brothers. The story is amazing in its ability to get one both loving the characters and enjoying the historical details: kind of like a combination of Alice Walker and Mary Renault. My only major beef with the plot is that the transition from Dinah\`s former life in Palestine to her new one in Egypt is a little too neatly done: would\`nt it have been more of a financial and emotional struggle? But this certainly does not deter from the overall message of the book. Definitely worth reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not since Memoirs of a Geisha (Arthur Golden) have I been so engrossed in a novel. Ms. Diamant's telling of a story that dates back to the days of Genesis is so moving. Her style of writing pulled me in to the story so that I felt I was truly there with Dinah living through her each emotion and feeling.I've know the story of Jacob and his twelve sons since I was a child but never heard any reference to Dinah his daughter. Ms Diamant's story of Dinah's life was woven to such perfection that I wasn't sure what was fact and what was fiction. I've actually gone back to the Bible to read the story of Jacob again.I think what also makes this novel so fascinating is the setting and time the story takes place. There are few novels that take place this far back in history and it is evident the reseach that was involved with the writing of this book.I highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. Plainly spoken, it's just a great story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I picked up this book because I love reading stories about lesser known people in the Bible. I was disappointed when I finished this book. I was expecting a biblically accurate novel, instead I got what I believe to be a feminist, anti-Bible account. For example, Dinah was portrayed by the author as a woman who had premarital sex. In the Bible she was raped. In the book she was portrayed as more &quot;enlightened&quot; than her relatives when she chose a goddess over God. If you appreciate accuracy, then you will dislike this book. If accuracy doesn't bother you, then you will probably like this book. One thing this book teaches you (maybe the only thing) is that you must *always* check the facts."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Old Testament, Genesis saga of Jacob and his family is transformed by Anita Diamant into a powerful story of one woman. Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, mentioned in the Bible maybe only once, is the central character and the narrator.Dinah recalls the events from the time before she was born, how Jacob came from Canaan to Laban, fell in love with Rachel and worked for Laban to marry, eventually, Laban's four daughters: Leah, Rachel, Zilpah and Bilhah. Each one is an unique woman and possesses strong characteristics.The women's domain is the red tent, where women spend their time away from men, being it menstruation, childbirth or post-partum rest and bonding with the newborn baby. The feminine rituals strengthen the bond between sisters, and Rachel, who is a midwife, is admired by many. The women rejoice in their family ties and support, in feelings towards each other, and in tradition, as they worship ancient gods.The midwife profession is the one chosen also by Dinah, and after the clan moves back to Canaan, Dinah becomes Rachel's apprentice. She is moved by the personality of her grandmother, Rebecca, the priestess and oracle. When the family moves on again, because there is no place in Canaan foe both Jacob and Esau, they settle close to the palace of the Egyptian king, which ultimately brings the disaster and Dinah's estrangement and separation from her brothers and beloved mother and aunts, and ultimately her exile to Egypt and completely new life.Dinah has to fend for herself, when she does not have family women by her side, but she does it exceptionally well and at the end leads a successful, fulfilled life. She experiences everything throughout her adult year, from friendship, hatred, forgiveness, physical attraction and deep, mature love for a man, maternal love, professional satisfaction and respect of others.\\"The Red Tent\\" is not a book to be analyzed in literary categories; it is perhaps not even that well constructed and not novel in form. It has to be read with the heart, not with the brain. Besides being a biblical story told from a different point of view, it has a deeper meaning. Anita Diamant manages to move the reader, to evoke strong emotions, and to write about women who are strong and confident in their natural role, who can find happiness and to develop fully their abilities and characters. In this respect, it can be called a feminist book, although it represents the strength of women who do not fight for men's rights, but rather manage to be the best in their \\"conventional\\" life, to became matriarchs and to possess knowledge unfamiliar to men. The women admire other women, they are best sisters and friends and they believe in feminine power (however simplified it soiunds). Nevertheless, the novel tries also to be objective and contains criticism of both men and women. It moved me deeply and I could not put it down until the end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think Anita Diamant did a great job with this story: She took a character that had no more than a \\"walk-on\\" part in the bible and ran with it. She did her research, gave it a lot of thought and imagination, and wrote out a beautiful and wonderful, yet highly fictionalized story of Dinah. Nowhere have I ever read that Ms. Diamant touted this as a true to life biography of any of the characters.I loved this book. I took it completely as a story of strong women, the strength they found in each other, how they (possibly) loved and (possibly) lived. They lived in a hard, dangerous time but in many ways better. I for one, would love to take 5 days off per month from work, husband and kids and hang out with my girlfriends; who wouldn't? But what will probably be most memorable for me in this story was Dinah's relationship with her mothers. Dinah loved them all equally, and vice-versa. Dinah took through her life lessons from all four women. We should all be so lucky.Yes. At times this story is bloody. At times it is violent. Obviously, couples had sex, even way back when. Midwives assisted in bloody, violent births that sometime ended tragically. Yes. Men in this book were maybe portrayed as chauvinistic, demanding animals. But I think it probably wasn't that far from the truth, say, 4000 years ago! Look at the time and circumstances they lived in. Don't forget. Women weren't even allowed to vote in US a mere 70 something years ago and that still goes on in the world today.Don't read too much into this story. Don't take it as gospel. It is fiction, and I believe it has been honestly portrayed as such. If you can't resist a wonderfully written, well-researched story with beautiful visuals and well-developed characters, this book is second to none. Read it, then borrow it to your girlfriends and or mother, then talk about. It makes for great discussion.I love a good NOVEL. This is one of my top favorites. I enjoyed it for what it is."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoy books that have historic themes, teach me about different cultures, and make me feel that I'm actually a part of the story. With The Red Tent, Anita Diamant succeeds on all three levels. I really felt like I was in the middle of this story with roots in the Old Testamant.The Red Tent is seen through the eyes of Dinah, daughter of Jacob and granddaughter of Isaac. Jacob was a herdsman, and life was not easy during this period in history-especially for women. But one thing the women of this story do have is the gift of sisterhood. In this respect, their lives are rich. And no where are their bonds as close as when they occupy the red tent-something done once a month (during menses) or during a childbirth. Many may look upon the red tent as a confinement. But the women look forward to their three days and three nights spent there each month. They would gossip, share secrets, and pass along their stories to a younger generation. They celebrated their gift of giving life and gave offerings for this gift to their gods. They also assisted their fellow sisters in childbirth. Jacob had four wives, so Dinah had many mothers to dote on her and teach her the secrets of being a woman.What I found fascinating about The Red Tent was the window it provided to a past culture. We learn what they ate and what they drank, where they lived and how they dressed. We also see the diseases they suffered from, how they died, and the gods they worshipped. And since Dinah became a midwife, we get a glimpse of childbearing techniques. We also see different areas as the characters travel from Iraq to Israel and finally Egypt.The Red Tent is a work of fiction, and should not be looked upon as an embellishment of the Bible. Dinah is barely mentioned in the Bible, and the fictional Dinah tells us that it is up to daughters to tell their mother's stories. The Red Tent is Diamant's vision of how Dinah's life could have played out.What made this book even more fascinating is that I also recently read Dan Brown's bestseller, The DaVinci Code. While The Red Tent celebrates the feminine gifts of giving life (the sacred feminine), the premise of The DaVinci Code is how the early Christian leaders did everything in their power to suppress the sacred feminine. While neither book should be taken as gospel, reading them so close together made for an interesting contrast.Diamant is a talented author, and I look forward to reading more of her works."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel was chosen by my bookclub and the overall opinion on this one was that we all enjoyed it. As none of us were terribly familiar with Dinah's story, I did feel compelled to read the chapters in Genesis for the original version. It is obvious that Ms. Diamant's &quot;story&quot; is just that, a fictionalized version of what MAY have happened to Dinah. Just because it is not biblically accurate does not mean it is not a compelling read. We all were impressed by the sisterhood between the woman, it's not often you read about women's cycles with such positive and beautiful prose. Kind of makes you wish for a Red Tent of one's own to hang out in for a few days each month. Now the childbirth issue is another entirely, as someone who had a very difficult delivery it makes you realize how lucky we are to have modern medicine around if we need it during childbirth. In conclusion if you are looking for a historically accurate interpretation of the bible, you will likely be disappointed, however if you are looking for a fascinating and and well written story you will find it here."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book deals more with relationships between members of a patriarchal group - one husband, two &quot;primary wives&quot;, two &quot;secondary wives&quot;, lots of children - than with plot. Half of the book deals with the various relationships, giving birth, midwifing, husband/wife relationships, etc. The second half deals with the main character, Dinah's, life after some momentous events of upheaval in her previously ordered existence. I think the book successfully captured the feel of the setting - ancient Rome and Canaan. There was much about the society, lifestyles, religions, etc. which were interesting and compelling. Overall, I'd have to say that I enjoyed the book quite a bit, but it didn't live up to the rave reviews some acquaintances (female) have given it. However, if you are interested in &quot;female&quot; issues, like giving birth, mother/child relationships, wive's roles in a male-dominated ancient society, you'll love this book!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a GREAT historical read. Thought provoking, and character driven, Diamant has written a truly remarkable piece which belongs on everyones bookshelves.I loaned my book to a friend, who in turn loved it, and bought a copy just to keep, and has since loaned it to another friend...this is a heartwarming tale (but at times heartbreaking) that makes you realize just how hard life was on woman way-back-when."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is such an excellent book...you really feel like you know the characters and it is a very interesting read all the way through. Other readers seem to have problems with the fact that the stories vary so much from the Bible. If you want to read the Bible, by all means do so. But if you want to read about what life may have been like for women of this time, read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I am writing this in response to the woman who said she was dissapointed in how far the story deviated from the Bible's account. It is true that it is very different, but it is a novel based on about one paragraph in the Bible. You should read this book as an unique story about culture in biblical times not as an expansion on a Bible story. I loved reading about how women lived thousands of years ago though I agree that it was slightly irritating that Jacob is portrayed as kind of a jerk and his son's as demons."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"There are some books you simply want everyone to read because you know it will enhance them, change them or simply move them. That is why I decided to write this review. .... The Red Tent by Anita Diamant is simply breathtaking. I cried from beginning till end. It was like diving into a sea of poetry, a river of song. It became my story and I know it will become yours. I have never felt closer or more familiar with any other woman like I felt to Dinah. In her mothers I saw mine. Whether the story is true or not is simply irrelevant. The possibility of truth is enough. The alternative provided to the Book of Genesis where Dinah is simply a footnote is enough. I applaud Anita Diamant for writing something so brave and so very beautiful and I plead you all to read it, just to pick it up and try. So that Dinah will be a footnote no more."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Not only did Jacob's family become real to me, I felt privileged to travel beside Dinah as she wove human element into biblical characters! Excellent read!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I just finished reading this book and will miss it! Dinah will open your eyes and your heart to life, love and death. The stories between fill in the details. A wonderful book to read. A wonderful book to recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was involved in Wicca for over 20 years, read Mists of Avalon and many other similar literary works with pagan agendas during that time, and got the same distinctive (and unpalatable to me now) flavor when I read this novel. The goddesses are named repeatedly and fondly, so I feel certain many of the other one star reviewers instincts about this being a pagan piece are spot on.MUCH better stories about women would be the excellent works of Francine Rivers that flesh out Scripture with a satisfying and godly ring of truth:A Lineage of Grace: Five Stories of Unlikely Women Who Changed EternityandRedeeming LoveBlessings with love,Shalom ShickSavedXWitch*com"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I think historical fiction is taking an actual event,time, etc. in history and making up a person, people, etc. who may actually have lived in those times. The fashion now is to take history and make up your own facts and people. The problem is that there are lots of people out there who take these historical novels as the truth. But the Bible actually was written about people who actually existed and tells their stories and about the Chosen People, God, etc. I actually have a problem with making up people who didn't exist or have biblical figures do things that aren't in the Bible. You know, it isn't called the Holy Bible, the Gospel, the Truth, etc. for nothing."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"What a tiresome read! Endless and boring. I don't know what all the hoopla is about."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was a good story, even with the too strong anti-male tone. Even that wouldn't have been so bad, had the author not chosen to base this story on real people. I would've rather her have completely made up the story, including the characters, rather than trying to tie it in to anything that actually happened or anyone who actually lived."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The hype surrounding THE RED TENT is not justified. Seeing that the author was Jewish, I expected her to weave an intricate story incorporating the details of the women in Jacob's family. What a disappointment and lost opportunity!Diamant penned an interesting tale, but she never let the Genesis account get in the way of her story. The idolatry practiced by her characters was overdone and often disgusting as other reviewers have mentioned. The family line of Jacob is incorrect as Bilhah was the mother of Naphtali, not Leah. Her account of Rachel's death barely got a mention though it was significant for the family. I was particularly appalled that she turned Dinah's rape into a consensual love act. Not recognizing that after Reuben, Simeon and Levi did great wrong, Judah was the next brother in line to take the mantle of leadership. Diamant did not include Judah offering his life to Joseph in exchange for Benjamin, forever sealing his leadership among the brothers which was later confirmed by Jacob's blessings. I doubt Diamant would have understood the significance of such an offer as it foreshadowed another life exchange from Judah's descendant, Jesus.The shame is that with her writing talent, Diamant could have produced an outstanding novel with rich characters while holding fast to historical and Scriptural accuracy. This novel elevates paganism and idolatry using Biblical characters who would certainly disagree with how they are portrayed.I rarely discard a book, but this one is headed for the trash bin."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"First of all, I HATED this book. It looked \\"Christian\\" on the outside but was FAR from it. Leah wanted to abort, Rachel miscarried repeatedly, Jacob and the boys raped the wild animals. This is a gross misrepresentation of Biblical truths."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One cannot deny that Diamant is a gifted writer. I agree with another reviewer who compared this book with Zimmer Bradly's The Mists of Avalon (complete with the goddess worship, and revisioning of traditionally viewed &quot;bad&quot; characters). It may have been Diamant's intention to subvert the Biblical text. She succeeds in doing this. The foremothers are goddess and idol worshippers; the forefathers'connection with God seems to pale in comparison. The only men presented in a positive light are ones who the bible clearly sees as negative. Dinah only finds happiness when she leaves the monotheism of her family for the pagan worship of the Egyptians. While other reviewers are anxious to share this with their daughters, I am not anxious to tell my daughter that the foremothers merely put up with the monotheism of their husband but remained worshippers of idols."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a disappointing distortion of the biblical facts of Jacob and his family. If you are Jewish or Christian this book can easily offend you. The idea of an historical fiction is meant to take the historical facts about a person and then embellish the details about their true historical story without changing the spirit of what we already know. This book did NOT do that. It took the biblical facts about Jacob and his family and changed them from a family who worshiped the God of the Bible, the God of Abraham in to a pagan family. The information about the customs and communities of Jewish women of that time period could have been very interesting if the facts of this story had not been butchered."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Who decided some of the most disturbing stories of all time (We're talking just as troubling as &quot;Salo&quot; or &quot;Caligula&quot; here!!) should be read with all the bizarre (almost perverse) cheeriness of a muffin ad?!! This isn't a margerine ad or a ring around the collar treatment-it ruins the whole story-you're so transported by this manipulative ad tone that you lose the story somehow! Where do they find these people?"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My mother passed along this wonderful novel and (I hate to admit this) after ignoring it for a few weeks, I finally picked it up on a rare, quiet evening and quickly became entranced with the vivid characters and enticing story. This beautiful novel is a celebration of women, motherhood, family and faith. Although I abandoned my Christian upbringing long ago, it inspired me to re-read the Biblical passages that describe Dinah and her family and made me feel connected to a long line of brave and loving women who sacrificed everything for their children and their faith. Very inspring. Don't make the same mistake I did and hesitate to pick it up - just read it. I promise you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant's The Red Tent is a rich, believable companion to the already familar tale of Jacob & CO. found in Genesis. After being somewhat familiar with the rags to riches tale of Joseph via the \\"Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\", I was really excited to expand my understanding of biblical \\"truth\\" especially with a story focused completly on the women in this society. After all, women have always carried the codes of light, the often neglected feminine mysteries of the life force. The Red Tent does not disappoint anyone seeking an invitation to sit with his/her inner anima. This book feels channeled. The voice of Dinah reads as if she knows that she has been given an opportunity to share with the reader a missing fragment of truth. What truth? That these stories of the feminine need to be reclaimed and brought out for us to hold an even more balanced understanding of the truth that the essence and energy of woman is sacred. Dinah and her mothers share the experience of the feminine in the red tent. It is a place that honors the sacred mysteries of women: birth and death, the cycles of the moon, and Goddess worship. The Red Tent is an intimate world of love and loss, hope and tragedy. You'll will start to befriend all the characters found within and the distant past soon will seem not as unfamiliar as you may have orginally thought. I read this book on the beach. I read it for hours at a time. It will engross you to no end. Diamant is a wonderful writer. The language she uses to describe the daily life of shephards, farmers, slaves, and midwives is natural and unique. I laughed and smiled at the details given, cried at some points too. The Red Tent is a wonderful book. It reads true to me. I'm glad I've expanded my understand of biblical times while being throughly entertained at the same time. The Bible is a boring read, this isn't in the least."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Told in Dinah's voice, The Red Tent is a story about this biblical figure's life journey. Anita Diamant elaborately transforms a short excerpt about Dinah's tragedy from the Bible into a captivating story. Although the story is fictional, Diamant successfully changes it into a credible memoir of Dinah.Because the story is based on the Book of Genesis, most of the major events are predictable. Yet, the reader is lured to the details and reasons behind these incidents, because the author tries to provide the reader with a convincing explanation to the tales in the Bible. Diamant also cleverly alters the events in a way that is difficult to oppose, thus making the novel more believable. In addition, she gives life to the biblical figures who have no personality and little emotions in the Bible. The humanization of these characters furthermore adds credibility to the novel.Another significant component of the story is the bond between women. The Red Tent is the foundation of sisterhood between women in the ancient world. It is the place where women trade stories, share secrets, support each other during childbirths and cycles of menses. Because of the Red Tent, the bond between the female characters is extremely close. Despite the fact that these women may have to share a husband or that they may have different social status (some are slaves and lesser wives), they still treat each other equally and take care of each other in the Red Tent. This strange unity in the women's society definitely fascinates the reader.Moreover, Diamant also explores the roles and status of women in the biblical world. This is a particularly interesting aspect, because although women are considered to be inferior to men, they are still respected in the ancient times. They are responsible for all the chores in the house, like brewing, baking, and weaving. They are not allowed to sit with men during meals and are viewed as unclean during their monthly cycle. Yet, in many cases, they enjoy the freedom to express their opinions. For example, Jacob always asks for Leah's advice before making important decisions. Women, like Inna, who have professional skills, are even highly respected in the male-dominated society. Although women do not receive the same treatment as men do, they do not resent their gender. In fact, they perform rites to celebrate the first menstruation and childbirths which are the symbols of their sexuality. I believe that their pride in their gender is probably one of the most interesting and unique aspects in the whole novel.The Red Tent is certainly an excellent novel. It is so realistic that it seems like a historical fiction depicting a truly living ancient world. The story itself is original and captivating, because it is based on a Bible tale and takes place in the ancient times which add a mysterious enchantment to the novel. Most importantly, the Red Tent is very original, because it depicts the ancient world from a woman's perspective. The novel gives a voice to women who have always been neglected and muted in history."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book is for you if you are female, Jewish (not required, but probably helpful, or else very interested in Biblical history), and if you have ever had your heart broken. This book will wring you out and stand you back up again.

When I bawled my eyes out at the end and couldn't stop, it wasn't because I was sad or even because I was happy. It was because this book brought me so much closer to all of my mothers mothers than any other single experience or piece of literature in my entire life.&quot;I do agree with the one review that pointed out that the male characters in this book are a bit two-dimensional.

Those who are angry with her for taking license with a biblical story need to calm down. In the disclaimer she admits it all came from her imagination. Why so much anger? Everyone who reads the bible will come to their own conclusions about the missing pieces. Her writing her conclusion down isn't blasphemous. It's her opinion. It's her bringing those times to life through her eyes. I thought it was a beautiful book. For those of you who are hesistant to read this because you might think it's a book about religion, do be afraid. It is simply a tale about a girl, her mothers, and her life."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Well, it's often hard to find a unique book...this one fits the description though!I admit i thought it would be boring- but it's not.

I love Biblical stories and I want Anita to write another."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant spins an excellent tale using very little information. Though her father and brothers are given enormous credit and favor within the Jewish nation... Dinah, like many women was glossed over. The only downside is was difficulty rendering what is fact and what was author created fiction without refering back repeatably to Genesis."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"At the risk of sounding sexist, I think this is a fine novel which will appeal to women of all ages. It is finely written, and thought provoking, and has all the real flavour of biblical times and places. But it is a novel of women, written by a woman, and in my opinion with the intention to be appealing to women.I sought out the relevant passages in my Bible, and there they were, just the bare bones of the story as Dinah suggests at the beginning of her narrative. But let me stress, this is the author's FICTIONAL fleshing out of that tale, and to all of those who may be looking for more, you will not find it.What you will find is a riveting tale of women living and loving in difficult times, but coping with humour and wit and grace. It is a very entertaining novel, and I recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Very interesting read. I cannot put it down!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"After reading the 5 star reviews on the web, I purchased the Red Tent. Being a lover of historical fiction, I thought I was in for a real treat. I guess I just don't get it because I had to force myself to finish this book. I got into the characters alright but halfway through the book they were gone. The part that had the most profound affect on me was when Dinah had to accept the fact that she would always be distant from her son. I think it is since their life and customs are so unfamiliar to me that I found it hard to follow. I'm not familiar with a lot of Bible stories."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I can only echo the words spoken by all those who reviewed this wonderful novel before me: it's captivating, refreshing and truly enjoyable. Having read so many disappointing books recently, it was such a treat to read a book where you care so much about the main character, where you really feel you know the characters - major and minor, and where you find yourself thinking about the book when you're not reading it. Done well, it can be very interesting to read an author's take on a well-known story or event told from a different vantage point (think John Gardner's Grendel). Ms. Diamant did an excellent job creating the historical times of the Bible but letting us see those times through new eyes and hear about the those times through a new voice. I am so pleased to have read this novel and highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was a marvellous story that both my mother and I absolutely loved. It really brought to life the characters it portrayed, and I was given a brilliant view of one of the periods of life you hardly ever hear about.

If you've ever been a daughter or a mother, this is a book you need to read."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Boy, am I in a tiny minority of the customer reviewers who gave this book a low rating. To me, Daiman's tale is nothing more than wordy hokum. I struggled through about a fourth of the story, and was so distracted by the stilted writing and the simplistic characters, I just gave up. Maybe it's something at this stage in my life that throws me into the negative camp. Could it be I'm getting old and cranky?(...)"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"While I thoroughly enjoyed the vivid characterizations and appreciated having a context in which to place some of these hard to remember stories of the Old Testament, I found the discrepancies between fact and fiction disconcerting. Diamant makes the disclaimer that all characters are fictitious but clearly she has borrowed facts and characters from history embellishing and altering along the way. Perhaps this would not be troublesome if all of us had a firm handle on what the historical facts and details from these stories are but sadly most of us are lacking in that area. Read the book and enjoy her obvious literary talent but consider reading the book of Genesis simultaneously if you are interested in maintaining historical accuracy on some significant issues."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I enjoyed reading about the lifestyle of people during OT times, but felt, as many other reviewers have noted, that Diamant is a somewhat lazy writer. The book is entirely written from the point of view of Dinah, daughter of Jacob, and yet she uses contractions and cliches that would never have been spoken by a woman of the times, such as \\"...he preferred the garment his mother had made for him over the dull (stuff) that men were given to wear. I (couldn't) tell if he was (putting on a brave front) or really liked his finery.\\"You could give her the benefit of the doubt and say she wanted the character to relate to the contemporary reader, except part of the time she does speak in a more structure tone. This amateurishness is really inexcusable, coming from a published writer. That said, I enjoyed the book for the most part."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"My very favorite bible story was always the story of Joseph. This book absolutely made the story come alive for me. I understand that it is fiction but it is a brilliantly written saga that breathes life into characters that were faceless names. \\"The Red Tent\\" is wonderful. I laughed and I cried and I breathed in the dust and water of a land far away. Don't miss this wonderful story."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is a pretty good idea of what women were treated like and how they lived in Biblical times. If you can get past the first chapter, the book gets intensly interesting and makes it hard to put down. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I must be nearing my tenth go through this book but I've never actually written a review. I have, however, marked it with five stars in more than one locale. Diamant's main character is Dinah and is based on a briefly mentioned Biblical figure who is the only daughter among Jacob's numerous children. Dinah grows up with four \\"mothers\\", one her biological mother and the other three are aunts (all are half-sisters and all married to Jacob). The titular red tent is where the women retreat during their periods. Dinah does eventually leave her mothers but she remains very tied to womanhood and she becomes a very skilled midwife. The story follows her from childhood to old age and imagines a side of history that is largely unwritten because most written accounts are from the male world.I am enchanted by this book every time. The women are all very different and each has her own strengths and foibles. Dinah revels in a lot about womahood but she also is limited at times by the roles it brings. The book shows relationships with amazing depth including those with a parent, the relationship among siblings (including sisters sharing a spouse and with Dinah and her brothers, esp Joseph), female friendships, mentorships, and romantic love. There is so much detail and richness. The book shows women celebrating womanhood and enjoying the secrets of their world, a place that men seem to fear.Five stars, no questions. Definitely oriented to women and I truly don't know how it might feel to someone who is very religious given the Biblical ties. For me, I feel like I've visited a friend every time I read this book."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I'm not a Christian, so I was a little nervous about reading a book based on biblical characters. I decided to give it a chance since it came so highly recommended from a co-worker. I couldn't put this book down! I absolutely loved it and even though its based on biblical characters, it really has nothing to do with religion. Its just a great, powerful story about women and the struggles they go through in life. It has become my all time favorite book. I was honestly sad when I finished because I wanted to keep reading more about Dinah and her family. Definately a book I will read over and over again!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I was disappointed to find that this book was advertised as new but is not new. The name of a previous owner is written on the flyleaf and the edges of the pages are yellowed. Since the book was for myself, I kept it and read it. I would have returned it if I had bought it as a gift. Buyer beware!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The portrayal of the women from this time period was insightful and seemed accurate, but the Biblically based story didn't follow Biblical facts too closely."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Diamant has woven a masterful story, fictional, but with obviously well researched history of Old Testament culture. It's fast-paced and filled with drama, so that every page demands that the next page be read. Too earthy for some, and definitely written with a feminist bent, but highly entertaining and apt to place on the Biblical stories of Jacob's family a new cultural perspective that will forever enhance Old Testament understanding."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Perhaps I am bringing to The Red Tent a set of experiences and expectations that is not the norm revealed in these reviews. As a secular feminist, books that explore the way patriarchal monotheism has stunted the lives of millions of Jewish, Christian and Muslim women are interesting to me. I am drawn to narratives that explore the boundary between myth and dogma. In Dinah's story, I found a neo-mythological account of how the capacity of women to create and bear life was diverted onto the one-male-god model. And the novel left me feeling satisfied that Dinah recognized the resulting impoverishment this misdirection among the descendents of Abraham caused. The Red Tent left me with a wistful longing for a re-balanced world in which women control their own fertility, where trinities have mothers instead of ghosts, and plurality in worship is the norm."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The Red Tent is an inspirational story from biblical times.

I had never read a work of historical fiction before, and I was immensely impressed by the cultural details, which when combined with a passionately written story of the rich, emotional lives of Dinah and her mother and aunts, make for a stunning, tragic, and ultimately inspiring book. I recommend this novel to any woman, and any man who cares about women's issues."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Great Story of Women and how they used to gather at times of menses in a \\"Red Tent\\" but the story is about so much more like the stories of each of their lives and what being a woman in their day and age entailed.

I found it interesting as I read the book that I realized much of the traditions and \\"sisterhood\\" of biblical time still exists in my family.

The Red Tent was a gift to me in that it not only was a marvelous book, but it reminded me of the great love my own family has for eachother, despite distance and time, quarrels and misunderstandings. I have never been so proud to be a woman and a sister as I was when I read this book and enjoyed the company of my own sisters.Meghan WierConfessions of an Introvert: The Shy Girl's Guide to Career, Networking and Getting the Most Out of Life"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This subject was not a typical choice for me.

Oh how those two years were wasted, my life bereft of knowing this amazing tale! This book had me captivated by page one. Anita writes beautifully, with the perfect amount of description, heart, thought and action. At times there are years that pass in the subjects life, told in a matter of sentences, and yet nothing is lacking. I am not religious at all, and I adored this book. This is a rare glimpse into what life was for women in these times. The heartache, the connections with the earth, the multi theistic way of worshiping all of these random gods, the way death was a part of daily life, the food, the deep love and unions they shared with other women- all of these elements are intensely woven into a stunning novel that will have you glued to this book.

Much to my surprise, I couldn't put this book down.I found The Red Tent to be an interesting perspective of a well-known Bible story. I was fascinated by the story of Dinah and her mother/mother-aunts. I felt for the women and I found their history enthralling. Something you may never have imagined or thought of happening.Can you imagine your period being a time of rest and celebration? I cannot...but that's what it was to these women. They found that time to be empowering and a chance to share their histories and traditions with the next generation.This book brought a lot of great discussion, laughter, and thoughts at our book group!Would I recommend it: I would recommend this book...with one caveat - read it for what it is, FICTION! It may be based on a Bible story and a specific historical time period, but it is fiction...and good fiction at that!Will I read it again: I doubt it. But I wouldn't rule it out completely.[...]"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As the only daughter of the biblical Jacob, Dinah is immersed in the ways of women and carefully observes the rituals of her mother and aunts; Leah, Rachel, Zilpah, and Bilhah, who each influence her in a different way. From her mother, Leah she learns the value of hard work, and from Rachel she learns her true calling as a midwife.But times are not always destined to be peaceful, as Jacob must take his family away from the home they've always known to make their own claim on lands as the tribe of Jacob. During these turbulent times of growing into a woman, Dinah has much to learn and begins to think of love for herself. Just when all seems possible, Dinah's cruel, unsettled brothers rip everything away from her and life is irrevocably altered.Taken from Genesis, the story of Dinah is a mere 750 words. Anita Diamant takes this, alters it, and presents the biography of Dinah, in which we get to know this young woman on a much different level than her short mention in the bible. Not being familiar with the bible at all, I found myself a bit lost in all the names and histories, but enjoyed it greatly still. Dinah is an excellent narrator of her story, managing to give both a girls and later, a woman's perspective on events. The scene is set perfectly and I can picture the dusty tents and the women crowded within. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This was such en enjoyable book. The female perspective was different from the portrayal of biblical characters as we unusually read. So much culture and traditions made the story an adventure to read.

Always recommended to my friends!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recently re-read this book for a book club. Last time I had read it was probably 10 years ago. I felt it stood the test of time and I enjoyed it more this time than last probably because my knowledge about the bible was stronger this time around."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book has all the makings of a timeless classic. I am not giving anything away, but it's not a religiously heavy book, just a well-written literary fiction that keeps you captivated to the very end."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Great reading but not biblically accurate. The reader must remember that this is a work of fiction based on the Biblical account of Dinah and all that is not said in relation to that account.

Dianna was a very believable person who we could relate to even in this day and age."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This book was very thought prevoking. This is a story of very strong women, who really didn't have much say in their lives, but found a way to influence their men, to thier bidding. These women are mentioned, by name, in the bible, but never in detail. This gives an account of their actual way of dealing with the good things, and the adversities they faced, as daughters, sisters, mothers. wives and widows. Once a month, they are obligated to spend some days, in the Red Tent, segregated from men, and they use this time to establish their power, as women. In the Red Tent, they are free of all male influence, where they can define themselves. This is where they gossip, learn, pray, and be with others in their position."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I very much enjoyed this book.

My daughter and i, however, both found the ending a little startling and odd. It sort of came out of left field."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It was a cleverly done retelling of the bible and the characters jumped off of the page. It is one of those 'must read' books and I envy people who have yet to read it.

They are tough women with meat to their personalities. They tell how it was,how they gave birth and raised their children and how they saw the world. This is how I saw Leah and Rachel in my head, I never gave his other two wives much thought, but glad Ms. Diamant saw fit to breathe light into them."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I know this book is a what if, or who knows so maybe this happened... But I think a lot of the bible is fill in the blanks, and left to interpretation, written by men and translated many times, editted and decided upon....Women were often cast out, looked down upon. I think Christianity is patriarchal like all popular religions. It's missing another perspective, this book fixes that.I never really thought about the story, the horror of it, in Sodom, it didn't make sense in anyway, this story makes some sense and it's beautiful, also redeeming."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"One of my favorite books of all time. The characters, especially Dinah and her four mothers, are very rich. They draw you in."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I recommended The Red Tent for my book club, having read it a few years ago and looking for an excuse to read it again. It remains a favorite and I was enamored with the exceptional storytelling all over again. This novel undulates with rich detail and a wide range of emotions. Dinah's story is fraught with sadness and tragedy, but she also experiences so many uplifting and inspiring events. Diamant does a phenomenal job recreating the biblical setting and developing the characters (which could have been difficult considering the size of the cast). I love everything about this book and it remains the best example of biblical fiction I have read yet."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"The narrator of this highly embellished Biblical story is Dinah, the only daughter of Jacob, whose wives include Leah (Dinah's mother) and her three sisters. Dinah's brothers and father are shepherds by trade, but they're basically murderous barbarians. This is a somewhat violent tale, contrasted with the midwifery of Dinah and her aunt Rachel, who have the mission of bringing life into the world. Grief and anger eventually drive Dinah from the sisterhood of her aunts to Egypt, where she bears her child in the house of her husband's mother. This is certainly a saga of Dinah's lost innocence but more about the dignity and compassion which she maintains throughout her colorful life. She exhibits an independence that was not typical of the day, and yet her friendships sustain and rescue her time and again. It's also a story of female bonding in a very male-dominated world, and I suppose that this theme is what made this book so popular."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I have read the Red Tent twice now, and am planning on reading it once again this summer. Anita Diamant infuses her jewish studies along with Dinah, who gets very little mention in the Bible. She then creates a masterpiece that is breath-taking and exquisite! Great love story, biblical historical fiction!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This novel follows the tale of Dinah, the daughter of Jacob barely mentioned in the Old Testament. In the Hebrew Bible, she is seen as a young girl who a handsome prince took advantage of, and that the following slaughter was the result of her family defending her honor.I went into this book solely expecting a rich, entertaining story and that's what I got. I never read the story in the Bible, so I didn't have any expectations in regard to being accurate.I learned much from this book and I could picture the vivid scenery. The way it was written was just so beautiful. Scenes that I would have otherwise found awkward were handled tenderly with grace. This family saga is a tribute to women and mothers everywhere, even those we have forgotten. I saw some reviews saying how this book treated men poorly and two-dimensionally, but I disagree. Dinah treated her male relatives with respect, and her later hatred of them was for personal reasons only- not just because they were men. The reason the men weren't as fleshed out as the women is simply because Dinah did not know them as well. She was surrounded by women, so that's what would have stuck with her.It seems the more impressed I am with a book, the less I have to say about it. Overall a beautiful, sad story about womanhood and family that I whole-heartedly recommend."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"A little slow for the first 1/3 of the book but then it picked up."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I decided to read \\"The Red Tent\\" because I was so impressed by \\"The Last Days of Dogtown\\" and because I am fascinated by the stories in Genesis.

I just love this book-ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!!!I am not exaggerating when I capitalized on the 2 words but really, this is a MUST READ BOOK, aside from the Bible, of course. If you cannot buy the book; check it out from the library but I would still insist you buy the book from Amazon.You know why?

I have read Genesis while reading this to see how the two compare and I don't think that Diamant's account of the events is far-fetched at all. The Red Tent made me realize the numerous gaps that are in the bible story and really question what could have happened. The bible doesn't actually use the word rape with Dinah and the subsequent sacrifices the prince was willing to endure to become Dinah's husband together with the disapproval of the murder by Jacob and Rachel's naming of the child son of my sorrow (and his renaming by Jacob) suggest that perhaps the love story could have happened. Also Dinah is not mentioned as Jacob's child in Genesis after this episode, which supports the assumption of Dinah's anger, curses and running away from the family (why would Genesis not mention her as Jacob's child anymore?)I really think that The Red Tent gave many plausible explanations of events in the bible if one just reads it with an open mind."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Let me begin with the fact that some people may not enjoy this book for the stark details about the female experience. If you can get past that, this is a wonderful book.I loved the stories interwoven in The Red Tent, especially in the first two parts. The last part is does drag a little, but it is still interesting.The reason I gave this 5 stars is because I truly enjoyed reading a book that took me back to the time when life was really like this. While I am sure their lives were much more difficult without the technology we have today, I found myself yearning for the simplicity of baking, sewing, medicine, and sense of community that was so well-described in Ms. Diamant's book. I recommend it for any woman of any age who wants to dive into a fantastic biblically-based novel."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Upon recieving THE RED TENT, I had been very reluctant and unwilling to commit to such a long and seemingly difficult book. I was unsure I wanted to even read about a biblical character that had nothing to do with my life, but by the second sentence of the first page, I knew this book was made for me.Upon meeting Dinah, her friendly and mysterious tone serves for an amazing story telling that seems almost common, as though Dinah and you, yourself, are sisters. Through Dinah, a deep, and sometimes depressing, light is shone uopn the ancient lives of women and &quot;the red tent&quot;; the place where the &quot;women&quot; went every month and rested during their cycle of life.Being the only girl in the story, Dinah is expossed to much as a child that most women are only introduced to much later on in their lives. Her story is filled with hate, tears (both good and bad), scandal, revenge, honor, but most of all, it's filled with love.This tale is one that is most nessesary to not only read, but to pass on to our daughters, and hers after that, and so on. It's important that Dinah's story is never forgotten and her memory lives on inside us all...Please read this, for the sake of your self. No dissapointment is possible."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Don't let the biblical setting deter you - even if you're not a big believer, you'll probably like this book. The author takes a briefly mentioned Old Testament character, Dinah, and uses an obvious knowledge of history and anthropology to create a whole novel with her as the central character. Even without biblical ties, the story would ring true.I would give The Red Tent five stars, except I was occasionally annoyed by the writing style. Diamont can be . . . well, a bit too melodramatic for my taste. Mostly, though, I really liked it. I finished it in a weekend and wished for more."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I love everything about this book! My female friends and family love it as well. Not that men will dislike it, but they may not relate to it as women do. It is an old story told from a new perspective - the women's perspective!

She has written this story with such style and grace you feel as if you have stepped back in time. Today, more than ever we all need the red tent!"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Anita Diamant has written an incredible historical novel, filled with stories about women and their trials and tribulations during biblical times. She has done a tremendous job researching her material, while at the same time, keeping a fast-paced story within its confines. The characters are well developed and the story about Jacob and his family are facinating. Most especially endearing is Dinah and her birth, her life among women and her death. A must-read in my mind. I am very pleased that I own this book"},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I spent the entire weekend reading The Red Tent, hoping it would never end. I was reminded of a time many years ago when I went to Sunday School and learned the Bible stories. The characters, which I loved as a child, still looked the same in my adult mind, only now I could relate to them as they truly became alive.The Red Tent is a beautifully written book about family relationships and feelings. I read this book at the same time my daughter-in-law and several close friends were reading it and we have gotten into some very interesting discussions.I would recommend it to women of all ages."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"I resisted this novel for a long time--a fictional account of a minor player of the Bible? Sounded deadly dull to me. But after many recommendations, I picked it up, and was pleasantly--incredibly--surprised. This is one of the best books I've read this year. I took a class on women in the Bible in college, and I only wish this book had been a part of it. The Red Tent reminds you that the &quot;characters&quot; in the Bible were human--they were real people, with real dreams, real desires, and yes, real bodily functions. Dinah's story is not a happy one, yet it is inspiring to see how she gathered the fortitude and courage to continue with her life in the face of unspeakable tragedy. It is a profoundly anti-Christian/anti-Judaism book, but it's time people wake up and realize this is what it was like. Christianity has not been around forever, and this shows what like was like before the birth of Christ. The writing is wonderful, clear, and evocative, and reading this novel is time well spent."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Women are assigned to their rightful place in this biblical view of an early societal structure, depending on your point of view, of course.... Author Diamant has taken an interesting topic, a woman's position in the hierarchy of things, and given it life, following biblical outlines to form her story. I found the Red Tent and it's particular mystery a fascinating image, conjuring up both the ability of women to live in their own mileau, while also defining those monthly periods when a woman is considered 'unclean'. The main character, Dinah, is able to move about the desert camp prior to becoming a woman, giving her some freedom in making judgements and choices. She follows her heart, and since this is, after all, a biblical tale, she must pay the price of straying from expected behavior. The wages of sin, etc...While I enjoyed this book, especially the vivid imagery, desert sand and blood, murder and lust, I was disappointed to I finish so quickly. I wanted a little more, shall we say, 'meat' to make the story fuller and richer. Depending on the reader, appreciation can go either way, but for me, it was starting to slide into Oprah-land, once a good thing, now not so special to this reader. The writing remains consistently elegant and descriptive: I craved more of the really strong writing and less of the romance novel flavor. Would love to see this writer reach farther, perhaps even in the direction of Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"This is the story of Dinah the only daughter of Jacob. Dinah is only mentioned in a few places in Genesis, yet it was great to see how Ms. Diamant maintained the integrity of the references and expanded the story. She has also maintained historical accuracy for the period and obviously did so with great research and integrity. If I had alot of money, I would buy this book for everyone I love."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"As a woman who has a background in Ancient Near Eastern Studies, and specifically the Bronze Age in which this story is supposed to be set, I find it really disappointing that something this poorly-researched can be mistaken for an accurate reconstruction of life in that time period. The author shows no evidence of having read the relevant source material, which is easy for any layperson willing to use Interlibrary Loan to obtain (Pritchard's \\"Ancient Near Eastern Texts\\" is always a good starting point). Particularly funny, in a sad way, was her \\"romance\\" between Reuben and Bilhah. Unfortunately for this reconstruction, Genesis 35:22 is all about familial power struggles, and not in the least bit about sex as such.Speaking simply as a scholar, I also find it a bit odd that anyone would want to begin their reconstruction of a historical event by assuming that the only existing account of that event was a mass of lies - except for the one bit suiting the author's personal bias, the idea that Dinah was not raped but seduced, and the only idea in the book I happen to think is actually provable by reliable historical/cultural sources. Isn't it suspicious that this is the only part of this novel that matches its alleged source text, the biblical narrative? It's a bit like starting your biography of George Washington by assuming that all previous accounts of his life were written by liars.We have some very cool literature remaining to us from this approximate time period, things like \\"The Complaint of the Eloquent Peasant\\" and \\"The Story of Sinuhe,\\" which are much more likely to give us a real idea of life in the Ancient Near East. Aside from that, it's probably better to read \\"historical fiction\\" that takes its source material seriously, whether the book agrees or disagrees with that source material. The Red Tent does not take its source material seriously... in fact, it shows little evidence that the author even read the source material."},{"Title":"Red Tent","review":"Ms. Diamant has done a remarkable job in telling Dinah's story, a little known character from the early books of The Bible. She introduces us to another time, and a far away place. This book is especially interesting for those of us not so familiar with The Bible and it's story tellers.I was riveted throughout the book. The women and men in this story have their jealousies; fears; joys and sorrows, just like you and I. Diamant's ability to put you right there in the Red Tent along with the women of Jacob is an amazing feat. The stories they tell and the companionship they share makes for wonderful reading.Listen carefully, mind that you don't wander off into the dust. Dinah, the one with the musical name, has a grand story to tell. Enjoy every moment of it."}]`),E={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:F},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:S,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],q={key:0},D={key:1};function H(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",x,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",D,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",q,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const j=d(E,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-d506de0e"]]),R=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/50.md","filePath":"quotesmag/50.md"}'),W={name:"quotesmag/50.md"},B=Object.assign(W,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(j)]))}});export{R as __pageData,B as default};
