The basics of unix style administration are explained about as plainly and simply as possible. One short coming of the book is the lengthy discussion of installation which admittedly used to be a harrowing experience 5 or so years ago (seemingly the main argument against the adoption of linux by microserfs), but in the hands of Red Hat has become nearly as painless a process as any windows install and therefore is not that necessary. The only other problem with this book is that the version of Red Hat is 8.0 (3rd edition) i believe and only has some middle variant of the 2.4 kernel (2.4.17 i think), this is not necessarily bad but the 2.6 kernel is out and Red Hat has a new approach to the desktop with its Fedora build.

The book: (i) guides you how to load Fedora onto your computer, (ii) describes how Linux works, and (iii) discusses Linux applications, networking and scripts. The author also touches on the Red Hat Enterprise version of Linux throughout the text. The Linux installation section is well written with plenty of screen shots showing the various screens during installation. The other sections are also very readable. The book comes with a couple of CDs containing Fedora Core1. A reader may wish to download a more recent version (Fedora 4 is available at the time this review was written). This book is a good springboard in getting into the Linux world with Fedora; however I think that a person will want to supplement this book with a reference on Linux (such as Linux in a Nutshell) in order to get a more detailed coverage on topics."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"I wanted a book that could help me with fedora in TEXT MODE.

If you are interested in exploring Linux, this is one of the lesser-expensive ways to get started, and RHL 7.2 is at least a viable starting point for most newbies.I used the book a couple of times to try to figure out something specific to Linux, but the content is little more than a command summary similar to what the man pages offer and a basic installation and configuration guide.At the cover price as sold by Amazon, you can not beat this for a gift of Linux or other way of getting your hands on CDs...without downloading the files for \\"free.\\""},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"I would call this a terse &quot;getting started with Red Hat&quot; book. I have been waiting several weeks to get the new edition because I usually prefer the O'Reilly series due to their direct and accurate style, unlike most other books that are pompous and as thick as the telephone book. This book met my expectations. However, I was disappointed that it was too deep in some topics and omitted others. For instance, I really did not need two chapters on Gnome/KDE, but I would have preferred more text on installing packages. And it would have been useful to have more info on how to improve the performance of KDE on older computers. And I would have saved two hours if there was a troubleshooting section in the installation; I eventually figured out that I had an errant USB device.All in all, it's a good book that helped me install everything in a few hours.

Which is ok unless you have any problems. then you will find yourself stuck and searching through other countless documentations."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"Unless you need Redhat tech support, buying this book to get you started with Linux isn't a bad idea. The author has titled the book &quot;Learning&quot; so if you are not experienced in Unix/Linux then this book will get you started. The fact that the author goes through the trouble of explaining a Redhat install from beginning to end was very useful. Unless you have some odd hardware (i.e. a 3d video card) you should have X runnng as well.You will immediately want to know more however, and this book will leave you wanting more. That is you will have to purchase another book in the near future. The Unleashed (i.e. Redhat 6.0 Unleashed etc...) are typically pretty good, and they also include a Redhat distribution.There are some mistakes/misprints however. Using the instructions as given you cannot get Quake2 running for example. Also there is nothing in the book about how to keep your installation up to date...a must for Linux users as the OS is constantly changing.The one thing though that really irked me was the authors insistence that Gnome was &quot;the most popular desktop environment in the US&quot;. Even after updating Gnome on my Linux box with the most recent stable releaes I find Gnome to be unstable and somewhat puzzling. The author spends alot of time talkng about the basics of getting around Gnome, but ignores the other popular desktop for Linux....KDE.Alot of this has to do with an almost religious war within the Linux community regarding what software qualifies as &quot;free software&quot; and what doesn't. The author is obviously a free software zealot and therefore leans towards Gnome. You as a user don't have to worry about this war ...you only have to be concerned about how to use the software on your pc. I think the book is lacking severely becuase it didn't cover KDE as it should have and worse yet, took a slap at KDE. Gnome is unstable. KDE is not. KDE is &quot;free&quot; as far as the user is concerned. In defense of the author though, Gnome is the preferred desktop at Redhat and the book is entitled Learning Redhat Linux, and thats is the desktop you get unless you take other steps on your own.I am happy to report that I am typing this from KDE using Netscape as my browser. A testament to the fact that I got Linux working, and I used this book to get me started."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"My only mistake about buying this book is it wasn't my first one.

It seems every question i went crazy trying to figure out with all of my advanced books, was right here in Learning Red Hat Linux.

Its not likely you'll pick up anything new(I didn't). (For those unfamiliar with what Red Hat has done with the split out of Fedora; think ofFedora Core 1 as Red Hat Linux 9.1 or 10; if Red Hat had continued the product line.)This book focuses on the &quot;NEW&quot; Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Core 1 Linux user. The book is a relativelyeasy read. Bill McCarty writes a clear and well organized book. From a novice's perspective, the author givesyou, what you need to get Fedora installed, running and usable. The author does a good job of pointingthe reader at additional information sources on each topic. The book is short, less than 300 pages.This is nice compared to some of the other 1,000 page plus Linux novice tomes; which try to be a &quot;how to getstarted&quot; book and a &quot;general reference&quot; all at they same time; except they don't do either well. Linux shouldbe friendly, not scary. First timers shouldn't have to read a Encyclopedia to get started in Linux. I agreewith the author's choice of brevity for his book.One suggestion to the author, would be to include output examples with the CLI (Command Line Interface) examples.He does it with the GUIs, so why not with the CLIs???I bought the book because &quot;Red Hat Enterprise&quot; (RHE) was in the title. I was disappointed in the fact there wasn'tmore detail about RHE. In retrospect, anyone doing RHE, is probably an experienced Linux person working for acompany, where RHE is deployed and may even have had formal training on RHE. So why would they need this book?My bona fides; I've been using been using various flavors of Unix for an embarrassing long time, Red Hat Linuxfor 8 yrs (from release RH 3.0.3 to 9) and I have been running Fedora Core for about 5 months now."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"This book covers the basics of linux.

These particular distributions are intended for the workstation market and so have many productivity related tools and fewer of the server tools. I particularly appreciated that it does not assume the reader is a high level technician but starts with all the basics and theory behind Linux including things like hard disk organization, hard disk track, sectors, cylinders, etc. Bill McCarthy does an excellent job of explaining what is going on.The author walks you through the installation and configuration using the graphical interface (by far the only appropriate interface for the non-technical person trying to install Linux by their self). This section includes configuring networking and user accounts, organizing data, the default directory tree, file permissions, and using the X system. It also includes a good description of devices and how they are used in Linux, something you really need to understand to setup Linux correctly.The two most common graphic user interfaces (GNOME and KDE) are examined in detail including common applications that come with Red Hat Enterprise and Fedora. These applications include OpenOffice, Evolution - an email client and personal scheduler, a PDA tool, and a CD writer.For the more serious administrator he discusses the Bash shell (the default command interpreter), installing new software using the RPM package manager, and network services like Samba (to share files with Windows systems), Apache (web server), Secure Shell (for secure connections), and firewall configuration.The authors also include a complete copy of Fedora on CD so you can actually install the operating system and configure it while you learn. &quot;Learning Red Hat Enterprise Linux &amp; Fedora&quot; is highly recommended for anyone looking to make Linux their desktop operating system."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"Of all the companies that arose to make a business around linux, Red Hat is perhaps the most successful, at least in the US. Many people wanting to install linux on their machines, or those buying machines with linux pre-installed, often encounter Red Hat's version. Accordingly, this book is in its 4th edition, updated in part because linux keeps expanding its functionality. But another change from previous editions is due to Red Hat replacing Red Hat Linux with an Enterprise and Professional versions. Plus, a group of volunteers, independent of, but supported by, Red Hat, split off a version called Fedora. The reason for Red Hat's actions seems to be a search for higher margins. Anyway, McCarty describes both the Enterprise and Fedora. As he explains, currently there is in fact little difference. Mostly due to the recent divergence.If you are currently using an earlier Red Hat Linux, and feel quite comfortable with it, then you might want to just glance at this book to decide if you find enough need to upgrade now.But if you have never used linux, of any ilk, then perhaps this book might be more useful. If you are going to migrate, you might as well do so to as recent a stable version as possible. McCarty presupposes no prior knowledge of linux or unix on your part. He explains clearly the salient features. The numerous screen captures are well chosen, in support of the text.But you should be aware that McCarty does assume some prior acquaintance with computers. Most commonly Microsoft or Apple. In keeping with the O'Reilly tradition, the book does not start from scratch."},{"Title":"Learning Red Hat LINUX: Guide to Red Hat LINUX for New Users","review":"O'Reilly and Bill McCarty have done it again - they've gone ahead and created an awesome intro Linux book.

I cut my teeth on SLS and Slackware releases of Linux before moving to RedHat and the O'Reilly books have been just incredible. In fact, I still have the first edition of Running Linux by Matt Welsh that I bought in 1995. Having said all that, I just bought this book for the free copy of Red Hat 7.2 included in it.

It starts in Windows with prepping a system for Linux installation, works through the installation (replete with lots of screenshots), then goes into the basics of window managers and Linux Office-style applications. The last few chapters go into some depth on working in the shell and shell scripting, but it's pretty light.This is a solid introduction to end-user level Linux that should be suitable for anyone who is reasonably technical (no need to be a programmer).

I would have wished for a more thorough look into Samba and Apache but that may have been out of the target audience they were aiming for. There is information dealing with setting up networking, DHCP service and modem configuration. By the way, you might as well toss out your winmodem and obtain a hardware modem (external is the best) as the author does not mention the difficulty when trying to get one to work. You also get one full chapter dealing with shell commands which should wet anyone's appetite to learn more. Overall, not a bad book to begin with.

I'm very glad that I purchased this book! I'd installed Red Hat Linux 7.2, on 2 of the boxes on our home LAN, to dual boot with MS Windows 98 Second Edition. Until now, our use of Linux has been minimal. My wife boots into Linux to play games in KDE and I use the Konqueror web browser. This book will make it possible for me to know what I'm doing with Red Hat Linux 7.2 and eventually discontinue the use of MS Windows. There are many illustrations in the book, which show what the reader will see on their CRT screen and the text explains what to do. The book explains, for example, how to configure the SAMBA server, which will enable us to have File &amp; Printer Sharing, between Linux and Windows boxes. The majority of the book, probably 90%, is very easy reading. There are two chapters about the BASH shell. The first is easy to read and the last chapter in the book, &quot;Advanced Shell Usage and Shell Scripts&quot;, is harder to read, but both chapters contain data that's very important to the reader, as do the appendixes. I found one error in the book. On page 100, the author says, &quot;you must be logged in as ROOT to shut down your system&quot;. Probably that is true for the &quot;Server&quot; installation, which would be appropriate and necessary, but it is NOT true for the &quot;Workstation&quot; installations which I've done, or the one &quot;Custom&quot; installation I've done. Users on our systems can shut down the system, without knowing the ROOT password. I believe if you want a book that will help you install and use Red Hat Linux 7.2 on a Desktop, this book is an excellent investment. It explains how to do many things that I wanted to do. The other books I'd purchased are: &quot;Linux for Dummies, 3rd edition&quot;. It came with CD-ROMs for Red Hat Linux 7.0 and when I tried Red Hat, I discovered that I liked it better than Mandrake. I'd purchased the boxed set for Mandrake Linux before that! &quot;Running Linux, 3rd edition&quot; is a super book, which came highly recommended to me, by a man in Red Hat Technical Support.

I like the fact that the information is layed out more cohesively than a reference manual, without being like one of those cheezy and ineffective &quot;Teach yourself [blank] in 30 days!&quot; books. So, when I decided that I was fed up with Windows once and for all, I decided to order this book. It comes with a rather dated version of Linux (6.2). This presented a problem for me because I have a brand-new Dell dimension 8100, so Linux didn't support most of my drivers, and I had to upgrade to 7.1. Also, I preferred using Partition Magic 6.0 rather than Disk Druid or fdisk for repartitioning my hard drive. But after that, this book came in really handy. It is not the only thing you need to learn Linux; websites like linuxnewbie.org and such also helped. But, I really like using this O/S, and I would certainly recommend this book to anyone who wants to try it. The information is presented clearly and in a well-organized manner.

For example, the author states in Chapter 2:&quot;... use FIPS to split the FAT32 partition. Once you've run FIPS, you can use FDISK to delete the new empty partition, creating free space for Linux&quot;Makes sense until you read the next section which tells you how to use FIPS to create the new empty partition and follows up with this advice:&quot;Now you're ready to install Linux to the new empty partition.&quot;Hello? You told me earlier that I was supposed to delete the new empty partition to make space for Linux, now you're telling me to install Linux to the new empty partition, which is it?!?!I now have three &quot;Installing Linux&quot; books (O'Reilly, SAMS, and Teach Yourself Visually) they all leave out a little something, making this &quot;newbie&quot; a little hesitant to go any further.

He is singularly adept at getting to the heart of the matter, yet without distorting or omitting relevant details. As a one time serving officer with the Royal Navy, I very much appreciate his level handling of the many contentious issues he must deal with, and as an amateur historian, I must say that whenever he deals with an issue I am already familiar with, he seems to have a very good, balanced view of what happened. It is a decided pleasure to read a current historian who writes in the great tradition of Carleton Hayes, Carl Becker,and Samuel Eliot Morrison (not to mention Mahan). I would certainly give this book a strong recommendation to any student of world history."},{"Title":"Round About the Ballet","review":"The photographs are dazzling, with enough stylistic variance to remain interesting start to finish.

The stories are at once unique and universal. They are expressive of an experience to which Native Americans can truly relate, and yet, set on the campus of one of America's most selective colleges, the stories are from a elite few who may be speaking of an experience that is virtually impossible to share. This is valuable as an oral history, and perhaps more importantly, as a voice of the Native American which remains too infrequently captured. Still, we must find those voices which are seldom heard, rather than continuing the habit of letting the elite culture speak for us all."},{"Title":"First Person, First Peoples: Native American College Graduates Tell Their Life Stories","review":"There is not much literature that exists about Native American students in Higher Education.

And it's curiously complete in unexpected areas, such as what to do about those feral cats who show up in your garage, pull at your heartstrings, and become semi-permanent boarders.But the book is frustratingly incomplete in other areas. When Emmy's belly started drooping to the floor, swaying awkwardly with every step, my son and daughter insisted I take her to a vet for diagnosis and, at the very least, some cosmetic surgery. Nothing about this condition in the book (I even looked under \\"tummy tucks\\"). The vet assured me that it was a perfectly \\"normal\\" condition, especially in spayed domestic female short-hairs, and that surgery of any sort would be contra-indicated. Is this information too much for a \\"dummy\\" reader of this book to expect to find?The same goes for a condition, variously referred to by vets as \\"excessive, or obsessive, grooming,\\" \\"self-mutilation,\\" and \\"psychogenic licking.\\" When Emmy started tearing her hair out, I did the same trying to pull some enlightenment out of this book (this time I even looked under \\"baldness\\"). Again, the authors offered nothing on a condition so common my vet was able to hand me several fliers about it.Finally, the authors certainly haven't met my cat or they wouldn't be so sanguine about the prospects of getting a pill down such a creature. They neglect to say that medications such as Prozac, Valium, and amitryptyline are now available in transdermal form (that's for the cat, not the owner).Emmy is once again beginning to look like a felicitous furry feline, but no thanks to this book."},{"Title":"Cats for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Item was in good condition with a crease in the cover that was not noted in its description.

The text is never condescending or self-consciously witty. The authors respect the reader's time and attention, keeping the presentation simple and to the point, but never dry; clear organization and structure make it easy to skip past sections that don't apply.This book's greatest virtue is that it neither overwhelms with detail nor speaks in vague generalities. For example, instead of detailing 50+ breeds, the authors explain the chief differences between them and proper criteria for choosing among them. Likewise, you won't find a list of breeders, but you'll find out what makes a good breeder and how to recognize one. From choosing a kitten to understanding body language, &quot;Cats for Dummies&quot; gives you well-reasoned and well-justified principles--knowledge you'll be able to remember and apply.I recommend &quot;Cats for Dummies&quot; to the first-time cat owner; it will definitely help make the experience smoother and happier, for both you and your cat."},{"Title":"Cats for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"&quot;Cats for Dummies&quot; is an honest, light-hearted, and informative guidebook.Though authors Gina Spadafori and Paul D.

And why your overweight baby might get stuck in a hole. (Hint: vibrissae don't grow with added poundage.)

With them, I mainly figured things out by trial and error. One of them lived to be 17, so things went pretty well all told.After he passed away and I spent time mourning him, I decided it was time to adopt two new cats. This time, I did the wise thing and tried to educate myself better about cats and cat care before adopting. In fact, since my last two cats came to me as strays, I'd never actually formally adopted a cat from a shelter, breeder, or the like and was looking for guidance on the process itself.Having found other &quot;for Dummies&quot; books to be very useful, this was the first book I turned to, and so far it's been extremely helpful, both as a guide and as a convenient reference. One of my cats is three months old (my first kitten), and one is a year old, so they both have different needs, and this book covers those needs in a fun, intelligent way. The tone is light, but the information is serious and detailed, with tons of useful advice on adopting, training, feeding, grooming, playing with, and otherwise caring for you cat. Many cat books are written by self-proclaimed experts, so it's nice to see that this one was co-written by a licensed veterinarian with very impressive credentials. My only complaint about the book so far is really a minor one: it would have been nice to have more full-color photos.As with any topic, this shouldn't be your only reference book, but it should certainly be one of your first cat references."},{"Title":"Cats for Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"This book is one I'd recommend to all cat owners, especially if it's your first kitty.

There aren't any pictures (though it does include a few comic pages) which makes it not-so-fitting for a child. The book is very pointless for any adult, especially one who has had any experience with a cat. I say this because although the book holds a lot of good information that might be new to a reader (like myself), any adult looking to learn more about cats would get frustrated from the small volume of this book. They would probably be seeking a larger &#34;real&#34; book on the topic to learn as much as they can. At the end of reading this miniature book I had wished there was more information, but how could that be expected from such a small book?I would pass on this book. It really is not worth getting.

Note - That version is only available in &#34;paperback&#34; - at least at the time of writing this review. If you choose &#34;hardback&#34; it might automatically switch to this miniature book.This book (in case you already have one or it's $1 at a store nearby) would be useful to give to a teenager who is just learning about a cat and trying to make a decision on getting one.

We went to the shelter to pick up one (selected a female kitten), and upon noticing a \\"two-for-one\\" weekend, decided to get a second (male kitten - turned out to be the more affectionate and venturesome one). That was an incredibly correct major act - the two keep each other entertained far better than my wife and/or I could. \\"Cats for Dummies\\" also recommends having two cats, but buried in the middle of the book it doesn't communicate the importance of this decision.As for toys, \\"Cats for Dummies\\" is absolutely right - their favorite toys are the plastic rings from milk bottles and baby food jars; further, they never tire of a new set of rabbit-fur-covered brightly colored \\"mice.\\"However, early in our indoor cats' lives it became apparent that they were getting a bit bored, looking more than a bit longingly outside, and wanting to climb the $600 drapes. So, under the guise of \\"enrichment,\\" we let them out. It took awhile, but now it is by far their favorite activity, and they no longer threaten the drapes, etc. However, one has to be very careful - a hawk and three coyotes have taken an interest in our house (and cats), so we have to be on the look-out and spend much time outside with them. Getting them back in, of course, is a bit of a challenge - this is impossible with less than an hour outside, and only accomplished (with some difficulty) after that by immediately feeding them baby food. Night-time outside play is an absolute no-no! (None of this good information is in \\"Cats for Dummies.\\")Finally, while both cats love tree-climbing, neither knows that the best way to come down is tail-first. This has led to a few crashes - anyone know how to teach them this?

Remember, Spadafori wrote, cats live in the day. This was wonderful advice and helped me appreciate Cyrus's last good times.I put the book aside for quite a while after that, but when the idea of a new pet no longer seemed like sacrilege, I pulled it out again and read about &quot;road testing&quot; kittens.

This book is a very refreshing change from those stuffy books I've read in the past. The author has done an outstanding job of covering all of the new software features for Windows 98 SE. I found everything I needed to know from a usage and theory perspective. In fact, I found that the author provides more information in many places than I actually need today, which means this book will continue to help me well into the futuer. Since that's the point of this book, I give it 5 stars.However, the author goes farther and provides me with a lot of hardware information. None of the information is wrong, it's just dated. The book doesn't include all of the connectivity options that are available today, so I feel that it doesn't provide everything it could in the way of hardware information.So, if you're looking for a book about hardware specifics, look somewhere else.

I needed help on hooking up an ethernet printer on a peer-to-peer network. This doesn't strike me as rocket science. Instead, I get pages of the history of networking. Who cares.I then needed help on an ODBC issue. No coverage is this &quot;Complete Guide&quot;.I wanted quick, bulletized text on issues that a user would expect to find in a complete guide.

It also gives a overview of the system and can help you see how the parts are connected. Unfortanetly, it seems to be written for someone who is upgrading from DOS V.1. The authors seem most concerned with getting old DOS programs and old hardware to work in Windows 98 and assume that anyone with new components and windows programs will never have a problem. This is not true!The book assumes you are already familier with the old diagnostic tools. For example, it tells you that the untility Dr Watson is much improved but only hints at what the utility does and gives no instruction for using it. (you will not find Dr Watson on the start menu so new users will not be able to even open it.)I bought the book mainly because I have a software problem with my new computer. This book told me about starting in safe mode and went on to say that if that did not work the problem could be very difficult to track down.

This book has just about everything you need to know about Windows 98 right there between the covers.Unlike one of the other previous reviewers, I found the background and theory portions of the book to be incredibly useful in figuring out just what has gotten out of whack with a system that is giving me fits. The explanations of memory usage, peripheral drivers, and FAT32 should be required reading for anyone who does more than word processing on their computer."},{"Title":"Peter Norton's Complete Guide to Windows 98","review":"The plus of buying this book is that you get a lot of useful information. There were few questions that I couldn't answer by reading a bit. I found that the information was much better organized than the Microsoft documentation and more complete as well.In addition, the author provides really good productivity tips that have made working with Windows a pleasant experience. I usually don't have a lot of time to waste getting things done, so anything that helps me work more efficiently is welcome.The big negative for this book is that the author spends a lot of time discussing theory. He'll talk about how things work for pages at a time. While this is OK if you have a lot of time to read, it's time consuming to dig through pages of theory to find the one piece of useful information you need. I did find the theory useful, so I can't say the author was completely wrong in adding it to the book, I just wish all of the theory had been included in separate sections so I could ignore it.I gave the book five stars because it is an essential reference despite the organizational flaws. Any book that can fix as many problems as this one can deserves high marks. Perhaps the author will include less theory the next time around."},{"Title":"Peter Norton's Complete Guide to Windows 98","review":"I bought this book because of the Peter Norton name.

The book is rather superficially written, and does not go into specifics if you are actually trying to fix something, or get something to work. If you wish to get Direct Cable Connection to work, for example, I would look elsewhere. Some things in this book are just dangerous. The authors suggest that the reader run a utility called LFNBK.EXE from the Windows CD. I did as they suggested and my computer was rendered unusable!

He ages from mid-sixties to mid-seventies in the course of the book. The first story has Bech visiting Prague before the comunists have been thrown out. He visits Kafka's grave, hangs out with the ambassador, and talks with the local literary celebs who are still intimidated by the Bolshies. This story is aimless, and the weakest of the five entries. The second is Bech Presides.HB is talked into heading a NY literary organization. It's a brilliant study of cultural trends and hidden motives. It's brilliant, the best of the book. Third, Bech is sued in LA for libel. HB's conflicting feelings about himself and his accuser make this story appealing and engaging. Updike releases rage at unappreciative critics in Bech Noir.(JU, I'm praising the book, no need for vengeance with me.) It's wonderful fantasy at getting back at those who have harmed us. Tip! Use a sponge to seal your mail. Bech wins the Nobel prize in story number five. Bech doesn't know what to say, and uses a Giuliani-like technique at the podium. It's a good story, not great. Overall, stories 1 &amp; 5 are very good. 2,3,4 are brilliant. Please read. Thank you."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"&quot;Bech at Bay&quot; presents five comic stories about the novelist Henry Bech, starting out with a visit to Communist Czechoslovakia when he is 63 and ending in his acceptance of the Nobel Prize for Literature when he is 76 years old (with his infant daughter held struggling in his arms). Through these Bech stories, Updike takes a satirical look at the the Manhattan literary scene, pokes fun at the absurdities of the big city life and even takes a moment or two to ponder the Eternal Verities (but not too seriously). As his life enters its last phase, Bech finds himself in some interesting new situations: president of the The Forty, an intellectual society hopefully modelled on the French Academy but without its sense of self importance; as a caped avenger &quot;ridding literary Gotham of villains&quot; (read critics); as a septuagenarian father. Through all this absurdist comedy, the old Updike magic is constantly with us. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"How does one best review a literary genius? This is not going to be easy. Updike is an author I discovered in college, but haven't been seriously reading him since a couple years ago. I devoured &quot;Roger's Version&quot; and his latest short stories, and I didn't know what to expect with the latest Bech book. This is the first of the Bech books I have read. What an amazing book. Updike has a way of describing reality that makes it feel more important..almost surreal.Bech, Updike's alter-ego, runs loose in this one, even resorting to murder of his least liked critics. If you are looking for very DARK humor, here is where to find it. In this pathetic yet somewhat brilliant character, we find some autobiographic hints about Updike himself I'm sure. Some of his dislike of critics is probably projected into Bech's harsh words. And at one point Bech wonders if he is polluting the world with subtle pornography, maybe something the author wonders about from time to time too.Perhaps the best part of the book is the end when Bech gives a rambling but very interesting Nobel Prize acceptance speech in Sweden. This is something only Updike could write. He rambles on about mortality, religion, relationships and birth and death. Vintage Updike. He is a world class writer of the highest order.Jeffrey McAndrewauthor of &quot;Our Brown-Eyed Boy&quot;"},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"In this, the third (and final?) installment of books about the imaginary novelist Henry Bech, John Updike has departed from the closely observed 'realistic' social satire of the first two volumes and drawn closer than ever before to a mode of fantasy writing more like Brazil or The Witches of Eastwick. Things happen (Bech kills people, is blackmailed into producing a baby, wins the 1999 Nobel Prize for Literature) that go beyond the normal limits of credulity. I am very glad of it. Normally Updike is religiously (in every sense of the word) faithful to 'reality'; but, as the book's epigraph suggests, 'Something of the unreal is necessary to fecundate the real' (Wallace Stevens). And, in the end, Bech at Bay does not feel any less 'real' than Bech: A Book or Bech is Back. It feels more whimsical, more holidaying, perhaps, but all the plugs are still in their sockets and electricity courses through these pages abundantly. Updike is never funnier than in these Bech books - here, he is also florid, sweeping, capricious, startling and very warm."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"As a big fan of the first two Bech collections, I carefully rationed my reading of this one, limiting myself to one story per day. All was well until I reached &quot;Bech Noir&quot; in which our hero takes murderous (yet flippant) revenge on his literary enemies. This was so ludicrously out of character that I kept waiting for the authorial signal that it was just the protagonist's fantasy. Unfortunately, it never came. I don't know whether Updike was being contemptuous or just plain stupid. But not only did his trashing of my suspension-of-disbelief ruin this book for me, it cast a retrospective pall over the previous ones.Ironically, a new first-rate Bech story appeared in The New Yorker some time later. Presumably, it will be included in the omnibus Bech edition being published in 2001. I only pray that Updike, who is known for his post-publication tinkering, will come to his senses and leave &quot;Bech Noir&quot; out."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"Henry Bech, Updike's fictional writer, is back in five story length segments. Bech ages from mid-sixties to mid-seventies in the course of the book. In the first story, Bech travels to Czechoslovakia. He visits Kafka's grave, hangs out with the ambassador and his wife,and talks with local writers who are still under the Soviet regime. This story is meandering and the weakest effort in the book. In Bech Presides, the second story of the collection, he criticizes the end of this first story. Bech Presides is the best story in the book. Bech is pressured into heading an old NY literary society. The story is a brilliant combination of hidden motives and a reflection of changing cultural tastes. In the third story, Bech is sued for libel in LA. Bech's conflicting feelings for himself and for the plaintiff make this story succeed. 'Vengeance is mine.' Sayeth the writer, 'I shall repay' is the theme of story number 4, Bech Noir. HB gets back at unfriendly critics in a variety of ways. It's very amusing. Bech wins the Noble Prize in the fifth story. He contemplates Faulkner, but comes closer to Rudy Giuliani when he brings his baby daughter to the podium and lets her say hello. Bech's inability to think of a great speech is complemented by Updike's bland story. Stories 1 &amp; 5, are weaker than 2,3 and 4. But overall Bech at Bay is enjoyable and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"Bech at Bay is the last in the trilogy of novels about Henry Bech, John Updike's Jewish alter-ego. It lacks some of the prose sparkle of the last two Bech books, and as such, does not quite have the head of steam necessary to fulfill even Updike's modest goals. One is to make us laugh, which he accomplishes sometimes but not nearly enough for our effort and the second is to make observations about art, life, and creativity, which he does in abundance, stretching the believability of the plot and the characters to the breaking point.In the end, I have great ambivalence about the Beck books, and Updike generally. What am I supposed to think of him? There is something slight about these books, even when they are decked out as serious observations of literature and life. Even the comedy is thin and a bit crude, lacking any essential punch. And that is what I want in my fiction. A punch. There are enough lulling, non-essential books and other forms of entertainment out there. I want my fiction to change my world. The Beck series does not come close to this at all."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"Updike does seem a bit weary as Michiko Kakutani noted for The Times in this book...still, weary Updike is better than most other authors at their liveliest.

Finally, a few weeks ago, I decided that it was time for me to get acquainted with Mr. Updike. I must say that the first work I chose to read of his did not disappoint me.Bech at Bay is the last in a series of books that feature Henry Beck, and aged writer who still manages to find himself in precarious adventures. Bech at Bay is a series of short stories that loosely make up a larger story.

Bech is a confused New Yorker writer. While the romance series with the character &quot;rabbit&quot; Armstrong pictures the obscure and simple suburban life, Updike brings us, now, in a comic approach, the adventures of a medium reputation writer that is always struggling with critics, friends and love affairs. Good, but if this is your first Updike book, go for Brazil."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"This is a collection of five more interelated stories in thelife of Jewish writer Henry Bech, while in his sixties and seventies.Bech remains a yo-yo. In one tale he is a conquering hero as Prague welcomes him as one of the literary greats of the century. In another story, he struggles with a libel suit. This up and down personna is at its best when Bech is awared the 1999 Nobel Prize, which leads to one of largest anti-selection protests in the history of the award. As he is aging, Bech remains one of John Updike's freshest and most interesting charcaters. Through Bech, Mr. Updike voices his opinions on a number of subjects, but does so in a witty satirical, and often times ironic manner. The Bech collection (besides BECH AT BAY, see BECH: A BOOK and BECH IS BACK) consists of some of the most humorous yet serious short stories written in the last three decades."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"I'm a great Updike fan. Loved \\"Rabbit is Rich\\" and \\"Rabbit at Rest\\"...but as good as they are, I don't think Updike is ever as good as the best novelists, such as Roth and Bellow, both of whom happen to be Jewish as is Bech. Is Bech ever as exciting intellectually as Bellow's best, such as Herzog? No. Updike is much more like David Lodge, whose own \\"Changing Places\\" features a Jewish academic not entirely unlike Bech. Lodge and Updike, and the British playwright Simon Grey, all concentrate their energies on the life of the writer, the ins and outs of the lit crit scene, and all do it masterfully, but none has the intellectual heft of the great Jewish writers, such as Roth. They've got the pettiness down cold, and Updike, of course, is a master of crude sexuality, so his intellectuals all run around with their flies open and their tongues hanging out of their mouths, but what Updike and Lodge fail to achieve is intellectual excitement in the ideas themselves and in the lives of the people. However brilliant they may seem, they never are troubled in a serious way; they are merely flummoxed and irritated in a Waspy way. They are also able to sail on, despite their observations of the world, whereas Bellow's characters are affected by the ills of society; they are troubled by what they observe as troubling. Roth creates a world that is under assault, that is being torn apart, but Updike's world is a carnival ride, even when his subject is terrorism, as in his recent novel."},{"Title":"Establishing incentive structures and planning agencies that support market-oriented transformations (IMF working paper)","review":"John Updike is NOT Nabokov's equal in any sense, let alone in the realm of the metaphysical novel, in which Nabokov is and will forever remain God. Updike, unlike Nabokov, is constantly begging the reader to pity his nasty, dull protagonists. Everything seems to go right for them, despite their best efforts to fail and feel sorry for themselves, yet we're expected to cheer them allong and cry for them when they experience minor setbacks? No thanks. Nabokov's multi-layored gems offer no easy heroes and no simple-minded moral messages. That said, I think Updike can be really good. The Centaur is a wonderfull book, and some of his short fiction is great. His serially-destributed fiction is, however, far to long-winded and thick-headed and self-serving to be compared to anything by Nabokov. If Nabokov has an American successor, it's Pynchon or Barth, not Updike."},{"Title":"Individualism, old and new","review":"You wouldn't think it, but this little baby packs a huge radical punch. Written in 1929 after the Depression set in it's Dewey's testament on what he thought society would have to do to solve that kind of systemic problem and survive. What comes out from Dewey's experiential philosophy is a radical critique of individualism that fit's into the category today of &quot;Council Communism&quot; or &quot;Autonomous Marxism&quot;, meaning socialism which is concieved according to Marxist type theory but is realized according to radically democratic and workerist means.

Meyer covers the history of relations, mostly economic, between Americans, and their weather and climate. The prose is serviceable, but there is a lot of information, a lot of it surprising. Examples:Climate was a major motivation for English colonization. The warmer climate in the South allowed different crops to be grown than in England. They would not compete with English crops, and would replace imports from warm countries like Italy.The Urban Heat Island effect was discovered in colonial times. It was considered enough of a health threat that President Thomas Jefferson proposed measures to ameliorate it, which were pretty much ignored.The large majority of agricultural workers who went to California during the Depression, were not in fact Okies fleeing the Dust Bowl. They were ex-sharecroppers from the South, fleeing unintended consequences of government policies. &quot;Most migrants to California were victims less of the direct effects of bad weather than of measures taken for protection against good weather.&quot; (p. 162)I recommend this book to anyone interested in public policy related to weather or climate, or in a different perspective on American history."},{"Title":"Discourse in commemoration of the glorious reformation of the sixteenth century: Delivered before the Evangelical Lutheran synod of West Pennsylvania,","review":"An easy-to-read source of information about catholicism and how the reformation set us free from the papist's bondage.Some footnotes go into great detail, but they can be skipped.

As the plot progresses, we not only come to know and like the character, we see him live and develop into a three-dimensional person.

A delightful story.While sea-faring, dodging city guardsmen, and learning of the final dragon-hunt, Watt-Evans creates a completely believable world, and during the dragon-hunt and resulting quest a completely believable maturing of the character. I can't understand why Watt-Evans' books are mostly out of print."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"This is a good story. The plot develops quite quickly and goes in several unexpected directions. The main character is a nice down-to-earth, average kind of guy. His aggressive lack of ambition is a nice, cynical twist to the conventional &quot;I want to save the world&quot; attitude.The synopsis at the end was a nice touch to tie up all the &quot;loose ends.&quot;A map or two would be really nice, but is not terribly necessary."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"This was the first Watt-Evans book I ever read, and it's difficult to write a strong review for it. The story is simple enough: a boy too old for apprenticeship finds himself homeless, penniless, and teacherless after his master dies. With nothing else to lose and a past he wishes to escape, Tobas joins a quest to kill a dragon and marry a princess.Although this sounds unoriginal, the book is unique because the majority of the book has nothing to do with the dragon or the princess. It instead revolves around a magical \\"trap\\" which Tobas falls into and has to figure out some way to escape. Only at the very end is the plot thread concerning the dragon revealed.This is why the book is difficult to review. The plot setup the book is misleading since Tobas spends about 2/5 of the book getting to where the dragon is, 2/5 of the book on a completely different plot, and only about 1/5 concerning the dragon and the princess. I also feel how he defeated the dragon was weak and displayed little of his character development. Still, it is a fun read and I would reccomend it to fans of fantasy novels."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"All of Lawrence Watt-Evans books are wonderful. Please print these in hardcover though!!! I hope somebody is listening out there."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"This is another great book in the Ethshar series of books by Lawrence Watt-Evans. This book takes place many years after the events in the \\"The Misenchanted Sword\\". Tobas is a failure. Tobas' Wizard teacher died after only teaching him a few nearly useless spells. This hardly seems to do Tobas any good and he quickly sinks into hunger and poverty and that is when the fun really begins.This book is as funny as the \\"The Misenchanted Sword\\" but becomes a fantasy/romance. A funny and fun read with an imperfect hero. Good read."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"but this novel, near the beginning of the series, is definitely one of the best.

This is the only book by this author that I have read and it does not encourage me to read any others."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Predictable plot, sketchy locale, good dialogue, sterotypical characters individuated by anachronistic twentieth century quips in an otherwise medieval mileau. The author has written this book several times under different titles with re-named characters in various locales. Reminiscent of Heinlein's &quot;Glory Road&quot; without fully realized characters. If you haven't already read one of Lawrence Watt-Evan's books it's definitely worth the price, worth reading for enjoyment, not worth re-reading. If you have read one of his books you know what your getting. Buy it, if you want more of the same. I borrowed my copy."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"This book is, perhaps, the best example of what makes the Ethshar series tick: there is a problem and the character or characters work towards resolving it.It sounds simplistic when put that way, and it IS a very simple concept, but what makes Watt-Evans books in this series stand out is the relentlessly logical and believable way that the problems are addressed.With a Single Spell is a charming story about an apprentice wizard who has the misfortune of losing his teacher after only learning a single spell (a simple fire conjuration). You can't get any simpler than that. And yet, the book takes off from that starting point and leads us through some truly marvelous terrain, including a dragon hunt and a very, very mysterious castle that seems to have crashed (!) into the ground.It is a very fun and inventive story that, while not being exactly Tolstoy in depth, is utterly enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"I love this book. It epitomizes some of the characteristics that make Lawrence Watt-Evans' books great. This story presents unorthodox fantasy elements with a seemingly improbably plot and weaves it together masterfully. An aprentice who knows a single spell and is expected to kill a dragon???? As crazy as it sounds, it is an immensely entertaining story with colorful characters, good dialogue, and creative writing. Given it is a light fantasy read, but many of his earlier books should be treated as such. Relax, kick up your feet, and read it in one sitting, enjoying it for what it is.......great fantasy."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"This was my first experience with the Ethshar Hegemony and its world. I first read the book about 10 years ago, and have since re-read it many times. From the lazy overage apprentice to the young polygamist wizard, Tobas shows some signs of maturing, all the while illuminating his world for us with an incredibly rich cast and detail, from stupid dragons to smart (if poor) kings with too many daughters, kindly sailors to indifferent wizards, legendary wars and lost spells, beautiful witches and princesses, as well as ugly ones. Ethshar of the Spices is a particularly fascinating city with too many fascinating throwaway ideas to numerate. Just the consultation made by Tobas to an ethsharian diviner at the end of the book opens up new vistas. I recently purchased The Misenchanted Sword, and fell in love with the whole world again, I'm now buying up the rest of the series and can't wait."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"While not quite as good as The Misenchanted Sword, With a Single Spell is still a well-written entertaining novel. Set in the same world, Ethshar, as the Misenchanted Sword, this tale takes the reader on an adventure with a young wizard-in-training whose master dies after he has only learned one spell. Considered too old for another wizard to concern themselves with taking him on as an apprentice, Tobas must figure out what to do with his life and his one spell. At least that spell is a fairly useful one, although even that manages to back-fire on him from time to time and cause even more angst to our young protagonist. As with the first book in the series, Watt-Evans manages to keep the action flowing while keeping the tone light and humorous. A good read for those who need a break from today's heavier fantasy offerings. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series soon. Also, the books in this series are all stand-alones, so you don't have to read them in any particular order which is also refreshing."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Reviews Of Unusual SizeRe: Tobas the wizard's apprentice knows one spell. He can light fires. That was all he learned before his master died, he accidentally blew up the house he lived in and he found himself wandering Ethshar. Without many options left, he joins up with a band headed to the Small Kingdoms to slay a dragon. If successful, he stands to gain a fat purse and a princess as his bride. Tobas is a clever young fellow, witty and fairly brave, but he's pretty unlucky. In the depths of the Small Kingdoms, however, Tobas finds that dragon and far more. He finds adventure, fortunes, strange magics, mysterious secrets and love! Maybe a single spell isn't that useless after all.Outstanding: I love this book. It may be my favorite of the Ethshar novels (I say that about a lot of them though) The way Tobas wanders blindly into his adventures is smoothly plotted and full of a lot of humor and fun.Unacceptable: Nothing. I know I say this a lot too, but I love everything about this story. Even the Wildside cover, which I normally hate, it pretty decent.Summary: This is a quintessential light fantasy novel. It stars a boy without many skills or prospects that sets out to seek his fortunes. He battles dragons, flirts with princesses, explores strange lands and overcomes tremendous hurtles to make his way. What could be better than that?5/5"},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Very enjoyable. The typical Watt-Evans hero, a bit bumbling, but smarter than he seems. The author has a wry view of heroes and fairy tales, and our hero goes through some Candide-like experiences while triumphing over both a dead wizard and a rather sad, and hungry, dragon."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"When I read this book for the first time I was inspired. Finally an author had imbued originality into Fantasy. Many of the cliche plots needed in fantasy were missing, and to my amazement a character with very little promise or power became a hero.Here was a boy with the high hope of becoming a powerful mage, but after his teacher dies he is left with only one spell. The way the author turns this into a very interesting yet simple novel intrigued me.Lawrence Watt-Evans is one of the few Fantasy authors that really explores the fantasy genre, creating different ways to turn it on it's head.One of the few books that actually made me laugh...how often does a fantasy novel do that and still retain a rich world that isn't comical and foolish."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Tired of epic stories that go on and on and on? Sick of novels in which the Hero saves the world five times and that's just in chapter one? Hate it when you read a book and find out it is number six in a series of twenty and if you read them out of order they will never make sense? Ever have a fantasy novel in which the time line and appendixs take up more space than the story?Than the works of Lawrence Watt-Evans is for you. Light fantasy, great taste, not boring. Each novel in the Ethshar series uses the same setting, history and magical rules but are not linked in any way. They are a series of stand alone novels! You can pick up any of them and enjoy them in any order you want!With a Single Spell is where I started and, boy, am I happy I finally opened the pages. I'm not normally into fantasy for many of the reasons above but this book, while not trying to be a comedy, does give us the lighter side of a magical land. We follow Tobas, a young wizard or an old apprentice, who knows only one spell on his way to finding a life. But what can he do with one spell? One SPELL! Yet he has to go make a living in a world where magic is repected but also not that uncommon. Pirates, big cities and dragons, oh my!I will not give away the ending but I have to say the book did seem to go a tad slow at first. I am going to collect the other books and maybe search out some of his other series as well. Anybody who loves fantasy should get this book."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Watt-Evans, in With a Single Spell, has addressed a problem that's haunted role-playing gamers since the first edition of AD&amp;D: what can a wizard do with only one spell?Tobas, the main character of Single Spell, has more troubles than the average AD&amp;D character, even. As an apprentice wizard, he only managed to learn one spell before his master died - and that one lights fires. An orphan, he has nowhere to go, and he can't make a living doing what a flint can do almost as well as he can. So, despite his strong disinclination for travel, Tobas just has to adventure - he fights a dragon, saves a princess, learns magical secrets, all while hoping that soon he'll be able to settle down.Although the plot isn't especially original and many of the characters are basically stock, Watt-Evans has done a fine job with the book; he's made it a very light, sunny romp through a world any reader of fantasy or player of RPGs will recognize. With a Single Spell is ideal reading for fans of Robert Aspirin, invalids in need of soothing distraction, and those who remember playing a first-level mage all too well."},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","review":"Wonderful.

While the book professes to approach the subject from a Taoist philosophy, that wasn't what I found when I read it. Rather, the text approaches the subject from a Judeo-Christian perspective with sometimes not so subtle references to good vs bad, right and wrong, defiling and love. While the book may speak to some and help in their work, it really doesn't do justice to the possibilities that Taoism brings to seeing and knowing the dying process. I would welcome a truly Taoist writing on dying. I would challenge the author to go beyond his current version and explore the deeper meaning of Taoism."},{"Title":"Baking For Dummies","review":"Baking always seemed impossible to me - I'd be lucky to get anything to rise, my food would always weigh a ton and, basically, unless someone really loved me, they probably wouldn't eat more than a couple bites.

He (among others) pushed the revolution in computing out of the slipstick era. He, at the height of the Cold War, wrote for audiences in both the USSR and the USA. Small wonder that he took on religion. I mean that he took it on as a duty and companion, not as an opponent, though many might have seen opposition.Much of this book lacks direction. He skims issues that are still contentious, including the right to die. His arguments about self-reproducing machines tend twaords the vague, although he admits that he avoided tedious precision. Many of his points are clear and sharp, however. Drawing on the genie in the bottle, the Sorcerer's Apprentice, and other popular literature, he argues that the capabilities of technology steadily run ahead of our ability to predict and mitigate its consequences. He also notes, during first light of the transistor age, that \\"Living matter has a fine structure ... [approached by] machines which operate according to the principles of solid-state physics.\\" As usual, technological optimism carried him well beyond justifiable extrapolation. Also as usual, he had a fair inkling of how today's 0.1 micron transistors might compare to 1.0 micron brain cells.His sharpest commentary starts in the faith that scientists and engineers are moral people, and work in the belief of the human good that comes from their life's work. (Please, don't descend to the belief that we think we are evil people reveling in evil outcomes.) Weiner notes that the deepest hell in Dante's Inferno is reserved for the sin of simony - directing the Church's good power to personal gain, using the force of money. He draws a direct analogy to the sin of corrupting vast technological power towards personal gain, also using money as controlling force. If you're already queasy about the amorality of the MBA's \\"bottom line\\" ethos, this may give you some very bad dreams.It's an important book. It's flawed, but has the honesty to ask hard questions. It also has the courage to attach a moral sense to the analytic trait of mind - it ought not be surprising that the two fit closely.Among all the quotable lines in this book, one stands out: \\"... remember that in the game of atomic warfare, there are no experts.\\" Here, now, under the president that demolished 30 years of arms control treaties, it's a phrase to remember.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"God and Golem, inc.;: A comment on certain points where cybernetics impinges on religion","review":"Written in 1964 when the concept of a human interacting dynamically with a machine was first becoming a reality, there are facets of this book that are dated. Nevertheless, the concepts that are described are still as pertinent today as they were when Wiener first set down his thoughts. The book is a collection of essays where Wiener explains his ideas for what he thinks the future holds for humans interacting with machines.The approach is very non-technical so it is possible for the lay person to understand his thoughts. The prose is also well structured, making it very easy to read through.

Whether it will be useful to anyone running a modern name server is a valid question.For starters the book is generally geared toward the complete newbie. Though it does eventually get around to complex subjects it glosses over all detail and other areas likely to cause problems while examining in excruciating detail all manner of completely obvious subjects. For example, the advice on where to put your working directory:\\"Which directory you use doesn't really matter.\\" No mention of possible permission issues - or SE Linux installs. But they spend a couple pages going into great detail on what a valid host name is and how to setup a 4.1 name server if you're stupid enough to still have one running.By far the biggest disappointment is the example used to demonstrate a name server setup. It is probably the furthest removed from a normal setup as one can get. There may be two people on the planet with a setup like this one. This guy has two routers, several physical hosts, etc. If that's what you're working with it might be just what you need. Most people will be wondering how this applies to their problem. I'm fairly good at finding patterns and extrapolation but this example setup has nothing in common with the two IP address VM upon which I want to host a couple domains. In short a couple more setups would have been nice instead of the in-depth look at a completely useless example.As the happy owner of about twenty O'Reilly books this one is the only one I find next to useless.

All of my previous DNS knowledge was obtained from the man pages and online tutorials.The book is great because the example network used throughout the book is built upon, showing you how to \\"grow\\" your DNS with your expanding network. The design and implementation presented is priceless and covers some of my favorite topics: placement of slaves, hidden primaries, building root servers, split views, daisy-chaining, forwarders, partial-slaves, address maintenance issues, etc. The pros and cons of each setup are weighed and best practices are suggested. If you like a generous helping of diagrams, examples, and tables as a learning aid, you won't be disappointed.One specific example of weighing the pros and the cons is presented on page 479 as follows:\\"Could we have saved a few bucks on hardware by using our external authoritative nameservers as forwarders, too? Sure, but that would have presented a risk.\\" After that statement, they proceed into all the details of \\"why.\\"There is adequate coverage on security. The authors preach defense in depth. An implementation example includes hiding your masters and only exposing bastion slaves. Securing communications between the masters and slaves is also covered in the security chapter using DNSSEC and TSIG. I think IPSec is another way to add a security layer, but that is probably another book.After reading the book, I started to implement my new DNS infrastructure and found myself referring to the index often. It is fairly consummate, however, I found a few things missing, such as the $GENERATE statement. Also, some of the configuration details were lacking slightly. For example, the order in which ACL elements are processed and how negated elements affect the processing outcome. Another question I had was, what would happen if an ACL name is negated, and what if that ACL contained some negated elements. Well I found my answer by actually trying it and verifying with the canonical reference docs on isc.org.I gave this book five stars because of its effectiveness in presenting the concepts and implementations of DNS using examples, good writing style, tables, and diagrams.

However, it could be better. A couple of times, the author waits until very late in the book to explain what particular commands mean when he could have easily explained them early on to avoid confusion. In the very least, the author should cite a particular chapter for further reading on a particular subject more frequently instead of not even mentioning it. Also, the example/case used throughout the entire book is of a mock company which is setting up a *public* DNS (meaning it communicates with the Internet). The author doesn't mention even once what a user might do if he's setting up an internal DNS for *private* use (not on the Internet). The reader is forced to either make assumptions (not a safe thing to do) or seek documentation elsewhere on this topic. Another complaint I have is that the author does not spend enough time to explain how one might go about mapping devices with multiple interfaces (e.g. routers...sorry, three ambiguous sentences is not enough). That having been said, I still must give it four stars considering it provides plenty of examples (even if none of them reflect a private DNS!) and thorough explanation of how DNS and BIND works.

As I write this review in July of 2001, nothing has changed.Taking the reader from the basic concepts of DNS and distributed host databases to set up to administration, DNS &amp; Bind delivers a complete package that no other title has been able to match.This book is easily the most comprehensive, well-organized, and clearly written text on DNS/BIND. Although the book does assume some prior experience with UNIX-type systems, it has enough high-level language and examples to keep the playing field even.Overall, I'd recommend this book to both novices and system administrators alike."},{"Title":"Dns and Bind","review":"I am a netadmin who works in NT.

Even when I followed examples on web tutorials, I found I still didn't understand what it was I was doing. But having read this book, I feel much more confident using Bind and DNS in general. Unintuitive config files are now totally readable, and fancy terms such as &quot;zone&quot; or &quot;reverse mapping&quot; make much more sense now.I definitely recommend this book to Unix netadmins because this book has a lot of practical advice for how best to optomize Bind in a network, and how to deal with tricky tasks such as delegating and compensating for network disasters (a must read section).Best of all, the book is very easy to read, rather humorous at times, and has something for people of all levels of experience.

It is a must-read kind of book for those needing to do DNS. I need an understanding of how DNS and BIND work since I wish to get my own internet services re-started. This book provides it. In my experience, DNS can be as painful to re-do correctly as it is to initially set up correctly because once you do have it running properly you can just forget all about it. It &quot;Just Works&quot;. So when you are later faced with having to re-learn DNS it can be as painful as the initial learning experience. That is why a book with many how-to coding examples for different DNS zones becomes valuable. I sure wish this book had the examples.With the understanding that I've only read the first 89 of 600+ pages, I'd like to agree with all the positives cited by other reviewers. You really must get, and read, and re-read, and re-read this book if you want to run web servers, mailing lists, and so on.For such a comprehensive book, it offers only one getting-started example of use to someone wanting to set up his or her own domain quickly (like me.) The movie.edu examples given are excellent, but at least one additional example is really needed.How about discussion of and coding examples for a zone named video.biz consisting of 4 machines on the same network plus a print server and a Linksys Cable/DSL router?

The combination of everyday experience with DNS and the wealth of information - both theoretical and practical - that I got from this book has done so much for my understanding of DNS and of the Internet as a whole. The book begins with the basics of building a nameserver, but I know that if I have a specific question, I can use it as a reference book as well. It's also written in a straightforward, accessible manner. The only constructive criticism I can offer is that I wish it had more information about managing many domains (not just subdomains).

Then \`named.boot' file is entirely different, among other changes. This book is great at identifying the required changes and assisting in making those changes.DNS and BIND clarifies all the mysteries associated with BIND (named) and DNS. Easy to read. Covers every detail from getting and installing the latest BIND, to configuration and troubleshooting. Has a great chapter on nslookup and another that gives detailed explanations of just about every BIND related error message. The only thing they left out is info on configuring syslog to manipulate in a usable manner the BIND generated messages.For some reason, DNS seems to be a mystery to so many sysadmins. If it were as simple as people often pretend it is (typical system admin person: &quot;Oh, I already know everything about DNS that I need to know... so why read a book or take a course?&quot;), then why do I see 15,000+ lame server messages and 250+ mail CNAME messages every month? These errors are only the result of DNS configuration errors!Very few sysadmin people REALLY know as much about BIND and DNS as they should. If you are a sysadmin person, do yourself a favor and buy and read this book. If you are an IT manager, check your system administrator's book shelf. If this book is missing, then buy it for them and make them read it! (You should read it first, then develop some test questions to see if they really did read it!)This BOOK MUST BE REQUIRED READING for EVERY system administrator on any type of system connected to the Internet. If everyone that administered an Internet site read this book, we could probably reduce the error traffic on the Internet by 50% or more!This book also should be the basis of a required one-quarter undergraduate CS course at all schools that teach CS, CE, IT, or equivalent.One of the best written of the O'Reilly books.Jon R.

Kudos to Paul for such a wonderful peice of work!"},{"Title":"Dns and Bind","review":"First off, the most recent edition of this book was published in May 2006, so all reviews prior to that are discussing previous editions of this book.The domain name system or domain name server (DNS) is a system that stores and associates many types of information with domain names, but, most important, it translates the domain name (computer hostnames) to IP addresses. It also lists mail exchange servers accepting e-mail for each domain. In providing a worldwide keyword-based redirection service, DNS is an essential component of contemporary Internet use. DNS is most well-known for making it possible to attach easy-to-remember domain names to hard-to-remember IP addresses. BIND (Berkeley Internet Name Domain) is the most commonly used DNS server on the Internet, especially on Unix-like systems, where it is a de facto standard. A new version of BIND (BIND 9) was written from scratch in part to address the architectural difficulties with auditing the earlier BIND code bases, and also to support DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions). Other important features of BIND 9 include: TSIG, DNS notify, nsupdate, IPv6, rndc flush, views, multiprocessor support, and an improved portability architecture. This book was written to address these changes.DNS is being used for many more applications than in the past. With ENUM (electronic numbering), DNS is used by voice-over-IP gear. With SPF (the Sender Policy Framework), mailers look up information in DNS to check for mail spoofing. This makes DNS more critical than ever, and a target for hackers. To handle these additional applications and increased threats, DNS has had to be extended, adding cryptographic security, for example.These topics and others are covered in the new edition of DNS and BIND. Security is therefore one of the topics that is deeply covered in this book. The previous editions of this book also described how to secure name servers, but most readers probably felt the likelihood of their name servers coming under attack was remote where today it is probably going to happen. There's been a recent spate of DNS amplification attacks reported in the news, therefore it is necessary for system administrators of Internet name servers to guard against these attacks by limiting access top recursion, which is covered in the chapter entitled \\"Security\\".The new and fifth edition of this old standard covers BIND 9.3.2, the most recent release of the BIND 9 series, as well as BIND 8.4.7. Beginning with an introduction to DNS and what it does, the book guides administrators through all aspects of setting up, configuring, and working with the distributed host information database. Other topics include using MX records to route mail, subdividing domains, the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) and Transaction Signatures (TSIG), dynamic updates, troubleshooting, and DNS programming using the resolver library and Perl's Net::DNS module. All of the programming examples in the book can be downloaded from the website of the latest edition of the book. Anyone who works with DNS regularly or wants to be more informed about the Internet and how it works will find this book useful. There are other books on this subject that are easier to read, but none that are as complete as this one. I highly recommend it. The following is the table of contents:Chapter 1.

Good overview of the islands and reflections of life in those times."},{"Title":"Among the Isles of Shoals","review":"Originally written as a series of newspaper articles the text appears as one long narrative for some reason which is a bit disconcerting at first but once you get used to it you find endless treasures both elegant and hilarious. Thaxter grew up on Star Island and is known both as an artist and for her fabulous flower gardens. She lived most of her life on the Isles of Shoals, those jewel like islands that glitter on the horizon nine miles off the coast of New Hampshire. Some years back I took a ferry out to Star Island and then across to Appledore Island but have never been to the rest. There are nine of them altogether. Nine made into eight by a connecting breakwater or seven when the tide is low and land connects two more.The islands are home to the Star Island Hotel which is now a convention center owned by the Unitarian/Universalism Church (whose earliest known cemetery is my backyard) but which was once a popular resort managed by Celia Laighton Thaxter's father.Her book is wonderful. She opens by describing the islands, both their geography and their history and then goes on to cover every aspect of life there. She rails quite furiously at how modern technology is ruining life there and how the newly built homes of settlers are an eyesore and destroy the charm of the ancient cottages. Since she wrote this in 1873 it is quite amusing to imagine how she would she her beloved islands today. Her love of the islands is on every page.She amuses the reader with descriptions of the people, many of whom have lived their all their lives never stepping foot on the mainland. She describes their peculiar speech patterns, the odd, rolling gate that many of the men have developed from spending most of their time aboard ships. The discusses their habit of giving one another nicknames and odd local colloquialisms, rails against the drunkenness that has blighted the islands, and praises the women who seem to keep busy when the men are drinking. \\"Blessed be the man who invented knitting,\\" she writes, \\"It is the most charming and picturesque of quiet occupations, leaving the knitter free to read aloud or talk or think while steadily, surely beneath the flying fingers the comfortable stocking grows.\\"In discussing mating rituals she recounts the native custom when a young man is besotted by a young lady he hides behind a tree and chucks rocks at her as she passes. If she turns to look at him that means she is interested. She tells of violinists who think that possessing a violin is all that is needed to make music and thus squawk out the most ear-splitting noise and give it pretentious, high-faulting names. In one charming passage she rhapsodizes about the sight of fishermen \\"Saxon-bearded, broad-shouldered, deep-chested, and bronzed with shade on shade of ruddy brown\\" and goes on to say \\"the neutral blues and grays of the salt-water make perfect backgrounds for the pictures these men are continually showing one in their life aboard the boats. Nothing can be more satisfactory.\\" Celia! You naughty girl!But amid the ghost stories, stories of wrecked ships, lost treasures, and amazing rescues are her descriptions of nature and there she is at her very best. She writes of storms and squalls, seals and snowy owls, songbirds and butterflies, the brilliant colors of island vegetation, and the beauties of the islands through the months from bleakest winter to sparkling summer.This is a beautiful book - one that I'll keep and read again when I need a break from the mainland and the 21st century.

Ostensibly based on the Visual Basic GUI, it presents several rather inconsistent approaches to database integration. There's the Data Environment, the Design-Time controls, or straight ADO. Added to this is a rather clunky web editor. Its interface encourages the developer to model a web page on the VB Form, an approach which relies on the out-of-date HTML 3.2 standard. But InterDev also ships with an HTML 4 CSS editor. MS encouraged developers to use FrontPage for design, but for years, InterDev generated non-standard HTML that made FP choke.These inconsistencies are reflected in the structure of the book, although that's not necesarily a criticism. But while it might appear that the book progressively leads you through a series of graded lessons, it's really more like a series of articles.The chapters on the Design-time controls are interesting, and probably contain the most in-depth discussion of their mysteries I have seen. The drawback is that most developers don't like using the DTs, and you can tell that the authors don't like them either, since they rapidly get on to ASP and JavaScript programming.This does lead to one minor issue, although it's one that I could raise with many other InterDev books: once you start writing ASP, there's not much real advantage to using InterDev, other than its Intellisense. (But you can get Intellisense extensions for other editors like HomeSite.) Still, the ASP programming examples are all very good, and full of practical code examples.Of course, it wouldn't be a Sams book without the usual number of typo's, incorrect diagrams, and software missing from the bundled CD. Most seriously, they promise you a demo version of SQL Server 2000, which isn't there. You can order one from MS, but you'll have to pay extra for it. Although you can get an Access version of the Pubs database from the authors' website, some of the ADO techniques presented only work with SQL Server."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Database Programming with Visual InterDev 6 in 21 Days (Teach Yourself -- Days)","review":"It seems that the authors were asleep during the making of this book.

I was wrong.If you don't have programing know-how the the consistant errata and lack of coding standards will cause you to not get past Day 1.The coding, which standards change from day to day, leaves out important details, chnages methods in doing the same tasks, and if you type it directly from the book, will cause your programs from Day 2 on to not work correctly.The amount of errata makes what could have been a good book a sub-standard one, and what is worse is that the Author only lists 2 errata on his website, when I found multiple errata throughout the book...at least 2-3 per 'day'.Stick with a WROX beginners book and you'll fair much better and save yourself some frustration.I've been programing for over 10 years, and without my previous knowledge, I would have never figured out the errors in the coding."},{"Title":"Sams Teach Yourself Database Programming with Visual InterDev 6 in 21 Days (Teach Yourself -- Days)","review":"I got this book thinking it would be a great start on ASP programing with Visual Interdev.Although I have learned alot, it has taken a lot longer due to, as other reviewers have pointed out, poor layout, poor coding (errata all over the place) and no coding standards.

If you are interested in how hard it would be to port the gui of an app from another OS to Be, this may help. But don't expect help on developing for Be much beyond an overview of the basic UI components. Heck, this doesn't even cover how to create your own components...just use the pre-defined ones. It's also a very short book, so it doesn't make for much of a reference.My vote is for you to use the BeBook online and grab what info you can from the mailing lists, chatrooms, and newsletters."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"I normally don't bother writing online reviews, but I felt I should after seeing the previous review. I think the two star rating and criticism of the book is somewhat of a disservice to potential readers. I do agree with the reviewer that the book doesn't go in-depth. But I don't think it's supposed to. In the author's comments he uses words like &quot;fundamentals&quot; and &quot;overview&quot;. He also says the book is a starting point, and a tutorial, and that programmers well-versed in Be programming should consider the two reference-style BeBooks by O'Reilly. So I don't think this book was really meant to cover things like custom controls (or even all of the existing controls). Anyway, it got me switched over from Windows programming, and that's what I wanted. I didn't really expect a tutorial to be the only book I'd need. (It's a good book, but I gave it four stars instead of five 'cause I don't know if I'd give *any* book a &quot;five&quot;!)."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"This is a great introduction for programming the BeOS. It's a great introduction for those who have never programed before, and it's a great transition book for those who have worked with other APIs and want to learn Be's API. True, the book is simplistic and it doesn't go into any great detail of the API classes, but thats what the Be Book is for. I give this book 5 stars for more than adequately doing what it was written to do."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"All in all, I thought this this was a decent book. To be honest, I was expecting more. However, the book is very thorough in its explanations and examples (almost to a fault). The book starts out very basic and the learning curve does not get much steeper as you continue through the book. This book probably should have been called &quot;The BeOS User Interface&quot;, rather than &quot;Programming the Be Operating System&quot;. If you are looking for a book that covers every one of the API kits in detail w/ programming examples to enhance itself, this is not the book. However, if you are looking for a book that explains the User Interface and its workings, this is the book for you (the coding examples in the book are fairly decent). This book, used in conjunction w/ the Be Book, provides a good learning experience. Sydow lays a decent foundation which you can then, in turn, experiment with and build upon."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"The title says it all. Take the authors advice. If your an advanced programmer go elsewhere, but if not (probably most of us) definitely use the book. I wrote my first simple Be program the same day I started reading the book. I can't imagine simpler explanations for what is a difficult subject."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"When I heard that this book was coming out, I couldn't wait to get it (in fact I pre-ordered it from Amazon). I have to admit that its a bit of a disappointment now that I've gotten through a good portion of the book.While what it does cover is explained fairly well, the book is quite weak in many areas. While it gives a fairly good introduction into programming for Be, it doesn't go into detail where it really matters. The book lacks depth when introducing the reader to the ways of the Be API. No attempt is made at explaing how to create custom controls, not to mention that the book doesn't even cover all the controls made available in the Be API. While it does offer a fairly decent explaination of some of the Interface Kit, I'd say shy away from this one and spend your money on the other BeBooks by O'Reilly.Here's to some better beginner's documentation!"},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"I'd say this book is pretty much as the author describes it above -- it's great for getting started in programming for the BeOS.

Now I'm digging in deeper with more advanced docs."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"If you plan on programming on BeOS systems this is the book. It is slightly dated, but not too much to be useful. That is its only shortcoming.

The first chapter alone helped clear notions in the Be API that I didn't quite grasp.There is talk about the fact that the book was supposed to come with a CD. But the way I understand it, the author only refers the reader to sample source code that's provided on the BeOS CDROM or on the Internet."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"I thought the book was an excellent introduction to programming the BeOS. The book focuses on the essentials, particularly of the interface kit, and provides an efficient means of becoming familiar with the API. The book clearly demonstrates the elegance of the BeOS API.I was concerned about the references to the CDROM, but I'm sure those will be corrected in the second edition. I just downloaded the code from the &quot;Examples&quot; page on the O'Reilly site. I'd take this book with some minor errors over not having a hard copy intro to BeOS programming any day."},{"Title":"Programming the Be Operating System","review":"In my opinion, this book was wordy and lacking in depth. Although it contained some very good information, it taught at such a slow pace that it was more effective at putting me to sleep than at educating me. Be aware that this book covers only the extreme basics of BeOS GUI programming. It seems like the first half of a serious programming book that has been inflated with extra words to appear more substantial."},{"Title":"The Everything Pregnancy Organizer: Monthly Calendars, Charts, Checklists, and Schedules (Everything: Parenting and Family)","review":"This book was like a diary for me to record the day by day changes that occurred during pregnancy.

He has little to go on but he stretches his talents to the breaking point to find her.Little does know that he is not actually the pursuer, but the pursued. He is being secretly led by his guru with an inner love and wisdom that is matched by a personality that puts the lie to the stereotypical image of the reticent, desiccated spiritual high and mighty swami. This guru-lama will keep you panting for more of his sublimely practical wisdom as he liberally sprinkles his tongue-in-cheek aphorisms throughout the book. I have photo-copied all of these and enjoy reading them often to keep my spiritual quest from degenerating into a brittle formulaic procedure or trailing off into a wispy yearning for an other worldly never-never-land.Your everyday life IS the Path and this twinkly-eyed lama will not let you forget it. Indeed, if you think your life is tough as a student aspirant, by the end of the book, you will realize how ever-so-much-harder is the teacher's lot. You will be brought to a summit of poignant insight that leaves you with naught but a desire to throw your arms around this forthright, insightful, stern lama. You will want to comingle your love with this man who has blended his heart flame into an elixir that will, if you truly quaff it, forevermore lift you onto a new Summit. You will find a new definition of spiritual responsibility--alive, vibrant and free--in a dedicaton to service heretofore unknown.I have read this book three times now--and two of those times I read it aloud to friends whom I loved enough to want to share with them its rare mixture of wisdom, spiritual yearning, humor, businesslike can-do spirit, mystery, adventure and hope.I gave my last copy to a couple, whom I instantly recognized as soul mates when I met them. Now I am buying it again and look forward to meeting more people I love enough to give it to. Maybe my having another copy will invoke another such joyous reunion.

Background and context for my interest: I have been a Chicago Bears' fan since elementary school; Gale Sayers and Dick Butkus, on the same team at the same time, are among my favorite Bears of all time; the story of Brian Piccolo was poignant as I followed his illness and death so long ago.This book does a nice job showing how Sayers moved from childhood and challenges to becoming a nationally known college football player to joining the Chicago Bears. The book does a fine job outlining his career with the Bears, including the story of Brian Piccolo. It also covers the devastating knee injury that wrecked his career (although he would have one very successful year after that surgery).All in all, a nicely done work."},{"Title":"I am Third","review":"Gale Eugene Sayers (born 1943) was a famous running back for the Chicago Bears for seven seasons. In 1977, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, and is still the youngest inductee in the Hall's history. His friendship with teammate Brian Piccolo (1943-1970; primarily recorded in the chapter 'Pick' in this book) was the basis for the inspirational 1971 TV movieBrian's Song, as well as the 2001 remake (Brian's Song). Piccolo's story is told in the bookBRIAN PICCOLO A SHORT SEASON~1972. This book was first published in 1970, and republished many times since the first 1971 film. The book's title is from Sayers' motto, \\"The Lord is first, my friends are second, and I am third.\\"He wrote, \\"Brian Piccolo and I began rooming together in 1967 and we became close friends. It's easy to make a big deal out of the fact that he was white and I'm black and to wonder how we got along. But there was nothing to it... The best thing about our relationship as it developed was that we could kid each other all the time about race, do our thing in perfect ease... Like, before that 1969 exhibition game... a writer came into our room to interview me, and Pick really laid it on. 'How do you get along?' the writer asked. Pick said, 'We're O.K., as long as he doesn't use the bathroom.'\\" (Pg. 63)He recalls, \\"I think [Pick] actually helped me open up because he was such a happy-go-lucky guy. He always had a joke or two in him... He was really a comfort to me during the 1969 exhibition season and into the regular season, especially those early games when the writers had written me off. He was one of the few guys who seemed to have confidence in me, who built up my morale.... Because of my injury and my mental state afterward, I got to know Pick even better and became closer to him than almost anybody else on the team. And then when he became ill, it seemed that our friendship deepened and we got to understand each other even better. And that's when I found out what a beautiful person he really was...\\" (Pg. 67-70)When George Halas asked Gale to talk to the players and dedicate a game to Piccolo, he said, \\"'I think each of us should dedicate ourselves to try to give our maximum efforts to win this ball game and give the game ball to Pick. We can all sign it and take it up to him...' About this time I was getting pretty choked up...\\" (Pg 72-73) He adds, \\"Brian's attitude after [his] operation was so phenomenal it made me feel all the worse about how I acted after my knee surgery. The day after I was operated on Pick and Bobby Joe Green came to see me... I just lay there and said nothing... and here was Brian Piccolo, after probably the most critical moment in his whole life, in fine spirits, cool and hopeful and so positive about things. He really helped lift YOUR spirits.\\" (Pg. 75-76)After his famous \\"Most Courageous Player\\" acceptance speech (\\"He has the heart of a giant... I accept [this award] for Brian Piccolo... I love Brian Piccolo and I'd like all of you to love him, too. Tonight, when you hit your knees, please ask God to love him...\\"), Piccolo told him, \\"'Magic, you're too much. If you were here now I'd kiss you.' I said, 'Yeah, well I'm glad I'm not there.' ... We left feeling better about him because he kept us in a lighthearted mood. He cheered US up. I'm glad of that last memory of Pick, since I was not to see him again.\\" (Pg. 78-79)There is SO much more in this book; anyone who wants to read one of the truly great \\"inspirational sports stories\\" of all time, needs to read this book."},{"Title":"Finding Dr. Schatz: The Discovery of Streptomycin and A Life it Saved","review":"Finding Dr. Schatz is an easy to read but facinating book.

How these two lives from far different backgrounds and histories came to impact on each other makes for very interesing reading. As a physician, I particularly found the trials and tribulations of Dr. Schatz, as well as his dedication to science and humanity a refreshing reaffirmation of what dedicating one's life to science and truth is all about. Although vindicated and recognized eventually as the co-discoverer of Streptomycin it is at the same time a sad commentary on the greed and jealousy that exists in the scientific community.

Her children made great strides with ABA, Applied Behavioral Analysis. It was through the diligent efforts of the ABA therapist that the children were able to learn to identify words; identify sensory perceptions and verbalize the experience.One thing that bothered me was the heavy handed use of the word \\"perseverate.\\" That is a truly harmful and judgmental word that has hurt many; helped none and is best avoided. The terms \\"special interest,\\" \\"repetitive verbalizations/behaviors\\" are far preferable and much more accurate. The overusage of this damning, negative and destructive word cost this book one star. It is a word best avoided. The deleterious affect this word has is addressed in Annabel Stehli's book, \\"The Sound of Falling Snow: Stories of Recovery From Autism & Related Conditions.\\"One thing that I tip my hat to Catherine Maurice for was exposing the fraudulent claims made in re holding therapy. The very name of this quack nostrum makes me want to run for cover! Maurice actually met with Margaret G. Welch, the founder of this nostrum and was initially a Welchian follower. Over time, she saw that holding therapy was questionable and harmful. Welch's book \\"Holding Time,\\" as well as Bettelheim's \\"Empty Fortress\\" and Elisabeth & Nikolaas Tinbergen's atrocious works on autism are the worst books I have EVER read!Welch had her view films of \\"holdings,\\" wherein the children filmed were either a) not autistic or b) displaying the adverse response to being restrained. I also didn't like the way Dr. Welch would tell parents to yell at their children; level accusations at them and then follow up with hugs. Welch actually advocates that people LICK their children, much as dogs do their pups. That made me queasy. To date, I have never heard of anybody with autism licking anybody!For people with autism, particularly severe autism, decoding expressions is difficult and trying to interpret conflicting behaviors had to be confusing. Many of these young clients were non-verbal preschoolers! I was queasy when I read of how Welch had people hollering at their children and blaming the parents for \\"not resolving issues\\" with the children and that forcing the children to endure hugs would \\"cure\\" them. Horse feathers!Donna Williams, an illustrious author with autism says of Welch's method that it \\"teaches people to give the desired response\\" so as to be freed from something dreadful. Lise Pyle wrote of her son John in \\"Hitchhiking Through Asperger's Syndrome\\" that \\"hugs are to be endured, not enjoyed by John.\\" John is given the respect he deserves instead of being subjected to this ignominious treatment.I was thoroughly disgusted with Dr. Welch for saying to Maurice's daughter, \\"lonely Anne-Marie,\\" \\"sad/angry Anne-Marie,\\" and trying to plant anger in Maurice's mind towards her then pre-school, nonverbal daughter. I cringed when I read of how Maurice practiced this \\"holding\\" at the home; I was ready to run like a deer at the thought of the child being forced to endure this. Anne-Marie naturally did not like it and I was delighted when Maurice jumped Welch's ship and resumed ABA, which worked quite well with her children. In time, they were moved off the a/A spectrum and Welch had NOTHING to do with their progress. It was upsetting to think of the number of good people who were snowed by Welch's methods and claims.Autism, as has been pointed out IS a spectrum condition. It is a neurobiological condition that affects sensory processing and communciation to varying degrees. It has nothing to do with resolution of any kind; it is simply neurobiological. It is also EXTREMELY counterproductive to blame parents. Nobody would make their child autistic! There is NO scientific data or proof to back Welch's claims. To add further insult to further injury, Welch cites Nikolaas Tinbergen, who was an ornithologist. Tinbergen's execrable works in re autism is just a rehashing of Welch, although his work predates hers. The bottom line is they say enforced hugging is a panacea for autism; blame mothers; claim autism is psychological, which is a fallacy. If enforced hugging was a cure, then everybody would be doing it and nobody would have autism! It is just an emotional elixir that satisfies the hugger at the expense of the autistic population. Tinbergen was an ornithologist, not an expert on autism! His work, together with Bettelheim, a notorious fraud and Welch's fallacious claims are among the worst and most misleading in autism literature.As a survivor of enforced hugging, which I abhor, I can tell you all it did was sour me on hugs. I think it is so cruel to take what is purportedly a loving act and convert it into a self serving punishment. I knew a boy who was put through the Welchian method; hated it and it backfired big time. The boy would cry piteously, \\"no more hug! Hate hug!\\" and beg not to be sent there \\"to be yelled at when you aren't bad.\\" Now nearly an adult, he will say, \\"I'm still autistic. I still like WWII jeeps and planes and I still hate hugs.\\" Prior to the Welchian method, the boy stoically endured hugs. To this day, he will flee them. That was very unfortunate, but not surprising.ABA on the other hand, recognizes autism for what it is - a neurological condition that affects behavior. ABA focuses on teaching cause-effect and linkage, e.g. linking words to a feeling or an object. ABA also teaches clients to focus directly on the issue at hand, e.g. someone talking to them and to tune out extraneous stimuli.Since a/A is a spectrum, there will be overlapping behaviors and sensory issues. Not all people with autism think in pictures; are adverse to being touched; are nonverbal or suffer from the more extreme form, Kanner's Autism.I recommend that ALL parents of children with autism as well as adults with autism to give ABA a try. Floor time is another good method that encourages direct contact and fun as well as focusing on relevant stimuli. \\"The Boy Who Loved Windows\\" is an excellent book about how a child was eased off the a/A spectrum by use of floor time."},{"Title":"Lean Solutions: How Companies and Customers Can Create Value and Wealth Together","review":"Authors James P.

It's exactly the same thing as producing a bad product that has to be thrown away.This book follows in the series these authors have been developing.

In both, their focus is on \\"five simple principles\\" which can guide and inform any organization's efforts to achieve \\"process brilliance\\" in its product development, supplier management, customer support, and production processes. The principles are:1. Provide the value actually desired by customers.2. Identify the value stream for each product or service.3. Get and keep each step of the value stream in proper alignment.4. Enable the customer to \\"pull\\" rather than \\"push\\" maximum value from what you offer.5. Once the value, value stream, flow, and pull are established, \\"start over from the beginning in an endless search for perfection, the happy situation of perfect value provided with zero waste.\\"In this context, I am reminded of Albert Einstein's emphasis on making everything as simple as possible...but no simpler. Lean initiatives should eliminate \\"fat\\" but not \\"muscle.\\" Decision-makers in many organizations confuse rightsizing with downsizing.In Lean Solutions, Womack and Jones identify what they characterize as \\"the emerging challenges of consumption\\" despite the availability of better, cheaper products.\\" And this seems very strange when we stop to consider that satisfying consumption - not just making brilliant products - is the whole point of lean production.\\" In response to challenges such as complicated purchase decisions because \\"consumers are often drowning in a sea of choices,\\" they explain how to combine truly lean provision with truly lean consumption. In process, Womack and Jones examine dozens of real-world examples of how various organizations have done so. When emerges is a new definition of value for today's consumer who insists that problems are solved completely, conveniently and without any waste of time. Moreover, today's consumer expects to receive exactly what she or he or wants, with value delivered where and when specified, with a substantial reduction of decisions which must be made to solve the given problem or fill the given need.\\"Our objective is simple: We aim to teach managers to see all the steps a consumer must perform to research, obtain, install, integrate, maintain, repair, upgrade, and recycle the goods and services needed to solve their problem. We then challenge each step, asking why it is necessary at all and why it often can't be performed properly. Once worthless steps are eliminated, we can talk about flow and pull, heading toward perfection.\\" Womack and Jones insist - and I wholly agree - that lean thinking must not only guide and inform continuous efforts to perfect production of a given product or service but to perfect, also, the provision and consumption of it. To the best of my knowledge, their book is the first to provide the core concepts, strategies, and tactics to accomplish that.True, Womack and Jones suggest and explain a number of \\"lean solutions\\" to all manner of problems but it remains for those who read their book to apply the principles of lean thinking to their own specific circumstances. Obviously, bold action is required and there are perils to take into full account. Any decisions made are, at best, subject to constant refinement and, when necessary, revision and perhaps even replacement as new circumstances develop. Effectively combining and then coordinating consumption and provision streams is indeed a journey rather than a destination."},{"Title":"Lean Solutions: How Companies and Customers Can Create Value and Wealth Together","review":"I was expecting real life, in depth case studies.

He describes actual cases and next to that speculates on the future uses of Lean Consumption. The solutions describe in the book, feel good.

The book makes a number of excellent arguments in a beautifully clear and readable style. The provision of goods and services to consumers is definitely the next target in the lean revolution and the authors note some particular example organisations that are achieving lean in the service sector. Tesco comes in for frequent praise.The book does have a couple of weaknesses. Firstly, the books lacks detail on the metholodogy for achieving lean provision. Only a few vague pages are presented.Secondly, the book would, in my view, really benefit from the input of retail experts and academics to comment on and improve the ideas that are floated by the authors. As it is, I am left with the feeling that some of these ideas are pie in the sky which would never work in the real economy.Clearly the aim of this book is to stimulate thought and discussion on the application of lean principles to consumer service. It presents a compulsive argument for change, though no clearly worked through solutions. It moves the lean management focus onto the provision of goods and services to the consumer - where it is much needed - and, as such, is required reading for anyone involved in retail and customer service."},{"Title":"Lean Solutions: How Companies and Customers Can Create Value and Wealth Together","review":"I have often commented on Lean, and mentioned the fact that Lean derives from the Toyota Production System, and thus from a manufacturing background. I was certainly aware that there were books on Lean Six Sigma for Service, but having glanced at a couple, I wasn't convinced that they had really made the transition to a service orientation. Obviously service companies have backroom operations, and obviously there is waste present in service companies, just as there is in manufacturing operations, so Lean must somehow apply, but I wasn't convinced that reading a book on \\"Lean for Service\\" provided any important new ideas. I had a student challenge me on this recently and suggested I read Lean Solutions - a book that James Womack and Daniel Jones - the ultimate Lean gurus - had written in 2005. I hadn't realized that Lean Solutions was focused on the service business, but sat down and read it.Lean Solutions is a great book that anyone in process work, Lean or otherwise, ought to read! There really are exciting ideas that Lean brings to analyzing service industry problems.Lean includes a number of different techniques. Among the most prominent are defining a value stream and then examining each step in the value stream to determine how long it takes, if its creating value, and whether it relies on push or pull. The techniques are mixed in with a lot of heuristics, often derived from practices at Toyota. Thus, for example, everyone at Toyota is urged to \\"always go to the gemba.\\" (a Japanese term for the place where the work is actually done). At Toyota, and in almost all books on the Toyota Production System or on Lean, the gemba is understood to be the factory floor where production processes takes place.What Womack and Jones have done is to imagine a new gemba - the place where the customer lives. (Note that in doing this Womack and Jones have moved beyond Lean as a set of practices derived from the Toyota Production System, and have started to create new Lean techniques for the service industry. (I would suggest that some of what they are doing is what people in the process management tradition have been doing for some time, and one of the reasons people in the process management tradition have thought Lean was limited to manufacturing - but that's a quibble. They key is that they have arrived at the right solution.)The essence of Lean Solutions is the following statement: \\"Customers have a gemba, too. It's the path they follow to solve their problems.\\" In other words, if you want to find out about service processes, you go watch what customers do.Womack and Jones refer to the customer's gemba as consumption, and refer to the service company's process as the provision process. (We prefer to refer to the customer's gemba as the customer process, and the company's process as the business process, but either set of terms will do.)As Womack and Jones say: \\"Consumption is a continuing process - a set of actions taken over an extended period - to solve a problem. It involves searching for, obtaining, installing, maintaining, repairing, upgrading, and eventually, disposing of many goods and services.How does this work in practice? Womack and Jones recommend the following:*Draw a Consumption Map - a list of the steps in the consumer process. Time each step.*Determine the value of each step in the consumer process. (The time the consumer wastes.)*Determine the \\"perceptual time\\" of each step. (Is the customer happy or unhappy about waiting.)Next Womack and Jones turn to the company's provisioning process (the company's gemba), and they repeat the steps:*Draw a Provision Map - a list of the steps that the company goes through to provide service to a customer. Time each step.*Determine the value of each step in the provision process. (The time the consumer wastes.)*Determine the \\"perceptual time\\" of each step. (Is the employee happy or unhappy about the step.)In each case, the authors first create a list of steps and then shift to a diagram of the steps.The model shows where both the customer and the provider are wasting time. It does not show where the provider is producing any value time. In essence the redesign strategy is to clean up the customer process, eliminating all possible waste in the consumer process, and then to turn to the provisioning process, adjust it to support the improved customer process, and then finally, to eliminate what waste you still can from the provider process.At this point I have only considered what Womack and Jones discuss in the first 50 pages of their 350 page book. They go on the discuss how they would systematically improve the customer and then the provider processes and then move on to consider lots of other service processes and to provide lots of good advice on how to deal with a variety of service process problems.The new ideas of Womack and Jones will create some problems that they fail to address in their book. Throughout the book Womack and Jones focus on processes that have a more or less linear flow: Repairing an Car, a Patient Visiting a Healthcare Facility, an Airplane Trip. Roger Burlton and I have found that the more challenging service processes are those that are non-linear. Consider staying at a hotel. You could break the overall process into lots of little processes: Checking In, Going to a Restaurant, Spending the Night in a Room, Attending a Conference Banquet, etc. The reality, however, is that if you want to analyze this problem effectively, you have to conclude that the overall hotel process is a network and that the customer could go from one specific activity (Check In) to another (Restaurant, or Room, or Conference Lunch) in whatever order the customer chooses, and the good hotel will want to support whatever choice the customer makes. Thus, analyzing the network and determining where there is information that you gain from one activity that can improve the customer's experience at the next activity, no matter what path the customer chooses, is another key element in analyzing and designing good service processes. It would have been nice to have Womack and Jones address such a process.A subtler issue also deserved more attention. In essence, when we look at a service problem, we are looking at two processes: the customers process and the service businesses process. Moreover, they are complementary, such that, in many situations, decreasing waste for the customer must necessarily increase waste for the business. Roger Burlton describes a class in which a student trained in Lean insisted that transportation was \\"waste,\\" and that, therefore, a pizza company should not deliver its pizzas. Roger tried to explain to the student that much of the value of a pizza, for many of us, consisted in its being delivered, but he didn't convince this particular individual who was determined to eliminate all possible \\"waste\\" from the production process. Womack and Jones have solved this problem. The pizza business is a service business. We begin by analyzing the customer's process and try to make it as efficient as possible. For us, as customers, transportation is waste. We don't want to have to travel to pick up the pizza. We want to eliminate the waste by getting the pizza people to deliver our pizza right to our door when we are ready to eat it. As we maximize the value of the customer process, in this case, however, we impose a burden on the pizza company's production process. To eliminate waste in the customer's process, the pizza company needs to accept waste in its own process - it needs to deliver the pizza to the customer. Anyone working with customer processes quickly realizes that the effort to make things easier for the customer must often make things harder (more expensive) for the service provider. It would be nice if Womack and Jones had explored this issue in a bit more detail and suggested some heuristics for dealing with some of these enviable conflicts. This book will challenge the thinking of those Lean practitioners who regard Lean as a set of simple rules - it begins to introduce the complexities of BPM into lean practice.Most companies today are service companies. Most process technologies were developed to deal with manufacturing processes. We are in the midst of a transition as we all learn more about how to analyze and redesign service processes. This is especially the case when we focus on service processes that interact with the customer, and not just with back office operations at service companies. Womack and Jones have made a major contribution to this newly evolving practice. They have extended Lean to make it much more flexible and powerful, and show how to move towards a true service-oriented Lean Six Sigma approach - by focusing on the customer's gemba.Every process practitioner should read this book. It is the kind of book that changes your view of the world and forces you to rethink what you know about process work.As it happens Lean Solutions was published in 2005 and for some reason www.amazon.com is currently offering the book marked down to $7.99. That is an amazing bargain for anyone who wants to read one of the most important books published in the process domain in this decade."},{"Title":"Lean Solutions: How Companies and Customers Can Create Value and Wealth Together","review":"Interesting, but not innovative.

This is because distributed computing has a lot to offer from a technology point of view, but management of distributed systems lags behind the &quot;legacy&quot; world. My move was a lot like migrating from a predictable world of methods, processes and procedures to the wild west.Some of the specific highlights were: very clear description of client/server systems and the underlying components. I personally gained a lot from the discussions on object technology, building distributed applications, and building extensible systems. The latter was especially useful to me because it exposed me to COM, Java and XML, and how these fit into the picture. Coming from a world where the standard buzzwords were CICS, JCL and the such I needed to fully understand the world in which I now work, and this book gave me an understanding of the technical underpinnings and their strengths and weaknesses.Where this book blends the &quot;legacy&quot; and distributed worlds is in the chapters that deal with managing distributed systems. I gained two deep insights from this section: (1) managing distributed systems is a quantum leap in complexity from managing host-based systems, and (2) the processes and tools used to manage today's distributed systems have not reached the maturity of those that we used twenty years ago in the mainframe world. The authors did an excellent job of pointing out the challenges and realities of distributed systems management, and did a wonderful job of tying this to service level management using core business objectives as the bridge.This book is truly a manager's guide that covers a lot of ground in technology and processes. It is too high-level for hand's-on technical folks who have worked in distributed environments, but is a wonderful source of information for people like myself who spent most of their career in mainframes and need to evolve into this wild environment called distributed computing.

Neither directories, security, PKI, nor directory enabled networks (DEN) are adequately covered. As a matter of fact only security receives any coverage at all.Security has 11 entries in the index, but none go beyond defining the role of security. There is no mention of how to implement security in a distributed environment.Directories are not even listed in the index. Directories are crucial to the management and security of networks in a distributed environment. The directory enabled network (DEN) initiative is a standard interoperable approach that will be widely supported (if vendors are to be believed). DEN is absolutely necessary if distributed networks are to provide the reliability and security needed by enterprises.Closely related to DEN is public key cryptography (PKI) which does not even show up in the index. Enterprises building extra-nets will need the security provided by the use of PKI.These omissions cause me to give a low rating to an otherwise good book on distributed computing."},{"Title":"The Re-Enchantment of the West: Volume 1 Alternative Spiritualities, Sacralization, Popular Culture and Occulture","review":"Christopher Partridge has provided us with an glimpse into what he calls the occulture, i.e., the \\"non-Christian religo-cultural milieu...that both resources and is resourced by popular culture.\\"Arguing against the idea of ever increasing secularisation in the West, he sets forth a well argued and well documented thesis that the West is increasingly turning away from traditional Judeo-Christian beliefs/understandings and toward non-Christian spiritualities such as New Age, Wicca, etc. He cites the significant change how the occult as well as Christianity is perceived and portrayed in contemporary popular culture.For example, he documents the change regarding the efficacy and power of Christian symbols, such as a cross or holy water, in dealing with cinematic demons like vampires. In horror films of 30 years ago Dracula was terrified and literally pained to be in the presence of a crucifix. Now it is common for films in the genre to display not only the ineffectiveness of such Christian symbols as a means of combating supernatural evil, but to have the fiend express contempt for them as well. And concurrent with this devaulation of things Christian is an increase in alternative ways to dispatch and or control the demon. Thus the message is sent that the supernatural is real, Christianity is weak, lacking, or ineffectual legend created by bunch of intolerant power hungry church leaders; and there are new and improved ways and means of dealing with the things that go bump in the night.But the author goes far beyond merely looking at horror films and builds a solid case that, far from being on the verge of tossing all in favour of secularisation, the West is increasingly turning to non-Christian spiritual paths and is becoming \\"re-enchanted\\" with the supernatural. And that this re-enchantment both feeds and is fed by popular culture.I recommended this book to all pastors as well as to all who would seek to understand the \\"spiritualities\\" now sweeping through popular culture."},{"Title":"Marijuana Indoors: Five Easy Gardens","review":"Five easy gardens is what you are buying here and is exactly what you get to see.

Cavanaugh's many gratuitous acts, soon ignited into something more, and their love boiled over. But, as much as Marty is caught up in the moment, there is something unsettling about him; she just can not put her finger on it. Further investigation reveals that her apprehension is justified, Cavanaugh is not just an investigator. He is CEO of a family-owned fortune 500 company and he is being investigated for embezzlement, arson and murder. Marty's heart believes he is innocent but her head is another matter.Newcomer Elaine Overton picked a sizzling title and a sizzling story to debut her freshman novel.

Both children are used to living with someone else; whereas Chris stayed at boarding schools, Nan was raised by her grandma, who has moved into a senior citizen's community in which children can visit for short times, but cannot stay. At a nearby store, Chris finds the model of the Red Hart Inn. At night while asleep and dreaming, Chris and Nan believe they have traveled to the real Red Hart.\\"The King's Hunters\\". During the rule of King James, Chris and Nan try to save the innkeeper accused of being a priest who if true illegally owns the Red Hart Inn which is punishable by death.\\"The Gentlemen\\". The smugglers seek the wounded excise officer in order to kill him before he can identify them to authorities; he hides in the Red Hart Inn where Chris and Nan try to keep him safe.\\"Hue and Cry\\". When the fire burned down Squire Mallory's barn, Chris is accused of committing the arson that almost killed several people. Bow Street runner Harry Hawkins, a friend of the family, tries to prove the lad is innocent before an angry mob takes justice into its own hands.This reprint of a 1970s young adult tale is character driven as in between their adventures; Nan and Chris have problems at home and at school. They feel like they do not belong anywhere and reject being step-siblings. The most popular girl in class wants Nan as a friend, but at an exorbitant cost; the most popular boy in the school picks on Chris. However, their time travel \\"dreams\\" that they have shared provide confidence for both to seek the right thing. Thus the great Andre Norton provides the audience with a strong fantasy wrapped inside a poignant family drama.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Red Hart Magic","review":"This book gives insight into the history of England during one of its turblent periods. It also gives a clear look at the problems facing children in new and strange circumstances. It is great reading for early teens."},{"Title":"Red Hart Magic","review":"Chris Fitton's father and Nan Mallory's mother recently married, but this isn't the Brady Bunch by a long way. Chris has spent his life in one boarding school after another, while Nan's grandmother raised her during her mother's long assignments overseas as a photographer. Even now, Chris and Nan are living with Chris' aunt Elizabeth; their parents just got married and promptly took off for a 6 month assignment in Mexico. Neither kid has seen them since before they announced the wedding.For years, Chris' father has given him money to buy presents, since he's never with his son much himself to get to know what he'd like. When aunt Elizabeth drops Chris and Nan off at a movie soon after Nan's arrival, Chris opts to shop for a present instead. In a strange store he's never been to before, he finds a very old model inn, bearing the sign of a red hart (i.e., a male red deer).Chris and Nan soon discover that the Red Hart carries some kind of magic; in their dreams, they find themselves in the real Red Hart, an English inn, in various periods of the past.&quot;The King's Hunters&quot;, in King James' reign, finds the two of them thwarting a Pursuivant who attempts to prove that the inn's owner is secretly a Catholic priest (a capital offense in that place and time). Catherine Aird's mystery _A Most Contagious Game_ would be a good read for anyone who's interested in how priests managed to survive and the tricks used to build hiding places for them.In &quot;The Gentlemen&quot;, a wounded Excise officer is being sheltered from local smugglers in the inn. This story makes a sharp, interesting contrast to Vic Crume's _Dr. Syn Alias the Scarecrow_, a terrific book that's also a movie by Disney with Patrick McGoohan (the hardest Disney classic to find on video as of this writing, may I add). The chief of the smugglers in &quot;The Gentlemen&quot; is as anonymous as the masked Scarecrow - 'he could be any man in the village, leaving out the parson and the squire.' (If you've read or seen the Scarecrow's story, you'll get the joke.)In &quot;Hue and Cry&quot;, Chris is falsely accused of setting fire to Squire Mallory's barn, a blaze that could have killed several men. Harry Hawkins, a friend of his father's days in Wellington's army, one of the Bow Street runners, is called in by Ira Fitton to uncover the truth. (This is *long* before the runners evolved into the Bow Street Station of Anne Perry's Thomas Pitt.)In the present, the kids have their own troubles, apart from getting along with each other. Nan is 'befriended' by the most popular girl in class - only to find that the price of entry into her circle is too high. Chris, on the other hand, is the favorite target of the most popular kid in *his* school - the bully who's captain of the soccer team. The lessons they learn in the past stand them in good stead."},{"Title":"Red Hart Magic","review":"It's an interesting story but the ending is abrupt.

Well maybe not, but this book does a perfect job in helping a Windows junky like me to make the transition to Linux and never made me feel like a lost puppy. By the time I finished reading this book I was ready to dump Windows and make a complete switch... except I would lose all my fun games. The only drawback this book had was in talking about running more than one hard drive, but for my intents and purposes there couldn't have been a better way to start learning Linux, and even though version 6.0 isn't the newest anymore, I would still very strongly suggest to anyone out there wanting to learn Linux to start with this book, it will be much worth their time."},{"Title":"The No B.S.

It would also make a good tool for self-teaching or for self-led small group study. For each chapter of readings there are discussion topics, an exercise, suggestions for a debate and a selection of further reading. The wide-ranging readings are carefully chosen, edited and arranged into key themes such as morality, aesthetics, ecofeminism and environmetnal ethics in society. The only other book to cover similar material in a similar manner is Louis Pojman's 'Environmental Ethics: Readings in Theory and Practice'. In my opinion they are equally valuable, making it difficult (should it be neccessary) to choose between them. From a British perspective they both lack historical depth. Botzler and Armstrong's book has only two readings from the eighteenth century or earlier (St Francis and Kant) but this can be supplied from elsewhere if needed."},{"Title":"Graphics Programming With Jfc","review":"It says it covers the 2D and 3D APIs. However, as near as I can tell, it covers the Java 2D API in much detail. Then it covers how to do 3D using the 2D API, but never covers the 3D API directly. This is still useful because any 3D API will make certain tradeoffs and if the tradeoffs don't match your needs, you might have to implement your own 3D API using the 2D API.The book is very heavy on code examples. Each section seems to have an introduction, a code example, and then commentary on the code example. However, I think the book would be better with more text to go with the code.While I don't think the strength of this book is the cover-to-cover readability, I think it is an excellent reference resource.

Other books of the stories of Krishna would inspire me and melt my heart. This book just gave me a headache. For a devotee of Krishna, he is completely cerebral. This book is so heady that there is little room in it for heart. He tries to be from the heart. His language is from the heart. But the feeling from the book is dry and heady.

Harris, the author of \\"Georgian Syntax\\", is well known as a leading expert in the field of Georgian and Kartvelian linguistics.Her book will appeal to linguists and linguistically interested laymenalike. Her framework is relational grammar, but this is no obstacle, since her book is extremely readable and very valuable for linguists of all denominations, especially for typologists and students of linguistic universals.Alice C. Harris writes about grammatical relations in Georgian. Penetrating the complexities of Georgian morphology, she reveals theunderlying syntactic generalizations. In her rather concise presentationshe deals with topics like version, passivization, inversion, and transitivity. She shows that Georgian has constructions such as Passive,Object Raising, Causative Clause Union, and others found in better-knownlanguages. Georgian is not as different from Indoeuropean languagesas Western or Eastern Caucasian languages in its neighbourhood,but it is still a challenge for linguists. Alice C. Harris succeeds inproviding a convincing linguistic analysis of some crucial Georgian data,so many linguists may want to study her book.

She detests the patients and the staff though she likes nonagenarian dementia victim Elsie Rigsby even when the elderly woman loses her touch with reality.During a seemingly lucid moment, Mrs. Rigsby informs Sally that she has stashed away from her avaricious family a fraudulent fortune. She wants Sally to distribute the money to worthy people in need. Sally promises to do so, but the temptation to use the money to get out of her own debt is overwhelming. Yet her conscience tells her to do the good deed and trust that God will take care of her woes though with the setbacks in her personal life, Sally has lost faith. Which path will she take especially when a snake offers her the easy road?Although some readers will believe that the POOR MRS. RIGSBY is a naive look at money, Kathy Herman provides a deep character study that focuses on faith and greed. The story line follows Sally as she feels like a failed female Job with a temptation that could solve much of her woes. Ms. Herman makes a case in an age of fiscal abuse and irresponsibility by those in power in Wall St and DC that money is not the root of evil; spinning the NRA contention that \\"guns don't kill, people kill\\", people's attitude turns money into a weapon of destruction.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Poor Mrs. Rigsby","review":"It is the first time that I have read a book by this author.

It is a must when taking children to an amusement park for the \\"big kid\\" rides for the first time!"},{"Title":"Zoom!","review":"I purchased this book for my Kindermusik class of 3 year olds.

Her Macaroni and Cheese with sausage, tomatoes and cheese is awsome! Easy to assemble and very tasty."},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"This title and three others like it by Rachael Ray in the 'Top 30 30 minute meals' series are, for the content, relatively expensive and inconveniently sized volumes of recipes reprinted from Rachael's previous books. Looking through two of the titles I recognize every recipe I see from earlier books. While Rachael is the nominal author of these books, I fully believe they were assembled by her publisher and a copy editor with maybe a day's input from Miss Rachael for all four books together.This is becoming a common practice among major cookbook authors, with Mark Bittman's re-releasing his 'How to Cook Everything' in three volumes, cumulatively more expensive than the original book.One may for a moment equate these books with the music world's 'Best of' releases, but the experience is simply not the same. A 'Best of' album's tracks are based on a genuine audience vote with their purchases and air play. These recipes are simply Rachael's opinion and that of a few of her colleagues. The parallel also breaks down in the sense that listening to, for example, 'The Who's top twelve hits introduces you to a whole new experience of listening to 'My Generation', 'I'm Free', and 'I Can See for Miles' on the same album.My 3 star rating is not based on the quality of the recipes. It is a warning that these volumes are, in fact, reprints and not new recipes. So, if you already own many or most of Rachael's books already, you may be disappointed if you buy these books.One other consideration if you do NOT own any of Rachael's books is that for not too much more money, you can get 10 times as many recipes in her 'No Repeats' book of almost all new recipes.In every way, this is a better purchase than one or all of these minibook samplers."},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"These recipes are just knock-offs of the other 30 minute meal books. It's a very small cookbook, maybe a stocking stuffer? But if you own any of her other 30 minute books you've already got every recipe listed. There were very few pictures so you don't know how the recipes are suppose to actually look. Not worth the price. Each book only has 25 recipes or so...expensive per recipe."},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"This book is small but the recipes were outstanding. I was a skeptic because I thought everyone bought her books because of the show. The first recipe I made was worth the money I spent on the book. It doesn't take up much space either so don't let its size fool you. There aren't many recipes I wouldn't make."},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"COMFORT FOOD uses Ray's signature 'Top 30 30-minute meals' format for comfort food: it provides a range of dishes from an Italian-style Mac n Cheese with sweet sausage and mushrooms to Lemon-Scented Broccoli and Creamy Corn, stuffed Monte Cristo sandwiches with bacon, cranberry sauce, ham, turkey and cheese, and focuses on dishes which are quick to produce with ingredients common found in the kitchen."},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","review":"Rachael Ray's sparkling personality is reflected in this wonderful little book.

His narrative is both vibrant and very intimate, soul seeking and bluntly honest."},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Answers!","review":"At last, an Excel book that provides help and solutions in less time than it takes to complete a crash course in the program itself.

Now everyone in the department has their own copy and we all can't say enough good things about how helpful Excel 2000 Answers has been and how much more productive we've all become.I'd recommend to anyone using Excel 2000 to purchase a copy of this book and keep it within arm's reach at all times.

I have only listened to the tapes for a week and i am already beginning to feel a difference in my thinking and acting. Mr Waitley presents plenty of knowledge and usable tips on how to think and to act. I also think the series is enjoyable to listen to. There is a difference between the other books and tape series i have read/listened to. I think the biggest difference is that this one is an easy to follow complete course on how to live a successful life, whereas many others don't feel complete, just bits and pieces. I think it is the best tape series and probably the best in personal development i have ever read/heard. I will follow this program and i think it is going to make miracles in my life.

You can read the book front to back covers (which is easy to do), you can reread the mantras set in each chapter daily, without using much time. It's kind of written in a way where you can use it in everyday life for motivation. This book was written before I was born, but despite that the author references celebrities that I may or may not know, I can clearly understand his points. As another commenter said, the book is \\"timeless.\\" Anyway, I love the content and approach the author has. I have a lot of goals to focus on, this book has definitely been helpful."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"Dr. Waitley apparently spoke to my father and grandfather years ago about success, both of whom instilled in me a basic love and appreciation of life, starting with simple questions \\"is the glass half-full or half-empty?\\" He discusses the top ten qualities of a successful life, and he reminds all of us that it is so basic by taking a positive approach to life. He talks about taking action today and forget all that \\"maybe tomorrow\\" downers/patterns that keep us bogged down, and never moving to the winner's circle. Winning is so sweet and it is available by appying his formulas for for being successful. Some of the book is dated, like OJ and and his appearance in the book, and possibly some his concepts could be challenged in psychology and research, but still very appropriate and applicable to our lives today.

Worth the read."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"These inspirational and motivational tapes can really help anyone who is struggling in life with not only achieving their dreams and becoming a \\"winner\\" but just becoming a winner in the fact that they have learned how to overcome ways of thinking that are hindering them from becoming who they want to be and feeling happier about themselves, the ones they love, their job, their goals, their day to day thoughts, etc.. Dennis Waitely is so easy to listen to and also incredibly captivating with many examples of other people who had the odds against them. He give examples of how olympic contestants imagine their successful race/ stunt, etc, in their head before playing it out with their body.... how to train your mind to make things happen.The thing I like about Waitely's way is that unlike some motivational speakers, her really says everything with the focus on nurturing your human spirit. It is not the emptiness that some other motivational speakers leave you with when talking about winning... as Waitely points out, you have to love yourself before you can love others, and you have to believe in yourself, but part of that includes your connection to others. Bascially, it is not \\"all about ME\\" contrary to what other speakers may focus on. Waitely's focus is MUCH more holistic and spiritual. His voice is calming yet interesting. He keeps you wanting to listen more.I HIGHLY recommend these incredible audio books of Waitleys. You won't be disappointed and you will want to listen to them over and over, because each time you realize something new about yourself.

This author helps readers delve into our interpretations and live more functionally by thinking more rationally. Yes-- this is the time to smell the roses.

I recommend this book without hesitation, as being undoubtedly the best book I have ever read."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"Enjoying tapes, especially on self improvement, has become a part of my daily commute. I have become more critical of their content in the process. This is my second audio tape from this author and I must admit that he is among my least favorites.Mr Waitley stlye is similar to that of a football coach with too many 'one liners' we have all heard while someone humms 'America the Beautiful' in the background. It became irritating and difficult to maintain attention to his words. He is also too wordy to get his point across.I am sure there are people who appreciate this man's style and may find him dynamic. I found him less knowledgable and making up for it with his cheerleading analogies.I won't buy any more of his tapes. I prefer Brian Tracy for the same subject matter."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"I first came across the works of Denis Waitley in late 1996, as I began my first steps towards entrepreneurship. It was via audio tape, which contained most if not all of the contents of this book, nonetheless, here was a complete stranger telling Me: I could succeed, I could achieve, I could do things - encouragement I was not getting from my immediate family, my peers, my &quot;friends&quot; at that time.Someone once said: You will become like the information you input into your mind and the people you associate with. If that's the truth, then, I am indeed one step closer to where I wish to be in my life, and YOU can be there, too."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"Although there are many authors who promote personal development, few have the credentials that Dr. Denis Waitley has. And few, if any, disclose the the techniques o f the most highly successful people in the world, from top executives, Olympic athletes, POW's and scientists. Dr. Waitley shows us that total success is an ongoing process that is cultivated, nourished and shared.Another unique quality about Denis Waitley is that he truly cares about you. He wants you to win at life and The Psychology of Winning will show you exactly how to win in life. Great book. One that needs to be read again and again."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"This 1970's book is a low quality printing. Many of the ideas stated are out of date, and since proven inferior.Rather than discuss winning psychology, the book drones on about the difference between races, and ethnic backgrounds, etc.Definitely not up to the caliber of other books in the genre."},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","review":"I'd listened to a sample tape of this when I was in high school (1991). I listened to the tape so much as a kid that it fell apart. I like it a lot. It's amazing what the power of a positive mind can do. The relentless grind of time had sort of worn me down. I feel like I have new wind in my sails and I'm starting a second small business and I stay positive for the majority of things throughout my day. I don't let things get to me and I don't dwell on all the bad stuff. You gotta have a dream to make a dream come true. I think this CD can help you in all aspects of your life.

This is obviously an exaggeration. Ninety percent of this book is speculation prefaced with, \\"Winners do such and such.\\" The such and such is something that Waitley did not observe winners doing. It's his own pet religion.Another reason to avoid this book is his take on self-esteem. He fooled a lot of people a decade ago, including me, but now we know that high self-esteem is a better predictor of bullying and aggression than good grades or success. Self-acceptance is preferable. Don't ever wish self-esteem on your kids.\\"Winners use a warm, open smile to project interest through active listening. That's why we have 2 eyes and two ears and only one mouth.\\"These are prescriptions, not descriptions, of what winners do and think.How did he study \\"winners.\\" He's constantly saying that \\"winners do such and such. Winners volunteer their names first. Winners care about the environment and are against nuclear energy.\\"So what measurement or standard did you have to meet to be counted in the winners category?

As a good scholar/teacher, Dr. Waitley expands upon this truth, helping us to see it from different angles.Different illustrations and research findings are used as he builds his case in a solid manner.

Although I could do without the title &quot;dummies,&quot; the cartoons, and the jokes, the meat of this book was the best of all the others on Amazon.Most of the other books teach very little except simple popular ditties. This book actually had -- yes -- scales and other exercises for both the left and right hands, with fingering techniques simply applied, but fully explained.And for those who want some tunes, there are (in addition to the standard ditties) actually some worthwhile classical adaptions, such as some of the best-known themes from the Bach cantatas.I was quite impressed with how much basic and even intermediate material was included in the book, and explained with clarity and simplicity.Since I read music already, I was able to skip many of the first chapters and get right into the practice and technique material, so I can't comment on how clear the music-reading chapters would be for a total beginner. However, I expect that if they are as good as the rest of the material, they should be fine for that purpose as well."},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I bought this book 2 months ago and started practicing an hour from it daily. The results were shockingly great and speedy. After a week of practice I would go back and shoot through the preliminary songs as if they were child's play!My one problem with it is the way you're presented with practice material. It's never specified how long or often you should practice something before moving on. Just be patient and ONLY MOVE ON ONCE YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH A PIECE. Do that and this minor problem won't affect you at all.I really like the play along cd. It does help alot. Also, the humorous way in which you're presented with all of the material this book contains will have you learning great amounts of theory and technique without even realizing it. This book is great as a reference book as well.So, although it's challenging (sight-reading in particular), you'll soon learn that with a little consistence and assiduity you'll be on your way to &quot;tickling the ivories with the best of 'em&quot;!"},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I bought several books on learning the piano at the same time. I found this book to be the least useful. As several other reviewers mentioned, the author's sense of humor is pathetic and he tries to throw in a \\"zinger\\" every other paragraph. \\"Thats's right, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, pengiums and parakeets...\\". Believe me. I not exaggerating on this. I cringed at almost every one of the author's attempts to be humorous. However, this was not enough to discourage me from continuing to read the book. That occurred after having to read over 50 pages before the author presented the first exercise. An excercise that it does not use a middle C hand position, requires you to move your hand, does not indicate which fingers to use for which keys, etc. After looking at this first exercise, I decided not to continue. I suspect that the author has never taught a single piano lession.I also picked up two books called \\"Total Piano\\" and \\"Alfred's Basic Adult Piano Course\\" both of which I've found quite good so far.

Then I called for a professional, feeling really discouraged. This book doesn't really even let you know at what point you might sit behind a piano and actually try playing? It's that bad.So I booked myself in with a professional piano teacher who within minutes made me realise it was the book and not me. I showed her the book which she referred to as \\"dreadful and patronising\\". She won't even allow me to have it back!She then handed me these two which are ideal for the older learner:- Piano For Adults (Bastien) ISBN 0-8497-7300-8- Accelerated Piano Adventures (Faber) ISBN 1-56939-132-7The former is my slight preference but both are leagues ahead of \\"Piano For Dummies\\".

I've now progressed more in a week than I did in two months with the Dummies book.Avoid."},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"I bought this book a few years ago before taking formal lessons. My idea was to gain some basics on reading music and piano-playing before engaging a tutor. The book started out o.k. and rather helpful but went totally downhill after something like Chapter 3. When I reached page 80, I couldn't continue reading because the chapters become totally disorganized, the lessons difficult to grasp and not suited for a beginner (especially if you have no one to guide you). The author explains something, presents a short music sheet exercise for you to play and then moves on to another lesson. If you're totally new, you won't be able to tell if you're playing the exercise given correctly (e.g. how to ensure smooth/non-\\"chopping\\" playing, observing the correct tempo, counting correctly, etc.). Not having a teacher means there's no one to correct your mistakes. The accompanying CD is not of much help if you have an untrained ear.I was glad I \\"dumped\\" this book because it isn't worth the bother to finish. My advice if you are serious about wanting to learn the piano is to get a good and dedicated piano teacher IMMEDIATELY. No amount of reading could substitute having a real teacher. And your teacher will be able to recommend suitable reading materials. I'm into Grade 4 now (and my 2nd piano tutor whom I find a real gem) and when I think back to Blake Neely's \\"Piano for Dummies\\", I realize what a waste of time reading this book had been. What annoyed me most was that Neely tried so hard to be funny... peppering (and wasting) the pages with jokes... when the space could have been used for more useful lessons on playing the instrument.Overall, I do not recommend this book. There are certainly better guide books in the market as I have discovered. If you're a beginner, it's perhaps useful to start with the trusted Alfred Library/Bastian/John Thompson book-series on piano theory and practice. Good luck!"},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"Contains a wealth of music theory for the beginner, and as such it's a valuable addition to the beginning student's resources. However, it's not a really good exercise book.

I wanted to learn Electronic Keyboard and hence chose the dummies book. The first few pages were great to learn the basics. Once I crossed chapter 4 I was lost. The important thing I wanted to know was the fingerings. There is no mentioning of extending the fingerings from the basic position. I would rather prefer a lesson &amp; practice approach. When it comes to Music (instruments), the approach must be &quot;build one block over other&quot;. Precisely a strong foundation. The Author must emphasise more on practice sessions and most importantly the recommended No. of hours for an average beginner to get hold of the piece. I am sure the book will be really useful if I know the basics of (piano) music or if I'm a student in a music school.

Recommend to all with the interest."},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","review":"First, I have not read the entire book. I was in a music store and read a few pages in the front of the book that were dedicated to proper piano technique.The author makes absolutely no mention of playing with the least amount of effort let alone how to achieve that. There are concrete ways to see if you are playing with the least amount of effort; I call it the 'fly away wrist' test. If you place the non playing hand under the playing hand\\\\wrist you should be able to flick the playing wrist away from the keyboard while it is playing. If the playing hand is locked in place, you are playing incorrectly. See a teacher.Like I said, there are concrete ways to accomplish this. The author does mention hand position but he leaves out a lot of important things. At any rate, if I were to write a book on piano playing, I would have written much more on correct piano technique - several chapters, not several pages.For me, this has a very personal meaning. I am 54 years old and am a professional player. I only learned how to play correctly at the advanced age of 28. No teacher in high school or college ever made any worth while mention of how I was supposed to physically approach the keyboard. I took about 10 lessons from a concert pianist when I was 28 and he showed me in several lessons how to correctly approach the keyboard.To properly study the piano, you need a real person sitting next to you. You can teach yourself how to read, you can teach yourself music theory, but the actual playing of a piano has to be guided with a real person.I'm sure the rest of the book is just fine. You want to play the piano, get a teacher.

Other reviewers have complained about the stale jokes, but for me this was a minor irritation. Music theory can be tedious, and the typically light \\"Dummies\\" touch counteracts what could otherwise have been a ponderous read. Even bad jokes are preferable to learned tomes that take themselves oh-so-seriously.The book contains a wealth of basic and reference information, and the various issues are explained clearly, assuming no prior music knowledge. Unlike many introductory books the chapters do not necessarily have to be read in sequence (though doing so would probably provide a better basis) - the book is well structured, with lots of references to other chapters should you need clarification of terms explained elsewhere.Using a DIY book effectively instead of piano lessons obviously requires some effort from the reader's side, though the accompanying CD does help. I also liked the attention given to the various styles, from classical to rock, blues, pop, jazz, country and soul.One of the first hurdles is learning to read notes, after which things become much easier. If you want to start playing real songs and tunes as soon as possible, you'll find a few in this book, including the beautiful \\"Aura Lee\\" (made famous by Elvis Presley as \\"Love me Tender\\") which is surprisingly easy to play.On the downside, many of the other tunes serving to illustrate a point are, to my mind, not very exciting, but then having musical notation of the more modern hits would probably have increased the selling price due to royalties considerations. So, for instance, we get the traditional and rather tame version of \\"The House of the Rising Sun\\" instead of the haunting hit arrangement by The Animals, who made it famous in popular culture.When I was a kid I had a year's piano lessons, but it just didn't work for me.

It is really useful to read if you are a begginner and teaches you everything basic like you never had any musical experience before, my only problem is it could have had more tips on how to put both hands together more gracefully, as well as more left hand techniques, it seemed to focus more on the right hand. It is worth it and has a few clever pieces that will give you a smile here and there, but if you are an expert or intermediate, chances are you will know most stuff mentioned in this book and will be no help at all.

Please consider purchasing this dictionary if you speak English as a native language and truly are serious about your studies of Russian.

But contrary to their purpose, the sect instead caused widespread war and destruction. The Church of Arsenal formed as an opposing force and eventually defeated Santogique, along with the late aid of Corinthia. But elements of Santogique still survive to this day, and have infiltrated not only the Corinthians, but the highest levels of Arsenal. It is implied that it might be behind the latest conflict between Arsenal, elements in Corinthia, and Materia, exploting both sides to its benefit for an as yet unrevealed goal. In this volume, the Testarotho are sent to the ancient city of Setenburo to expose and capture city leaders that are working for Materia. To their surprise, the Testarotho are the ones who get arrested when they enter the city. Father Garrincha is accused of slaughtering an entire village because of their Materia sympathies. Garrincha, Leonedus, and the others realize too late that it's all a setup.The main reason Testarotho succeeds is that Sanbe Kei has envisioned such a rich world that has layers of thought behind it. From my experience, this is a pretty rare occurence in manga, which most of the time, even with a fantastical plot, is set in the real world. I also liked this volume a lot because it showed flashbacks of Leonedus' childhood, or what little he had of one as he trained to be a killer. It also revealed Garrincha's past and why Leonedus has such a strong bond with the man. The art is great, and even though there is a ton of action, it never becomes messy or confusing to read. There is a plot twist that borders on dumb and I'm still curious as to where Leonedus hides his 1-ton gun but these are small concerns. This is a nice read.For a lighter take on an action series with religious overtones, try the manga Chrono Crusade."},{"Title":"Testarotho: Volume 2 (Testarotho (DC Comics))","review":"All I can say is...

Johnson's A Shopkeeper's Millennium, an account of the rise of the industrial capitalists of Rochester, New York in the 1830's, in any truly socialist understanding of history the role of the class struggle plays a central role. Any thoughtful socialist wants to, in fact needs to, know how the various classes in society were formed, and transformed, over time. A lot of useful work in this area has been done by socialist scholars. One thinks of E.P. Thompson's The Making of the English Working Class, for example. One does not, however, need to be a socialist to do such research in order to provide us with plenty of ammunition in our fight for a better world. Frederick Tolles account of the importance of Philadelphia Quaker merchants in pre-revolutionary America is another such work.The last time we had heard from the Quakers in this space was as part of British historian Christopher Hill's The World Turned Upside Down, an account of the turbulent 1640-60 period in English revolutionary history where they formed one of the many sects that immerged from that experience (and were among the last armed defenders of the Cromwellian republican experiment). Well, in the reaction of the Stuart Restoration the Quakers got quiet, very quiet or immigrated from Merry Olde England. The immigrants who wound up in William Penn's Pennsylvania are the subject of this narrative. These Quakers brought their religion, but also their fierce sense of \`calling' with them. As a result, for a period anyway, they formed the mercantile elite of that colony. Moreover, their success formed an important component for the latter industrial capitalist development of this region in the 19th century.As Professor Tolles cogently point out in the post- revolutionary Stuart Restoration period of Quaker persecution two trends developed both in England and America. One was a fierce sense of communitarianism as the Quakers faced the \`world' and in aid of their fellow Quakers wherever they were and the other a need to be \`making and doing' in the world. As they gained financial success some of the rough edges of their religious experiences faded into the past. This culminated in a three-quarter of a century political domination of colonial Pennsylvania. During this period they also left their imprint on many facets of social life. Professor Tolles details those developments, as well.The good professor spent some time going through the overall Quaker experience in Pennsylvania. The successful Quaker domination of trading and the crafts has been noted above. They also placed their imprint on the financial system, the social mores of the credit system, land use, architecture, the manner of dress, education and the use of personal and social time. Some of this overlaps with the general Puritan ethic of the period prevalent in most colonies but the Quaker experience is dominated by much more anguish over the tension between individual achievement and social responsibility than the puritan ethic. That this Quaker experiment did not outlast the revolution and the rise of industrial capitalism, in hindsight, seems a forgone conclusion. But damn, that 'peace witness' concept central to the Quaker belief might have changed things around a little if they hadn't, in the end, gone quiet and introspective on us."},{"Title":"Inside Windows 98","review":"I just finished reading this book and I must say that it is a great guide for both those who are upgrading from Windows 3.11 or Windows 95.

This is a story of the reemergence of one of the Navy's oldest and premier fighter squadrons, Fighting Forty One, The Black Aces, during a war that many Americans were mostly oblivious to...the 1999 conflict in Kosovo. Here you will meet, up close and personal, many of the senior and junior officers of the squadron, the pilots and RIOs who flew the aging but still highly capable F-14A Tomcat into combat. It is a story of learning, fear, trepidation, improvisation, teamwork, and above all, honor. The \\"fog of war\\" is ever present and you will read how the Black Aces overcome many obstacles on their way to winning the fight. There are many interesting side stories described here, and those who have been close to naval aviation (as well as those who haven't) will be interested in details of the Foreward Air Controller Airborne (FAC-A)mission and the use of Tactical Airborne Reconnaissance Pod System (TARPS, unique to the Tomcat) to locate and hunt down the enemy.Black Aces High is a marvelous book that hopefully will enjoy a wide readership. It provides rare insight into the inner workings of a fighter squadron and the complexities (human and mechanical) involved in modern warfare. Mr. Wilcox is a fine author who has written other books highlighting Naval Aviation, and anyone remotely interested in the subject of aviation and/or modern warfare will enjoy reading Black Aces High...."},{"Title":"Black Aces High: The Story of a Modern Fighter Squadron at War","review":"I've read and enjoyed the author's previous books (Scream of the eagles and Wings of fury) which is why I decided to buy this one. Unlike the aforementioned books, this one concentrates on one squadron, VF-41, in one time period, the war over Kosovo in 1999. I think the author does a good job in capturing the essence of a modern fighter squadron, but in my view that is also the book's biggest limitation. The main thing that caught my attention while reading this book was all the internal politics going on inside the squadron, highlighting the role of a few main \\"players\\" that in most cases seemed more interested in furthering their careers and looking good on their CV's than anything else. By no means this is intended as a fault to be attributed to the author. This sort of internal workings will be familiar to most people in various working environments.

However, this book was right on the mark, had no embellishment and was captivating.Reading about the strikes in which I participated and the antics of squadron life brought back some great memories. Every squadron had a cast of characters that are pretty funny, but the VF-41 had a lot of larger than life personalities.If you want an accurate portrayal of a squadron at war and the thoughts which pass through pilot's heads during combat, this is a great book.Sincerely,Kurt McClungLCDR USNVMFAT-101 (exchange F-18 instructor with the Marines)"},{"Title":"Black Aces High: The Story of a Modern Fighter Squadron at War","review":"Robert Wilcox is an extremely talented military aviation writer and Black Aces High is another great effort. This is a story of a rundown squadron with low marks and low moral that is transformed into the top bombing squadron in the US Navy. When a new and determined CO, with the unfortunate call sign, Joey, takes over the squadron, he recruits the best senior pilots he can find and a handful of talented maintenance chiefs. Reminiscent somewhat of the story 12 O'clock High, Joey changes the attitude and commitment of the squadron by keen leadership, attention to detail, and care and concern for the men under him. Flying old F-14A Tomcats, recently configured as bombers, VF-41 heads in harm's way aboard the USS Roosevelt for combat duty over Kosovo. The reader gets the inside story as the pilots learn their trade through trial and plenty of error. The book is candid and reveals the squadron's early failures, frustrations and tension. From launching into storms and rain, dodging SAMs, AAA, mountain peaks, and, sometimes, the rules, to landing low on fuel, scared and exhausted, the reader is in the cockpit for all the action. Based primarily on interviews with the participants, Wilcox does a great job building the tension and developing the story. A super accolade to the author for his recognition that the reader knows what an aircraft carrier is. Understanding that carrier aviation has been around for 80 years now, we do not suffer through a yet another cook's tour of the ship, explaining that different colored shirts on the flight deck do this or that, what an LSO does, how a catapult works, what a mirror landing system is and all the other tedium that most naval writers drag readers through. If you read about baseball, you don't expect an explanation of what a pitcher does, where a batter stands, how many are on the team, etc. Thank you Mr. Wilcox, you rate 5 stars just for this! Without Allied ground forces to call out targets, the Black Aces learn how to use LANTIRN, FLIR, and TARPS systems (and a cool, new IZLID system) to hunt out an elusive Serbian military at night in bad weather. This is not Desert Storm tank plinking, but down and dirty hunting and killing among the trees. We learn these systems are not fool proof and every bomb drop is not a CNN highlight film. Its hard, its dangerous, and it takes a determined effort to get it right. Many pilots are unconvinced they can do the job and the rules of engagement, lack of information sharing among forces, and tonnage drop requirements are uncomfortably reminiscent of Vietnam at its worst. But leadership, determination, courage, and that unique quality of American innovation turn the tide. These guys soon become skilled and terribly efficient in what they do. Both Wings of Fury and Scream of Eagles are excellent. Put Black Aces High on your bookshelf right next to them."},{"Title":"Black Aces High: The Story of a Modern Fighter Squadron at War","review":"Black Aces High is an unusual book but a terrific one. Usually books about fighter squadrons give a lot of technical detail about airplanes and how they fight. Well this one does too. But that&#65533;s not the emphasis here. The emphasis is on the flyers, who they are and what they go through in a modern fighter squadron. The Black Aces fly off the USS Roosevelt. Their fighter is the aging F-14 Tomcat, still pound-for-pound one of the greatest fighters ever made. Their assignment was Kosovo, a precurser to Afghanistan and Iraq. We meet them, learn the problems they are facing, and then go to war with them. War is scary and the Aces are full of trepidation. But the core of officers mustered by and including skipper Joey Aucoin leads by example. There is a great group of younger aviators too. This is a war diary. It shows you what really goes on in a navy fighter squadron. They&#65533;re not all flag-waving heroes. But they get the job done. And its a tough dangerous job. Even the reluctant step up, which is the true definition of a hero. This story is a credit to the fighting men America produces.While there is a lot of shouting about how to do it, they are not going to be denied. The Black Aces subsequently led the bombing in Afghanistan and were later deployed to Iraq.

Robert K. Wilcox&#65533;s BLACK ACES HIGH is that kind of book. Shunning adulation and geewhiz approaches to our aviators on carriers, Wilcox takes us into the heart of a modern fighter squadron as it flys and fights over Kosovo, an important but somewhat forgotten conflict for our forces. However, the Black Aces paved the way for what was done in Afghanistan and what will be done in future airwars. The squadron is preparing to fight in Iraq. But in Kosovo, the Black Aces are thrown in to fight a war dictated by other people. The Black Aces have to learn on the job. The dangers are everywhere. They innovate, fight their fears, come up with new ways of hunting and killing. They don&#65533;t have the benefit of ground spotters so must learn, almost like detectives, how to find their enemy, which is hidden and cunning. They end up being prime factors in the capitulation of the Serbian forces. Most importantly we learn in this book how the members of the squadron relate to each other and function as aerial fighters. It is fascinating to get behind the closed doors of a fighter squadron and see what really goes on. We see the personal lives of the pilots and air crews. There is even a love story. They are Americans to be proud of.This is a must read for anyone who wants to see and understand how a carrier fighter squadron functions today in this Age of Terror. This is the new right stuff."},{"Title":"Black Aces High: The Story of a Modern Fighter Squadron at War","review":"Former Air Force public affairs officer Robert Wilcox was given a unique opportunity to write about the combat experiences of a frontline naval squadron flying the rapidly retiring F-14 Tomcat. VF-41's time in the Tomcat was usually personified with their shootdown of two Libyan MiGs in the early '80s, but their resurgence in the later '90s earned them strong praise after their conversion to the strike fighter role.Lots of attention is given to the turnaround that the skipper effected with his squadron after a few years of decline. The turnaround led to the squadron's tasking in the skies over Kosovo against the Serbs in 1999. The development of a new way to fight, and the need to train the newer, junior pilots into lethal warriors while dodging enemy fire takes up the majority of the book, and readers will come to know the members of the squadron well after Wilcox' treatment.While not as crisply written as Angles of Attack (by a former A-6 attack pilot from Desert Storm, since he was the author), the book is an uncommon opportunity to get a feel for they way that the Navy operates its squadrons, and the challenges that come with added responsibility and rank. Overall, the book makes a strong case for the Navy's ability to train and mold its leaders with a new generation of challenges, while making tis subjects all too human."},{"Title":"Black Aces High: The Story of a Modern Fighter Squadron at War","review":"Robert Wilcox follows the aviatiors of VF-41, a navy F-14 fighter squadron, as they learn a new brand of war in the skies over Kosovo in the spring air war of 1999. Though much of \\"Black Aces\\" (the title refers to VF-41's nickname) tells the same legends of naval aviation that I've read since about 1987, it does cover an important moment in the history of the F-14. Though the plane is on its way out (the Navy has already begun phasing out the earliest models, with the plane to completely exit operations by 2010), F-14's were given a late-in-life new mission of ground attack, probably meant to fill the gap between the already phased out A-6 Intruder and the not-yet-ready for primetime F/A-18E/F \\"Super Hornet\\". Equipped with laser and infra-red sensors, and armed with laser-glide bombs, Tomcat crews - pilots and radar-intercept officers - scour the hilly, forested terrain of the former Yugoslavia for Serb forces. Flying from the USS Roosevelt, Tomcats pass the mouth of the Adriatic (off the \\"heel\\" of Italy) and into Kosovo. Unfortunately, not fighting a true war, Serb forces don't attack or hide out in the open before they sweep into Kosovar-Albanian enclaves, forcing the American fliers to rely on their sensors and no-small degree of detective work to locate the enemy. For Tomcat crews, their eventual success is bittersweet: their ability adapting Tomcats to strike roles (for decades, the F-14 was a dedicated interceptor, more singular in that role than F-16 or F-15 fighters that were equipped with ground attack weapons) will do less to earn the aging fighter a reprieve than validate and pave the way for the plane that will replace it. Wilcox doesn't hint much at the \\"Supre Hornet\\" and doesn't begin to approach the controversy that the F-14 v. F/A-18E debate has reportedly ignited among naval aviation professionals. (On the last page, Wilcox mentions Super Hornet in glowing words - it's the plane of the future.)In telling his story, Wilcox follows the planes and pilots of VF-41 - from the \\"Hinges\\" (senior pilots) to the \\"Nuggets\\" (untested and sometimes not quite proficient new guys). Wilcox reveals the pressures that nearly crush the senior pilots - who must battle the poor weather and the F-14's poor serviceability as much the enemy. He also reveals the faults (and strengths) of the nuggets - at least one of whom appear to be using regulations as an excuse for their less-than-aggressive flying. Wilcox gets very close to his pilots - quoting them almost word for word. You get a sense, as he recalls individual statements - thatthere's more going on then even he understands, even if he gets enough to encapsulate some thoughts in brackets. The writing is also embarassingly bad in spots - with Wilcox often summarizing a paragraph or completing a thought with a single-sentence paragraph that makes the book sound less like a history of war than a first-grade reader. Organization could also have been improved - Wilcox starts describing the faults and strengths of a Nugget - only to tangent into another pilot before giving closure to the initial assessment of the first. We also learn fairly late in the story that one of the F-14 pilots had transitioned from the A-6, the vintage carrier-strike jet whose role the F-14 was now trying to fill. You'd think that pilot's experience would have made him a prominent member of the squadron - but not to Wilcox.\\"Aces\\" has the feeling of a rush job. Wilcox accompanied the Roosevelt doubtlessly knowing as much as the rest of us that the 9/11 attacks would reduce the Kosovo war to a blip on the minds of many Americans. He reminds us that the F-14 can be a trying plane or that landing on aircraft carriers at night or in poor weather can be an ordeal rivaling combat, but he doesn't take us inside the minds of those pilots. Wilcox likely thought that he had already done as much to humanize his pilots by showing them lose their temper, miss targets, get chewed out by superiors or by displaying questionably unagressive tendancies for a fighter pilot - and had to \\"balance\\" things to stay in the Navy's good graces.

By about halfway through, I started scanning and turning pages to find some aspect of squadron life that hadn't already been covered several times before. They fly a mission; they get shot at; they drop bombs; they talk to each other with funny call signs; they return to the ready room and yell at each other. Over and over again. The author's repeated details of each mission, and use of inscrutible call signs made the reading ponderous.What I took away from the book was the impression that Navy pilots are largely thrill seekers with big egos who don't like to be disagreed with; an impression not consistent with my own three years aboard a carrier.If you want to read this book, buy a used copy. It's not one that will live long in your reference library."},{"Title":"What Happened to Heather Hopkowitz?","review":"When Heather, from a non-observant Jewish family, spends some time with a friend from a religiously observant family (despite her mother's hesitation about the idea), she discovers there is much to respect and admire in a more religiously observant lifestyle and starts to follow it at home, trying to keep her secret from her parents.This book is good reading for high school students and advanced readers of junior high age, as well. Watching Heather discover more about her religious background can be quite enriching for Jewish students, from observant and non-observant backgrounds. Non-Jewish readers may enjoy the book as well, but may not find themselves identifying with the characters and siutations quite as much. However, if they have ever had questions about their religious background, they may find Heather's journey quite intriguing."},{"Title":"What Happened to Heather Hopkowitz?","review":"What Happened to Heather Hopkowitz? is a young adult book that would most appeal to ages 11 and up. NInth-grader Heather spends a month with a neighboring Orthodox family (Modern Orthodox from the context, not any variety of Hassidic) while her parents are away, and goes from anxious about all the things she won't be able to do (she likes her cheeseburgers with milkshakes, Friday night bowling, and bacon) to genuinely enjoying the deeper Jewish observance of her friend's family.Ultimately Heather decides to become more observant herself, setting up a conflict with her own unobservant parents as she secretly tries to keep Shabbos and kosher without letting on to her family and friends.This is a compelling story, well told, that will mostly appeal to Jewish young readers but also has parallels for any young person feeling compelled to go deeper into a religious or spiritual practice that might alarm their parents who are comfortable at their own level--it even has resonance for the many kids who would like to become vegetarian in a carnivorous family.While I don't mean to demean the significance of the spiritual side of Heather's Jewishness by such a comparison, it actually was striking to me how much of Heather's interest and ultimate observation had to do with the forms rather than the meaning of the practices. Much of her interest in observing Shabbos has to do with finding an appealing group of friends to attend shul and youth activities with rather than any deep spiritual experience--Heather spends more time scoping out a cute boy at the synagogue than she does learning the prayer service (although it's clear that she is learning more of the prayers as well). She begins to keep kosher after a month at her friend's house more because she simply loses her appetite for milk and meat together or non-kosher meat than because of any grasp of mitzvot or the meaning of the practice.Which is okay. The overall purpose of the book is to show the appeal of deeper observance, and to explore the more universal theme of the call of one's own conscience vs. desires of family and friends, and the story does that quite well. The characters are appealing and it's a quick read that doesn't get preachy, although after all of Heather's inner angst, everything does get resolves pretty quickly and neatly.As an adult reader I found myself wondering about and wanting to know more about Heather's parents--her dad, raised more observant who became non-practicing as an adult, and her emphatically non-observant mom who is ethnically Jewish but has a dislike and critical view of anything \\"too Jewish.\\" The story focuses where it needs to for a young adult book, on the inner life of the teenage protagonist, but the hints of the adults' inner conflicts were intriguing and left me wanting to know more about them.On the whole, a well written, compelling and quick read that might not have a huge audience but which certainly should appeal to many young adult readers."},{"Title":"What Happened to Heather Hopkowitz?","review":"Heather desires a more Orthodox life after she lives with an Orthodox family for a month, while her parents are on vacation. This book emphasized the struggle between Heather, who wants to become an Orthodox Jew, and her mother, who couldn't stand the idea of no twinkies, lard,frappes and hamburgers etc.If anything was faulty about this book it was the fact that it slightly over emphasized. The only other fault I could think of is that the end is too happy go lucky, too fast.

It's a wonderful book to keep looking at over and over again.The Complete Encyclopedia of Locomotives is a hardcover picture book of all of the major classes of steam, diesel and electric locomotives from all over the world. Each page is packed with color photos and text (which is secondary to the pictures)which outline the history of each country's locomotive history.The book is divided by nations. It begins with Britain and North America and then a list of european, asian and african countries. However, the book is mainly devoted to the locomotives of Europe. It is just fascinating to look at all of the different locomotive designs from all over the world, how they evolved and the future of the modern locomotive.There's also coverage of Japan's Shinkansen locos as well as a separate chapter on planned high-speed trains.There's very little coverage of EMUs and DMUs, both of which technically can be considered locomotives, but to cover these would require a much bigger book. But I still feel these should have been included more than they are in this book.The biggest disappointment to me is the sparse coverage of the American locomotive. While there are some nice pictures of early American steam locomotives, there is virtually nothing on the modern American high-horsepower diesel locomotives. No coverage of the SD70/80/90 types, or the newer GEVO and SD70Ace hybrid locomotives (maybe the latter was not well known at the time of printing). Nor was there any pictures of the famed GG-1 or UP 'Big Boy' locomotives. It's just odd that these were left out. There were several pictures of the Genesis Amtrak locomotive and the new MP36 in service by Chicago's Metra.The British section also seemed small, given their variety of diesels (which are not as attractive or as big as American diesels, but it is very sparse as well).All in all, if you have any interest in the design and history of locomotives, this is a MUST, esepcially if you have an interest in european motive power.Given that this book is hard cover and full color, you CANNOT go wrong with the price!Get one if you can!"},{"Title":"NT Network Programming Toolkit","review":"Yes, the first chapters are good.

My uncle managed a turpentine plantation during the 1930s and I worked with him several summers, helping to blaze the trees and gather the sap. I am waiting (impatiently) for Ms. Morris' next book.

Artfully done in taking you from the Civil War era to present times. A story well written. Hopefully Ms. Morris will have more for us."},{"Title":"Secret Sins of the Mothers","review":"&quot;The author, who was born in Charleston, S.C., grew up in the low country where most of her story is set. The story takes us back to the mid-1800's, just prior to the Civil War when we meet the young Margaret O'Donnell, a young woman who is the daughter of a half-Cherokee and an Irish mother. The family has a small home on the Parrish plantation, where her father, Charlie, is employed. Her mother, Sylvie, is probably the most sour and unhappy woman you'd ever expect to meet and Margaret tries to stay out of her way(and so does Charlie). When Charlie goes off to war, Margaret steps up to fill his shoes, bringing home game for the two of them to eat. She also is asked to come over to the Grenville plantation to read to the owner's daughter, Elizabeth Perry. Elizabeth and Margaret form a close relationship, so close that Margaret feels that Elizabeth is the only one she can turn to when the unthinkable happens. The story jumps back and forth from the present to the past, but that doesn't cloud the issue. In the present, Elizabeth Wilson, a descendent of the Perry family, finds an old letter in her mother's trunk. The letter leads her on a quest for answers about the family and about herself. This is a pretty fast-paced read with a couple of surprises thrown in along the way.&quot;"},{"Title":"Secret Sins of the Mothers","review":"\\"Secret Sins of the Mothers\\" is the first of what is now the three-part Mockingbird Hill series written by Dorothy K. Morris, a native of Charleston, South Carolina. Most of this first novel is set in rural South Carolina during the Civil War, but the story is not really about the war. Many of the male characters in the story go off to fight for the Confederacy, but that is to allow the focus to be on the women they leave behind and the relationships they form during a time when survival matters more than class (at least to most people). However, part of the story takes place in the present, among the ancestors of the people we meet in the past.The story starts in the fourth decade of the 19th century when a half-Cherokee Indian by the name of Charlie O'Donnell decides the time has come for a wife. He finds one in Sylvie Sharp, an indentured servant who worked two consecutive contracts because her younger sister died on the ship from England to the United States. The marriage is of convenience and nothing more, and produces a daughter named Margaret for Sylvie's dead sister. But before Margaret is even born in this story, a woman named Elizabeth Perry reads a pair of desperate letters written by Margaret to another Miss Elizabeth from Tally's Nook, South Carolina, on November 30 and December 6 in the year 1864. This is how we are introduced to the mystery that winds its way through Morris' first novel.I am in the habit of taking the book jacket off of a hardcover book like \\"Secret Sins of the Mothers\\" and putting it away when I start to read the book without paying attention to the cover art or anything the publishers have to say on the back or the flaps. That was a good thing in this case because the cover art by Vanessa Aeriane Vermond captures the pivotal event that happens at the end of Part 2. I was surprised when this happened, so I was happy that I did not look at the cover and that I ignored the reproduction of the cover art on the title page as well. The same thing applies to the back of the book jacket, which in the first sentence after the title gives away the key things that happens in the novel. I appreciate that readers usually need some sort of hook to get them interested in a new reader, but I had the third book and was not going to read it without reading the previous two novels first. That fact that an author gets to the third volume in a series is a pretty good sign and if you are interested in stories set during and after the Civil War that could be enough to recommend these books as well without knowing the specifics of this tale of mystery and romance. So my advice is to pay not attention to the dust jacket of this book.The other important thing to know is that Morris tells her story briskly. Charlie O'Donnell usually makes his living making turpentine and I know plenty of authors of books like this one that would go to great lengths to work in all of the details of a process like that into a novel (if they are Jean M. Auel, of course, then they actually would have done it for real). Consequently, there is an economy of story telling her that keeps you involved in the story. I have a preference for what is happening in the past rather than in the present in \\"Secret Sins of the Mothers,\\" and to tell the truth Morris would have maintained my interest without the modern part of the story. That is where Morris wants the payoff for this story to be found, and I can certainly follow her reasoning for wanting to play it that way, but that is not the most captivating part of the tale. Now I am hoping that when I pick up the next Mockingbird Hill novel,\\"Coyotes of Creek Crossing\\", that a lot of the things Morris quickly at the end of Chapter 13 of this book will be fleshed out more fully. The important thing is that I want to find out more about what happens to Margaret O'Donnell (plus I am betting Charlie comes back from the war)."},{"Title":"History, Buddhism, and New Religious Movements in Cambodia","review":"The chief benefit I found in reading this book was that it opened my eyes to new categories of thought when contemplating religion in Cambodia. It caused me to take seriously the matter of the Buddhist nuns; showed me the existence of various cults and powerful spiritual figures that mix Buddhism and animism; informed me about some key figures in Buddhist history in Cambodia, and led me to consider how Cambodians abroad interact with religion here in Cambodia today.Major disappointment: the book did not teach much about real Buddhist belief, and, what it did say was obviously arrived at through the \\"armchair theologian\\" approach to studying a foreign culture.

If you want to know how a Cambodian views his religion, this book is not for you.Several of the chapters are written poorly to the point that the thesis is almost unintelligible. Fortunately, the introduction to each section states in clear terms what the thesis of each chapter is. Highly scholastic work does not need to be difficult to read.

Here we can find the paintings of Edward Hopper turned into poems as footnoted by St. Augustine's words in the Confession, Thucydides and Virginia Woolf conversing about war, and a host of other characters summoned in the forefront of contemporary image-making: Sappho, Artaud, Tolstoy, Lazarus, Antigone, Akhmatova.

Her far-reaching vocabulary touches various human endeavors like myth, archaeology, science, history. Because of this pre-occupation with facts and quotes, Carson has debunked the lyric, freeing words from imposed musicality that poetry is almost always made to assume. Her poems are minefields, nuclear antechambers, blackholes. They are reckless, energetic, centrifugal.

Nevertheless, the quality of writing and intellect at work here is absolutely stunning--and makes Anne Carson one of the most exciting, adventurous, and brilliant lyrical poets I've been reading. Unlike the &quot;glass&quot; essay in &quot;Glass, Irony, &amp; God,&quot; you will not get anything remotely resembling an intimate first person narrative here. If that's the kind of poetry you're looking for, this is definitely not the book for you. On the other hand, if you're looking for expanded possibilities in lyrical writing--the lyric operating in an intellectual/philosophical arena--or you enjoy experimental lyrical poets--then this book is well worth the money. It's a sheer tour-de-force in intellectual imagination and breathtaking lyrical lines that spin intelligently, if not emotionally, as some of the reviewers here have cited as a criticism."},{"Title":"Men in the Off Hours","review":"... Anne Carson's two previous books string their wonderful perturbations along narrative lines, but \\"Men in the Off Hours\\" is a deliberately unstrung chaos, which Carson calmly, almost academically sorts through.

Carson's deftly goes into the minds of these greats and with convincing conviction from the female brain, not just a female perspective compared to that of a dominating male perspective. These poems are skillful and some will not doubt argue brilliant. These poem's flaws (both individually and collectively) are that they go only far enough to engage the mind, ignoring the rest of the reader's body. No chills. No growls. No tears. No laughs. This leaves us with beautiful, but flat poems. This is a sad departure from Carson's last book, _Autobiography of Red_. Some of the poems fall apart due to meticulous overwriting as in the case of the Tolstoy selection of \\"TV Men\\" where Carson combines her own lines with Tolstoy's giving far too much precedence of the intellect of the poem over the rest."},{"Title":"Men in the Off Hours","review":"As is to be expected from Anne Carson, the breadth of her knowledge results in thought-provoking writing even when it fails as &quot;poetry&quot;.

It's true--I think--that Carson is very likely a genius. Her debut, as far as literature is concerned, was about as great a collection as any published that year: Plainwater. But here, in her fourth collection, the follow-up to the woefully over-hyped &quot;Autobiography of Red,&quot; Carson is struggling to &quot;make&quot; poetry--out of appropriated texts, out of nonsense, out of little precious epigramatical sayings. . .it's a hodge-podge that makes little sense as a collection, and whose individual poems make even less of an impression.If I have my math right, Carson has averaged about a book every other years since the mid-nineties. I think she needs to take a break. I think she needs an editor. I think she needs to stop paying attention to the folks who so eagerly want to claim her as the late twentieth-century's answer to the American tendency to love the unknown writer late discovered in his or her life, a la Dickinson, Clampitt, etc."},{"Title":"Men in the Off Hours","review":"This review appeared, with discussions of Giacomo Leopardi and Jane Cooper, April 20, 2000, in the Seattle Weekly and is available online at http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/0016/arts-lightfoot.shtmlAnne Carson's two previous books string their wonderful perturbations along narrative lines, but &quot;Men in the Off Hours&quot; is a deliberately unstrung chaos, which Carson calmly, almost academically sorts through.

Men in the Off Hours, her first book since Autobiography of Red, is a mess. I don't know how else to describe it. It's not that I'd expect an easy read after her last book--just a consistent one. There are poems in here that first appeared in prose elsewhere and now are in lines! This suggests a lack of understanding of the line and its history and uses on the part of the writer, which shocks me since Plainwater and Autobiography of Red I truly liked.I would not suggest this book if you like Anne Carson. It will disappoint you!"},{"Title":"Men in the Off Hours","review":"Exactly when did Anne Carson become the biggest thing since Bishop? Why these last few books of hers have sold as quickly and as widely as they have (she's the best-selling poet in America, supposedly) is a question for posterity, I guess. Whether we'll be reading her in twenty years is hard to say, but in light of the gimmicks she's been pulling out of her sleeves lately it's likely we won't even remember her in less than a decade. Plainwater is brilliant. Glass, Irony and God is very interesting. But Autobiography of Red and this new book, Men in the Off Hours, are both examples of a writer pushing too hard to make a mark; and, in the case of Men in the Off Hours specifically, she's also pushing too hard to simply fill out a book. Every other poem in the book is something she calls an &quot;Epitaph&quot;: trite, gimmicky, nonsensical clever turns of phrase without any literary or emotional or even intellectual pay-off that have become all the rage lately in graduate writing programs and lit magazines. Add to this her usual tricks (interviews with dead authors, prose converted into flat unimaginative lines, etc.) and what's left are about a half dozen interesting works that should have been the starting point for a book still long in the making."},{"Title":"Men in the Off Hours","review":"Anne Carson continues to be one of the most interesting poets working today. Her translations of Catullus depart violently from the original Latin in text while staying remarkably true to the sentiment.

I really tried to appreiate the experimentality of it, but I couldn't, because I realised I was readin it more for the sake of reading, &amp; because I enjoy reading,than because this book is any good. I know a lot of unskilled teenagers who write dada-influenced poetry that's much more interesting than this uninspired book; I don't see what makes Anne Carson so special. 1 star because it's not a good book. 1 more star, bringing the total to 2, because I feel bad just giving it 1 star.

The poems are so terrible that by the time I got to the essay at the end about hot &amp; cold symbolism for the writers of antiquity I was so upset with the book that I just couldn't care about anything in it. These poems don't sound good. If nothing else, there should at least be the sound. &amp; in any other respects, the experiments are to no end in themselves.

There is a long essay in the book titled IRONY IS NOT ENOUGH: My Life As Catherine Deneuve that is at once moving, sexy and intelligent. There are also a sequence of poems about Hoppers paintings, paired with St. Augustine's Confessions that show perfectly how Carson dances on the fault lines of the modern and the ancient.

If so, then this book fails from the top down, for the characters lack credibility and are as one-dimensional as they get. The author does make an ineffectual play for the reader's emotions by giving them personalities that are mired in a need to be loved and/or accepted, but the gambit is made too openly and in such a cliched fashion that the first response of a reader is to pity them, followed quickly by despising their personas.The plot too, is without sparkle, and could have easily been lifted from any B-, C-, or indeed un-graded movie.Perhaps this novel shows all that has become bad about the publishing industry, where things like editing appear to be discounted completely. Doors spontaneously open and shut themselves, punctuation is sporadic at best, and the writer has taken the lowest and simplest form of shortcut when she decides to convey information, by using a succession of adverbs: feebly, repeatedly, clumsily. Dreadfuly.That said, the final two pages or so seem to evince real care, as the story is finally wrapped-up and of course by then, the devotion was some 370 pages too late.I've seen first drafts that are more polished.Like the first reviewer here, I too am glad I borrowed this tome from the local library, rather than paying good money for it."},{"Title":"Sleeping Cruelty","review":"I rather like Lynda LaPlante's stories and writing, particularly her Trial and Retribution police procedurals.

The characters, particularly Justin and Laura Chalmers and Sir William Benedict, were well-drawn, their dialogue believable. The plot, beginning with Sir William's sponsorship of a promising politico, Andrew Maynard, builds up well. The only thing I found slightly unbelievable was the characters' opinion of Sir William as a fool. While they might disparage his origins and lack of ease in high society, any man starting from nothing to build a financial empire would be grudgingly acknowledged as having some sort of know-how. The ending itself was also weak, with the near psychotic Laura happily ensconsed on a paradise island with Sir William as her mentor, her dead but murderous yet still charasmatic brother Justin everpresent. The whole idea of Sir William's buying/developing the island might seem unlikely, but people who have lots of money can do and get most of what they want."},{"Title":"Sleeping Cruelty","review":"A complete waste of space - this book has no literary value, it is so implausible that it is not even entertaining from a 'light read' perspective.The characters are ludricrous, the plot is full of holes and ridiculous and the whole premise of the book is flimsy.I have read Cold Heart, Cold Blood and Cold Shoulder by this author and really enjoyed them - I know she is a talented television script writer.

When I was in a bookstore a few months ago I found a copy of The Rebel, which is apparently a rare sight these days, since The Rebel is often ignored. Camus is one of the most famous writers of the 20th century, so why would one of his masterpieces be ignored?It has been ignored, from what I can gather, because it is a philosophical work in which Camus pulls no punches and examines thoroughly why the excessive crime and violence of our era exist. Camus explains how, in both philosophy and politics, the reigning attitude has been one of nihilism for the past two centuries. This nihilism, being necessarily without an aim, leads to dictatorship and gross amounts of suffering for humans, no matter what principles it claims on the surface. Camus systematically destroys those who have used the philosophies of Hegel, Nietzsche, Marx, surrealism, u.s.w., to justify their murderous plots.Camus proposes that instead of nihilism and murder, we take to heart the ancient concepts of moderation and responsibility. Camus' destruction of modern governents and his proposals of these ancient ideas seem to have made this book unpopular. In this era of oppression, it is easy to ignore what offends us or makes us think. Camus gives the reader no choice. He must either raise a defiant fist to the giants of power, or he must give way to these minds that are utterly without scruples. I admire Camus deeply because of this--he has summed up the ideas I have been carrying around for years--but some will be deeply hurt by his comments. I leave you with a final thought: everyone is partly to blame for the state of the present and the future. You have the choice to make it either good or bad."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"I wrote my college entrance essay on this book (Let's not say how long ago, but I was accepted.) and just recently went back to reread it and compare my impressions now to my impressions then, when it was one of my favorite books. I found it still holds up as a fine piece of literature as well as an inspiring example of personal courage. As another reader has pointed out, Camus was ostracized, more or less, by the French literary establishment after the book's publication. I still find the chapter on metaphysical rebellion the best. Camus has a fine understanding of the English Romantic poets and what, for many, their rebellion consisted of: &quot;The Byronic hero, incapable of love, or capable only of an impossible love, suffers endlessly. He is solitary, languid, his condition exhausts him. If he wants to feel alive, it must be in the terrible exaltation of a brief and destructive action. To love someone whom one will never see again is to give a cry of exultation as one perishes in the flames of passion. One lives only in and for the moment, in order to achieve 'the brief and vivid union of a tempestuous heart united to the tempest'(Lermentov)&quot; This is as an acute a dissection of the raison d'etre of the &quot;Byronic hero&quot; as I've read in any English criticism (and believe me, I've read a lot!). The passages on Nietzsche are also exquisite. He gets to the root of many of the great thinker's ideas by quoting the lines that come from the heart: &quot;the most painful, the most heartbreaking question, that of the heart that asks itself: where can I feel at home?&quot;-The passages on Milton are exquisite as well.-The whole book is a well-rounded philosophical enterprise that touches both the heart and the mind. This is not sentimentality, as one reviewer contends (such criticisms usually come from those jaded souls who have had their hearts burnt out in grad school). It is decency...unshakable decency, according to the review by the Atlantic on the back cover of my edition. I recommend this book to anyone interested in the wherefores behind man's many different states of rebellion. It is the best and most readable I know of."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"In his novels -- short and to the point -- Camus strove to embody a philosophy. THE REBEL, probably his best, most sustained work, talks about that philosophy at length. He takes something of the same viewpoint as Robert Lindner -- who insisted that the rebellious and protestant in man is what is best in him, not the docile and quiescent -- and explores that viewpoint exhilaratingly and totally. He also does something no modern philosopher or critic has done well, to my mind, which is give de Sade a proper shakedown. (Most intellectuals who have a flirtation with de Sade's writings and pseudo-philosophy -- not all that far removed from Ayn Rand's, come to think of it -- wind up contriving some kind of argument for the man as a martyr of intellectual freedom. Nothing could be further than the truth, and Camus makes a good case for that.) The best thing about the book is its tone -- lofty without being snooty, intellectual without being distant, and passionate without being sentimental. It's not a hard read, and it has the flavor of a conversation with a man who makes you stop and say to yourself, &quot;Yes -- why didn't I think that before, in so many words...?&quot;"},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Critics of Albert Camus consider L'Homme R&eacute;volt&eacute;, or The Rebel to one of Camus' most important non-fiction works. While Le Mythe de Sisyphe is far more polished, The Rebel is the most comprehensive exploration of Camus' beliefs. There are weaknesses in The Rebel, as in most rhetorical works, but the public found the work accessible and, as a result, made it a bestseller.The book begins as an essay &quot;Remarque sur la r&eacute;volt&eacute;,&quot; written in 1945. This &quot;Commentary on Revolt&quot; attempted to explain Camus' definition of the word, &quot;revolt.&quot; In the essay, Camus' explains that a revolt is not the same as a &quot;revolution.&quot; Camus' lexicon define &quot;revolt&quot; as a peaceful, evolutionary process. He had hoped that mankind would evolve toward improved societies. In his ideal, socialism is the result of a natural historical process that does require effort and leadership, but not violence.&quot;Remarque sur la r&eacute;volt&quot; begins with a civil servant refusing an order. For Camus, revolt begins with a single person refusing an immoral choice. Laws and rule are not defensible for Camus unless they are meant to help society at all levels. The civil servant in the opening parable is an existential hero, though Camus would have rejected such a label. The bureaucrat makes a decision based not upon what is easiest for him but what is best for him and society as a whole. This man's revolt is resistance, not violence.Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's works are the primary target of The Rebel. While not a perfect treatment of Hegel, Camus argues that Hegel's works glorified the state and power over personal morality and social ethics. Worse, according to Camus, Marxism co-opts Hegel and extends his theories to allow any means to an end. In Marxism, as embodied by the Soviet Union and its Communist Party, the state is always &quot;right.&quot; Humanism and equality were important to Camus, not an artificial organization.Camus further offended some leftists by opposing what he considered a trend toward nihilism in European thought. Life was &quot;meaningless&quot; for Camus, but each person did have the opportunity to define a role for himself or herself in life. Nihilism rendered living pointless, which Camus could not accept. Mankind, by its very existence, was in the unique position of defining itself through choice.Attacking Hegel, Marxism and nihilism resulted in a resounding rejection by the left. Leftist critics hated The Rebel and described it as an act of intellectual treason. The May 1952 issue of Les Temps Modernes featured a review of The Rebel by Francis Jeanson. The review affected Camus deeply. Camus found himself described as a traitor to the left and Jeanson suggested no one should be critical of progressive ideas, even when the actions of the left might be &quot;wrong.&quot;The review in Les Temps Modernes marked the end of Camus' relationship with Jean-Paul Sartre. As editor, or director, of the magazine, Sartre exercised a great deal of control. Camus knew that Sartre must have agreed with the review at some level. Camus was compelled to write a response to Jeanson. In his response, Camus tried to explain his belief that the ends, or at least the goals, do not justify the means in many cases. Sartre then published an open letter to Camus. Sartre, himself, wrote nineteen pages, including some very personal attacks. As a result, the friendship was over forever.While not the primary work cited, the 1957 Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Camus in part due to The Rebel."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Camus' The Rebel is the first book of his that I had the great pleasure of reading. Eloquent and enlightening, The Rebel speaks to me in a way that no other 20th century philosophical work has, at least in its entirety.The Rebel is both an introduction of new ideas and a history of previous ideas and events: Camus' scholarship is unbelievable in the area of revolt. It spans from early greek history and earlier all the way through to the French Revolution and beyond.I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone concerned with spiritual, historical, or any kind of rebellion - and really to anyone who concerns themself over the human condition."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Of course, this book has not been totally forgotten, but for what a good piece of work this is, it is largely negelected. Flat out, I find this book Camus' masterpiece and if all his other books were destroyed, this one alone would make him seem genius....Why is this book so good? First, it provided a reading list for me, an American, to learn the basics and the names of some of the most important French and European thinkers in the past five hundred years and an impetus to read them (such that I could agree or disagree with what Camus said about them). Second, the book made me think, and made me question, in the logical, precise, but human way that Camus did (which is an invaluable tool for anyone just starting out in the world). Third, in this book you get to see a great swath of history unfold through one of the greatest writers/minds of the twentieth century. How cool is that?I highly reccomend this book to anyone to read. Especially, though, I recommend this book to anyone just starting out on a path in the social sciences or law (who thinks about 'things that matter....') or to anyone going through post-adolecent pangs of conscience....This is the first book that I'd read of Camus if I were new to him too...."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Without straying into the dogamtism or the sentinmental romantic mindset that Camus warns of, this book had a profound affect on me as it helped me reconcile my 'reasoned' agnosticism and irreligion with my 'intuitive' socialism. I have since come to the conclusion (with the help of Camus) that both the above aspects of my world-view are logical, and perhaps most importantly,that it is necessary to temper whatever ideolgies you happen to find yourself agreeing with, your own intuitive morality.This is in my opinion the crux of The Rebel as Camus examines the history of religous (metaphysical) and social rebellion. From the Marquis De Sade and Neitzche in the former to the French Revolution and USSR in the later.Camus seems to have started from a point of being at a loss to explain the seeming contradictions in apparently well meaning revolution's that dole out (or promise freedom over here) and practice tyranny over there. Camus shows the depth and originality of his thinking by showing that these contradictions can be seen as the logical conclusions to total obediance to the doctrines of Marx, Hegel and Rosseau amoungst others ( these contradictions are found in the works themselves of Marx et al as these thinkers have been 'slaves' to their own logic which can be seen as analagous to Weber's notion of 'over-rationalism' and the 'iron cage' ). The result is a wise and profound analysys of social rebellion and a proscription for future reform as well as presenting a kind of 'eudaimon' for the contemporary existentialist."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"\\"The Rebel\\" is a meaty and insightful \\"essay\\" with Camus telling his account of rebellion beginning in the mid-1750s and alluding to Greek mythology to answer the question stated below for 20th (now 21st) century living.

But he does offer struggles, hard work, and rebellion in the name of the humanity we all share. Robert Kennedy often quoted Camus, including The Rebel, before he was killed.

Albert Camus is one of the most profoundly influential thinkers of this century. The Rebel is a definite must read for lovers of L'etranger and Myth of Sisyphus. Camus maintains his signature style of short, simple yet hard-hitting sentences that leave a lot to the imagination, thus giving the reader a chance to re-create their our vision. One of the best writers to come out of France, Camus' sharp eye toward the French Revolution shows how inevitably the course of revolution leads to tyranny. Much like his predecessors such as Kierkegaard and Dostoevsky, Albert Camus writes with an unshakable decency and his work is eloquent and supremely rational."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Building on his former essay \`The Myth of Sisiphus', where the view of an absurd world culminated in suicide, Albert Camus analyzes here rebellion against the absurd, the affirmation of life: \`I rebel, therefore we exist'.He examines critically metaphysical and historical rebellion for freedom and man's dignity. Moreover, he asks the all important question: why are rebellions mostly ending in (and justifying) murder, under the flag of freedom or reason (logical crimes) with philosophy as an alibi? For A. Camus, the will to power takes the place of the will to justice.Metaphysical rebellionThe metaphysical rebel protests against his condition in the world, against the whole of the creation, its injustice and its evil, and also against death.The father of all rebels is Prometheus (\`see the injustice I have to endure').The Marquis de Sade proclaims unbridled personal freedom, absolute negation and universal destruction. Stirner proclaims universal affirmation of the self, while Nietzsche proclaims active nihilism: every man has to make his own laws.The surrealists also proclaim absolute personal freedom with \`gratuitous acts' as satisfactions of one's instincts and one's unconscious.All those metaphysical rebels want to control totally their own world and construct for them a pure terrestrial kingdom.Historical rebellionThe history of man is the sum of his successive rebellions. Freedom and man's dignity are the motivating principles of all revolutions. But, when justice demands the suppression of freedom, terror consummates the revolution. Justice adopts violence and murder and the revolutionaries assume the responsibility of total guilt.J.J. Rousseau formulated the concepts of the Republican State with law and order based on the general consent.Saint-Just wanted the Republic to be totally cleansed of all alien elements.Hegel's dialectic of master and slave (the conqueror is always right) culminates into the absolute State, \`the reflection of the Spirit of the world in the mutual recognition of each by all.'But, in the absolute State, the will to power replaced the will to justice.Fascism dreamed of liberating a minority by subjugating the rest.Building on Marx' prophesy of the abolition of the State, Lenin's professional revolutionaries organized Russian Communism aiming at liberating all men, but, by provisionally enslaving them all.Trade-unionismOverall, man's dignity and living standard (freedom) have only been served, not by doctrine, dogmas or abstract concepts, but by concrete revolutionary trade-unionism. Only by organizing the labor force and by strikes have the working conditions been mightily improved from a 16 hour work day to a forty hour work week.Albert Camus expressed impressively his personal views on the history and the deadly dangerous human rebellious condition, which are still highly relevant today.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Camus' The Rebel has stood the test of time and will continue to educate, inspire and empower those who read his essay. This book influenced MLK who understood the spirit of rebellion and applied it's principles. Whether we talk Gandhi, Sade, Kerouac, Hunter S. Thompson, Dean, Brando... the list goes on. With rebellion awareness is born. Read The Rebel and change your life... quit your job. End a dead-end relationship. Move on. Fight a law. Disagree with someone. Color outside the lines. Say no. Say no instead of yes. Start a revolution and change the world. Sedition is the way to a better existence."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"This is largely the explanation behind all of Camus's works. Everything Camus ever wrote, from &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot; to &quot;The Plague,&quot; had some form of rebellion. What kind, though? In order to understand, you must read this book. There are different types of rebellion (metaphysical and romantic), and different types of circumstances surrounding both. Camus seeks to explore individual's humanity through the notion of rebellion.This book is not for the faint of heart, but Camus fanatics will enjoy this extremely well-written work."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Very Camus from start to finish. Not one of his 'easier' reads. If you are looking for something light...this is not it. A deep look into the mind of the late Albert Camus. Must read for a fan of Camus"},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"This book followed his 'The Myth of Sisyphus'. Camus explains in the beginning that while his previous work was about the question of suicide, this one is about the other aspect of taking human lives - other people's lives (murder). The book however is not so much about murder, as it is about the ethics of rebellion.At a deeper ideological level, Camus was reacting to the excesses of Soviet style communism with which he disagreed. He felt that rebellion is always at the risk of falling prey to the very tyranny it revolts against and destroys.Camus however does not believe that rebellion is therefore not desirable. His humanitarian ideals harmonize with the dream of rebellion. So he tries to answer the question of how rebellion can escape falling prey to tyranny, albiet unsuccessfully, by taking the examples of Russian nihilists who fought tyranny through murder, but nevertheless punished themsleves for that act (because the act of murder becomes tyrranny if routinized).In all his works, Camus is generally good with analysis but poor in his conclusions. This book is brilliant for its analysis of the ethics of rebellion and the dilemmas of a rebel. It raises important questions and leaves you free to find your own answers. That also harmonizes better with the spirit of existentialism."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"Camus' quasi-coherent point takes a back seat to his insightful historical analysis. It's worth reading for the historical info, rather than his elusive point."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"In The Rebel, Albert Camus, the master of existentialism, analyzed the spirit of rebellion from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution. The Jacobans, rebelled against King and God and by making their principles divine, introduced the Reign of Terror.Nihilism went further and eliminated absolute principles and its rise during the second half of the nineteenth century created terrorists who renounced virtue and principles and who rebelled against reality and history by destroying them. From the killing of gods to the killing of kings, rebellions had ushered in the terrors of Hitler and then of Stalin. The Soviets, in the name of the classless society in the future, a new heaven and a new earth where the lamb and the lion coexist, justified violence to guide the path of civilization, to force the end of history, the Marxist utopia.Camus stated that absolute freedom leads to injustice and absolute justice stifles freedom and demonstrated it with examples from the French Revolution to the Russian Revolution. And he believed that only through moderation, by limiting freedom with justice and vice versa, could a possible solution emerge.Events in the past several decades have shown that his statement remains relevant in our time. From Timothy McVeigh to Anders Behring Breivik, we have seen terrorists kill in the name of their freedom, their absolute freedom, and of justice, their notion of absolute justice."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"This is a really fine work. The essays trace the development of rebellion in the twentieth century and show how the rejection of God, nihilism, and power lead us to terror. His readings of Sade, Nietzsche, and others are deft and insightful. His prescription for a careful solidarity, and for thinking through where and how we draw boundaries is timely. Camus asks us not to draw boundaries to exclude and create the &#34;other,&#34; but to mark spaces of value. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"The product arrived on time safe and sound. The product was covered against any kind of damage. Thanks for the good work!"},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"This can be both an easy and difficult read depending on how deeply you'd like to think about Camus' ideas. He is definitely passionate when thinking about the theory of rebellions and revolutions, but you can tell he is different than most philosophers. Instead of an A + B = C approach, Camus is more focused on arguing his points by presenting history. It's a great read and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"i dont know if my last review came through, so i am just writing this one to see if this comes through it is just a test"},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"after being introduced to camus, i have read all of his works from the fall to his notebooks. i am not a scolar and after reading this you will see a lot of words spelted wrong oh well. my review is simple it is a work of art, starting with his wise and elogent dismantling of the marquie de sade, who saw rebellion in its most nililistic form, however camus notices sade'w rejection of capital punishement. move's from sade to the revolution and on to the works by hegal, marx, and nietzsche; to name a few, there is a lot more. show's his respect for the organization for combat of the Socialist Revolutionary party. this book is and should be a manitory read for all people of all races. the principle of &quot;nessisary but inexcusible&quot; is the call of the rebel."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"The book highlights the refractories of thoughts ,that the european mind has gone through , over a period from the dawn of history to our times ,in it's process of development to its present form.The classroom language makes it a formal read though."},{"Title":"The rebel: An essay on man in revolt =","review":"I have never read a book by Camus I didn't like, and this series of essays on man's inclination if not inborne need to rebel is one more example how how Camus has cemented himself as one of the greatest authors of the twentieth century.I only wish I had read this book when I was younger, I would have gained a better navigator for my own rebellious nature.

Though it contains a wealth of factual data, Camus's examination of the paradoxes of revolt misfires on account of the faulty premise of its argument: that revolt is an act by which the individual rebel somehow invokes, in the intention behind his deed, the welfare of others. Any other form of revolt that licences the murder or enslavement of a fellow human being as a means to and end, violates, in Camus's view, this human bond implicit in the genuine act of rebellion. The rest of the book is an elaboration on this theme and the result is a splendidly written, frequently opaque and - (what is most regrettable) - barely coherent and sometimes pretentious treatise. Camus offers some valuable insights on how movements laying claim to liberal ideals degenerate, once they are established, into monolithic despotisms. It is interesting how this work, written in the aftermath of the Second World War, which witnessed the genocide of millions, marks a dramatic change of attitude in Camus, from being the out-and-out existential nihilist of &quot;The Outsider&quot; to becoming a humanist &quot;value-nihilist&quot;. It is a pity that the convictions of such a profound and individual thinker were not strong enough bulwarks against the enemy of all clear thought: - sentimentality."},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","review":"Although its not the most memorable of Ice's releases. I mean how could you ever top the rawness of PIMP or the drama of Mama's Black Widow, but if you really read this book you will see the sad and vulnerable side of this 'strong' man. I enjoyed the book, the most touching parts of the book were the letter to his Papa, his rap of the pimp game, and the one that stuck with me the most was the story of his goddess. I had to take a break after reading that one. I felt his pain every brutha has had their heart broken. Powerful stuff!! Also Ice explores the relationship with black males and white women and white males and black women. Ice says the things we are all afraid to say. He definitely invites you into his world and it will forever remain etched in your mind.Great novel. I'm only 16, but after 30+ years I can still relate to this late brutha he was a pure ghetto genius only person that ever came as close to him in ghetto story telling was Tupac."},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","review":"This book is a warmer side to the pimp saga. The iceberg is melted away and the heart of Robert Beck is revealed. This book in some ways is stronger than his first book &quot;Pimp&quot; but falls short in other areas. I recommend first &quot;Pimp&quot; then &quot;The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim&quot;."},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","review":"In &quot;The Naked Soul Of Iceberg Slim&quot; Robert Beck (street-named Iceberg Slim) tells stories from his life. Mr. Beck describes his anger and resentment at white society's treatment of black people. He describes his dealings with the Black Panther Party and his admiration for the young Black Panthers.Mr. Beck dedicated this book to a number of black luminaries including Malcolm X. Mr. Beck also mentions Malcolm X. I compared this book to &quot;The Autobiography of Malcolm X&quot; by Malcolm X and Alex Haley (co-author). Mr. Beck discusses white society's racism and writes about revolutionary solutions to racism. Early in his life Malcolm X also sought revolutionary solutions to racism. After his visit to Islamic North Africa, however, Malcolm X proposed a different solution: a strong, black-owned and black-operated economy coexisting peacefully with the rest of society. Mr. Beck does not discuss Malcolm X's later-proposed solution.This is an interesting book. It is clearly-written, and Mr. Beck has led an interesting life."},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","review":"I am ashamed to admit that Robert Beck's cheap pulp fiction had a mysterious hold on young black men of my generation. As semi-rural country boys, having never seen a big city, we collectively imagined that Beck's hip, sexy, ultra-misogynistic narratives, through the voice of Iceberg Slim, about the South side of Chicago, was what street life in every big city was all about.We imagined all cities to be populated by his collections of low-lifes: pimps, whores, drug-addicts, beggars, and grifters who went about the business of separating the predators from the preys among them. Everyone's goal on the big city streets\\" was to get paid\\" by any means necessary, which usually meant \\"conning\\" someone less wise than you in your own race. Learning about \\"Slim\\" and \\"the pimp game,\\" and thus about how to end up a predator on the streets rather than the prey, was like learning the Algebra of the streets. It was a curious kind of self-destructive self-hating armor for manhood.Looking back, it seems inconceivable to me how those in my peer group went from Sunday School and Cowboy Movies each weekend, directly into imagining ourselves working the streets as pimps and grifters: that is, as predators in the environment of a large city most of us had never even seen?The life and times of Iceberg slim, told through his books -- Trick Baby, Long White Con, Pimp, Mama Black Widow, and this one, The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim, was a vicarious and naughty rite of passage for us black boys as we moved from teenager to adulthood. And even though here \\"Slim\\" tries to downplay the glamour of Pimping and grifting in these vignettes, it had no effect on our minds at the time: no matter what anyone said, Slim was our \\"backhanded\\" \\"clandestine unacknowledged hero.\\" Embarrassingly, his teachings rivaled anything we might have learned in school. And this was true primarily because we saw him and his cohorts surviving in the urban environment only on their wits, outsmarting everyone including (and most importantly) the racist white man.Had we been aware enough to realize how self-destructive and negative the subtext of \\"Slim's\\" messages were, I think we would have never given him the control over our minds that we did. Without realizing it, Slim taught a whole generation of young black boys how to be hard, callous, cruel, ultra-misogynistic and self-destructive as if these were the things that would somehow make us men. It was a lie: Pimp made us hard, callous, cruel, misogynistic and self-destructive, and little else.Slim traded on the racist self-hatred young black men already imbibed as a normal part of the American culture. Learning about Iceberg Slim exploits thus in a curious twist of fate, gave us the same negative message that racist America had already given us: that there is no place in this society for black men, except as low-lifes on the streets or jail, or death. In other words, our \\"fight for survival on American streets would always end badly.\\"Slim's stories thus were stern tough-love preparation for the hard life for black boys in racist white America. And thus his novels were a black boy's fairy tale, before Eddie Murphy's \\"Coming to America.\\" It was designed to prepare us for the inevitable hard knocks waiting just around the corner at the gates of hell called adulthood. Iceberg said to us: It's a dog eat dog world out there, and you'd better get ready. If you expect to live, the armor you need is to be cold-blooded emotionally; respect no one and nothing but the code of the streets. The \\"code of the streets,\\" naturally was the opposite of the golden rule: \\"Do unto others before they do unto you.\\"One can only imagine the great harm that these novels have done to black manhood and thus to the black race. When I read it this time, it reads like the trash it should have read like 60 years ago. I hope the world has advanced beyond this kind of callous nonsense. One star."},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","review":"Give me any one page of any Iceberg Slim book and I can identify the author. He possessed a singular voice that was so honest, gritty, raw and uniquely his own experiences that it could never be duplicated by anyone.Now to the review at hand:\\"The Naked Soul Of Iceberg Slim\\" is a tour de force of street realism, autobiography, and social commentary that leaves one blood-stunned in its vicious and entertaining wake. You will experience nearly every emotion as you run the gamut of tales from page to page. It packs a visceral sledgehammer to the skull and does so without apology. His style is cool pimp dialogue underscored by the fact that he is telling you that this is no way to live. In fact, he tells you that it's quite possibly the worst way to live.These are short stories of his life in the pimp game and he writes with savage realism and surprising degree of perception and introspection. Slim writes about the frustrations of growing up poor and how it may not have happened the way it did had his mother chosen one suitor over another. His palpable rage toward both his mother and biological father can be felt even as he rhetorically apologizes to them and comes to terms with the circumstances of their lives and how it affected his own and his degeneration to the life of a young pimp.Slim also describes just exactly how romantic it is to be in a prison cell and hear the tortured beatings of fellow inmates while living life as an animal behind bars himself. Behind all of the girls, gold, money, and seemingly plush lifestyle he lets you in on just how hard the hustle is and the likelihood of being killed if pimping is to be your chosen vocation in life. He tells of how he mistreated his women and how it relate to the psychology of the pimp and the whore. He gives you an example of how to \\"turn a square broad into a whore\\" in vivid detail but this is no instruction manual as he also reveals that behind the pimp's pampered veneer that he is nothing but an insecure whore who has more neuroses and paranoias than one could possibly imagine underneath that cool, unflinching exterior.This is one of the most worthwhile books by one of the sagaciously observant writers to ever put pen to paper and describe any kind of life, not just street life.There are also short vignettes where he explores many complex social and racial issues with a keen perspective that no sociologist could ever learn or explain in any school.This jewel of a book can be obtained cheaply and if you enjoy engrossing and visceral literature that is emotion based and real you can do no better than Robert Beck aka Iceberg Slim's \\"The Naked Soul Of Iceberg Slim.\\" He delivers on what he promises in the title.

He deals with the rise of christianity in europe and how unbarbaric it was in many aspects and the resentment of peasants to the church hierarchy. He deals wiht issues like politics and certain agendas influence history. Overall, history as mystery does make you question how history is taught and how to question the facts."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Parenti examined a number of accepted historical \\"truths\\" and biases to be found in current historical works. He examined the reasons for Christianity's rapid spread, the history of anti-Semitism and the clashes between labor and capital in terms of more recent factual evidence versus what is commonly explained in textbooks and the mass media. He then followed the controversial case of the death of President Taylor whom Parenti claimed was against the spread of slavery into the terrorities. The book shines when it exposes the way conjecture and flimsy evidence becomes concrete facts ready to deliver to bored students, thus fulfilling state mandated (and politically influenced) curricula.Students and thinkers looking for more than interesting historical tidbits to spout at parties will appreciate this book about the creation of history. Those who control the past control the future, said Orwell. Parenti opened my eyes about those who control the past.He was particularly critical of Daniel Boorstin, a well respected historian of the twentieth century. Parenti seems to be asking whether the mainstream will allow alternative histories to reach wide audiences.Parenti's book helps evaluate the current state of the \\"Historical Industry\\" (my term). His book is a reminder to remain wary of those issuing the official history. History is a human process, his book cries, not a mystery divined by Ivory Tower mystics spread by edicts written in stone!We must be aware of those writing and distributing history and ensure their methods and sources are verifiable.

I will petition the reader's and amazon's patience to go into it in just a few lines as it is such a good case in point of all that Parenti is rallying against.Parenti is labeled a &quot;self-styled &quot;progressive&quot; thinker&quot; and his work &quot;one-sided&quot; and &quot;emotional&quot;. For me to be self-styled is the only way to go and far better than being other-people-interests-styled, and the quotes on progressive serve well to subtly convey the contempt at the very begging of this article, with no more than four words coming before that (Mr. Jay Freeman, his name an irony in itself, does not feel his readers ought to know the reasons for his scorn, just accept it per se with no prior justification.) The claim of it being &quot;one-sided&quot; is another rhetoric device. Who is not one sided, who does not have just his own side to write about, any contrary claim to that would imply that the author could and should and must be ubiquitous and rise above themselves as if they were a type of higher essence, a mere medium for a higher order of ideas. The later claim of emotionality goes unjustified as well. And that's only the firt two lines folks! He then name drops &quot;paranoia&quot;, &quot;dogmatic&quot; and &quot;absurdity&quot; to tie the whole thing together with empty and sterile stereotyping. The coup de grace comes with the mental image mr. Freeman constructs for dr. Parenti as being a &quot;mind hog-tied by ideology&quot;, as if he himself had no ideology of his own, and &quot;hog-tied&quot;... how bile and fearful and slandering can a reviewer get. This is is insulting.To do justice to the book is to say that it is at least revealing, well thought out and well written. Parenti writes in a clear and spirited tone, managing to be at the same time, a popularizer of complex issues, an informed scholar and last but certainly not least an inspiration for social action and change, being the activist he is. This series of essays cannnot be labeled &quot;leftist&quot; because this would reductionist to say the least, they are the words of a person favouring the egalitarian and democratic future that we all should aspire to. And how can we further this cause failing to understand how our distant and not-so-distant history comes to be, if we do not learn how to think as Parenti said in one of his lectures &quot;systemically&quot;, i.e. to see the whole picture, the whole frame of reference and not the unimportant bits and pieces of information the media supply as with. (?) The answer is we cannot.I urge you to read dr. Parenti's books for all their profound analysis, scholarship and humor and for their value at instigating social struggles and change. And listen to him live if you can, he is a remarkable speaker.Thanks for your time and patience, and to amazon for offering a space for free and radical discussion."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"A wondeful book. Again, Parenti gives us a lively and richly informed analysis of ideology and institutions that shape American consciousness. The book is not a history book, but a look at the way history is recorded, by whom, and for what reasons. I enjoy his early work a little better, but this book offers an indispensable critical insight into unexamined prevailing orthodoxies that are heralded as infalliable thruths, schools, textbooks, the church, and a great chapter on &quot;psychopolitics&quot;, all written in Parenti's analytical, often humorous style."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Michael Parenti is indeed one of America's more progressive thinkers. History as Mystery is a good introduction to how \\"history\\" is made, and how abysmally informed Americans are about the issues of history. I was amazed at the Booklist review, which is a shocking diatribe that should make any reader sit back in dismay, and wonder what was behind that kind of professional review being published. It read more like a tabloid headline than an actual book review. It is true that Parenti's work is not as rigorous as Zinn's or Chomsky's (such as no indexes in his books), but that does not mean he has not done his homework. His chapter on the death of Zachary Taylor deserves a much wider readership. Though definitely written with an activist perspective, Parenti's book is well worth reading as an antidote to the establishment fabrications that pass for history texts in America."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Well written and highly readable, this book is nothing more than a superb attack on the prevailing orthodoxy that passes for history today. Parenti pulls no punches and is not afraid to be politically incorrect. His savage attack on the conservative historians, their biases and their sacred cows will raise the eyebrows and the blood pressure of those who want their past prepackaged like junk food, made to look good, taste good and slowly poison the society it misrepresents. It will terrify those who believe that are ancestors were greater and wiser than we are. This is a book that should be read by every intellectual, regardless of bias. It will astound as well as entertain, and for those of a conservative bent, it will probably appall. The best sections deal with the excesses of the Church as a destructive and distorting agent in history, Viva La Revolution!"},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"This is an absolutely sensational book that deserves to be read by a larger audience than it will probably get. Parenti touches on traditionally taboo subjects and sheds a whole lotta light on them. His section on the religious inquisition is outstanding along with his analysis of how powerful mainstream intellectuals have white-washed the death of Zachary Taylor. If you have time to read only one history book all year, make this the one."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"OK, you've probably read all the other reviews by now so I won't repeat what they said, but I wanted to point out that his review of some of the myths of the church may offend some people, or at least shake them up. It was an eye-opener for me, especially as I'd just been reading St. Augustine prior to this book. But it explains a lot too and for me at least became reassuring that things aren't on a path to destruction, history has just been whitewashed. This book will offend some tho, but probably by saying the ugly truth."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Michael Parenti reminds us that most history has been written by \\"gentlemen historians,\\" people who have the mindset of the economic class which sponsors the writing of history, i.e., rulers, aristocrats, titans of industry--people of privilege. The voice of the average guy--\\"Joe Six-Pack\\"--is almost never heard. In the 20th century, historians began to pay more attention to the experiences of ordinary working folks, using ancient trial records and similar sources, but the old mindset still had enough momentum to carry on. Parenti attacks this bias head-on, starting with the rise of Christianity (maybe not the result of pure faith plus the example of the holy martyrs) and ending with an interesting analysis of an old \\"cold case,\\" the death of President Zachary Taylor. Why did historians reject the idea that he might have been poisoned? And more importantly, why do contemporary historians follow suit? This is a \\"pop\\" book, but useful as a corrective work to counterbalance the edicts of traditional historians."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"I 'd like to further the discussion for this book by posting my thoughts about it.

Parenti writes in a very comfortable style that is more accessible than Chomsky while retaining a very academic approach. I think this makes his work far more readable for the average person and certainly for people who are just approaching the field of progressive thought (such as my wife) and aren't ready for for the more analytical style of Chomsky. The subject matter I was quite familiar with before reading it, but it was nice to be able to reference the footnotes and have easy access to supporting documentation for my arguments with people who believe anything they see on TV. Thanks for a wonderful book, as usual, Michael!"},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Readers of Zinn, Chomsky, Herman etc will find little new in reading this as other works by Parenti but this takes away little in the entertainment of the read. Like other Parenti books 'History As Mystery' is filled with many delightful facts rarely mentioned in mainstream history and scholarship. Aside from the distasteful apologetics of lenninism and the soviet union much of what Parenti says is highly accurate and relevant. The most novel chapter I feel was the one on Zachary Taylor being poisoned. Parenti makes a strong case for this being a possibility but does not do a good job linking this to the 'bias of modern historians.'I have to admit however that I was somewhat dissapointed in 'History as Mystery.' I found little value in two chapters discussing the oppressiveness of the catholic church in the middle ages, and although the chapter on 'pyschopolitics' is highly amusing it is somewhat dated. A better Parenti book to read I feel would be 'Against Empire' which does a wonderful job debunking the ideas that the 'US only cares about world democracy' and that empires are artifacts of the ninteenth century. I got this book for 5$ at a used bookstore. Although not the best (in rhetoric or information) radical book I feel it was worth the cost!"},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Michael Parenti's History as Mystery was a wonderful discovery. As a fan of all things historical, it is always a pleasure to discover a writer who looks at history from a different angle from most mainstream authors. Parenti has a viewpoint and shouts it loudly and proudly. Since all history writers have a bias of some kind, it is nice to read a book that wears its bias on its sleeve. He is far left. That could pose a problem for some readers who are so firmly entrenched to the right but for others it is a delight to travel with Parenti as he examines the ways history is manipulated by the ruling elite for their own benefit. This book, whether you agree with it or not, will make you question other historians as you read them. That is a very good thing. This book opened my mind a little (and along with the History on Trial, as a companion piece) allowed me to examine with insight the history that I have been spoon fed in the past and the history books I will enter into in the future. An entertaining read from an angry (with every reason to be so) book."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"I give this book three stars not because of the questions that it brings up, but because of the level it's on. Parenti is the master of rewriting areas covered by Chomsky, Zinn, and company on a less rigorous level. This book is no exception. If you don't read much history then this book is ok but it doesn't pass muster as an academic book, as anothe reviewer described it . The reviewer in Kirkus was wrong though. Whatever you think of Parenti's book or his style he raises questions that really need to be addressed. And if you think that pointing out that Columbus was terrible to the Indians, just like we were, is being full of leftwing ideology and is browbeating it into the reader you really need to check your history. Same thing with the comment on Parenti's analyses of textbooks. Just like the record with Columbus you can actually check out the books that get read in public schools and really detect bias. It isn't a matter of conservative versus liberal it's a matter of the real historical record versus one that's been distorted every generation to agree with the current prejudices and biases. A pretty radical statement until you remeber that people were routinely taught in school and in Church that slavery was natural and justified and that all Union members were foreigners and commies ought to destroy the country and that now the orthodox opinion is that free trade is the new saviour for the world."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"I 'd like to further the discussion for this book by posting my thoughts about it.

This is classic Parenti."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"Parenti's book is invaluable not because he reiterates history that most seasoned readers of history haven't unearthed themselves, but because he succintly summarizes how history has been manipulated and distorted to forcefit capitalist exploitative practices throughout the centuries. The truthiness of this assertion is best exemplified by the Western Church's oppressive landholding monopolies in the post-Roman world, followed closely by royal feudal, colonial imperialist and finally sham-democractic corporatism. Parenti's book is a must read for anyone tired of the trite, homogenized, mythologized and agendized histories of this country, which validates the apparent good by neutralizing the unpleasant bad.Any serious student who doesn't swallow the goverment lies about the Kennedy assassination will appreciate his total debunking of Posner's \\"Case Closed\\" and even his analysis of the Taylor death refutes the trumpeted non-assassination claims of the many who didn't read the coroner's report, though I did find his speculations a bit tendentious. Still, the central thesis of his book is that the man in the street hears or reads what the power structure wants him to and not the truth that may tarnish cherished myths."},{"Title":"History as Mystery","review":"I 'd like to further the discussion for this book by posting my thoughts about it.

For better or worse, soldiers can be replaced, their presence being only numbers to the war-planners in the first place. But shred the beliefs that put those soldiers in the field, and political upheaval looms. The US suffered a stunning military defeat in Vietnam. But more importantly, a belief system was shattered, crushed between the benign ideals of democracy and the genocidal demands of empire. Thousands returned home, traumatized, forever changed by what they had seen, thought, or done. More than victims of war, they were victims of a belief system that could not stand the test of reality.History as Mystery doesn't try to explain the Vietnam calamity. It does however give us a good idea how the unsuspecting many can be made to march off and die for the moneyed few. Those who don't know their own political history, in a very real sense, don't know themselves. Parenti shows how history is written as a self-serving process by elites. The process is sometimes clumsy, sometimes refined, but always geared toward preserving the privileged role of wealth and power. Parenti takes on schools, churches, and publishers as central agents in this belief forming process. The picture that emerges is not a pretty one, but sometimes the most important truths are the ugliest,(the Freeman travesty being even uglier).Parenti's style is easy and accessible to all, and though heavily footnoted, this is a work geared toward a popular audience. On the downside, the parts appear stitched together and lacking in overall coherence. Still the contents are for the most part invaluable, and while certainly not a classic, like most Parenti books, this one too stands as an eyeopener. However, don't expect to see Parenti's title or name any time soon in the history classroom. Doing so would only make our next imperial war that much harder to fight."},{"Title":"Curacin cuntica (Spanish Edition)","review":"I ordered a used book and it was what I ordered.

What a difference 23 years and a change in style and technique make! \\"Beatrice Doesn't Want to\\" is Writer Laura Numeroff's updated colloboration with Illustrator Lynn Munsinger to present a stubborn pup instead of a whiny girl. I like it!The stubbornness is not fun for Brother Henry, but siblings need to learn how to get along with recalcitrant people. After all, they may have one for a boss, or worse, marry one. Learn cooperation early. Beatrice's brother Henry does. This update, however, is now just about even with the expiration date. Henry wears hip-hop clothes while Beatrice dresses collegiately. She's cute in her pleated skirt, striped sweater, and hairbow. This style will probably never fade.The big problem is Henry's responsibility, which he handles. He's in charge of her care for the three days he must do research in the library for a report. Beatrice is not cooperative. In fact, she is the epitome of a pesky little brother or sister. Finally, on the third day, Henry discovers that a reading of a popular best selling chiildren's picture book will take place. Oh joy! But not to Beatrice. Finally, Henry puts his paws down and makes her go.To her utter delight the character loves to skate board through the house just as she does. Ha ha or woof woof (whichever works). Beatrice loves this story. Loves it! After the reading is over, she asks the librarian if she can have the book. Of course. The look on Beatrice's fact--I want to know where the illustrator found that look. It is magnificent! It is blissful! Actually, all the facial expressions are just priceless!Beatrice starts out not wanting to read or hear stories or go to the library. But there's magic in the place. Beatrice gets a dose and is cured of her contempt for reading.

Henry therefore needs to go to the library to research his topic. Because he is responsible for Beatrice, Beatrice must come along. Beatrice is the typical preschooler: petulant, easily bored, moody, and attention-seeking. Eventually, Henry finds something in the library that Beatrice enjoys. As others have noted, this story is not particularly creative or novel.The entertainment value comes from two sources: the lively illustrations and Beatrice's dialogue. All the characters in the book are dogs of various breeds; the illustrator (Lynn Munsinger) has captured the playfulness and emotions of the dogs very well. In addition, Beatrice's dialogue lends itself to animated reading aloud. She repeats some lines (such as \\"I don't want to\\"), but really, all of her lines sound like classic preschooler comments that are easy to exaggerate for the entertainment of your listening audience (which, of course, is your preschooler).The best audience for this book would be three- to seven-year-old girls. I read it to my six-year-old daughter, who enjoyed it. My four-year-old son got a little bored with it, perhaps because the lead character (Beatrice) is a girl. (Plus, he prefers dinosaurs and Batman to quiet books about the library.)"},{"Title":"Beatrice Doesn't Want To","review":"Popular author Laura Numeroff (\\"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\\") and teams with the prolific Lynn Munsinger in this cute book about a dog who follows her brother to the library, but doesn't like to read. Henry drags his clearly unhappy sister, Beatrice to the library, where he needs to finish a paper. Beatrice refuses Henry's suggestion to read; instead, she just wants to watch him work, and she pours herself and her saccharine smile all over the increasingly frustrated Henry. Beatrice follows Henry for three straight days, until Henry has had enough. The reader may have had enough of Beatrice as well, for the humor of her unvarying, cloying smile is stale after awhile.On the third day, Henry sees a library poster announcing a book reading that afternoon. Henry encourages his sister to attend, but Beatrice says, \\"I don't want to.\\" Henry comes back with, \\"Too bad!\\" While waiting for the reading to begin, a dog introduces herself to Beatrice: \\"'Hello. My name is Wanda,' said the girl in the next chair. \`This is the second time I've heard this story.'\\" \\"'Big deal!'\\" said Beatrice.However (surprise, surprise), the book reading is a big hit. The librarian reads about Albert Mouse and his new roller skates, and Beatrice, who likes to roller skate, begins to show interest and even smile. Like Albert, she had once roller-skated in the house, and she listens and laughs and even looks over the book after the reading. When Henry comes to take her home, she replies, \\"I don't want to,\\" hugging the book with her eyes closed dreamily and a big smile on her face.The warm and welcoming story may encourage kids who have reservations about libraries or reading. Munsinger clearly depicts Beatrice's emotions, but she relies too heavily on Beatrice's somewhat comical expressions. The book's thin plot is fairly predictable. The pictures are too static and the colors are not very imaginative or exciting. Actually, Henry seems the more interesting of the two dogs, and the best scenes are those in which the brother interacts with his sister."},{"Title":"Beatrice Doesn't Want To","review":"This is a great story for reluctant readers.

Great to use with reluctant new readers."},{"Title":"Beatrice Doesn't Want To","review":"[...] While the outcome might be predictable to you, in the eyes of a child it's probably not.We got this book out of the library, have had to renew it several times. My 4 year old daughter enjoys this book. She enjoys the expressions by both Beatrice and her brother Henry. This book has become part of the bedtime routine for over a month.I will say that as a parent I found some of the illustrations to be off. On the page where Beatrice finds herself in the children's room, the character Wanda does not look really interact with Beatrice in the illustration.The story is enchanting; however, the illustrations could be a bit more accurate in depicting what is happening in some instances."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"After reading two books (number two and three) I'm really hooked to the series about Trevor Joseph. They resemble in some ways Elizabeth Geroge's books about Lynley, or perhaps even more Peter Robinson's about Alan Banks and are recommended for everyone who is a fan of those authors.The title of this book is appropriate, the murder victim the story starts with is a man that has by all accounts been dead for two years. Identity theft is not unknown in mystery novels, but this is a rather innovative one and it doesn't resemble any other plot I've read.This novel is well written and captivating, the characters and the setting seem very realistic. There are details that aren't completely plausible (for example someone who had undergone the surgical procedure that has taken place in the story would have needed lifelong medication and could not have lived the life described) but, honestly, how many stories in this genre are really plausible?The characters are extremely well developed and there is a lot going on in their lives, therefore it is absolutely recommended to read the books in this series in the right order."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"This is not a \\"cozy mystery\\" for reading on a rainy day. This mystery had plenty of twists and turns as well as ups and downs. It is amazing how quickly events unfold. This story could have gone so many different ways."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"Katherine John goes from strength to strength in her Trevor Joseph Detective series. This is the fourth book in the series, and the central character and detective, Trevor Joseph, is one of the reasons for the appeal of these novels. He doesn't fit in smoothly with the all too often depicted craggy, cynical British detective found in many novels. His character's complexity and inner struggles are conveyed subtly and skilfully by Katherine John. In this novel, he struggles between the consolidation of his relationship with Lyn (who has now moved in with him) and his attraction to one of the women from an earlier novel.It is interesting also to see his offsider Peter display a more mellow side as he too develops a tentative relationship with a fellow police member. The plot has lots of interesting twists and turns, and the ending is full of unpredictable surprises, some truly tragic.I look forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"John is indeed a true writer of mystery and intrigue. Wonderful read; wonderful plot; wonderful characters. You won't want to miss this read."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"I just loved this book, in fact love it so much I bought all the rest of the books in the series.Detective is very understated and his pal is just a hoot. Keeps you guessing who the bad guy is."},{"Title":"Murder of a Dead Man","review":"I enjoyed the style of this book. It is a well written mystery, with a reasonably likeable cast of characters. Great setting, interesting comments on social problems, and relationships.The things that made me not like this book more are the following. 1)The killer is obvious. 2)For me was the clincher. In this case, we are supposed to accept that a prisoner who signed up for a clinical trial of an influenza drug instead is taken in for a total face transplant. Umm, hello? Even if you assume that the doctor is stupid and unethical enough to do such a thing, there is NO WAY the data could be used. It would be a criminal offense, and at the very least, could lead to the doctor's being blacklisted and sued for malpractice. Because of this, I couldn't give the book a higher rating. Still, it is an interesting read."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"This book is money. The ideas and concepts in this book will probably recoup the book's cost many times over every month you remain in the industry. It is hard to discuss technical matters in a clear manner. Will Mitchell does so with warmth, wit and humor. No mean feat in a technical book. This guy actually tries to explain his ideas, not impress us with his intellect. Probably 60% of this book will be useful long after Java is an old dusty language that people used to use. I think that just about everyone in data processing would benefit from this book whether they use Java or not. I have been programming for over twenty years and I wish I could have read this book in the beginning. I have learned most of these principles and ideas the hard way. The rest not at all until now."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"First let me say I liked the writing style and it was enjoyable to read. I was able to finish the book cover to cover in 3 days of casual reading. I did get something useful out of the book. He talked about right-brain versus left-brain activity which I found interesting and helpful for my job.I've made the mistake of reading Extreme programming and Refactoring BEFORE reading this book. So for example in this book the author spends great detail on how to count in a large switch case statement how many case: elements you should have and how to quickly check it. If you've read Refactoring by Fowler you would instantly hear alarms in your head telling you your NOT using OO corectly and that this bad code should be refactored. If you want a good OO/Design Patterns book I would recomend Cooper's book. You better understand Design Patterns if your going to code in Java or you will have a tough time when it comes to I/O and Swing classes.Two finally points to make on the downside of this book.1. The author mentions 'goto' and does not correctly tell the history of why the word is reserved. James Gosling at OPSLA on year informed the audience that a technical writer was documenting 'goto' and wanted him to explain it. When James did a grep against the code base he saw it used 10 times of which only 3 where valid in his opinion. James then decided it was easier to remove it than it was to have it documented. James felt that continue and break statements handled all cases that goto were being used in the system.2. The exception model in C++ is just plain broken and the author does not do a good job of explaining what Java did to fix this problem. In a very large C++ system any 3rd party library could throw an exception that is un-advertised. Exceptions in C++ are checked at runtime. The Java compiler checks exceptions at compile time. In java you could never add a 3rd party jar file and have an exception thrown that is not advertised in the interface of the class or method.Java is an OO language and to debug in Java you better know OO and you better understand threads and java.object or your going to have a long night. The author should have started here and delved deaper instead of wasting paper on MS Word and Word macros for coding.Ah...Before I forget. If you read the book PLEASE don't use /** QQQ*/as a tag in your code. If you've got JBuilder use /** todo */ or something non-cryptic to document coding in progress comments."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"A while back I picked up 'Debugging VB' and didn't think much of it. At first I thought 'Debugging Java' was better, but the author completely blew his credibility on three counts:1. Not only does he recommend using MS Word as a Java IDE, he goes to some length to provide macros and so on to show how to achieve context-sensitive highlighting and so on. In fact, at the back of the book, several pages are devoted to this very thing.2. At one point he writes with pride about how he whipped up a 'report generator' in Basic that cranked out 25 copies of boilerplate COBOL. Precisely the kind of code that Java's inheritance and object composition paradigms are intended to avoid. Some people never learn!3. In a similar vein, he also takes about a faux Javadoc he developed that cranked out 1&quot; of documentation in half a day. This fellow seems to prefer quantity over quality.On the plus side, this book had a better-than-average discussion of the various IDE's (other than Word!), and is worth a quick peruse to see what they all look like, if you haven't already."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"This is a great book. It is inusual in that it talks about techniques and methodologies rather than just reiterating a bunch of APIs. It discusses how to avoid bugs in the first place, and how to code defensively, and how to present abnormal conditions to users. It talks about how to cope with the inevitable deadlines, and how to design programs (like write the user manual FIRST, instead of last).Every so often a book comes along that you know instantly must be read by all your colleagues. This is one of those books. I'm ordering a copy for each of my staff today, and we're going to decide which of the author's recommendations to adopt (maybe all of them).Only about half of this book is really about &quot;Debugging Java&quot;. The rest of the book could be titled &quot;How to Develop Quality Software&quot; and could be used with other languages (although if you care about quality software you're already programming in Java anyhow).Buy this book. As soon as you get your hands on it make sure you write your name in it, because it'll get passed around a lot!"},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"Nowadays there are a few Java books out there which are starting to catalogue common Java pitfalls (&quot;Java Pitfalls&quot; by Daconta et al, &quot;Practical Java&quot; by Haggar), but none of these actually focus on the entire debugging process. Come to think of it, I don't know *any* book which focusses purely on debugging software, full stop. When I spotted &quot;Debugging Java&quot; I therefore bought it virtually &quot;on spec&quot;. Was I right to do so? In this rare instance, yes.Mitchell's writing style is engaging, informal without being inaccurate, and in some places refreshingly unconventional. This book is clearly the author's considerable debugging knowledge condensed in one place. To give you a taste of how different Mitchell is compared to the majority of programmers (and book authors), Mitchell claims that he always guarantees his software for life: if clients find bugs in his deliverables, he fixes them... for free. Microsoft, IBM, Sun, Novell, and the other big guns, shame, shame on you for not being as quality-driven as one Will David Mitchell.Given Mitchell's software product quality philosophy, it's no surprise that he has a few tricks up his sleave that the rest of us should also know. Buy the book and join the elite ranks."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"This book is called Debugging Java, and it does have some Java specific content (like discussions of Java specific debugging tools), but its content can be applied to any language. Being a veteran programmer most of the tactics evangelized by this book I had already learned (many the &quot;hard&quot; way). Interestingly one technique that I find extremely useful, walking through each new line of code in the debugger, wasn't mentioned at all. Beginning to intermediate programmers will benefit the most.While reading this book, be very careful about trusting the examples and descriptions because there are a lot of errors in the text and the examples. Some are obvious and trivial (like the &quot;test stub&quot; claiming that &quot;a = 5; b = 5; a = b = 10;&quot; will result in &quot;a == 5&quot; on page 235) others are less obvious and can cloud the points. Most of the philosophy discussed, however, is dead on. All-in-all a little depressing that in a book about bugs and testing the thing the book needed most was better editing.I was disapointed to find that almost the last 100 pages of the book is fairly useless appendices (lists of Java applications that undoubtedly was out of date before the book hit the shelves, for example) including 20 pages of Word macros that would make Word into a questionable programmer's editor. If you can't afford a &quot;real&quot; programmer's editor like CodeWright, my current favorite, at least get a free version of EMACS, which is available on pretty much every platform. My opinion."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"This book reads very well, and I truly enjoyed the afternoon spent perusing it. I would summarize it as presentation of a useful bag of tricks accumulated by the author, targeted at second year comp sci students. Be aware, though, that the author has not worked on large scale or complex problems, and his bag of tricks will need to be upgraded to more formal and robust approaches, common in the industry, as you try to tackle more difficult problems. For example, his 'write user manual first, then spec, then help file, then code' will need to be replaced by one of the formal sw development methodologies, his RFA will be replaced with one of the formal risk analyis techinques, his 'autolog debugging messages' will likely become a tracing tool allowing remote debugging and dynamic tracing levels, etc.I was surprised to find out that the author did not focus more on testing and writing test cases, (after all, how else do you debug your code if not by running unit and system tests?), and code walkthroughs (after all, this would be the usual way of getting another pair of eyes, as he suggests), logging and tracing strategies (interactive debuggers are great, but they can not be shipped with the with the product and can not be turned on remotely to generate a log), etc.If you are intested in improving your personal software development process, you may find books on PSP (Personal Software Process) interesting.Overall, though, I found the author presenting a coherent point of view and I definitely found it worth the monetary outlay :-)"},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"I try to look on the bright side of every book I read, and the bright side of this book is that everyone at the office got a good laugh when the CTO brought it in.The author talks about the advantages to editing java files with MS Word over other editors meant entirely for text document writing (Wordperfect, and another editor that I'd never heard of, but which, I was told, was popular in the '80s) . It also talks about writing word macros to help, and has a small section on how you may have problems with Word appending '.doc' to your java source files.Aside from choice of editing tools, the content itself is poor. This is not a book for anyone who has programmed before, it is not a book for those who are trying to learn Java, and it doesn't talk about debugging Java in any real sense, so I can't imagine who this book is for.I am amazed, however, at the fact that I see these 'Debugging' books in prominent places at many bookstores. I haven't looked at any of the other 'Debugging' series, but either the publisher has tremendous clout to get these books put on shelves, or _Debugging Java_ is the black sheep of the 'Debugging' family."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"Although it was probably not worth the price of admission his discussion on preventing bugs was useful. Essentially, if you have 1 week to do 2 weeks work you will produce buggy code.To avoid deadline stress like this he recommends a system for estimating work that consists of estimating what it would take if you could write it off the top of your head and giving it a factor from 0 to 5? for how unaquainted with the component techniques you are. Then raise your intitial estimate to this power to get your estimate for how long you will take for this task.However, I agree with all the other criticisms.2 stars. Not absolutely aweful but I could write better."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"Debugging Java is an excellent book on debugging and writing bug free Java code. While the book is aimed more at beginning and intermediate programmers, having all these techniques contained in one place makes this a valuable resource. Rather than mechanically show you with endless examples the different kinds of bugs, the author takes a different route and discusses them from a higher perspective, including where you are likely to find them and how to prevent them. He also includes some unconventional methods for preventing some types of bugs, some of which was good, some of it less so.The book is well organized for the most part, although there are places where the author goes off on a tangent. Although Word can be used to prevent certain kinds of bugs, the placement of this and other less conventional techniques merited a section of their own.My other complaint with this book is that some of the specific information regarding IDE's and such are quite out-of-date. While Visual Cafe was just recently pulled from the market, other IDE's have been gone for sometime, and anyone who has been around Java for more than a couple weeks will have heard of the IDE's and other Java tools listed in the book. But in the end, some of the information is valuable enough that I'll be re-reading portions of this every year as a reminder and checkup on my coding practices."},{"Title":"Debugging Java: Troubleshooting for Programmers","review":"A genuine treat! Witty, but erudite -- but easy to read, like a &quot;spoonful of sugar.&quot;With Java being such an error-free language by design, how do you write a book like Debugging Java? You look for where the errors are. They aren't in the source code nearly so often as they are in the development processes.Surely this is why Mitchell doesn't include a ton of source code. It's not a book that lists a lot of boring subroutines you can cut and paste for your website. There have been 2,000 other books that do that!This unique book teaches you the Mastery of Java. One reviewer said it is for beginners only. I strongly--strongly disagree. It is primarily for Experts, and Would-be Experts. It is for people who need to become, as the author states, Java Masters.Beginners copy source code from books. Experts expand the horizons and write their own. Therein lies the problem. How do you write code that can be, &quot;Guaranteed to Specs., Forever!&quot;? Mitchell guarantees his code that way, and lo, he shows you how he does it. He sure showed me a lot. I feel 50% better about my Java now, and people already consider me a guru. Little did they know how shakey I really was.Want to be the best? Devour this book! Even if you're a VB or a Cobol programmer, devour this book. Dev-X loves it. Java Pro loves it (3/01), saying it belongs on every programmer's shelf.I think it belongs open, next to the keyboard.I did what another reviewer suggested. I bought nine copies for my people and made it required reading.

It is one of those books that, by taking a narrow topic and exploring it thoroughly, offers stunning insights on everything from the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to the nature of modernity itself. It also is a fun read, filled with hilarious anecdotes and fascinating details. (It is, after all, about sex.)The author is both an American and Israeli citizen who grew up in a Palestinian village in Israel. She speaks fluent Arabic, Hebrew, and English and did her advanced schooling in the U.S. This special background makes her uniquely qualified to explore such a topic. Because she was raised in a Palestinian village, people from that area were willing to talk to her freely about their private lives. Because she is American-educated and has lived in the United States (and is married to a Jewish American), she knows how to describe Arab culture to Western readers. She knows what we will be interested in, and knows what needs explaining. Kanaaneh devotes a decent amount of time to Israeli government policies regarding reproduction and Israeli political rhetoric on these issues. But the heart of her book is her fieldwork -- hundreds of hours of interviews with Palestinians about having children and having sex, and how the people themselves take stock of such things.The book's main contention is that in Palestinian communities in Israel, reproductive decisions are used as a way of measuring modernity. For example, for many Palestinians, a family's decision to have few children is seen as an indication of how advanced they are. For others, having many children is seen as an indication of how dedicated they are to their national cause. Either way, reproductive decisions are interpreted in a highly politicized manner (by the people involved in them, not by Kanaaneh). The same is true for birth control methods and sex education programs.The book is chock full of surprising details. Kanaaneh presents a picture of a vibrant, changing society that is not quite so \\"backward\\" as some of us like to believe. One detail that surprised me particularly was that in Palestinian sex education classes, masturbation is taught as a safe alternative to sex. When a U.S. Surgeon General suggested such a thing during the Clinton administration, the American political establishment went into a delirium (both Democrats and Republicans) and she was quickly stripped of her position! Another thing that is evident is that sensual pleasures -- for both women and men -- have always been an important part of Arab culture, and in some ways the Palestinians are more open about these things than we have been.As a way of \\"getting into\\" another culture, this book can't be beat. And given the rapidly changing nature of Palestinian society (and its sadly uncertain future), one feels as though one is reading a historical document in the making. This is a real find."},{"Title":"Birthing the Nation: Strategies of Palestinian Women in Israel (Public Anthropology)","review":"A good book explaining the \`feminist' approach to Israeli-Arabs living in the Gallillee. This book is not a feminist anthology on Palisitnians on the west bank, rather it is a feminist-nationalist book on the Arab women living in Israel. It looks partly at the ideas of modernization among arab/muslim women in Israel and tries to look at the varying way that women are used in the nationalist anti-Israel movement. One method is examining birth rates. In order to \`modernize' the Arab women they are encouraged to marry older and have less children. But a second nationalist strain encourages them to have more children in order to \`out breed' the Jewish population. It is an interesting study. A very biased book which frequently replaces the word \`Jew' with the word \`zionist' but it is also the only book of its kind on the issues confronting Arabs in Israel, especially women. Unfortunately there is little focus on the status of women in Arab society, rather the book looks at women as a tool to confronting Israel and how the Arab community uses women in this manner, thus it examines the status of women in Israeli society. But unfortunately although this is supposed to be a feminist text, it comes off as very nationalist, not analyzing problems associated with women in muslim communities, particularly the phenomenon of \`Honor Killings' and other issues, such as the education of women are availability of abortions. An interesting book, a good contribution to literature on Israel, but one must read it with a questioning eye.Seth J.

Kanaaneh traces the development of reproduction, sexuality and social characteristics among Palestinian women, and how these conditions have changed over time. She also alludes to political factors, mainly Israel's treatment of the Palestinians, as a major cause of this evolution. The book is extremely enlightening and cogent in its reflection of the condition and lifestyle of Palestinian women; however, it is flawed in that it is inherently biased against the Israeli government. Thispartiality is manifested through her narrow choice of prejudiced sources and herreference to Israeli-Arabs as \\"Palestinians-\\" a label that is not only inaccurate butalso deliberately offensive to Israelis.Another unwarranted aspect of the author's work is the use of visibly anti-Israeli sources. A prime example of this is that the book is foreword by Hanan Ashrawi, a PLO politician that has been linked with terrorist activity in the past. Ashrawi is by no means a neutral source, and evidence of it is her accusation that \\"[Israelis] rob us of our most basic feelings for our children\\" (xiii). Taken at face value, this unfounded statement is a testament of her hatred for Israel. Ashrawi has made a long career of attempting to villainize Israel, and this severely hurts her credibility. Further one-sided sources include the likes of Edward Said, long a vehement objector of Israel's existence, and the Palestine Red Crescent Society- an additional condemner of Israel. Even in her attempt to balance her work by including Israeli sources, she chooses to consult radical left-wing politicians, such as Yossi Sarid, whom by no means reflect the views of average Israelis. Any author wishing to present a somewhat moderate and respectable perspective on such a sensitive issue would consult a wider range of sources. Nevertheless, Kanaaneh's sources range from Anti-Israeli to Pro-Palestinian and this favoritism severely damages her credibility.Another disturbing issue is her recognition of Israel's Arab habitants as \\"Palestinians.\\" In today's context, the term \\"Palestinians\\" refers strictly to residents of the West Bank, Gaza, and displaced refugees outside of Israel. The mentioned subjects of the book, Israeli-Arabs residents of the Galilee, are not Palestinians. They are considered (and consider themselves to be) Israeli-Arabs. Even Palestinians do not consider the Israeli-Arabs to be Palestinians, and many even consider them to be traitors for their support of Israel. Israeli-Arabs carry Israeli passports; some serve in the army, and go to Israeli schools. They live in Israel by choice, and are free to leave at any time. Labeling Israeli-Arabs as \\"Palestinians\\" is deliberately degrading to Israeli citizens, who consider Galilee Arabs to be of their own. I must note, however, that in this review I refer to the subjects as \\"Palestinians\\" so as not to cause unwarranted confusion. The labeling of Arab-Israelis as \\"Palestinians\\" is another way in which Kanaaneh's shocking bias is revealed to the audience.Birthing the Nation is perhaps one of the most interesting books I have ever read. It summarizes the complex developments of the modernization of Palestinian society, and the everlasting clash between Zionism and pan-Arabism, as each seeks to maximize its influence in one of the smallest countries in the world. The book is by no means impartial, and incorporates several aspects of anti-Israeli propaganda which include (but are by no means limited to) its narrow range of sources and its cataloging of Israeli-Arabs as \\"Palestinians.\\". To say that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is merely a collection of historical data is at best a severe oversimplification, at worst a complete lie. The Palestinian-Israeli conflict can only be understood when evaluated in a diverse context that includes the evolutionary progress of both societies (and lack thereof)."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"\\"Seeing is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer\\" may be a misleading title for Boyd's book on using our imaginations as receptors for commmunicating with God. Many people that have posted reviews seemed to have bought the book hoping for a biblical analysis on prayer. Had that been Boyd's intention in writing this book he would have failed miserably. Thankfully, however, that is not Boyd's aim and he makes that clear throughout.Boyd is not primarily teaching in this book how to pray; rather, he is endorsing an ancient Christiant tradition that works supplementary to prayer. He calls this \\"resting in Christ\\" and it is essentially a time of devotion with God in which you enter into an experience with Him instead of simply going through a list of religious observances.Though Boyd does not quote great amounts of Scripture in order to back up the practice of resting in Christ, he does use a great deal of Scripture to show how people in the Bible experienced God through visions, dreams, and true encounters. So the questions becomes: why do we not tend to experience God this way in 21st century American society? Boyd believes the problem isn't with the way God communicates, but with the way Christians have become obsessed with the importance of the physical and have essentially determined that anything that can't be touched, smelled, etc. is merely imaginary.Boyd conludes by showing how to \\"rest in Christ,\\" a practice that will allow us to open ourselves up to the Holy Spirit in order to experience Jesus rather than just have intellectual knowledge about Jesus. He shows us a devotion that Christians have been practicing for hundreds of years, from Ignatius to A.W. Tozer. This book is not for everyone, but if given a chance it has the ability to help you become more passionate about worship, more devout about prayer, and more experiential in your faith through encounters with Jesus Christ."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Seeing Is Believing is an inspiring book on prayer. It is one that encourages believers to rest in Christ. In an age where busyness, the pressures of life, materialism, and countless other distractions demand our attention, Dr. Boyd recommends spending time in prayer, and allowing the Holy Spirit to inspire our prayer life. And inspire He does! I am more excited about prayer now than ever. Prayer makes a difference in the life of a believer, and in the lives of those we are wanting to reach with Jesus' love.The book explains how God can inspire God given imagination - to bring our prayer life alive. It is exciting, and inspirational reading. Dr Boyd tells us that there is not one formula, but shares his own experience of transforming prayer with us in a vulnerable, and moving account of the Holy Spirit healing a wounding memory.It is difficult to read the book, without being inspired to pray. I highly recommend it, especially for those who have struggled with praying. It is wonderful, though, for the life of every believer, and will fan into flame even a tiny spark of prayer.In my own experience, nothing is as transforming, or healing, than time spent with the Lord, and this book advocates that, above all else.I found this book to be solidly scriptural, and refreshing in its approach to prayer.Transformation and prayer go hand in hand, in the life of the believer."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Greg Boyd has come through with great insight into the shortcomings of the try harder method of transformation.It just doesn't produce genuine or lasting results.His answer, &quot;imaginative prayer&quot; introduces the reader to the way of intimacy with God that many of the true friends of Jesus throughout the history of the church have taken and found to be the path to real transformation. There is nothing &quot;New Age&quot; about this. Yes it is different from what we are used to, but a fair evaluation using both wisdom and revelation will reveal that Greg Boyd is only after connecting believers with the real Jesus. Get this book and read it. Then read it again and begin to implement what you read. It is truly transforming.Jesus is real and yes he is with us, literally, in every aspect of our lives."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"I admit it. I bought the book for someone else - someone who was going through a very difficult time and was looking for answers and inner healing. But I decided I had better read it all the way through before giving it to him. I was only a few chapters into it when I found myself sobbing, and pouring my own heart out to the Lord. Praise God for Dr. Boyd's insights on prayer and on the importance of opening our hearts, our minds, and our experiences (past and present) to Jesus so He can lovingly heal each one. What was especially touching to me were the examples Dr. Boyd shared from his own life and how, through his own times of intimate prayer, Jesus healed even the most painful of memories. I recommend the book to anyone who desires to experience the loving touch of God and His healing presence in their own lives."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Dr. Boyd has been blessed with one of the keenest minds in American theological circles today. Seldom will you find such a combination of honesty, careful scholarship and passion in one \\"package\\" as you do here.Seeing Is Believing is just the prescription for those Christians who know they should pray but find no satisfaction in their praying. Boyd opens up the reality of genuine communion with the God who longs for our fellowship like few writers on the scene today.While there will always be those who react in knee-jerk fashion to any thought that is new to them, honest hearts who long for intimate communion with Jesus will appreciate this wonderful and Biblical book which validates the experience of thousands of hungry seekers throughout spiritual history who have found that God is more than just a concept or a theological tenet--He is a Person who wants to be experienced by His creatures."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Since I became a Christian, I've often wondered why God gave me an imagination. Dr. Boyd's answer is that God gave us all imaginations to experience Him with. This book is so helpful because it exposes the myth that the solution to emotional problems, sin patterns, and even mental illnesses is to try harder. Rather, it is to rest in Christ. This book reminds me of others by Neil T. Anderson with the exception that it goes beyond the \\"repeat Bible verses until you get who you are in Christ\\" approach. Dr. Boyd teaches you how to actually rest in Christ, to let Him supply your identity, and to experience transformation out of that experience.Another really helpful aspect of the book is that Dr. Boyd shows clearly the Biblical basis of imaginative prayer and experience of God as well as it's historic roots in the church, both ancient and more modern.The only reason I give the book only 4 stars is because I feel like there are two or three books that should have been written rather than this one volume. The whole aspect of grace and experiencing grace could have been explored more fully, as could the area of emotional healing, and finally, the area of sanctification. All in all though, this is a powerful and exciting read."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Imaginative prayer is a time-tested and true method of experiencing the Lord as never before. As Mr. Boyd points out, imaginative prayer is nothing new, it was used for centuries as one of the main methods of relationship building with our Lord, however its use had dwindled as a more materialistic view of reality began to be favored. Mr. Boyd has done us a great service by reviving this method, and by giving us a solid, comprehensive, and clear explanation of the &quot;how's&quot; and &quot;why's&quot; of imaginative prayer. I devoured the book and began immediately to put what I read into practice, and the results have been exhilarating! I'm recommending it to everyone."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"This book is an excellent tool for people to understand one of the most misunderstood gifts God has given us...our imagination. I highly recommend this book for a solid biblical understanding of the subject and the real life testimonies that reveal the power of a sanctified imagination.I read the 1 star reviews for this book and as expected, noticed the exact theme that runs throughout a religious mind. It is the theme of fear. What people fail to understand is that Satan cannot create. He can only counterfeit that which God has already made. This means that the imagination is to be used as a tool with God on the highest levels. You will notice those riddled in fear who warn others of the \\"occult\\" or \\"New Age\\" on this subject, are actually of the same spirit they claim to discern and warn about. Their fear of the imagination is like being afraid and warning people about having hands, because some people use them for evil. Our hands and imaginations are tools in the hand and imagination of God.With that said, this book is a gem that will help many to not be conformed to the pattern of this world, but be renewed in power of their minds. People will grow in understanding of the gift and power of the imagination that God has given and redeemed. Enjoy and be blessed with this books content that helps us better understand wholeness."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Greg Boyd does an outstanding job of bringing into focus the spiritual world, or the unseen world that Paul talks about. By asking the Holy Spirit to guide our minds throught thoughts and imagination, we are able to experience Jesus as He intended for us to. Greg Boyd cautions those who engage in imaginative prayer that scripture MUST be the sculpture of how we experience Jesus, what Jesus is telling us, what He wants us to see ect. Powerful book that I believed the Holy Spirit used to help me grow in my knowledge of Jesus and His attitude toward me.Thank You Greg Boyd for sharing!!"},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Boyd really hits the mark in his chapter about \\"resting in Christ\\" vs. \\"trying harder!\\"The role of our imaginations inspired by the Holy Spirit in everything from prayer to bible reading to meditations is a powerful concept. It has vitalized my prayer life."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"Looks like Pastor Boyd has embraced the old Gnostic heresies of seeking to divine special insights or knowledge by practicing imaginative or contemplative methods. (The epistles of Peter and John warn about the false teachers. So does the Book of Galatians (Paul.))With all due respect..... this is New Age Hinduism with Christian terminology. And I am very disappointed that Boyd, with all his education and background in Baptist General Conference theology, has turned away from simply preaching the gospel. (1 Cor Ch. 15:1-6).Pastor Boyd's new book follows in the footsteps of Richard Foster, Brennan Manning and a host of others who have invaded the church and convinced undiscerning Christians that mere bible study is not enough. Imagine the possibilities. Visualize God. Health and wealth. Intimacy with God. Repeat &quot;Jesus, Jesus&quot; over and over and get closer to Him.Why do preachers sell this heresy? Because seekers are bored with simply studying the bible which teaches perseverance, suffering, and the fact that Christians will have trials in this life. Instead, in our McDonald's instant gratification culture, they demand more experiences, feelings, and self-fulfillment in the here and now. Pastors get rich and can build big churches spewing this rubbish to unsuspecting, bible-illiterate seekers. And these seekers have found teachers who will teach such garbage to their itching ears. (2 Timothy 4:3).I expect Boyd's next book to be co-written with Deepak Chopra. God help this world. We are fast approaching the one world church predicted in the Book of Revelation and one can start to predict who will be its leaders."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"After decades in the occult, I can vouch for the occult roots of the garbage in this book. Greg Boyd is not a Christian--this book alone attests to that fact.Christians, steer clear of Greg Boyd and this book unless you're a false convert and really want to dabble with demons."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"This is an excellent book by a careful writer. Boyd lays out a very precise and exact argument for the practice of resting in Christ. He gives detailed attention to an argument to win over those who are skeptical of using their imagination for anything useful. He also describes the best understanding and definition of \\"the flesh\\" that I have ever read anywhere. He gives excellent insights about how to battle this thoroughly defeated but tenacious enemy.I've noticed some harsh criticism of this book. Couldn't it be said that those who scoff at using their imagination for anything useful rarely use their imagination for anything useful? What are they doing reading books then? You should trust this author and you should read this book. A closer walk with Jesus is the result. If you don't want that, you should look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"This is a very good book on imaginative prayer. This form of prayer is liable to be controversial for some Christians, which is understandable. However, I think Boyd does a very good job of explaining the biblical and historical precedents for this method and of answering common doubts and questions about it. It's sometimes difficult for me to imagine Jesus saying and doing some of the things he does in the case studies presented, but imaginative prayer is a highly individualized experience. This, in itself, is not a problem as long as it doesn't conflict in character with Jesus as revealed in scripture. Imaginative prayer seems only applicable to the \\"inner healing\\" of damaging memories of past experiences. I wondered how it would help for those who experience difficult situations in the here and now. The book is well worth considering carefully even if you have trouble accepting some of the experiences described in it. It makes the case that the use of our imagination in prayer is important if it is to be a formational experience, not something that leaves us much the same as we've always been, struggling entirely by our own efforts to better ourselves."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"This book along with Prayer is Invading the Impossible by Jack Hayford have motivated me to pray and to realize the transforming power of prayer. Boyd points: 1. it is not about labor; it is about resting in Jesus 2. prayer has the power to transform our lives 3. prayer can help us to see God. Through Boyd's very clear examples, we see that using our imagination is a powerful way that God uses to heal us, deepen our relationship with Him, and transform our prayer lives. ([...])"},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"In his book &quot;Seeing is believing,&quot; Dr. Boyd has redefined the words &quot;truth\\" and \\"real\\" to mean different things, they are no longer synonyms.On page 11 he states, \\"Wondering whether Christianity is real is not the same as wondering whether Christianity is true.\\"On page 13 he states, \\"Remember, it's not what we believe intellectually that impacts us; it's what we experience as real.\\"Dr. Boyd is telling us that the objective factual evidence that we tangibly discern and process with our intellect is less real than subjective experiences we don't confirm with our senses. Dr. Boyd goes on to define \\"spiritual truth\\" as internal subjective experiences. He states on page 15,\\"We have forgotten the truth that while the imagination certainly can be merely \`imaginative,' it can also be the means by which we experience spiritual truths as real.\\"This may sound innocent, if spiritual truths experienced actually conform to objective truth - Scripture and the historical record observed by men. This is exactly what is denied, however, and the process that Dr. Boyd provides us with constructs an \\"alternate reality\\" in his imagination that is disassociated with the objective historical record. He constructs a lie and he claims it \\"real.\\" He implicates his imagined \\"spiritual Jesus\\" into his lie and claims it to be true and Scriptural, because it works.I am not exaggerating. Dr. Boyd gives us the factual historical objective truth of an incident in his life. He had a cruel grandmother that didn't give him a present and called him bad which he recounts on page 117,\\"No, Greggie is a bad boy, and bad boys don't get presents.\\"This incident brings pain to his life. Dr. Boyd discovers the techniques of imaginative prayer and applies them on pages 118 through 122, progressing through a series of emotions from grieving to forgiveness. Dr. Boyd claims that Jesus personally leads him through this process. As the process unfolds, we see that what is happening is that Jesus Himself is changing the objective historical record witnessed by Dr. Boyd's sisters to a different story that never happened. This story evolves into the following account on page 121,\\"But this time, instead of seeing the angry wrinkled face of my grandmother, I saw the radiant, joyful face of Jesus. He leaned over the bag and peeked in with a wildly excited smile on his face. Instead of hearing my grandmother say, \`No, Greggie is a bad boy,' I heard Jesus exclaim, \`Oh, of course Greggie gets a present! He is such a good boy!' He rubbed my head vigorously as he said, \`It's a very special gift. That's why I saved it for last.' I began hopping and flapping my arms even more excited than before as I looked again into the paper sack. And there I saw a huge red toy airplane.\\"Dr. Boyd has imagined, with the inspiration of the Holy Spirit and Jesus, a new historical record without witnesses that he now believes to be \\"real\\" and a spiritual experience of the truth. This is how the imaginative Jesus enabled Dr. Boyd to forgive his grandmother and find healing. It is the process of building a story that opposes objective reality, believing that it is inspired and therefore \\"real\\" and experiencing relief from the historical record that is now \\"unreal\\" so that forgiveness is possible. He states on page 123,\\"It is crucial to note, however, that forgiveness usually comes at the end of the healing process (i.e. imagined story believed as true), not at the beginning.Scriptures tell us of a different path to forgiveness which doesn't consist of my creating inspired \\"subjective reality.\\" When I realize that I am utterly sinful and undeserving, with a monumental debt towards God I am incapable of paying, destined to damnation - and God comes and dies for me and forgives my mountainous debt and gives me eternal life instead, the antithesis of anything I deserved or merited - the gratitude that whelms up in my heart and mind at this realization enables me to forgive the puny debts that grandmothers owe to me. This is the gospel. This doesn't require spirits to create freestyle historical records so I can forgive. It simply believes in the work that God, as a tangible man, did for me on the cross. This is where we find the true and real power to forgive, in objective history that was seen by witnesses and written down for us to read and understand."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"READ IT, READ IT, READ IT!!!

My prayer life has been dry lately and I was looking for some Bible insight to reconnect with the Lord. Suffice to say this book had lots of inner-sight but little properly-interpreted Bible.No sooner had I finished the book than I got out my NKJV, NASB, and NIV to check out the verses cited. I was truly amazed that a mega-church pastor, former theology prof & PhD published author could get his exegesis so wrong so consistently.The book seems a rambling, repetitive excursus on one excerpted text sequence: 2Cor.3:14-4:6. I counted its use or allusion over 40 times in 220 pgs. It was used very superficially with no independently verified cross-checking by other scholars (none cited in the notes)as to its intended meaning. To say nothing of missing the crucial context of 2Cor.3-5 as Paul's complete discourse on the subject. To say nothing further of not addressing other crucial scriptures that entirely negate the whole plot.I was faced with a choice. Either embrace this practitioner's extra-biblical belief system about primary point of contact/ main receptor with the spirit world being envisionary/ imaginative picturing-in-the-mind of what we want to be real. Or search Scripture itself for Holy Spirit-bestowed insights into prayer.Jesus says, \\"When you pray, go into your room, close the door and pray to your Father Who is UNSEEN..\\" (Mt.6:6) Jesus does not teach us to envision-imagine-conjure up an icon of God to bolster our sagging prayer life or really encounter the Lord.Jesus says, \\"Blessed are those who have NOT SEEN and yet have believed.\\" (Jn.20:29) Doubting Thomas-theology of 'seeing is believing' is rebuked here in favor of the blessed faith that biblically teaches the opposite:'believing despite not seeing'.Peter says, \\"Though you have NOT SEEN Jesus, you love Him; even though you DO NOT SEE Him now, you believe in Him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy..\\" (1Pet.1:8) Peter does not lament the fact of Jesus' invisibility as a deterrent to true Christian experience. Nor does he advocate visualization-in-the-mind's-eye to compensate for lack of sight. Faith is the goal, not fixation on focused imagery to facilitate believing.Paul says (conveniently omitted in this book): \\"So we fix our eyes NOT ON WHAT IS SEEN, but ON WHAT IS UNSEEN. For what is SEEN IS TEMPORARY, but what is UNSEEN IS ETERNAL...WE LIVE BY FAITH AND NOT BY SIGHT.\\" (2Cor.4:17,5:7)This imaginative-praying practitioner preaches that Seeing is Believing; we become what we see. Virtual-reality in the mind is the missing dimension of true spirituality. Regression-projection erases and replaces bad past memories with inner healing.The Bible says otherwise. I choose Jesus', Peter's, Paul's teachings on Scriptural Prayer over any substitute that impersonates things in our mind as objects of worship/prayer.My story has a happy ending. This book went back to Goodwill. I got \\"Praying the Psalms\\" in exchange."},{"Title":"Seeing Is Believing: Experience Jesus through Imaginative Prayer","review":"I just finished the book. I was struck with how extra-Biblical it was. I didn't see Mr. Boyd use Moses or Hannah or David or Jacob or Samuel or Daniel or Jeremiah or Mary or Paul or Jesus Himself as role models of how best to pray. He chooses people and techniques beyond-the-Bible as the most effective praying to REALLY EXPERIENCE God.Just because something \\"seems to work\\",\\"feels so right\\", \\"suits different people's personal preferences\\" is no justification to depart from the way Jesus and Scripture teach us to pray to the Father. The writer gives the sad impression that the Bible is deficient and insufficient to teach the Lord's people on praying. We need Agnes Sanford's inner teachings and other mystical misunderstandings from Roman Catholic Jesuits and New Age practitioners to \\"heal our pasts\\". So long as it \\"works for me\\" then let me be. Live and let live. Don't criticize.True love shows concern when brothers & sisters go astray, especially with important Bible truths. True compassion speaks truth in love. In heaven when we're all perfect, it won't matter. But here on earth when we're all IMperfect, it DOES matter. Straying sheep led by straying shepherds need more than prayer, but to be brought back to the truth of Scripture, the arms of Jesus, back to the flock and away from the wolves.Please pray for those who imagine this book is in agreement with the Bible when in fact it departs outside the Word of God. Pursue its popularist practitionings at your own peril. Don't say you haven't been lovingly warned of what Paul himself urged: \\"DON'T GO BEYOND WHAT IS WRITTEN!\\"Is Jesus' way of praying in the Bible enough? Read all His prayers and what he taught us and see for yourself.\\"Now faith is being sure of what we hope for and certain of what we DO NOT SEE. This is what the ancients were commended for.\\" (Hebrews 11:1-2) Follow the way of the ancients.

Malamud seemed to move into this area of exploration with more contemporary characters in his latter books-this is broadly similar to 'Dubins Lives'-where are lives are influenced by our natures and the moment in history we exist in,yet we continually try to satisfy the falsehoods of society,or other peoples expectations.This is a good,satisfying read.Malamuds prose of even mundane surroundings leave a vivid picture in your mind,and there are great pieces of humour: (\\"We're going to do it on the desk?\\" \\"I hated to mention the floor,but where else is there!\\")I love Malamuds work for many reasons.Yes this is a lot 'softer' than 'The Fixer' or the life of poor old Fiedelman,but it gives another insight to Malamuds take on life.He's also a member of the 'Holy Trinity' of great 20th century Jewish writers;sitting alongside Beshevis Singer and Saul Bellow, in my view."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"Rereading this book after many years was at first a great pleasure. How wonderful to go into the innocent world of a small- town university in the 1950's. The protagonist Levin is a New Yorker who goes West to Cascadia College to find a new world and life. He comes to what he thought would be a liberal- arts college and is in fact a kind of community -vocational college. Nonetheless he wonders at the remarkable outdoor world, and also at a whole group of faculty- characters he meets.So far, so good. But innocent Levin turns out to be a less than admirable character, and the second part of the book centers on his love- affair with the wife of the faculty member who has greeted him and been most kind to him.This affair does not lead to any kind of redemptive moral message of a kind Malamud's writing often has. It rather I think reflects an ethic of the 'do your own thing' and 'me first' sixties about to come. Sexual liberation cancels out consideration of others.Perhaps I am a bit unfair to this novel which I started out enjoying and enjoyed less as it progressed. Malamud does do an excellent job of creating the university types and atmosphere, and does show meticulous attention to the kinds of minor disputes and pettinesses which plague faculty life.He also writes in a clean and precise way, and there is an air of freshness, and youthful adventure at least in the first chapters of the work.This is not the Malamud which the world will love him most for. The main character by the way is only nominally Jewish, and Jewishness plays no part whoseover in the story. This again is far from what one ordinarily thinks of one when one thinks of the work of Malamud."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"As a Northwesterner, I was interested in reading this book because of its setting. The descriptions of Washington State (my home state) were done pretty well, but the dialogue between the unrealistic characters was less than satisfactory. Malamud chose to ramble on, sometimes in two page segments, in inneffective attempts at a sort of social statement. The ending of this book was absolutely ridiculous."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"I am a long-time admirer of Malamud. In my view, \\"The Assistant\\" and \\"The Natural\\" are two of the outstanding novels of the 20th Century. I can still recall my gratification upon finishing \\"The Magic Barrel.\\"In the case of first-time exposure to a book,play,or movie, I believe that expectation frequently colors reaction. Given my experience with Malamud, I began to read \\"A New Life: with a sanguine attitude. The first page, carefully calculated to entice the reader's interest, validated this attitude. Although my enthusiasm waned over the next 20 or 30 pages, I reminded myself of Malamud's literary prowess. He's just having a little trouble revving up the engine, I thought. Happens to the best of them. My man will get off the ground shortly and we'll be soaring into the clouds.Malamud's early take on Levin bolstered my confidence. Levin is an unsuccessful teacher, a former drunk, a tactless, gauche klutz whose professional and intellectual capacity and social skills are, to say the least, limited. The reader will identify with Levin, or root for him, or feel sorry for him, or simply connect with him, however attenuated the connection, WHEN LEVIN CHANGES. And so, the reader looks forward to finding out what manner of event, what shift in circumstance, will rehabilitate Levin, or trigger his turnabout, or spark his transformation, or signal some incipient but viable adjustment of his personality and character. Or perhaps will reveal some redeeming quality, some suppressed side of Levin that is rational, perceptive, sensitive, sensible.It doesn't happen. Levin's self-destructive behavior accelerates, and the book plunges irreversibly into contrived farce and fatuous set-scenes devoid of credibility. Contrary to Mr. Lethem's Introduction, the book is neither comic nor tragic; it is simply hollow in its core.To revisit the credibility issue, Levin's attempts to insert himself into and influence campus politics are so maladroit as to be unbelievable. His relationship with Pauline is self-delusional and empty-headed, and is not plausible. The ultimate implausibility, of course, is the last segment.The book does contain well written descriptions of scenes from nature. But why so many? Some of the dialogue is clever in a stilted way. College-faculty environments are unquestionably as vicious as reflected, but surely the real-life intrigues are not conducted on the level of ineptitude depicted here. Beyond those small plus-factors, the book fails in terms of plot, narrative, and character development. Like Levin, \\"A New Life\\" is a loser. Come to think of it, Malamud's purpose may have been to write the book as a metaphor for stupidity."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"Jonathan Lethem's preface shouldn't be read first but last, as it--albeit subtly--gives away the ending for any reader who makes it to the latter third of the novel. While I did not support the choice made by the protagonist, Sy, at the end, and sympathized more than perhaps I was supposed to with the antagonist, I found this evocation of the Cold War period as spent at a cow college in a small town in the Northwest gripping and surprisingly convincing in its indirect narrative style, which mimics not only the patterns of thinking in Sy's mind, but springs off at times into Joycean reverie.I have only read Malamud's The Assistant, and that in college, so my pleasure at his plot became all the more pronounced when I found so much of the setting alarmingly familiar--I teach English too at a non-liberal arts college, run by number-crunching techies, so Sy's predicaments--although now I doubt if he could land his position without a PhD--stayed fresh despite happening half-a-century ago.Issues of academic freedom, nourishing of the soul, escape into nature and ideals vs. the mundane may be new material for those used to Malamud's urban explorations of often NY and Jewish characters, but here it all works. I was mildly intrigued that Sy's Jewishness never gains but one mention, near the end of the novel, but is assumed, I suppose, throughout as he is marked by his beard and his \\"East Coast\\" origins as an outsider all the time. The near-absence of religion and the substitution of a longing for nature, perhaps a Wordsworthian sort of wonder, permeates much of the lyrical passages interspersed with the more tormented episodes--which gain as the book lengthens.The book has a bit of slapstick and a lot of farce in the predicaments Sy gets himself into, but I can testify that much of Malamud's take on such an institution remains relevant today, in a much more constrained academic job market for such profs-to-be. Again, a measure of the skill Malamud brings is both the detachment the third-person p-o-v offers of Sy (who never leaves our sight) and the engagement with the other characters we see through his jaundiced eyes, and the fact, as I stated, that your sympathies may not be fully with Sy by the book's close."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"Bernard Malamud is known for creating deeply flawed characters with strong ideals, and Seymour Levin - known interchangeably as S, Sy, Seymour, Levin and Lev - the central character in this wonderful novel, is no exception. A thirty year old masters graduate, down on his luck, but with the backing of an NYU education, he lands a job as a college instructor in the English department of a fictional mid-western state (Cascadia) college. This opens up an interesting cast of characters who view him with a mix of interest, disinterest, partly an inferior, an activist/idealist (his beard suggests he is a radical in the year 1950 in the midst of red-baiting and community suspicion), a potential threat, an alien, an anomaly.Levin, \\"formerly a drunkard\\" (to quote the author) has deep seated problems and issues of self worth. He is a plain man, though definitely an idealist; however, one gets the sense early on that his idealism comes less from a passionate, inward set of convictions and more from a sense of inferiority, and a desire to find meaning in ideas. His activities and how quickly he reacts to the new environment are fascinating - he wastes no time getting inappropriately involved with a female student, sleeping with the wife of a trusting colleague or getting embroiled in the politics of the English department (here Malamud provides an interesting look at a college in a conservative town that values professional training at the expense of literature and learning) and being drawn into a myriad of ethical and moral dilemmas. Without spoiling the plot any further, Levin breaks every conventional rule in the book - this makes him less a sympathetic character and more someone the reader is almost glad to see suffer the fate he does. I would not have felt this way if I got the sense that Levin was fighting for something and doing it sensibly - while I love literature, the way Levin goes about seeking its elevation seems foolish and misguided. Perhaps more about ego and an attempt to feel worthy than out of a true love of books.This is in essence something of a morality tale, and if I had to get to the heart of what Malamud is saying here it would have to be that misplaced idealism - without moral or ethical standards - will destroy the person within. I found it to be both gripping and bleak at the same time, but surely one of my favorite Malamud novels (and I have now read them all, so will have to find a new author to stalk!).It seems that from the sparseness of the reviews here and from the seeming lack of recognition this book has received, it is one of his least known works. That is a shame because the characters and plot are fascinating; the themes are timeless (suspicion of someone who looks different, moral bankruptcy, clash of conservatism and radicalism, status quo versus change) and the writing is very good."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"I first read this book in college - I found it in the stacks in our library and chose it as a recreational read. Needless to say, it has become one of the most memorable novels I have ever come across; so much so that I bought the book to read again last month. Malamud's talent lies in his effectual portrayal of true to life characters and situations: S. Levin has a history of making the wrong choices, struggles to do what his conscience tell him is the correct path in life and battles to maintain his personal dignity -- all while living in a new state without emotional support. The administrative tug of war that defines his experience as instructor at a small state college are realistic and well portrayed - but also, they are written with a good deal of wit, making this quite the enjoyable read. I recommend it without any reservation!"},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"'A New Life' by Bernard Malamud is the fifth novel I've read by him and with each book I am further convinced of his genious. He was a master at the novel (not just short story). Though his works are funny they are also deeply humane and, from a literary standpoint, subtle. I can't think of anything more difficult in writing than subtlety. Time and again, while reading this book I'd have to pause and reread a line or paragraph because of his subtle and miraculous use of language. The main character, Levin, is somewhat of a comic hero, but there is deep truth in him. His life is regret and he wonders when he will actually begin living. Already thirty, an outcast from the east in a northwestern college town, Levin's new chapter of life is on vivid, often comic and sad display for the reader. Another masterpiece!"},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"Malamud's book is the story of a man who moves across the country to try a new life as a college instructor. As a college instructor myself, the politics he deals with rang true. I was mainly impressed, however, with the thoughts inside this characters head. I often read novels in which I come across something and think &quot;No man I know would ever think this&quot;, but I never felt that way here. I didn't like the ending (I thought the character made a bad choice) but Malamud is under no contract to clear his endings with me first. A good solid read."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"Malamud has written an entertaining novel about the attempt by the &quot;hero&quot; Levin to begin life anew in Cascadia (Oregon) in the 1950's, an era it is hard to imagine interesting - but it is here! And the end creates its own questions about new beginnings, love, the meaning of life, and all sorts of serious subjects, without ever feeling weighed down by them."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"New Life is Bernard Malamud's college novel, based on his experience teaching in a land grant college in Oregon in the 1950s. Coming after his success with The Assistant, and before his even greater success with The Fixer, this novel can be a bit of a letdown. The college professor, the departmental intrigue, the faculty wife having an affair with the outsider to the department, are all elements of the \\"collage novel\\" we have seen before. In this sense, there is nothing new here.But Malamud is careful writer, laying each brick of the story carefully on the other, giving this all too conventional tale his own unique solidity. He is fearless in what he puts his characters through, and his fairness to show how each on his responsible for his or her misery is unwavering.So, though New Life does not quite stand up to his great novels or short story collections, it is worth reading. Malamud steers clear of overtly Jewish themes, by and large, and charts through some new territory."},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"If the Northwestern US fascinates you or you somehow find yourself there, this is one of the three best books set in the region. (The other two are &#34;The Oregon Experiment&#34; by Keith Scribner and &#34;Sometimes a Great Notion&#34; by Ken Kesey.)"},{"Title":"A New Life","review":"A NEW LIFE has been around for over fifty years now. I first read it more than forty years ago. But it remains a favorite Malamud novel for me. I've worn out a few different mass market paperback versions in the dozen or more times I've read it (and taught it too, back in my teaching days).Although the story of S. Levin, \\"reformed drunkard,\\" and his married lover, Pauline Gilley, is set firmly in 1950, it still seemed relevant when I read it again this week (July 2012). It remains a classic novel of academia at its worst. A director of composition who cuts pictures out of magazines, hoping to publish a picture book of literature. A dean who was once a successful used car salesman. The frustrated 'old maid' instructor. The office/departmental politics, the genteel poverty, and the sexual intrigue and pecadilloes - it's all still going on in the small third-rate colleges around the country. The McCarthy-ism has been replaced by the ill-conceived \\"patriot act\\" of post-9/11 and the nasty partisan garbage that has rendered our Congress nearly impotent.But most of all it is Seymour Levin who carries Malamud's tale. More mensch than schlemiel or schlimazel, Levin comes across as a Sad Sack Eeyore sorta guy, but with big dreams of improving things, of building \\"a new life,\\" as the title indicates. Shot through with allusions to Hardy and the rural life, Malamud has nailed the academia of the post-war years perfectly. Much of this is probably due to the author's own years spent teaching at a small college in Oregon back in the 1950s. For more background info on those years, a reader could benefit greatly from reading Janna Malamud Smith's memoir of her father, MY FATHER IS A BOOK, which I found simply delightful and infinitely informative.Bottom line: there's a reason this book is still in print fifty years after its 1960 publication. It's just a damn good story. It'll make you laugh, because Levin does have a bit of both the schlemiel and the schlimazel in him, but it will be a wincing kind of laughter, because the humor is used for a particular effect - to show just how sad and complex life can often be. To show how sometimes even when you get what you thought you wanted, it will have changed in the getting.

It was never reviewed because she was unhappy with it. I think she was disappointed in the content."},{"Title":"The Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays (Post-Communist Cultural Studies)","review":"Although it has taken the English translation of this collection of essays a few years to come into print (it was first published in Dutch),this is a highly relevant, illuminating, and moving book. Most of the essays were written between '92 and '94, with more recent postscripts. With rare clarity and complexity of thought, gift of articulation, emotional courage and absence of pretence or squeamishness, Ugresic has carried out a highly accessible investigation into the Yugoslav war, the demise of communist Europe, the East-West polarity, the ambiguities of exile. With references to other East European writers and thinkers (Milan Kundera, Miroslav Krleja, Danilo Kis, Josiph Brodsky), she explores the tyranny of the new constructs of national identity in the Balkan states, the enforced collective amnesia of the former Yugoslavs, the many traumas of their history, as well as the common psycho-cultural lanscape of the 'Eastern block'. There are many deeply moving episodes and revealing insights here, delivered in the familiar 'Central European' style of ironic, melancholic, bitter humanism. Vaguely reminiscent of Milan Kundera, only better because of the lack of smugness and the final doubting humility of someone who has felt intense pain and articulated the nature of this pain."},{"Title":"The Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays (Post-Communist Cultural Studies)","review":"Dubravka Ugresic is perhaps less well-known in the English-speaking world than the other Croatian &quot;dissident&quot; writer Slavenka Drakulic, which is unfortunate. Both Ugresic's essays and especially fiction are far superior to that of Drakulic. &quot;Culture of Lies&quot; includes the author's observations of Croatian society and politics of the last ten years, both of which have been none too kind to her (indeed, while achieving great acclaim in other European countries, she was branded a &quot;traitor&quot; and worse by Croatian politicians and the pro-regime press for her uncompromising criticism of Croatian nationalism, etc.). In this book, Ugresic shows the many ways in which nationalism imbued all levels of society in Croatia, making people increasingly hostile to different views and people who were/are &quot;different.&quot; Her particular area of interest is the way this was reflected in the behavior of intellectuals, who-at least one would like to think-are not supposed to be as susceptible to the appeal of God-and-country patriotism and nationalistic kitsch. Her description of an incident in a Zagreb tram, in which a young man accosts and beats an old destitute drunken man, is particularly vivid and sadly indicative. In fact, this whole section of the book, called &quot;Souvenirs from Paradise&quot; is an excellent collection of impressions and observations of the underside of Croatian life. Despite the recent sweeping political changes in Croatia, many of the negative aspects of society in this country as described by Ugresic are still here, and they will haunt this country for some time to come."},{"Title":"The Culture of Lies: Antipolitical Essays (Post-Communist Cultural Studies)","review":"It tells truth of thousends of people manipulated with mass media on Balkans.

While I agree with Ugresic's criticism of nationalism and the role it plays in post-Yugoslavian times, I also wonder if it is just a collective defense-mechanism, a means for survival when collective identity is being shattered.

In a delightful style, this book touches the heart, engages the mind and moves the soul."},{"Title":"Becoming a Father: The Real Work of a Man's Soul","review":"John Hart has written and longtime male-friendly publishingstalwart Health Communications has released a unique book about menand fathering. Becoming a Father is a short book yet one thataudaciously attempts to do more things at once than any one workcan realistically undertake. Its first section draws connectionsbetween the Biblical Joseph and challenges faced by modern fathers,interweaving new tales about Joseph with analysis of dilemmas thatwill be familiar to any father. (How do I let my boy know I amthere for him while allowing him to find his own way in the worldand build his own confidence?) I must admit, I was quite put offright at the beginning by a baldly introduced and unjustifiedstatement about the five stages of fathering, stages which did notresonate with me.But, I am glad to say, I stayed with the book. As I kept reading,I noted the humorous and yes, odd aspects of using Joseph and Jesusto address issues faced by all fathers and sons. At the same time,this daring approach worked for me pretty well most of the time.The recounting of a baby's birth and Joseph's acceptance of itbrought tears to my eyes.Hart's writing employs pithy apothegms that convey his heartful andinsightful vision of fathering's unique role. In a fancifulscenario evidently invented by Hart, Joseph writes that in caringfor his son, his love for him grew. \\"For men, the doing createslove. It does not make a man into a woman when he cares for achild; it makes a man a father. In doing this work, a man findsunderstanding and respect for the work that women do, as well asfor the work of men.\\" A few pages later we see a concrete exampleof the son applying the love and compassion he learned so well fromhis father, as the author recounts a story of Jesus befriending andhealing galley slaves. Moving forward into the present era, Harttells of a therapist who established a regular time slot for\\"special time\\" to be alone with each of his children. \\"Thisspecial time let his children know that they were each unique, theywere each special to their father and that they did not have tofight with the others for attention and time.\\"Hart surveys various different types of intelligence and includesa memorable example of award-winning UCLA basketball coach JohnWooden's phenomenal empathy. The heartwarming passage is worthquoting at some length:[Wooden] had an uncanny ability to mold a disparate group ofstrong-willed, often spoiled and egotistical adolescents into asmoothly functioning team that was willing to sacrifice theirindividual glory for the good of the team. He did it year afteryear.... I was able to observe Coach Wooden as a participant at aweek-long camp for adults. Now, conducting a camp for middle-aged,portly and poorly talented basketball wannabes would seem to be astunningly boring task for the greatest basketball coach inhistory, but not for John Wooden. In his very first moments withyou, the enthusiasm, drive and determination of his personality areapparent. In your first personal contact with him, you sincerelyand genuinely feel he is deeply interested in you as a basketballplayer and as a person. He puts everything about himself intobeing \\"your coach,\\" and it is clear he is expecting no less inreturn.The second half of Becoming a Father contains a series of first-hand personal stories about fathers and fathering by variousauthors including actress Mary Steenburgen. In a fittingreflection of the first half of the book, these tales are quitedisparate in tone and subject in a way that is a bit odd and a bitdisconnected but at the same time provides richness. Most of thepieces are emotionally affecting.As a virtually inevitable result of its eclectic structure andapproach, Becoming A Father is a somewhat disjointed work. Theseams do show and at times it is unclear how the various threads ofthe narrative connect up with each other. And yet, to continue theanalogy, the bolts of cloth are so richly sewn and sobreathtakingly lovely, and the juxtaposition of the differentcolors and fabrics so unusual and creative, that the worktranscends its flaws.

Rorvik purportedly was asked to make connections between an anonymous rich American and a nameless geneticist who would help the rich man to clone himself. The scientist/doctor would set up a clinic in an unnamed Southeast Asian country and use young girls who came as patients to the clinic as possible incubators. Rorvik's role was also, according to him, to make sure that this experiment was conducted ethically, under his eagle eye. Apparently using uneducated, uninformed, and unconsenting virgins did not present a moral or ethical problem to him or anyone else; the girls were poor, after all. Rorvik was (and apparently still is) a professional science writer, and Lippincott published this book as-is, seemingly without doing any fact checking. It was pretty controversial when it came out, both because of the editorial laxness of this respected publishing house and because of the story's improbability - though generally not because of its ethical shakiness. The science journal reviews when the book came out denied that human cloning was possible (though they tended to hedge just a little bit, with good reason, as we now know). Whether factual or not, this book demonstrates, apparently unwittingly, just why human cloning is a bad idea. It's just another way that rich people can buy poor people."},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","review":"The book was a sensation back in 1978, but most who read it did not believe it. At the time of its publication, the US Senate held hearings on whether human cloning should be banned. A scientist mentioned in the book sued the publisher and the end result of the lawsuit was an apology from the publisher, J. B. Lippincott, and a court ruling that the book was a hoax.But was it? The author, David Rorvik, has always maintained that the story he told was the truth. He included a great deal of technical descriptions of the techniques used to clone the mysterious \\"Max\\" as if he wanted future readers to know exactly how he claimed it was done. That can be compared to the techniques used today to clone mammals. Rorvik says in his Afterward to the book that he does not expect his story to be accepted, since he can offer no proof. He says he saw the baby, and it was a normal healthy baby. He was never shown the genetic proof that the baby was actually a clone, but he says that Max told him he had seen the verification that the baby was in fact his genetic duplicate.I did an internet search on Rorvik and found many references to this book, and no consensus on whether it was fact or fiction. There are a number of references to it as fiction or a hoax, but in an interview with Omni magazine in 1997, Rorvik says the story is true and that he has continued to be contacted by people interested in cloning. However, he has nothing to say about Max, whether he has been in touch with him or seen the child, who would be a young man in his twenties now.Why do people get so upset about human cloning? Why is it often described as \\"morally repugnant?\\" At the time of Rorvik's book, in vitro fertilization was still new and considered repugnant too. Rorvik describes how a friend of his, Dr. Landrum B. Shettles, was fired from his position at Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital for creating a test-tube embryo for an infertile Florida woman. His superior destroyed the embryos and tried to discredit Dr. Shettles. That was the level of hysteria about a procedure now routinely done; there are probably thousands of people walking around who are the product of in vitro fertilization. They do not think of themselves as freaks because they are not.Cloning is just one more way to make a baby, although it has little to recommend it. Isn't it better to use our new knowledge of our genetic make-up to eliminate defects and create better humans? It seems to me that the objections to cloning come down to a number of misunderstandings. People talk about cloning as a way to immortality, as if a clone of me is me. But that is not the case. The clone has the same genetic material, but is a separate person in the same way that identical twins are separate people. Someone who's been cloned, like Max, will die and his \\"immortality\\" is no more a reality than anyone who has children has a claim to immortality. We pass on our genes, but so what? We are each still responsible for our lives and how we live them. A clone would have his own life, his own soul, and be no less an individual than any of us. I find it interesting that in the experiments with multiple cloned cows, they were not even all physically the same. These were spotted cows and the spots had variations, attributed to the differences in the surrogate mothers and conditions of pregnancy. A clone, it turns out, is not necessarily an exact duplicate.Human cloning will happen, if indeed it has not already happened. But it will not be popular, and the hysteria over it will eventually go away, as have the objections to in vitro fertilization. I would love to hear from anyone with more information about an existing human clone; see my longer review at my book review site, The Seeker Books."},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","review":"While attending Washington State University in the early 1980's I read this book as part of a class project.

A willing doctor was also contracted and the procedure was described in the minutest detail.David Rorvik was described by the editor as a respected science writer with numerous prestigious periodicals. The editor makes no claims of autenticity and lets the author's reputation speak for itself.Rorvik asserts the that the details in his book are true and accurate and thus that the cloning of a human subject was going to be attempted and that in the end actually occurred. The details described were compelling and quite believable.As new information arrises in the cloning arena, the details put forth in this book become even more believable. In fact, the method of cloning the sheep in Great Britain is nearly identical to the procedures detailed in this fascinating tale of human cloning.After reading this book in 1982 I came away a believer that human cloning has taken place. Now after hearing the recent tales of animal cloning, I am more firmly entrenched in that belief. So will you believe after reading this story.If you can find the book, you will find it earily timely even 18 years after it's initial publication.Read this book and the hair on your neck will stand on end. This is a 5 star publication"},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","review":"I'm the one in the book which was apparently cloned off of a mid 50-60 ish man.

It was after he assured me that it was a true documentation that I decided to read the first few pages. Well, 21 hours later (I slept 8), I had completed the book. I simply could not put it down.Many will wonder where the child is now - I assure you he is alive and well.The best book I have ever read by far. Michael is brilliant!"},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","review":"When I read this book when first published I was astounded. I had seen and read several articles in various journals debating this subject (including the shocking possibility of DNA Recombination), but was disappointed by those who challenged the theory of Cloning by heatedly debating the moral/ethical implications of it. It reminded me of several things - that Biology and Chemistry are the cornerstones of understanding Life As We Know It, it's well known that numerous forms of life on our planet reproduce themselves by cloning, that flight was impossible yet disproven by the Wright Brothers in 1903, that space travel was impossible yet disproven by Sputnik in 1957, and the spiritual conviction of Galileo for challenging the Christian belief that the Universe orbited Earth instead of vice versa.If it weren't for the insatiable curiosity of science and technology we would still be living by way of spears, stone knives, bearskins, and fire. The knowledge of genetics isn't simply to clone humans, but to understand our existence as well as every living thing on our planet and the beneficial results of it. \\"In His Image\\" may or may not be a hoax, a better writer could have made Rorvik's story a little more gripping, but it's the suggestions this book reveals that is so phenomenal.Instead of debating the pro's and con's of cloning, perhaps we should debate the pro's and con's of biological warfare. Read the book \\"Germs\\" and you will find that the proliferation of such deadly viruses as weapons is collossal. There is no match for such malevolence. They are so dangerous that it reaches the conception of biologic annihilation; it puts nuclear weapons to shame and makes cloning totally irrelevent. Most incredibly, research and development still goes on. THAT is where anti-clonists should re-focus their intent."},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","review":"Intriguing and - even three decades ahead - its reading still maintains the possibility of being a real description of what could be the first human being cloning successful procedure.

This book has a rather simple concept, that once read, becomes painfully obvious--no matter what our position in life we all follow someone. Even the President of the USA follows opinion polls.Kelley examines and analyzes the types of followers, their characteristics and identifies methods to motivate them based on their objectives and priorities.It also includes a test to identify your own followership traits. Very insightful. Should be part of every management training and employee development program."},{"Title":"Power of Followership, The","review":"As Kelley points out, most of what gets done in any organization gets done by the followers not the leaders. If you want to know how to become an \\"exemplary follower,\\" or how to encourage those in your families and businesses to become \\"exemplary followers,\\" this book provides an assessment tool that will allow you to understand your \\"followership style\\" as well as the styles of co-workers and family members. Among Kelley's insights is that a person must have a \\"courageous conscience\\" to be an exemplary follower. By that he means, the integrity to know right from wrong and the courage to speak up at appropriate times even at personal cost. Kelley makes clear that a strong personal support system and a strong financial foundation are both essential to permit an \\"exemplary follower\\" to have a \\"courageous conscience.\\""},{"Title":"Power of Followership, The","review":"This book really puts the responsibility of power in perspective: how followers can effect good/bad leadership; how interchangable the roles can be..."},{"Title":"Power of Followership, The","review":"To paraphrase Kelley, &quot;Without Napoleon, the armies were merely a mob.&quot; Kelley's thesis that &quot;followers&quot; are critical to the success of &quot;leaders&quot; is obvious enough to not need much discussion. However, for reasons only known to him (since he doesn't reveal any in this book), he seems able to support his positon only by demeaning &quot;leadership.&quot;Yet, it is obvious that he lacks a fundamental understanding of both followership and leadership. His effort to separate the two and then argue that followers are superior to leaders fails to account for the true relationship: followers are leaders are followers.Kelley shows his total lack of understanding of leadership by defining leaders as really nothing more than someone with followers, and by constantly referring to ineffective managers, bosses, supervisors, and CEOs as &quot;leaders.&quot; Leaders are not leaders because of their organizational position, nor because of their authority (another fatal flaw is his failure to distinguish between authority and power). His examples of ineffective leaders are usually not examples of leadership or leaders at all.On the other hand, he treats followership as somehow unique. While he places leaders into a single group consisting largely of ineffective, dishonest manipulators, he divides followers into four groups, three of which, to varying degrees, are as ineffective as the leaders that he rails against. His fourth group, the effective followers, even if you accept his flawed thesis that followers and leaders are two distinct groups, have the same attributes that Bennis, Gardner, Heifitz, Burns, and many others, have attributed to effective leaders. Indeed, take his descriptions of effective leaders and give them to any qualified student of leadership, and they would say that he is describing leaders, not followers."},{"Title":"Essential Excel 2000 Book","review":"Excellent book for beginning/intermediate business users!

My dismay didn't last long; I hadn't read the familiar stories in a long time, and there were a number of unfamiliar ones as well.Dick Lupoff's one helluva writer and I've always liked the stories of Marvia Plum and Hobart Lindsay, and as a former Berkeley resident, I appreciate the settings of these stories. Several appeared in Mysterious Intent magazine (where yours truly was a regular writer) and Dick contributed some of these stories for the first time. It's about time they were collected too.One standout story that was new to me was \\"News from New Providence\\", a story set in the Bahamas, where Marvia's father Marcus appears. It's a story featuring a, well, an unnamed Duke and Duchess, who are shown to be as self-absorbed and snobby as I always thought from what I read. The familiar themes of collecting and the odd folks who often collect rare objects appear in several of the stories, and Lupoff's sure hand and sure knowledge of history show up everywhere; especially in two stories created for this collection: \\"Golden Glory\\" which has to do with a favorite topic of radio, and \\"Old Folks at Home\\", which revisits memories of Nazi Germany.Alas, the \\"bonus story\\" was not to my taste, but that's not that it is a bad story. It's that, sorry folks, but I am not in any way a Nero Wolfe fan and it really helps to read this story featuring agoraphobic rose mavin Caligula Foxx. That hardly matters overall in this collection. Timmy in \\"Chinese Gunboats\\" - a sensitive an fascinating story that deals with an autistic man who knows whodunnit and tells Marvia about it in his own way.One final note: I know that the author is truly pleased with this publisher. They've done a pretty good job, but I can't get excited about the interior illustrations. I think they're that combination of art and computer and they didn't work for me. However, the cover is truly wonderful. I think it shows off well Lindsey's slightly nebbishy qualities and Marvia's forthright cop nature. A welcome book in our household...."},{"Title":"One Murder at a Time: The Casebook of Lindsey & Plum","review":"It was wonderful to see that Mr. Lupoff hasn't forgotten about Bert and Marvia. I really enjoyed these stories, separate though they were, I kept hoping these two guys would cross paths.

I was disappointed, but it definitely made me anxious for their next mystery together. If you haven't read the series, you're really missing something.

I'm used to thinking of them as a publisher of traditional religious books. Several of which appear on my shelves. I'm not generally drawn to religious fiction, so I never realized that they are the big player in that genre, so I would never have noticed were it not that Mel Odom, who has written a whole bunch of books in genre that I do read a lot (Buffy, Angel, etc.), also has written several books for Tyndale. One, Paid In Blood, found its way onto my reading pile, and I found my nose buried in a piece of military fiction with a bit of a twist.This novel, which I hope is the first of a series, is the story of a Naval Criminal Investigation Service team, that, in investigating the murder of a fellow investigator follows a series of clues across the world until they are in a desperate chase to keep a psychotic terrorist from starting world war three. The telling is quite well done. While the plot is fairly obvious - Odom drops in on the terrorists often enough to make sure the reader understands what is going on - Odom has a knack for building the story as a police procedural rather than as a sneak and shoot tale. The result is that the story proceeds logically, with time for both some interesting twists and some solid character development. In other words, actually is a plotted novel rather than an excuse for weapon discussions and maimed fatalities.Of course, the story is more than just another piece of military fiction. Religion plays a part as the faith of many of the team members is tested. A divorce, the violent death of a friend, another marriage in difficulty, all of these things test the individual members of the team. While I would not normally pick up a novel with acceptance and faith as secondary themes, Odom's writing never comes across are preachy, and the troubles of the characters make them much more human and accessible than they would be if they were all Green Berets on steroids. The result is that I finished the novel once again favorably impressed by Mel Odom's talent.If you like military fiction I suggest you try this. I think you will find interesting and even a bit unusual in a genre that is often guilty of repeating itself."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"As a recently retired NCIS Special Agent, I started to read this book with much interest hoping for an accurate description of NCIS, its mission, and capabilities. Unfortunately, by the second chapter the inaccuracies were such that it totally destroyed any further hope I had for the book.From the start, it should be noted that NCIS is a civilian federal law enforcement agency responsible for conducting felony criminal investigations specifically involving the Department of the Navy (U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps) and the United States, in general. Its Director and senior management are members of the Senior Executive Service (SES) and the Special Agent corps are Federal Criminal Investigators (GS-1811), with the same authority as the FBI, U.S. Customs Service, ATF, U.S. Secret Service, etc. While there is a small cadre of USN Intelligence Officers and USMC Criminal Investigators and Counterintelligence personnel assigned to NCIS, they are subordinate to the civilian law enforcement personnel. The Director, NCIS reports to the Secretary of the Navy (SECNAV).The books primary character/investigator, CDR Will Coburn is a former aircraft carrier Commanding Officer, something that would never occur in reality. First, aircraft carrier COs are O-6 - Captains, not Commanders (O-5) and generally on the road to Admiral. In no way are they eligible nor would they take such a position as a NCIS Special Agent. A carrier CO's age would preclude him/her being accepted to the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) - a prerequisite to becoming a 1811. Also, within the USN hierarchy an assignment as a NCIS Special Agent is not career enhancing.A second major inaccuracy is the fact that NCIS takes over a crime scene out in the local jurisdiction under the notion that NCIS has primacy over all criminal cases involving USN/USMC personnel. In actuality, NIS/NCIS has joint jurisdiction and routinely works with local authorities providing investigative and technical assistance when requested. However, it is not uncommon for local jurisdictions to turn over cases to NCIS particularly when both the subject and victim are military or there is specific federal interest in prosecution. NCIS prides itself on how well they work with local jurisdictions, one reason being a significant number of NCIS Special Agents were recruited from local law enforcement and pride themselves in the relationships they are able to establish and maintain with local law enforcement...NCIS is probably better at this than any other federal criminal investigative agency.Additionally, it should be noted the requirements to become a NCIS Special Agent. At a minimum , Special Agent candidate must possess a Bachelor's Degree, pass an appropriate physical exam, and be able to possess a minimum of a Top Secret security clearance. NCIS does recruit heavily from the law enforcement and military officer community and also look for college graduates possessing specific language capabilities, area studies, and/or academic backgrounds. Upon hiring they must then complete the FLETC and a special NCIS \\"add-on\\". NCIS personnel do not/not attend USN \\"boot camp\\".I realize this book is a work of fiction and while I have no real problem with the plot and its execution, its description of NCIS is so inaccurate I could not make it through the book nor can I recommend it."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"NCIS - Paid in Blood, where to start? First off the spine of the book says \`Novel one' which indicates that there are more coming in this series, so rather than repeat a lot of what's been said in the other two reviews lets look at that aspect. I read an average of 4 - 6 books a month, split between fiction and non fiction, balanced between SCI-FI, Finance and Spirituality. That being said I've delved into my share of series books. If this is indeed the 1st book in a new series, as it appears to be, I have to say that Mel has done something that seems VERY difficult in writing. He's made a 1st book very easy to get involved with. Typically many series books start off using the first volume to fill in the entire back story on every primary character being utilized. Although I do agree that knowing the characters past helps you become involved in their present and care about their future, there have been some very good Volume One's that have been VERY hard to get through, due to all the back story. Whether it's LEFT BEHIND, INTERVIEW WITH A VAMPIRE or LORD OF THE RINGS, the stories themselves are great the books are good, but the depth at which most authors seem to subject their readers to detail of history is overwhelming!Not Mel, he drops you SMACK DAB in the middle of it! There is action and intrigue from page one! Now this is not to say that the characters history is ignored, instead it's fed to you a little bit at a time, in just enough volume to make it palatable and yet still keep it relevant to the story at hand.Mr. Odom should also be applauded at the amount of precise detailed military information that he relates to each character and their story. Not since Tom Clancy in the early 80's have I read a novel with as much accurate detail in relation to the story and the tools being used. More over this isn't simply a recitation of facts and figures in relation to bullet grains and wind velocity, this information is made integral to the movement of the plotline.But most importantly I think that any prospective reader should know up front that Mel has brought us back to a method of story telling that seems buried in the past, but that made so MANY books great! His chapters are short, legible and leave you at a cliff hanger at the end of every one! Whether you like Dan Browns Da Vinci Code or not, I believe that the thing that has made it such a HUGE success is that he brought reading back to the average person! The average chapter in Da Vinci was about 4 pages, and it always left you wanting more! NCIS does the exact same thing! The chapters are more than 4 pages, but within each he moves along several different characters, each being left in a situation where you the reader are holding your breath! I'm not quite old enough to remember the Tom Mix movie serials of the 50's but I absolutely understand the concept! Leave your fans for more! Even the END of the book leaves the reader going \`Hey wait! What happens NEXT?'I first read Mel Odom in his \`sideline' to the Left Behind Series \\"Left Behind-Military\\", and although I am avidly awaiting the continuation of that series, I personally feel that the writing, story, plot and character development in NCIS far outweighs that of the other series. Perhaps it has to do with the investment he as an author makes in characters and a universe of his own creation. Whatever the reason, I for one hope that this does become a series and will be looking out for the next volume. Also a search through this bookstore shows that he has done an awful lot of work with other characters and universes that I'm a fan of. So if, like me, you buy and enjoy this book, I'd strongly recommend you see what else he has on tap."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"I found this book to be a somewhat entertaining read, but as a law enforcement officer who has worked with the real NCIS I found many of the same factual errors that other reviewers have mentioned that were hard for me to get over:1. A Navy Commander would not have been in command of an aircraft carrier.2. The US Navy rank is Warrant Officer, not Warrants Officer.3. NCIS is primarily made up of civilian Special Agents. I don't know if they still even have them or not, but at one time NCIS did have a small number of military Special Agents in certain positions, but those military Special Agents would have no authority to arrest civilians. (Although, like military police, they could detain civilians if on a military base). Even civilian NCIS Special Agents could not arrest a citizen of a foreign country in that country (i.e arresting a S. Korean citizen in S. Korea).Like I said, all in all, it wasn't a bad read if you don't know how far-fetched some of the details are................"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"I really enjoy the NCIS TV series (minus the copius sexual innuendos) and thought this would be a good, wholesome addition.Plot:An NCIS agent is killed when checking in on a coworker's stepson. Will Coburn and his team begin to investigate. As they wrap up the NCIS agent's murder, they realize that something worse is going on: military weapons are being smuggled. What follows is a fast-paced ride through the US, Korea, and Okinawa to find the culprits and stop the ultimate plan: to start World War III.Good:At first, I was rather bored. Not realizing where Odom was going, I thought that he was using the NCIS agent's death to show his readers how good his NCIS team is and then would segue into the real mystery. So I kep reading and going, \\"Okay, when is the mystery going to start?\\"That's when I realized that the NCIS death led to the mystery. Odom wraps up the NCIS agent's murder (which is indirectly related to the main story) so that he can focus on the true mystery--the nuclear war that someone is trying to plan out. As the mystery unravels and the team finally discovers the identity of the one trying to start World War III, the pace gets faster and faster and ends in an explosive conclusion.The author beautifully wove the main story--a possible nuclear war between the superpowers--into the death of the NCIS agent. Further, I was so amazed at the twists and turns in this novel! They were odd (inserting terrorists into the U.S. Navy), but not so odd that you think, \\"Am I reading science fiction?\\"The characters are real and personal. Each person's role in the team makes sense (the author isn't making up some stupid task just so he can put a character in it) and is unique. I just wish they didn't all have supremely depressing personal stories (minus, of course, the late, great Frank Billings). On the other hand, life is tough.Bad:I really don't have a lot of problems with this book. Mostly, it was a little gory, so if you don't like hearing autopsies or going over how someone died or reading about lots and lots of blood, don't read this. The characters are kinda grim--Will is going through a painful divorce, Maggie's father is a control freak, Estrella's husband committed suicide, Shel and his dad don't get along, and Nita doesn't want to be a wife and mom. I would have liked to have seen more character growth and coming to grips with their problems, but if this is going to be a series, that's okay if the author takes his time.Last problem is that the investigation of the NCIS agent in the beginning is too fast. In less than a day, they have processed the crime scene, interrogated neighbors, found the chop shop, brought down the criminals, and gotten a statement/confession. I know Odom was closing this up so he could focus on the real story (good move) but worth noting.Dialogue/Sexual Situations/Violence:No language. Sexual situations consist mostly of brief mentions of scantily dressed women in bars. Several people are shot at or die in the novel. Grisly descriptions of autopsies.Overall:If you like crime scene and mystery mixed with great characters and a military setting, you will like this novel. Can't wait to read his next book!"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Although this book has religious overtones they are almost inserted as a distraction from the story rather than the theme, except for one small miracle. Most of the detail seemed very plausible although Max the attack Labrador seemed a bit beyond belief having owned a series of black Labradors who would be more likely to lick to death than anything else; there are also noticeable errors in the description of photographic equipment. This aside and I have no knowledge of forensic processes everything seems to hang together well. It is an exciting tale which moves quickly and although the first of a series does work as a standalone novel. I could visualise the characters, even the Labrador, and locations which added to the realistic feel. The plot is fairly straight forward rather than multi-stranded It starts with a prologue that seems to have little relevance to the rest of the book as it is about a Yaseen the ultimate villain in the story being let down over the supply of missiles, the story then switches to a murder victim and the search for the killer however everything soon comes together and everything is tidied up nicely."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"This book is unrealistic...if you have a military/law enforcement background it will disgust you. \\"Special Agents\\" running around with 2 pistols out shooting gangster style haha"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"I found this book in the free ebooks section and I had it for 2 weeks before I was bored at the pool and started reading it.

This was obvious when the main character did not notify the proper chain of command after he theorized correctly that a terrorist-lead, nuclear-missile armed ship is headed straight toward them. After the initial meeting with the sub's Captain (not the Commander) who sends an arrest team after a culprit, he never issues orders to protect his crew or sub. Another poor decision was made to surface the sub to send a message about a new murder not about the nuclear missile threat. This made the sub a sitting-duck waiting to be attacked. What sub Captain or Commander would make dumb decisions like this? Even after the torpedos hit, the NCIS team ask each other what is happening. The whole book was strange.

It has missing nuclear missiles, murder, black market action and more. These events are woven together in an entertaining way.The problems with the book are mostly in the areas of editing and lack of knowledge of the military. For example, the author referred to someone being a 'warrants officer' several times; it should have been 'warrant officer'.In another section, Mr. Odom introduced a character named Seaman 2nd Class Edward Dill. Just four pages later, he referred to the same person as 'Ensign Dill'. That kind of carelessness does not bring credibility to a book.I would encourage the author to study and learn a lot more about the military before attempting another book like this.

Command of aircraft carriers go to very senior four stripe Captains, usually the ships navagator is also a Full Captain and the Exec Officer of the USS Kennedy would have been a four stripe captain.As a former Police Officer I can also see errors of juristiction. The NCIS may have full juristiction on a Military Base but their authority does not extend beyond those limits. An off base Homicide investigation would still fall under the juristiction of the local authorites. Those authoraties might or might not agree to NCIS participatation but they would not relenquish the entire case. I also resent the implication that the Wilmington Homicide investigator was a fat moron."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"I didn't get far because the religious references and the bible thumping were too much for me.

I wasn't sure what the Christian references added to the book. It didn't seem relevant to what was happening. There did seem to be some areas of the book left hanging. There was a lot about Will's divorce in the making, but was never mentioned once he left the base. It didn't makes sense to make it such a big deal and then nothing. Maybe there is a sequel that resolves it.

The parts with religious undertones also didn't fit with the rest of the writing. They seemed forced, as though the writer inserted them as an afterthought. I wish I had known about the religious undertones of this book. I wouldn't have read it if I had known they would be so prevalent and poorly written.Even not being military myself, I spotted several errors that were confirmed by other reviewers, such as the \\"commander\\" of an aircraft carrier becoming an NCIS investigator. That makes no sense. I don't think these factual errors were so awful that the average person would not be able to read the book because of them, but they definitely should have been better researched. If you are going to write a book about something that is loosely based on actual organizations, then I feel you should know how those organizations work and what they do."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"The death of NCIS agent bring Will Coburn and his team to an empty apartment in Wilmington. But the death of a fellow agent is the beginning of events that will lead the team from the United States, Japan to Korea,where a solider is invovled in things that could decided the fate of the world. As Will and his team deal with this crisis they are also dealing with their own problems that may make them lose focus and put the whole world in danger.\\"Paid in Blood\\" is the first book in the \\"NCIS\\" series by Mel Odom. I have to admit the reason that I picked up this book is that I am fan of the series and while I knew that I wasn't going to be seeing Gibbs & Co, I did expect that the writer could get some of the details on how NCIS works. This really bugged and kind of turned me off to the whole book and I was glad that I only bought the first book and not the whole series as I planned.

This first book in his NCIS series contains non-stop action, intriguing characters and great locales.Commander Will Coburn heads a specialist NCIS team undertaking covert investigations in potentially lethal situations. Each member of his team brings with him or her specialist skills which uncover the evidence necessary to put terrorists and criminals behind bars. When NCIS agent, Chief Petty Officer Helen Swafford, is found murdered, Will's team is plunged into a global terrorist plot which could jeopardize the security of the United States and its allies. As evidence in the North Carolina crime scene is gathered the team is led to South Korea and confrontations with Colombian drug lords and Russian mobsters.Mel Odom's attention to detail makes this book a thrill to read. The plot is tight with unseen twists and the characters are fascinating, not only for their occupational skills, but for their complicated personal lives that have shaped the way they view the world. I hope Tyndale's decision to limit the series to two books changes as there is scope for plenty more action and character growth from this NCIS team!"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"This is the first in a series of NCIS books that I have recently found and started reading.

Want to know what happens to the characters in the book series. Happy reading."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Though somewhat immune to murder having been a Naval Criminal Investigative Services Agent for a few years, in Wilmington, North Carolina Commander Will Coburn sadly looks at the corpse of NCIS Chief Petty Officer Helen Swafford, who was on her own unauthorized hook when her throat was slashed. As he wonders what she was involved in, Will and his team (Maggie Foley, Shel McHenry, Estrella Montoya, Dr. Nita Tomlinson, and Frank Billings ) begins tracking clues involving the illegal trafficking of military weapons being sold to rogue states and terrorist groups. Their efforts lead them to Chainae, Republic of Korea where they spy on a suspected weapons dealer.However, to their shock and chagrin, hooligans working for a drug dealer abduct their prime suspect. When they finally catch up to the kidnappers and their victim, the NCIS team find corpses only, as if someone knows what they are doing and wiped out the evidence. The Navy takes control of the body of their prime suspect, only to have it snatched from them leaving behind a dead NCIS agent. With no time to mend fences at home though each, except perhaps Frank, face personal crisis, the unit finds clues in South Korea, Colombia, Russia, and the Middle East, but how drug dealers and weapons sellers converge as their commodity markets are so different remains just out of reach.Though the investigation turns over the top with global repercussions, Mel Odom's fine NCIS thriller is an exciting tale starring real people as the Navy investigators. Each of the team members has issues back home with family members or with themselves as they struggle with personal demons while battling an insidious unknown enemy who may be connecting two major illegal commodity selling groups into a super power. Fans will enjoy observing the dedicated team members follow the clues in North Carolina and overseas trying to save the big world while their little world teeters on the brink of implosion.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Enjoyed this book by Mel Odom.

In the backdrop there is the one described in the blurb, about a NCIS team trying to unravel the plot of a deadly mastermind and is quite engaging and a decent read. Unfortunately the two stories are not woven neatly, with Will's crisis of faith jarring the flow of the plot rather than adding to it as the scheme is uncovered.

That being said why let it ruin the rest of the read for you? The book had an escalating plot where details revealed more details in a nice flow going from a minor incident to a major one. It was fast and entertaining and kept my attention for a rainy day. One reviewer said, \\"Like I said, all in all, it wasn't a bad read if you don't know how far-fetched some of the details are\\".

I was trying to live with these inaccuracies, but it just kept getting worse.Two of the characters are \\"professional\\" agents, but they carry two full sized handguns and use them like a gunfighter in the old west.

This book does not."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Naval Criminal Investigative Services (NCIS) agent Will Coburn firmly believes in following the trail of evidence wherever it leads him. His team is called to the death scene of one of their own, Chief Petty Officer Helen Swafford. Little does the NCIS realize, but the clock is ticking towards World War Three and Swafford's death will provide them the clues to an even bigger and deadlier crime.Qadir Yaseen hates both the Israelis and Americans, referring to the Americans as Satans on several occasions. His diabolical plan to ignite a world war that will set numerous countries against America is already in place and all of the pieces seem to be coming together. The only thing standing in the way of his success is Will Coburn and the NCIS team. Qadir is willing to do whatever it takes to destroy Israel and America. The NCIS will have to have the same determination to stop Qadir- even if it means risking their lives in the process.Mel Odom has crafted a very credible thriller that is sure to spark great debate among readers due to the issues of faith addressed. Qadir's faith in Allah is paramount to his role as a terrorist as he truly believes that fighting Israel is the correct and only thing he can do. Mr. Odom does a fabulous job at showing Qadir's motivation for his actions.Qadir's faith in Allah is juxtaposed with the Christian faith displayed by several of the NCIS members, including Frank and Will. Frank's faith in God is very solid whereas Will's faith is a bit shaky due to the recent break up of his marriage. Mr. Odom cleverly intertwines religious questions with the very real situations that many people face, including marriage difficulties, drinking alcohol, child abuse, and even death without being preachy or overbearing. Instead, PAID IN BLOOD stands as a beautiful testament to the Christian faith as it shows very realistic characters struggling with very real issues.PAID IN BLOOD is a fantastic action-packed adventure that takes readers on an international journey while delving into forensic science. This reviewer is relatively new to Mel Odom's writing but is quickly becoming a fan based on solid storytelling such as found in PAID IN BLOOD. Interesting characters and a storyline full of twists and turns make this a fascinating read and one that is sure to garner Mr. Odom some new fans!COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Nice character development, great technical detail, story line was action packed and was delivered with continuous action. Well written action thriller."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"I enjoyed the book. I am a fan of the original NCIS TV show. I expected it to be similar to the type of action found there. As ex-military I found a few of the military moments a touch stretched but over all passable. The flow of the book was well done and the \\"Who done it?\\" parts were well done. I don't want to give anything away but as I was driving home listening to the book on the kindle I found myself every now and then saying \\"OH No! Not him!! or Not her!\\" There was even one moment where I said \\"don't open that door!\\" knowing what would happen if he did and it did. But over all it was enjoyable and I am going to see the writer has more books. I hope so it was a good read. Yes the reliance on God by the main characters was outstanding.

While the plot will be familiar to anyone who has watched the NCIS television show, the characters won't be. That being said, the characters in PiB are well drawn and fleshed out.

Finally, this book lacks the editorial gaffs that are usually found in free Kindle offerings. Props to Odom and thanks for sharing this at no cost!"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"\\"Paid in Blood\\" is a detective suspense novel which ended like an action-packed military thriller. While the reader knows who the main bad guy is and the broad picture of his evil plan, the reader had to learn the details of the scheme along with the heroes and hope they'd solve it in time. Suspense was also created by the various family problems that the characters were dealing with and the physical danger at various points.The forensic details of the investigation were excellent and woven into the story without slowing the action. However, apparently there were many inaccurate details about how the Naval Criminal Investigation Service is actually run.The characters were interesting, varied, and complex. They dealt with realistic family problems (a marriage falling apart, an unwanted marriage, a single mom feeling guilty about leaving her child so much, etc.) in addition to the investigation. The bad guys seemed unrealistically unwavering in their motives (a.k.a. cliche bad guys), but that's true for many thrillers.Several of the main characters were Christians. Mel was bitter toward God for letting his marriage fall apart after all his prayers and efforts to save it, and several other main characters felt that God had let them down in their family situations. However, their parents or friends urged them to trust God despite circumstances.There was no sex. There was a very minor amount of \\"he cussed\\" style bad language. Overall, I'd recommend this fast-paced, exciting novel."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"PAID IN BLOOD by Mel Odom is filled with suspenseful twists and turns, riveting plots, and complex characters. What starts off as a murder investigation of one of their own NCIS officers, ends up leading Commander Colburn and his team to uncover a plot that links together terrorist from South Korea, Japan, Russia, and someone inside the United States Navy.Though the genre I enjoy most is romance, which PAID IN BLOOD is not, I thoroughly enjoyed this action pack thriller and can't wait to learn more about the intriguing characters that make up the NCIS team. If you enjoy fast paced fiction, you will enjoy PAID IN BLOOD"},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"Qadir Yaseen knows that Israel can never be defeated as long as America arms it. But Israel, the nation that stole hs homeland destroyed his entire family, and caused the deaths of so many others must be destroyed. So Qadir comes up with a monumental plot to destroy, or at least distract America for years--long enough for the Arab world to rise againstIsrael. Qadir is cetain that God is on his side.With his marriage in tatters, NCIS (Naval Criminal Investigative Service) Commander Will Coburn isn't at all sure God is on his side. Still, whe one of his teemmates is murdered, Will goes to work tracking down the killer. What he finds initially doesn't seem to add up. Over time, though, it begins to make a horrible kind of sense. Will has caught a small piece of Qadir's plan. But Qadir has been plotting for years and Will has only days to uncover the full truth. It would take a miracle to stop the destruction.Author Mel Odom delivers an action-packed thriller. Will and his team face Columbian druglords, Hispanic assassins, the Korean Maffia, and Arab warriors willing to die (and kill) for their faith. Odom has researched his crime-scene techniques and the investigation felt very real and pressing as the team traveled the world in search of clues.The religious aspect of this story is a bit heavy-handed for the secular reader. Odom leaves the reader with no doubt that Qadir's God is not the real God of the ultra-Christian NCIS. Bringing this message home strongly, the Christian God repeatedly delivers on behalf of the NCIS team. The book's target audience (Tyndale is a Christian publisher), however, will definitely approve of the message. Considering this, I thought Odom did a fine job motivating Qadir, explaining how his loss of two families (including young children) to Israeli attacks, drove him to adopting his extreme plan.The generally fast-paced story occasionally bogged down over religion, praying, and especially Will's concern over his upcoming divorce. With saving the world at stake, surely Will could have put the impending divorce on the back burner--especially given that he had separated many months before the story began. Still, once Odom gets back into action, though, PAID IN BLOOD is compelling reading, especially for the Christian target market."},{"Title":"Paid in Blood (NCIS Series #1)","review":"A dead NCIS agent and a cache of illegal military weapons lead Commander Will Coburn's NCIS team on an international hunt with stakes bigger than the team can imagine in Mel Odom's Paid in Blood. Even as they follow the suspected weapons dealer, their suspect is grabbed by a prominent South Korean drug dealer's thugs. Then someone murders both the suspect and the thugs. When one of their team member dies trying to prevent the theft of the suspect's body from a U.S. military morgue, the hunt becomes personal.As they pursue the case, the team faces attempted murders of themselves and witnesses. They face down drug dealers and find complications in Colombia, Russia, and the Middle East. The investigation leads to a conspiracy to engulf the world in World War III.Odom develops his characters well with realistic friendships, tensions, and problems. Commander Coburn's wife serves him with divorce papers as he leaves for South Korea. Tough \\"guys,\\" Maggie Foley and Shel McHenry, have problems with their parents. Estrella Montoya, the team's computer whiz, is a single mom trying to raise a young son by herself following her husband's suicide, and Dr. Nita Tomlinson, the team's medical examiner, struggles with alcohol and a marriage that she is driving to ruin. Only Frank Billings, Will's number two, seems to have his life and relationships together.Taking advantage of the popular interest in forensic science, Odom uses his crime scene investigative background to write a military page-turner. He also draws on current international tensions to create a suspenseful story that is hard to put down. Though the plot is complicated, and, at points, borders on bizarre, Odom smoothes out the wrinkles with skill. My only real problem with the series is that Tyndale House plans to limit it to only two books. With Odom's characterization and plotting ability, two is simply not enough! - Debbie W.

The investigation into the murder leads them to a local crime ring that has ties to stolen military weapons and drugs that are being smuggled around the world on Navy vessels. One clue leads to another and the team finds themselves in the middle of a desperate battle to keep a homicidal terrorist mastermind from starting World War III.It is an easy and enjoyable read. I picked it up and had read two hundred pages before I even thought to put it down. Mel writes in a style that is compelling and enjoyable. Mel's characters were well written, dealing with real life problems while having to work in a stressful and hazardous world.As in all Tyndale books, the Christian faith plays an important part.

There's topics ranging from American Airlines' &quot;Bistro&quot; style food (&quot;A lot better than saying 'a sack of inedible objects'&quot;), Who Wants To Be A Millionaire (&quot;The dramatic hit quiz show that has all of America wondering, how, exactly I [Regis] became famous in the first place.&quot;); not to mention colleges, low-flow toilets (his idea for that solution is to declare war on Canada), Online stock trading (&quot;You should try to pick a broker with a good TV commercial&quot;), taxes, lots of stuff on Airlines, The Rolling Stones, and, my personal favorite, Mr. Language Person (&quot;You got a question for Mr. Language Person? He does not care&quot;). Oh, and The Low Flow Millionaires would make a great name for a rock band."},{"Title":"Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down","review":"This is another compilation of columns, somewhat more disjointed than Dave Barry's Money Secrets. It's great for listening to in a car, because there's really nothing - no plot - to keep track of, and you can just listen now and then. It's quirky and funny, that's about it. If you like the columns, obviously, this is something to listen to."},{"Title":"Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down","review":"If I wasn't so familiar with Dave Barry's work, I would probably have called this a five star book; it is a delightfully funny collection of columns by one of the best humorists in the world.

This just goes to show you that Dave is old, but he doesn't mind making fun of the fact that he's old.

By the way, I support his &quot;movement&quot; to &quot;eliminate&quot; these newly federally-mandated 1.6 gallon toilets.

Whether he's talking about flushing &quot;acts of congress&quot; (#2) down a low gallon toilet or his coffee addiction, he makes me laugh out loud every 2 minutes. I was so engrossed in the book that I didn't realize I was near the end and sat around not believing that it had ended. Then, I entered a deep depression.... Okay, I'm lying, but I was disappointed that I didn't have another one of his books right there to keep me going.If you've never read Barry before, rush out and buy this.

And THEN I got to the column he did on SUVs. That's when I laughed myself into an earache. How many of you out there drive one of those big honker Chevrolet Subdivisions (as Dave has rechristened them)?

This is his latest hilarious collection of columns from papers across the nation. Mr. Barry is as gut-wrenchingly funny as ever. (And he got a toilet on the cover of the book)Among the intense, serious topics discussed in this are:*&quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; and their questioning system (&quot;You call your mother DURING THE X-FILES??&quot;)*The new toilets and why we hate them so much. (&quot;They stink. Literally&quot;)*The return of Mr. Language Person! (&quot;I Lost 40 Lbs. in Two Months!

Mr. Barry thrives on the absurdity of real life in his own warped universe, and the scariest thing is that he makes a great deal of sense. He also has an endearing way of creating a perfectly normal sentence, and then ending it with something bizarre like &quot;weasel boogers.&quot;With the help of alert (or possibly insane) readers across the world, Mr. Barry brings the weekly belly-laugh to American doors.

Well, here's your chance with Dave Barry's book, Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! While the cover shot may have visions of the scatological Farrelly Brothers doing the can-can in your head, you can put a lid on that: Barry's humor is irreverent, yes, but it is tidy-bowl clean.Although I appreciate a good laugh as much as anyone, I have a rather serious countenance. I'm the kind of person that total strangers come up to and command, \\"Smile!\\" Another oft-posed question is, \\"Why aren't you smiling?\\" Like I'm supposed to be standing in line at the Post Office or the DMV grinning like an idiot. One possible solution could be Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! This book did have me smiling a lot, chuckling, and even - lo and behold! - laughing out loud. (This gets an entirely different reaction while standing in line at the Post Office or the DMV... It has fellow line-loungers casting furtive glances at the \\"wanted\\" posters on the walls.)Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! is a collection of the humorist's previously published columns. Barry has been with The Miami Herald for nearly 20 years now, and his commentary has been syndicated all over the planet - in case you are wondering (as was I), he received the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1988. According to his bio, \\"Barry writes about various major issues relating to the international economy, the future of democracy, the social infrastructure and exploding toilets.\\"I have read several of Barry's books before, and while I prefer the ones on a theme (Dave Barry Does Japan is my personal fave), the compilations are fun too, because I'm always bound to find a little something that tickles me. The only complaint I have about these compilations, and this one in particular, are when timely themes are included. They \\"date\\" the book, and even though it's brand new, it seems old in some places (one I can recall offhand is mention of the impending Y2K problem that never materialized).There were quite a few bits and pieces that struck a personal chord with me. As the driver of a little sports job, I was howling with laughter at Barry's rant on SUV drivers:\\"...What people mainly do with Sports Utility Vehicles, as far as I can tell, is try to maneuver them in and out of parking spaces. I base this statement on my local supermarket, where many of the upscale patrons drive Chevrolet Subdivisions. I've noticed that these people often purchase just a couple of items - maybe a bottle of diet water and a two-ounce package of low-fat dried carrot shreds - which they put into the back of their Subdivisions, which have approximately the same cargo capacity, in cubic feet, as Finland... Then comes the scary part: getting out of the parking space... I drive a compact car, and on a number of occasions have found myself trapped behind a Subdivision backing directly toward me, its massive metal butt looming high over my head, making me feel like a Tokyo pedestrian looking up at Godzilla. I've tried honking my horn, but (they) can't hear me, because they're always talking on phones the size of Chiclets (The Bigger Your Car, The Smaller Your Phone, that is their motto).\\"And forget Mars and Venus - Barry knows guys better than Gray could ever hope to. He has a reoccurring report in his column on Stuff That Guys Do, and a couple of them are presented here in the chapters Rubber-Band Man (\\"...Guys like to do stuff. This explains both the Space Shuttle and mailbox vandalism.\\"), and Rock of Ages (\\"At some point or another, almost every guy wants an electric guitar. Electric guitars exert a strong appeal for guys, because they combine two critical elements: 1. guitar, 2. electricity.\\")This is the sort of book that you'll want to read passages from, aloud, to anyone within earshot whether they like it or not. Barry has something to say about everything from the government's spending habits to the climate in Florida. Even if you're not especially interested in the government's spending habits or the climate in Florida, I bet you'll get a snicker or two from Dave Barry Is Not Taking This Sitting Down! You really can't go wrong with this book.Let's just say Dave Barry is the American Standard of humorists working today. He goes to the head of the class. He's a damn sight funnier than Harry Potter.

I would give this zero stars if I could, only because of the narration. As usualy, Dave Barry is very funny, but it doesn't come through in this version because it's impossible to get past the narrator's reading. In a word, he is AWFUL. He sounds like a combination between a bad Paul Harvey impersonator and the adult voice of Ralphie in &quot;A Christmas Story.&quot; His timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book. I couldn't get through one of the five CDs before I wanted to throw the thing out the window. It would have been great if they had used someone like Harry Anderson (who played a fictionalized version of Dave on TV a few years ago) to read this, and then perhaps Barry's humor would have come through.

You won't be able to turn the pages fast enough."},{"Title":"Loss and gain: The story of a convert","review":"The quaintly punctuated title of Cardinal Newman's first novel, LOSS AND GAIN; OR, THE STORY OF A CONVERT says much. Nineteenth Century England abounded in conversion novels and Newman's stands head and shoulders above all the rest. That, at least, was the opinion of Harvard history professor Robert Lee Wolff in his monumental 1977 GAINS AND LOSSES: NOVELS OF FAITH AND DOUBT IN VICTORIAN ENGLAND....John Henry Newman (1801-1890) deserves a far wider non-specialist readership than he now enjoys. Once England hung on his every word: whether sermon, philosophy, church history, poetry, apologetics, satire or controversy. He does not lack for professional readers who take up formidable masterpieces such as APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA, THE IDEA OF A UNIVERSITY, ARIANS OF THE FOURTH CENTURY or A GRAMMAR OF ASSENT....LOSS AND GAIN may well be the easiest and best place for non-specialists to begin with myriad-minded John Henry Newman. It is a novel about Oxford and fleshes out Newman's belief that students form their deepest convictions from their discussions with one another and not from teachers. It is also a novel very much like a Platonic dialog that presents and wrestles with various theories of why intelligent young men are either content to stay with their inherited personal faith or are moved to seek another....LOSS AND GAIN covers six years in the life of Charles Reding (pronounced READing) and his interactions with family, teachers, tutors and fellow students of various Oxford University colleges about which of the Christian denominations and trends in England of the 1840s had greatest claim to be taken seriously and to teach the truth. Problems debated are perennial since the Reformation: is there a visible church? Does it have authority to teach definitively? What is faith? What is reason's role in reaching faith? Who needs a Pope?...A tutor's systematic lectures on the 39 Articles of the established Church of England, interpreted by the hero as mere 16th Century \\"articles of peace,\\" a doctrinal hodgepodge of Roman Catholicism, Zwingli, Luther and Calvin, leaves an increasingly troubled Reding shaken in his inherited trust in his clergyman father's simple faith in the Church of England. Some of his Anglo-Catholic friends play at re-establishing Catholic practices without the Roman Catholic beliefs behind them. Others move towards rationalism and Unitarianism. Others yet are caught up in the emotional but action-oriented and society-transforming Evangelicalism of the age....In the end Charles (like Newman after a 12 year struggle) opted to become Roman Catholic, thereby losing his right to take an Oxford degree, and alienating friends and family alike. He gained, he judged, truth and peace....The debates of Oxford in the 1840s go on today in America and elsewhere. Recently converted himself to the Church of Rome, Newman pokes fun at the frequent shallowness and selfish career seeking that an Establishment of (the wrong) religion inevitably promotes. He also lovingly enlivens a bygone time at Oxford University where until very recently he had himself been the foremost leader of the Oxford Movement to reform the Church of England in a Catholic but non-Papal direction. Had he persuaded in TRACTS FOR THE TIMES # 90 even one Anglican bishop of the correctness of his Catholic interpretation of the 39 Articles, very likely neither Newman nor hundreds of others would have so suddenly gone over to Rome....The book has color, humor, religious insight and respect for individual consciences. Charles Reding exemplifies Newman's belief that God leads each person of good will at an individual, unforced, respectful pace from his or her inherited religion toward ever closer union with Himself. He who first tastes Newman through reading LOSS AND GAIN will not be disappointed and will reach out for more and more of his works, both verse and prose."},{"Title":"Loss and gain: The story of a convert","review":"Whether you are interested in the book or not, read him. If you like to read, this takes reading to a new, higher, level. His ability is like music to enjoy. If you like the subject, that's a bonus."},{"Title":"Loss and gain: The story of a convert","review":"John Henry Newman was a leading spiritual and intellectual figure in the so-called \\"Oxford Movement\\" in the Anglican Church when, after a lengthy spiritual struggle, he converted to Catholicism in 1845. Some of his friends preceded him into the Church and many of his followers followed him, which made for considerable controversy in robustly anti-Catholic mid-Victorian England. A small number of these converts later \\"reverted\\" and one of these, a Miss Elizabeth Harris, published an anti-Catholic novel in 1847 entitled FROM OXFORD TO ROME: AND HOW IT FARED WITH SOME WHO LATELY MADE THE JOURNEY. Beyond hoping to dissuade other potential converts from \\"going over to Rome\\" as the saying went, Miss Harris hinted in her novel that Newman and some of the other converts from the Oxford Movement were likewise regretting their decision and contemplating a return to the Established Church of England.Recently ordained a priest, Newman was in Rome when the novel was sent to him in the summer of 1847, and he quickly set about \\"answering\\" it with a novel of his own, his first, and the first book he ever published as a Catholic, LOSS AND GAIN: THE STORY OF A CONVERT. Insofar as the novel partakes a little of spiritual autobiography in a fictionalized form, it is often considered a sort of run-up to Newman's autobiographical masterpiece, APOLOGIA PRO VITA SUA, published in 1864 and also written in response to an anti-Catholic work.LOSS AND GAIN tells the story of Charles Reding, an earnest young student at Oxford in the 1840s, when the Oxford Movement was in full swing. Reding's ecclesiastical views, particularly in regards to the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Anglican Church, to which he must subscribe if he wishes to take his degree, undergo a sometimes painful process of transformation. This process, ultimately leading to Reding's conversion, takes place over the course of several years and is narrated in the book largely through Reding' conversations with other students and dons. The views of Reding' interlocutors run the gamut of mid-Victorian spirituality, from an indifferent Liberalism to a fervently anti-Catholic Evangelicalism to a High Church Aestheticism to a mushy-mystical Swedenborgianism. As the story--and Charles' change of mind--unfolds, the reader is given a glimpse, sometimes a surprisingly funny and even satirical one--Bl. Cardinal Newman, funny...who knew?---of the religious landscape in which Newman lived and moved and had his being.Even when an Anglican, as his letters prove, Newman was particularly critical of theological loosey-gooseyness and the attitude of entitled complacency that he believed had developed in the English clergy as a result of the English Church's social and economic privileges, and its being under the spiritual headship of the English monarchy. Here, for example, is Newman's delicious description of one \\"Dr. Brownside, the new Dean of Nottingham, sometime Huntingdonian Professor of Divinity, and one of the acutest, if not soundest academical thinkers of the day\\":\\"He was a little, prim, smirking, be-spectacled man, bald in front, with curly black hair behind, somewhat pompous in his manner, with a clear musical utterance, which enabled one to listen to him without effort. As a divine, he seemed never to have had any difficulty on any subject; he was so clear or so shallow, that he saw to the bottom of all his thoughts: or, since Dr. Johnson tells us that \\"all shallows are clear,\\" we may perhaps distinguish him by both epithets. Revelation to him, instead of being the abyss of God's counsels, with its dim outlines and broad shadows, was a flat, sunny plain, laid out with straight macadamised roads. Not, of course, that he denied the Divine incomprehensibility itself, with certain heretics of old; but he maintained that in Revelation all that was mysterious had been left out, and nothing given us but what was practical, and directly concerned us. It was, moreover, to him a marvel, that every one did not agree with him in taking this simple, natural view, which he thought almost self-evident; and he attributed the phenomenon, which was by no means uncommon, to some want of clearness of head, or twist of mind, as the case might be. He was a popular preacher; that is, though he had few followers, he had numerous hearers; and on this occasion the church was overflowing with the young men of the place.\\"Perhaps my favorite scene in the novel takes place near the end, when news is getting round that Reding is about to be lost to the Established Church. (There's even notice of it in the newspaper--that's how seriously people took it when some educated Victorian \\"crossed the Tiber.\\") The emotionally exhausted young man is sitting in a hotel room near the monastery where he intends to be received into the Roman Church, suffering all the slings and arrows of anti-Catholic prejudice--of having to give up Oxford, friends and even the love and respect of his family, in order to follow his conscience--when a veritable Fool's Parade of well-meaning but insufferable strangers, reflecting every hue of the ecclesiastical spectrum in mid-Victorian England, comes knocking on Reding's inn door intent on dissuading him from turning papist. With Reding, the reader hardly knows whether to laugh or cry, but it is vintage Newman at his orneriest and most entertaining.LOSS AND GAIN is an unusual novel by modern standards. There are no gunfights or love scenes; hardly anything \\"happens\\"...except that a soul undergoes a quietly momentous revolution, one conversation, one idea at a time, and this when the cost was still very high. Since in some senses the price of being Catholic is once again becoming culturally steep, LOSS AND GAIN, for all its Victorian peculiarities, may prove more relevant to twenty-first century readers than one would initially suppose. Beyond that, LOSS AND GAIN is a great way to get acquainted with the writings (here, in a somewhat \\"lighter\\" vein) of one of the greatest minds,and prose stylists in the history of both the Church and the English language."},{"Title":"Loss and gain: The story of a convert","review":"If you want this book, buy the Ignatius Critical Edition (also available through Amazon), which is sized and typeset like a normal book (and has helpful footnotes for Latin expressions, etc., too).This book is the size of an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet and was typeset like a college paper on an old typewriter.

There was a subject about Essentials of Developmental Biology in my Biology Department.

Very similar to Ajahn Chah's style of teaching.Though it is easy to understand even for beginners, the teaching provides for advanced practice in training the mind for on the cushion and off."},{"Title":"Pure and Simple: The Extraordinary Teachings of a Thai Buddhist Laywoman","review":"I read the online version of this book from Access to Insight and was amazed by the grasp this remarkable laywoman had of the practice of the Dhamma. Her practice and account of it should be an inspiration to all of us lay Buddhists out there. The Dhamma and the Deathless are real and can be achieved by human effort. One must give up a lot and go against the grain of the world but the peace of Nibbana is there for all of us, lay or ordained if only we would follow the path. There are so many other books on Buddhism out there by scholars and others who try to fit the Dhamma into the narratives of Western Science or Western Cultural values and assumptions but they are all false or misguided because they don't face the Dhamma on it's own terms. Both the author and the translator have truly practiced the Dhamma according to the Dhamma. The truth in this book rings as clear as a bell and I hope anyone with a serious interest in practicing the Dhamma will pick it up and make use of it."},{"Title":"Pure and Simple: The Extraordinary Teachings of a Thai Buddhist Laywoman","review":"Contemporary Buddhism is a house of many mansions. The myriad traditions, practices, and rituals can be bewildering to a seasoned practitioner of Buddhism, let alone to a newcomer. One good way to evaluate any tradition is to look at its prominent teachers and writers. Thanissaro Bhikkhu (Ajahn Geoff), the abbot of Wat Metta in Valley Center California (near San Diego), has solid credentials. I had the good fortune to meet him and speak with him about 15 years ago. (Now that I've moved back to California, I hope to visit him again.) By that time, he had already studied for 15 years in Thailand under very prominent masters in the Thai forest tradition. So, he's been at it for 30+ years. Since taking the position at Wat Metta, he has written and translated prolifically, making available books, pamphlets, and sermons on just about every facet of Theravada Buddhism. Although he is an American, he is fluent in both the Thai and Pali languages. He has a gift for making what can be somewhat esoteric teachings accessible to a Western audience. And I know that he walks the talk. He and his monks at Wat Metta abide strictly by the Vinaya rules. You can learn more by seaching his name, or \\"Wat Metta.\\" Check out the Wat Metta Dhamma Talk Archive. There you'll find a catalogue of sermons on many topics, which you can listen to. I usually listen to one or two before I begin a meditation session.Thailand, where the forest tradition is alive and well, also has many women who are celebrated meditation teachers. The subject of this book is one of them. Another short book he translated (even though his name doesn't appear on it) is \\"Reading the Mind: Advice for Meditators.\\" It's a translation of the woman teacher Tan Ajahn Kor Khao-Suan Luang. Although short (only 41 pages), it has been the single most helpful book on meditation I've ever come across, and it's my constant companion. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding that meditation is a process of RECOGNIZING AND ROOTING OUT MENTAL DEFILEMENTS. There are many forms of \\"meditation\\" being packaged and marketed in the contemporary spiritual marketplace which never even mention mental defilements. I can categorically assert that, from a spiritual point of view, they are useless. It is the mental defilements, to which we tenaciously cling, that are the source of our suffering. The Buddha categorically stated that \\"It's suffering I teach, and the end of suffering.\\"Meditation is not easy, because the defiled mind has myriad defenses against it. It requires determination and consistent practice over a period of time. A good teacher isn't going to tell you what you want to hear. He or she isn't going to try to sell you the notion of \\"instant enlightenment.\\" He or she isn't trying to sell you anything. You alone must decide whether the goal is worth the effort. If it is, you really have no alternative to it. In the end, you're liberated from suffering by your own efforts, and faith in the Dharma. Such faith is, however, not \\"blind faith.\\" The results are such that you can experience them for yourself. Be assured, however, that no \\"guru\\" is going to save you. One of the most attractive characteristics of the Theravada Buddhist tradition (\\"the Way of the Elders\\") is that, while it has its esteemed teachers, the very idea of a holy-man \\"guru\\" is alien to it. You'll find no teacher, monk or otherwise, who boasts of his or her spiritual achievements, or sets himself or herself up as an idol to be worshipped. In fact, boasting of one's spiritual achievements, especially if such boasts are untrue, is a serious infraction of the Vinaya rules, the code of conduct for Buddhist monastics.If you've come to the conclusion that your life amounts to little more than a chasing after wind, or running toward the horizon (the faster you run toward it, the faster it recedes), Buddhism is a good place to start getting your house in order. And you can do no better than to begin with the teachings and writings of the translator of this book."},{"Title":"Pure and Simple: The Extraordinary Teachings of a Thai Buddhist Laywoman","review":"It seemed like Upasika Kee Nanayon was talking directly to me.

However, it was really neither, or perhaps a little of both. Overall, I was disappointed (hence only three stars) but I want to applaud Angel for his good intentions.Essentially, the book tries to convince readers that we can have real fellowship with other Christians despite theological disagreements. Though the subtitle is about Catholics and Protestants, Angel also discusses differences between different denominations of Protestantism. It's more about Christian unity in general than specifically about Catholic-Protestant relations, I'd say.I felt that the book was at its best when Angel told concrete stories about problems or solutions to interfaith disagreement. He clearly has a good deal of experience with different kinds of Christians and his stories were interesting. At other times, however, he seemed rather vague and \\"fuzzy.\\" Further, I felt that the book at times lacked practicality. There's a good deal in it about love, but not a lot about how to put that love into action given the state of the Church. I would have liked to see more of that.The author makes certain unacknowledge assumptions about Church history that are problematic, given that it is supposed to be for both Catholics and Protestants. Catholic readers may likely be off-put by the author's attitude towards tradition; he believes the early church became corrupt in the second century when all that bad theologizing (!) started happening. What seems most problematic is that though the book seems aimed at convincing Protestants that they can love their Catholic siblings in Christ without converting them, it doesn't really deal with any of the theological objections Protestants have against Catholicism. A very conservative Protestant reader could put the book down, feeling that Angel has a made a good case for having fellowship with other Christians but that he has not proven that Catholicism is even a Christian denomination.This book may be of use to people who are not interested in more squabbling about doctrine, but who want affirmation that different Christian groups do have a basis of unity. It may also be of use to people who are not sure just how to treat their \\"separated brethern\\" - though again, more practical advice could have been nice.Do not purchase this book if you are looking for theological analysis: the book is actually rather anti-theological and (it seemed to me) anti-intellectual in general. The emphasis on subjective experience of God at the expense of theology did not sit right with me, though others might not have that reaction. In fact, Angel asks: \\"Does it really matter if we don't agree on all points of theology?\\" (p. 115) and \\"Does it really matter if some churches have a highly structured liturgy, while others conduct a very informal service?\\" His point is that we can fellowship with other Christians even if we don't worship the same way they do, and even if they don't agree with us completely, and he's certainly right. But that doesn't mean that those differences are completely unimportant: not all disagreements between denominations are matters of \\"indifferent things.\\" While it's true that we shouldn't use our differences as a reason to hate or oppress each other, it's also true that we need to continue to discuss the theological grounds for agreement. I had hoped that this book would play some role in that discussion, but it does not."},{"Title":"Yes We Can Love One Another!: Catholics and Protestants Can Share A Common Faith","review":"This is a great book; I bought it today, and I just finished reading it. The author (Warren Angel) uses historical and Biblical references, as well as personal stories, to show how Protestants and Catholics should be, can be, and are all Christians who's purpose it is to serve God. We spend so much time fighting between denominations (Protestant vs. Catholic and Protestant vs. Protestant) that we forget the message that is given to us in the New Testament. I would definitely recommend this book to any Christian, Catholic or Protestant, epecially those who believe that their theology is the only true theology or for those who believe that Protestants or Catholics are too different from them to be considered the same religion. When you do read this book, read it with an open mind. The book is fairly short and a quick read, but even at twelve dollars it is well worth it; I can't recommend it enough."},{"Title":"Yes We Can Love One Another!: Catholics and Protestants Can Share A Common Faith","review":"I loved this book. It helped to put things back into perspective for me. This is a book for all Christians, especially for Protestants who dislike Catholics, Protestants who dislike other Protestants, or Catholics who dislike Protestants. It's also a great book for those people who have been driven away from Christianity because of something a \\"Christian\\" has done. It's for those who have been turned off because of something evil a priest or a minister has done (whether it be molest children, preach hatred, have affairs, etc.). Chapter five adresses the issue of people who claim to be Christian, but who don't live it. It tells you not to let those people ruin Christianity for you. All Christians should read this book so that we don't let our petty differences destroy us. Thanks for the book, Mr. Angel."},{"Title":"Abayudaya: The Jews of Uganda","review":"I first heard about the Abayudaya in 1996, through the work of \\"Kulanu,\\" an organization working in support of isolated and marginalized Jewish community around the world. In September 2003, Rachel Namudosi Keki, a 21-year-old Abayudaya woman visited our community. It was a remarkable event.Rachel highly recommends this book (which includes many pictures of her father, J.J. Keki, and a few of Rachel as well, although she is not identified by name) as the best available resource for understanding the history, reality, and day-to-day life of the Abayudaya.The audio CD is a vital part of that understanding. (More Abayudaya music is available on the Kulanu-produced CD, \\"Shalom Everybody Everywhere;\\" Rachel is the soloist on these recordings, mostly recorded when she was around ten years old.)Among the many unexpected revelations in this visually stunning book is the fact that J.J. Keki was visiting America in the late summer of 2001, and witnessed the first plane striking the World Trade Centers on September 11th. If you review film footage from that day, you can catch a glimpse of a tall black man wearing a kippah among those running from the scene."},{"Title":"Abayudaya: The Jews of Uganda","review":"Richard Sobol has just come out with Abayudaya: The Jews of Uganda, an exquisite volume of photographs with text about this remarkable group, and a CD of Abayudaya music is included in a pocket attached to the back cover. The music was recorded and annotated by Rabbi Jeffrey Summit, an ethnomusicologist at Tufts University.Those of us who have lived and traveled in sub-Saharan Africa universally bemoan the fact that our pictures cannot capture the color and contrast, the rhythm, the unique beauty that is Africa. Richard Sobol, a seasoned pro, has captured the essence of these African scenes as few others can (Carol Beckwith comes to mind). Views of the Ugandan countryside and towns, of Abayudaya prayer and study and feasting, of women washing dishes and carrying water and preparing food, of elders in contemplation, of adults and children at play, of vendors of colorful housewares, of stunning posed portraits - it's all there, and each photo is a masterpiece.And Sobol's 18-page essay about Abayudaya history and life and Jewish practice is a fine summary for those who have not been introduced to this unique community before.Summit has written a five-page text to introduce the CD, which is entitled Abayudaya Music of Worship and Celebration. This essay is both informative and poignant. It reviews the various influences on Abayudaya music - Zulu music, church and Salvation Army music, Bantu folk music, Western visitors, and Nairobi (Kenya) synagogue melodies - often learned from recordings or the radio.Summit recorded this wonderful sampling of Abayudaya music in informal sessions in Uganda in 2000 and 2002. The first half of the CD includes unaccompanied traditional hymns and psalms, some dating back 20 or 30 years, one composed by the community's founder, Semei Kakungulu, in the 1920s. The annotations themselves make fascinating reading. One note explains that Psalm 136, heard on the recording as a responsive \\"reading\\" with soloist and chorus, reminds the community of the downfall of Idi Amin since it recounts God's deliverance with the splitting of the Red Sea. A particularly precious rendition is Rena bat Esther's solo in Psalm 121, used by the Abayudaya to provide strength and comfort when a person is ill. This is one of the few compositions on the CD by a female composer. Another woman's composition is the melody to Psalm 130, which is sung repeatedly during a burial while shoveling earth and filling up the grave. Women seem to specialize in consolation.Twagala Torah (\\"We Love the Torah\\") is a charming children's song composed by one of the youth leaders of the community, Moses Sebagabo. The text, in Luganda, English and Hebrew, is sung by Abayudaya children who attend public school.The more upbeat second half of the CD features guitar accompaniment by Gershom Sizomu and electric keyboard by John Mark Nkoola, musical director of the Abayudaya high school. In an interesting contrast, Summit placed the a capella rendition of Psalm 136 in the first half and the electric version of the same psalm in the latter half. J.J. Keki's song \\"Ali Omu Yekka\\" (\\"My Only One\\") sounds like a standard love song: \\"I have one chosen one. I only have one love. I'm warning those others, don't come near me, she's enough....\\" But Summit points out that the Torah is the object of the songwriter's love, and the song is a veiled warning to Christian and Muslim proselytes in Uganda!John Mark Nkoola wrote a modern song about the feeling he has when somebody has died. The words are particularly poignant in this place where deaths from AIDS and malaria are not uncommon: \\"The time has come. We must be going back where we have come from, to dust... When I think about death, I become afraid. I wish I had somebody to explain why this happens. Perhaps I may settle my mind. Let us enjoy life... Enjoy life in the right time, place and with the right people before you disappear like a shadow.\\"A few of the selections were heard on the community's first recording, \\"Shalom Everybody Everywhere!\\" produced by Kulanu with the Abayudaya in 1997. It is particularly satisfying to hear the beautiful, mature voice of Rachel Namudosi, in \\"Adonai Mukulu\\" (\\"God Is Great\\"). We heard her lovely child's voice on earlier recording. Happily, more recordings are in the works."},{"Title":"Abayudaya: The Jews of Uganda","review":"Richard Sobol takes you on a soulful journey to the Abayudaya Black Jewish Tribe in Uganda.

A group of seven women became the governing council. Twenty heifers were originally distributed and to date there have been 5 pass-ons. There are now 22 persons ready to receive Heifers.This group is one of the poorest groups that Heifer works with in Uganda. However, it should be noted that the assistance of the Abayudaya Women's Heifer Project extends to those who are Christian and Muslim as well as Jewish.We visited many of the farms and then visited the people gathered at the synagogue.

Differential equations and advanced math models are used to discuss the issues of diving decompression. The author presents an overview of the models used for decompression, then advocates changes in our model configuration. He convincingly argues for a change to what he calls a &quot;Thermodynamic&quot; model. (Seems a bit miss-named to me, it is really about phase changes and the energy of bubble formation- not thermodynamics). The text is long on discussion of the aspects of the Thermodynamic model, but fails in providing specifics . . . the author even acknowledges not rushing to print with a specific decompression schedule. There is enough information in the book for an advanced reader to derive the basis of a Thermodynamic model, but the author never puts it all together in a conclusion."},{"Title":"LINUX Web Server Toolkit","review":"If you have more than 10 minutes Net experience and say, ooh, 3 minutes of coding html you can skip the first 200 or so pages.

The kanji are easy to memorize, given explanations of what they are supposed to look like.

And the way it's written, you read it like you would fiction or easy non-ficiton and you pick up the Japanese characters without even realizing it!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"The formidable hieroglyphic writing system used by Japanese is perhaps the most intimidating challenge, among many, for native English speakers. Adopted from the ancient Chinese script in the 3rd century, the Japanese written word can seem indecipherable at first glance, like a modern Rosetta Stone. But Len Walsh actually makes sense of it in this splendid little book. He organizes each character group into categories like tools, animals, derivatives of the hand, money, and the like. He shows how the Chinese script began with approximations of basic, concrete objects in nature-- the hand, the sun, the mouth, the eye, the horse, the dog, and so on-- and then began to encompass abstract concepts via metaphors, stories, and incidents involving the concrete ones. You see how the basic characters, squared off and standardized to allow for easy writing, are incorporated as radicals into more complex ones, and how compounds are formed to represent basic concepts. And since you'll learn this history, you'll learn how to glean the meaning of a character based on its constituents. You learn, for example, how the character for &quot;mura&quot; (&quot;village&quot;) came about, uniting the radicals for &quot;tree&quot; and &quot;law&quot; (the latter itself a metaphorical extension of a character for &quot;measure&quot;), with the village symbolizing a social structure that brought law out of the tree-lined jungle. You'll learn how the character for &quot;name&quot; (Japanese &quot;na&quot; or &quot;mei&quot;) arose from a combination of &quot;evening&quot; and &quot;mouth&quot;-- stemming from an ancient Chinese practice of sentries demanding the names of passersby at night. Thus you not only learn the characters themselves, but gain an insight into ancient Chinese and Japanese culture.Each character is not only drawn out and linked to a word in English; its reading (pronunciation) in Japanese is given as well. Japanese characters generally have multiple readings, which vary depending on whether the character is used as a standalone word in a sentence, or one character in a compound that represents another word (e.g. a stone being &quot;ishi&quot; by itself and &quot;seki&quot;-- as in &quot;sekiyu,&quot; petroleum-- in compounds). The standalone reading is usually native Japanese, while the reading in compounds is quite frequently borrowed from the equivalent Chinese word-- although just as French-derived English words, derived usually from Old/Middle French, differ from modern French, the modern Chinese equivalent will often vary somewhat from the Japanese. Walsh illustrates the history of the characters based on the Shuo Wen Chie Tsu, the classic source from the 2nd Century A.D. explicating the origin of the Chinese characters. Walsh's own drawings are lucid and comprehensible, and the story of many characters' origins often quite humorous (still trying to figure out how &quot;mono,&quot; meaning &quot;thing,&quot; arose from the combination of a cow and an elephant). In any case, you should pick up this book even if you intend only to learn spoken Japanese. You'll acquire a feel for how the vast majority of Japanese words were assembled from simpler compounds, and you'll sense the logic of the design. A very highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"I've read and reread this work since buying it many years ago. It came in handy when we traveled to Japan: I actually understood much of what I was looking at--at least on signage--while the overwhelming majority of tourists stared dumfounded. A word of advice: I would look into Chinese first--please check out Diane Wolff's marvelous &quot;Chinese for Beginners&quot;--inasmuch as Japanese writing was built on top of Chinese. You'll get much more out of Walsh if you read Wolff first. Also, don't think for a moment that, just because you recognize a kanji, you know the meaning of the phrase in which it appears. We learned the hard way that the Japanese mind combines characters and components of characters in _very_ peculiar ways--it was often quite a surprise when a native told us what that sign over there actually meant after we told him what we ambitious gaijin thought it meant! Walsh's book cannot possibly equip you in only a couple of hundred pages to understand why &quot;lawful-language&quot; means &quot;French,&quot; or why &quot;self-move-concentrate-mind&quot; means &quot;Caution: automatic door&quot;--or why &quot;water&quot; means &quot;Wednesday&quot; on that poster! Also, bear in mind that some of Walsh's explanations for the derivation of various kanji are suspect. That doesn't really matter, of course, if his mnemonic helps you remember it--as long as you're not a philologist. Take it for what it's worth, and enjoy your heart out!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"I enjoyed this book very much and it was very easy to read. But it didn't really teach me much. The \\"vocabulary\\" is very limited and information on how to actually read Japanese is pretty much non-existant - it's more a guide on how to recognize occasional characters. If you are curious about the writing system or are travelling to Japan and just want the thrill of recognizing a few characters, this book will be good for you. If you are a serious student beginning a life-long journey of learning to read and write Japanese, I would recommend A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters by Kenneth G. Henshall."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"As a first kanji book, this is excellent; it got me hooked on learning kanji. It's short but straight to the point, and very easy to read. It starts off describing how the simpler characters came to be, and builds on these as it shows how they are combined to form the more complex characters.In total, about 250 characters are explained. The book gives some readings (in romaji) for each character, and example compounds in some cases too. There are no mnemonics for learning the readings, however, and the book does not describe how to write the characters.Some of the etymologies differ from more accepted versions. For example, \\"iro\\" (colour) is described as a person leaning over a window rather than over another person. However, the author's interpretations do have great mnemonic value. Generally, he is very good at tying the original meaning of a character to its modern meaning; sometimes they may appear to be unrelated, but he is able to make them seem logically connected, which is what makes them memorable.I recommend this as your first kanji book. It requires only a very small investment in money and time, and is fun to read. And it will give you a good grounding in kanji recognition for when you move on to a more thorough book."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"I just bought this book two days ago and cannot put it down. Mr Walsh gives a good account of how the Chinese first devised their pictographic writing system, and how it was later borrowed by the Japanese. He supplies each kanji with a mnemonic device that makes it easy to remember. The book is written such that it is very accessible to the complete beginner. I agree with the reviewer who recommended getting this book as a first introduction to learning the kanji. To learn the kana, I would recommend Heisig's &quot;Remembering the Hiragana&quot; and Morsbach and Heisig's &quot;Remembering the Katakana&quot;."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"...this is the book you'll want to get first. Many people studying the Japanese language, even those who have successfully learned the hiragana and katakana, become filled with anxiety at the prospect of kanji. If you really want to understand how Japanese words are constructed and by able to read and write proficiently, you'll need to at least become familiar with the kanji. Becoming familiar with the kanji is the step you must take BEFORE trying to diligently memorize all of them. You will probably get bored and disinterested if you try to start from the beginning and rigorously attempt to learn and master the stroke order, pronunciation, English meaning, and how to use them in words and sentences! Before you even come close to doing that, it is important to grasp what kanji are first.This book is arranged in a \\"building block\\" style; the book continually builds on what it has just taught you. The origins of Japanese writing, how the characters were constructed, how they came from China, and so on. This book does not have the style of a textbook at all; it is a very informative overview of the meanings of around 300 common Japanese kanji and how they have changed from their ancient pictograph forms. For example, Section Two begins with showing how the character for sun (which originally looked very much like a sun) developed into the more square form that it is today. Thematically-related characters are discussed next to one another; the next character, \\"tree\\" precedes \\"root/origin\\". Then the word \\"nihon\\" (literally \\"sun-origin\\"), which means Japan, is introduced. As you can see, kanji are introduced slowly and in a matter-of-fact way that won't result in any confusion as to their meaning. The book is short enough to be able to read in one or two sittings and afterwards I guarantee that you'll find that you are able to recognize most (if not all!) of the characters introduced in this book. You'll have a clear understanding of their pictograph origins in China and you'll understand that they are symbols for concepts and are used in words."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"This is a really fun and engaging book because it reads almost like story. I read it while I was in Japan (having no previous background in the language, and having never been there) and found the book extremely helpful getting around! After reading the book I was able to understand quite a bit of written Japanese, particularly signs and other travel related messages. My traveling buddies were completely astounded as I squinted at these Japanese signs and other scrolling information, thought about it for a few moments, and then confidently pointed, &quot;It's THAT WAY!&quot; They couldn't believe it! Even _I_ was impressed! This book is amazing!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"I absolutely love this book. I bought my copy at the Kinokuniya bookstore at Umeda station in Osaka. Before I read it, I thought there was no way my mind would ever be able to read Japanese, but author Len Walsh opened my eyes, my mind, and my heart. This book was the gateway for me to fall head over heels in love with everything Japan-related -- and I ended up finishing a BA in Japanese language and lit upon my return to the U.S.Walsh takes the basic 300 characters and breaks them down by picture, explaining everything in the most simple manner. Once you grasp the foundations of kanji by \\"seeing\\" the characters as pictures, it will all begin to make sense.I'm so thrilled it's still in print, though it was originally published in 1969. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"my father bought this book for me as a gift a while ago..so far its the best book ive come across for learning the pronunciations of the kanji.. sure ive got a ton of work books but rote memorization of charts doesnt work for me.. this book takes kanji and shows you examples from things you are familiar with.. like the honda corperation.. it also shows some of the history of the character which further helps with cementing the character into your brain.. it tells you in plain english when one pronunciation is used and when the other is used, none of this onyomi kunyomi stuff.. it tells you when there are exceptions..this book is everything ive come to expect from tuttle publishing.. tuttle publishing always seems to do a first rate job.. plus they have several books about each topic.. each one written for a different learning style so no matter how you learn tuttle always has a perfect book for you.. for example for kanji they have books with loads of charts for people who learn best when their info is all displayed and organized for them and they have books for kanji with loads of mnemonics. and they have this book for people who learn best through known examples and simple english explanations. plus they have workbooks and flashcards for rote memorizationoh right.. this book does NOT teach you to write the kanji.. tuttle has seperate workbooks for that.. great workbooks i might add..this book presents the kanji in an order that makes better sense to the western mind and really flows from one kanji to another.. each bit of info building on what you have already learned"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"\`Read Japanese Today' is a short, but brilliant, start to learning how to read Japanese.

There are better books for those seeking serious kanji study."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"When I moved to Japan last year, I was confused and I found it very difficult getting around. I tried taking classes, but they didn't help me in the Kanji department. Then I found this book, and ever since, I have become fascinated with studying the Japanese written form. It found that it explained each kanji's etymological source in language that the average person could understand. It is comparable to &quot;An Idiots Guide to Japanese&quot;. It does not teach you to write japanese, but even so, I thouroughly reccommend this book."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"As advertised, this book is a solid introduction to about 300 common kanji. Walsh wrote the book with a flow that allows you to read it like a story. The characters are explained in terms of the evolution from ancient Chinese drawings to modern kanji. Walsh also gives the various pronunciations of each, as well as examples of how you will see them in context.My primary criticism is the lack of an index or headings. Walsh will say, \\"the following are based on animals,\\" where a heading would be more functional. Along with the lack of an index, the book cannot easily be used as a quick reference.However, I highly recommend this for anyone interested in the basics of kanji. It is an excellent first step before moving on to more advanced study."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"This is a great little book.Len Walsh really plants the love of KAnji learning.It doesn't pretend to teach you every Kanji, or thousands of compounds.

Full of useful mnemonics and all Joyo Kanji.Both are great - enjoy!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"Len Walsh takes on the formidable task of explaining the Japanese kanji to the absolute beginner. And having read the first 3 pages, I became utterly convinced that his approach was astoundingly effective - more so for being clear and straightforward.The author begins by showing how a few basic kanji - the symbols for sun, tree, person, mouth, and so on - developed from earlier pictures that any child could recognize instantly. He then shows how these kanji are altered and combined to create more than 20 Japanese words.He makes things so simple that just reading the book is enough to remember pretty much every Japanese word he introduces - without memorization. I picked up the book 36 hours ago, read the introduction plus 2 chapters, and feel confident that I could identify the meaning of 60 or 70 Japanese words without further study.Mr. Walsh, I hope you're out there working on a follow-up covering the *next* 400 Japanese words. And if your next trip to Japan takes you through the Bay Area, look me up - the first round of sake, sir, is on me!"},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"You know how karate starts with learning the body positions and basic moves before you ever step into a ring? The idea is to get you moving in the proper ways first. What this book does is introduce you to the idea of word-symbols being made up of radicals for &quot;water&quot;, &quot;clean&quot;, etc. and the mental pathway by which they are combined with others to get &quot;desalination plant&quot;. Mr. Walsh does a great job of covering the fuzzy logic that lets one symbol mean 2 or 3 things with similar interpretations, which is something you just have to resign yourself to in Japanese language and culture. Start with this book, THEN move on to one that covers the kanji in a more everyday-life book."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"A big pro of this book is that it continuesly compares kanji characters with little drawings where it probably has been derived from. This makes kanji more easy to remember for i.e. Dutch people (like me). Unfortunatly this book lacks an index if you want to look up a character."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"I am a US Navy Sailor stationed in Japan and this one was really cool. I liked it because when he gives you the kanji he also gives you the reason why the ancient Chinese drew it that way and a couple different ways to pronunciate.

It's a no-brainer. This is the easy and natural way to learn kanji.I'm essentially a lazy person, so the traditional brute-force memorization of kanji has little appeal for me.This book takes a logical and natural approach - learn the origins of the symbols. It's so easy to remember the meanings this way.So far I have read 50 pages in this book. It's getting a little more like work and less like fun. There is a lot to absorb. So this will be a book I read slowly and will then re-read in the future.Of course you will still need to learn stroke order and remember the sounds. And learn the other 2000 or so kanji that a literate Japanese knows. But this book is definitely the way to start."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"This book is awesome!

A truly excellent little book that makes learning kanji considerably more engaging than most textbooks you'll find on the market.No prior knowledge of Japanese is required. But even as a fluent speaker already, I found a number of \\"aha!\\" moments reading it.For the serious student, though, Kenneth Henshall'sA Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters (Tuttle language library)would be more interesting and useful material. Rigorously researched, it covers the origins of all the 1945 common use characters, graded into accessible lessons and useful as a reference book in its own right.But for a fun starter, either to a culturally aware visitor to Tokyo or to a student struggling to remember the basic kanji, you can't go past this book here."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"This book doesn't just show you a symbol (kanji) and tell you what it means. it breaks down the symbols to explain everything.

Initially, I really did not think I was absorbing any of it but then ... while at work one day and having nothing better to do (O.K., I'm the director so I can do anything I want), I happened on a fantabulous website: [...]where I took a flash card-type test. Yes, indeed! I aced the equivialent of the Japanese 6th form! How could I possibly have recalled all those ideograms? And I was less than half way through the book! One can quite easily run through this book in under a month, however, being the busy sort, I was only able run through the tutorials at bedtime ... a few pages at a time before nodding off ... paying little attention at first to the On and Kuhn pronunciations. You should save that extra effort for another time. First prepare to recognize the pictographs. That takes most of the memorization effort out of the 'picture,' so to speak. Then, all you'll have left are the sounds (and you almost don't really require these as they are not always used in spoken vocabulary but mostly in the written form (and often, these are accompanied by Furikana, completely eliminating the need). Although there are few more than 400 Kanji in this text, these are among the most practical Kanji to know and I see them everywhere I look. The final 14 pages of 'Today' is, alone, worth the price of the book. The next book to use is \\"Essential Kanji\\" (P.G. O'Neill). This may be used simultaneously with 'Jap. Today' and covers more territory but is organized in a more detailed, summary-type format and may be carried around for practical review. It covers 2,000 characters , is remarkably easy to use and serves as your constant guide until you feel you have mastered the idiom. When you no longer have use for \\"Essential...,\\" you also will have little use for a Kanji dictionary. The third and last book to have around is \\"Kanji ABC\\" (Foerster & Tamura). This is a really terrific text based on the 'radical/grapheme' concept and lends a new visual dimension to the task of memorization that allows one not only to read Kanji effortlessly but to derive a meaning from a character or compound that one has not previously encountered. This book is also a must! In my experience, these are the only three books you will need to master this intensely difficult area of the language. I do have the Kanji Flashcards but have always found them rather cumbersome. Don't forget to tune into the above mentioned website. You won't be sorry. It's the best of the Kanji/Kana practice sites I have ever encountered on the Internet."},{"Title":"Read Japanese Today","review":"This book has been in print for over 40 years and yet has not dated one iota.

Also, particularly in the early chapters, every paragraph (sometimes it seems every sentence) has a snide and gratuitous shot at Win98 and at Microsoft in general. If you hate Microsoft, you'll be saying &quot;amen&quot; after each and every one. If you don't, it just wears really thin, really fast. (My advice is, if you hate Microsoft that badly anyway, go get Linux or Free BSD, and don't waste money on this or any other Win98 books.) Mostly it just seemed sophomoric. The book is not totally worthless. While the tips and tricks it contains have all been covered elsewhere (PC Magazine, for one), it can be handy to have them collected in one lump. Many of the tips, though, are very disappointing. Don't like the number of warning boxes you have to dismiss when deleting a directory full of files?

Take it line by line (few examples have more than 5-6 simple steps), and you'll have no trouble at all.O'Reilly is truly an amazing book publisher. It's very uncommon to pick up one of their books and find even one error or lack of coverage. This book is NO EXCEPTION. O'Reilly makes a durable book with a clever binding called a RepKover. That's very important, something you'll discover after referring to O'Reilly books over &amp; over &amp; over again. These books are kept on the desktop or very nearby and used continuously."},{"Title":"Windows 98 Annoyances","review":"This book really gets down to the essence of Windows 98. I wasn't expecting a regurgitated manual. I wanted a reference that provided information I couldn't get from the 1000+ page &quot;bible&quot; books, and without having to dig through hundreds of magazines and user-groups... and that's what I got.The tone of this book is honest, but positive. The author acknowledges the problems with the software, which is refreshing, but it's not a dig at Microsoft! It focused on fixing the problems, and not just complaining or glossing over them. It's more than just problems, too... there substantial networking information and tips for improving performance, and (finally) documentation on the windows scripting host.It's one of the most useful computer books I've ever bought."},{"Title":"Windows 98 Annoyances","review":"In the several years since I switched from Mac OS to Windows 98 I've spent quite a lot of time on the phone with Dell tech support. Sometimes it's the hardware, occasionally it's the software, but often it's the operating system, Windows 98, that is giving me a problem. The Dell employee recommended this book to me, asserting that in his view and the view of his cohorts &quot;Windows 98 Annoyances&quot; is the best reference available for the wide variety of little problems, bigger puzzles, and flat-out mysteries that Windows 98 is so devilishly capable of posing to its zillions of users.I like to read a book from start to finish, which you obviously do not need to do with this one. On the other hand Karp has explained and provided straightforward solutions to at least twenty obstacles, glitches, or difficulties I've encountered with Windows 98. There is a wealth of conceptual information here, too. In addition to responding awfully well to niggling problems, Karp also supplies the demystifying know-how that enables you to modify aspects of your set-up. It's terrific, there's a CD ROM with it, the index is a real index that is a tool and not a token - and I wish that I could personally thank that Dell tech support guy for giving me such great advice by recommending that I buy this book."},{"Title":"Windows 98 Annoyances","review":"This book contains a lot of useful information arranged in a practical fashion, so that you can look up whatever problem you are having and find out how to fix it.

This is one of three books that I keep handy for solving Windows problems. The O'Reilly web site has samples (and corrections!) for this book, so check it out if you are interested. I am very glad that I bought this book!"},{"Title":"Windows 98 Annoyances","review":"This book, a newer edition of the previous _Windows 95 Annoyances_, is an essential tool for anybody supporting W 95/98 operating systems and applications and it continues the publisher's category of Microsoft software annoyances.It is a close up view of just what the Man Behind the Curtain does to keep the Emerald City (Windows 95/98) running. For example, it explains many of those cryptic messages that we see on the screen when the system has tanked. Since the book does not come out of the maw of the Microsoft publishing and adoration machine, the view is realistic, tilted slighty towards the jaundiced. It is oriented towards practical explanations and solutions. In fact, the author often offers more than one solution and explains the consequences of each one. The book is well organized and has an adequate index.While _Windows 98 Annoyances_ is, for the most part, applicable to both Windows 95 and 98, the accompanying CD will only install in W98 systems. If you are thinking of upgrading to W98 be sure to throughly read Chapter 8, Taking Control of Web Integration.In general, the book assumes a better than average knowledge of computing hardware and software.

Some of these limitations are just plain bad design, while others are attempts to hide &quot;confusing&quot; concepts from the precious, fragile user. Also, like most O'Reilly books it is very entertaining and easy to read. It's not dry or overly technical, despite being very detailed and advanced.In response to &quot;A reader&quot; from Ann Arbor, Michigan: I definitely agree that the anti-microsoft potshots wore very thin after a few pages, but I *definitely* don't think that makes it deserve a piddly two-stars.As far as your other complaints, first of all, Windows is a very popular operating system, so you'd have to expect that some of his solutions might have been mentioned elsewhere, and they were probably discovered independently. Second of all, if you actually read anything other than the table of contents, you might have noticed that his suggestion to use DOS was only an alternative. He said that if you want to avoid the delete confirmation box, you can by right clicking Recycle Bin, properties, then unchecking the option for the confirmation box. But, he also said, that if you like the confirmation dialog, but don't want to go through 700 of them when deleting a directory, you can use the deltree command.Besides, why do you look at DOS as separate from windows? DOS is just the windows command line, and that's what Karp was trying to say. Sometimes it's more appropriate to use the command line."},{"Title":"Windows 98 Annoyances","review":"Well this book is the best reference I've ever read on Windows, and I've read almost all of them. :) One of the absolute best tips was that you can download the free X-Setup from Xteq Systems.

For a small community Athens was filled with several generations of over-achievers. Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Socrates, Pheidias, Themistocles, Aristophanes, Xenophon, Plato, Herodotus, Thucydides and Pericles himself all moved through this city in Attica and in some cases influenced each other.Athens at the beginning of its greatness was the creation of Cleisthenes who established it as a democracy following a period of particularly bizarre family politics that would be surprising even today. This ironically was the source of not only its greatness, but its destruction.The second factor that was responsible for Athens to achieve greatness was its role in defeating the Persians. The Persians retreated from the Aegean and the Athenians formed the Delian League which city states contributed either ships or money for the common defense. Since the Persians had better things to do than to invade pockets of Greek city states, Athens had money for a cultural explosion that formed the basis of western civilization.Architecture, drama, comedy, philosophy, and politics all came out of this development. Athens was not only the cultural center of the western world, it was the western world. What is sad is just how little survived from this period.The source of the greatness of Athens was also its downfall. Maintaining the Delian League, turned Athens into an imperial power, whose citizens became victims of a series of incompetent and unscrupulous leaders who proposed policies that lead to its diplomatic isolation. The greatest disaster was the campaign against Syracuse, which was not only incompetently waged, but lead to Alcibiades, the lead general of his day (and lacking in scruple) to defect to Sparta and propose a policy that would lead to the end of the long walls that had ensured access to the sea and trade.This book, the first in the Centers of Civilization Series is an excellent summing up the contributions of classical Athens and features extracts from Thucydides, some of the plays, and Plato. Few works can summarize the contribution of this golden age in a more concise manner"},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2003 (Bbest American Travel Writing)","review":"I get the &quot;Best American&quot; series to stay current with what some of our best writers are saying, but this year's editor has led me down the garden path.At least 50% of the articles dwell on environmental or social causes. Yes, I suppose the writers had to travel somewhere to get their data, but their essays are not about travel; rather, they are about causes.I will hope that, for 2004, the series publishers get a handle on things and place social essays in the &quot;Best American Essays...&quot; collection and reserve the Travel volume for just that."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2003 (Bbest American Travel Writing)","review":"Though there are a few funny pieces in this year's travel anthology, Frazier's (\\"On the Rez\\") bent is for serious things happening in unhappy and often unlovely places. Tom Bissell's \\"Eternal Winter\\" explores the death of the Aral Sea, a hopeless Soviet-made ecological disaster with endless ghastly repercussions in a surreal landscape. Peter Chilson writes about the Tuareg rebellion at the edge of the Sahara, in Niger, which perpetually resumes with the harmattan, the dust and sand storms that cripple visibility, allowing swooping raids on merchant caravans through the desert.Scott Carrier witnesses the Afghan view of war and life in Mazar-e-Sharif and makes a harrowing road trip to bombed-out Kabul, while Andrew Solomon, there for much the same purpose, discovers the wonders of Afghan food and hospitality.Ecological warriors are the focus of Patrick Symmes' \\"Blood Wood,\\" and Tom Clynes' \\"They Shoot Poachers, Don't They?\\" Symmes journeys along the Brazilian Amazon meeting fierce and endangered activists striving to stem the lucrative, illegal, and often deadly mahogany trade. Clynes reports on American conservationists in the Central African Republic. \\"Their mission was to drive out the marauding gangs of Sudanese poachers who were rapidly wiping out the region's elephants and other animals. Their authority: shoot on sight.\\"There are pieces on journeys made for their own sake, but these are no vacations. Lawrence Millman has a funny, scary piece on being stranded on an uncharted, uninhabited desert island - in the arctic. And Kira Salak follows the trail of doomed early-19th century explorer Mungo Park, paddling 600 miles down the sometimes very hostile Niger River in an inflatable kayak.For lighthearted contrast there's Michael Specter's profile of rapper Puff Daddy, now a fashion designer, in Paris for Fashion Week, and Lisa Anne Auerback's \\"Pope on a Tow Rope,\\" exploring Pope John Paul II's Polish skiing days.Off the beaten track and often intense, from Wilmington, Delaware to Timbuktu, this all-around fine compilation has all-around appeal."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2003 (Bbest American Travel Writing)","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in years. Every night I would randomly open to a different story and be transported.I think the title is a bit misleading, though. This is not full of tourist stories. They are just very well-written articles that happen to take place in a land foreign to the author. For instance, a Jewish woman's journey to the Ukraine to uncover the story of relatives that were killed by the Nazi's. Not all the stories are quite so serious, in fact there is one by Jack Handey (Saturday Night Live writer) about a men's camping trip that was absolutely hysterical.For anyone who values great writing and well-told story, you will definitely appreciate this book and the others in the series."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2003 (Bbest American Travel Writing)","review":"This book contains several interesting pieces on travel as well as articles about activities related to specific geographical places. I am a fan of Ian Frazier's, especially his bookOn the Rez, and was glad to see that he was editing this collection.There are three pieces that stand out for me. The first one is called 'Getting Jiggy' and it is about folks who get together on the Seattle area piers and jig for squid. The piece reads like a funny ethnography.The second piece is called 'The Forest Primeval' and is a reprint from the original in Harpers Magazine. It is about the Congo - - its people, politics, animals, and current issues. The article describes the horrific problems with forest elephant poaching. To date, 700,000 elephants have been poached from this area., Because elephants are the kingpin of forest life, the entire ecological system is off-balance. There is also a lot of violence in the Congo. \\"Every Tom, Dick and Harry has an AK 47\\". This is one of the reasons that forest elephants are being killed at such a high rate. I learned that elephants are able to communicate by infrasound below the range of human hearing. This way they are able to avoid human contact. Forest elephants look different from Savannah elephants as they have chocolate brown skin. They also have a different diet. I learned that chimps can mimic antelope calls in order to trap and kill them - - not so different from human beings. Between the logging, civil wars and poaching, much of the forest is gone except for designated wildlife areas. I found this the most interesting article in the book, by far.Another essay I enjoyed is called 'Power Trip'. It is about a woman who enjoys going to freakish places. She once went on a free trip to a mayonnaise factory. She is now planning to go on a free trip to a nuclear power plant. I don't think that a nuclear power plant is particularly freaky but it is a pretty freaky way to spend one's vacation.I think Ian Frazier did a good job of picking out diverse and interesting articles for this collection."},{"Title":"The Best American Travel Writing 2003 (Bbest American Travel Writing)","review":"This book is filled largely with the type of article you'd read part of while waiting in the doctor's office, and never lament not being able to finish it (or even recall you had started it).

Contrary to the Synopsis by amazon.com, Taylor was NOT a survivor of the Custer Fight, and can adds nothing to what happened to Custer's immediate command. Taylor was assigned to Reno's battalion, and thus participated in the Valley fight and on Renor Hill.

(which you realize after completing the book.....)Anyways, I would rate it as a must-buy, if you are an desi immigrant to North America....check it out.... and you realize that an author like Anita can package all your desh experiences in one nice book.

It was that good. What struck me the most about this book is how alike we all are, even if we're from different parts of the world.The author skillfully weaves the present and different versions of the past together. Aunty Vijaya from the book remarks that memories are never the same between two people--\\"They are pictures we create in our hearts you see...and each of us uses different sticks of chalk to colour them.\\" The dialogue is excellent.

There are chords struck that resonate in my family recollections with a clarity and truth that strikes me dumb, were it not for the envigorating sense of recognition that she has felt the same forces as I, and articulated them wonderfully. There is a poignance that exceeds mere reminiscence, that's what happens when one recognises a similar feeling occurring in another person. Thanks to Anita Rau Badami for putting it all down in words so beautifully!"},{"Title":"Tamarind Woman","review":"Badami creates mood and vision with musical, poetic prose and is able to draw the reader into her world of early 20th century India. I heartily recommend this book to anyone who desires to explore cultures and language, and is willing to struggle a bit with some foreign words and phrases (usually but not always explained), and changing voice (she jumps from person to person and generation so that it's not always clear immediately who is speaking). The author exposes the subtle ways that culture and family relationship are transferred from generation to generation in a refreshing and unique way, always in tune to the physical surroundings in which this transfer occurs. There is also a sense of mystery which unfolds gradually and a satisfying feeling at the end of the novel because the author accomplished her task: to educate and entertain at the same time."},{"Title":"Tamarind Woman","review":"This story starts out by the daughter telling the story of her life with her family and her time in India.

There's no plot, so the story consists almost entirely of flashbacks of the childhood through adulthood experiences of the two narrators (Saroja and Kamini, who are mother and daughter.)TAMARIND WOMAN is not meant, however, to be a thrilling tale, but rather an in-depth look at the tangled relationships of family life -- especially the inextricable bond between mother and daughter -- and in this it does succeed. It is not deeply psychological or intellectual (perhaps thankfully), but it is warm and well written, and ultimately very worth reading, especially for Baudami's loving and skillful portrait of her Indian culture."},{"Title":"Tamarind Woman","review":"Tamarind Woman is a beautiful story although the main plot has been done over and over in the past few years by a number of authors: relationship problems between mother and daughter. I think the author has overdone the use of foreign words (Indian words) and can easily push away certain readers. In one page alone, I counted six Indian words with no reference whatsoever to their meaning or origin. I love reading novels that take place in another country or are written by foreign authors being a foreigner myself but the use of words in Tamarind Woman was a little too much and can make the reader feel a bit lost in the journey."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"It was over priced and poorly written.The plot was underdeveloped and the characters were predictable.The historical language was forced and awkward.The dialog and characters thoughts were constantly repeated."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"Although Marcus, the Earl of Rutherford, is a confirmed bachelor and a most notorious rake, he knows that he must resign himself to marriage in order to produce an heir. His current air, his cousin, has no desire to become a duke, and would rather spend his time in scholarly pursuits than the duties of a duke. So Marcus, intent on marrying someone just as cynical and hardened as himself, decides to propose a marriage of convenience to a widow with a dubious reputation, his mistress. But before he can do so, he is called out of town to settle his dead great-uncle's estates - and returns to London with a wife!Miss Marguerite Fellowes had spent her life suffering from the scandal of her parents' deaths, always the unwanted relation. When Marcus comes, she is near death from influenza, and because Marcus nurses her back to health, her reputation is in shambles and no one will want to employ her again. So when Marcus proposes a marriage of convenience to her, she accepts, but soon discovers there is a vast difference between Marcus, the private person, and the Earl of Rutherford, his public personality.I read this book directly after reading \\"The Unexpected Bride\\" by the same author, and quickly realized that the plot was virtually the same, with a few minor alterations here and there. That was a bit disappointing, since the plot of the former book was still fresh in my mind. Still, I did enjoy this book, but not as much as I probably would have had I waited to read it.As mentioned by another reviewer, all of the disagreements between the hero and heroine could have probably been solved by a long talk, but after learning more about Meg and Marcus's childhoods and personalities, the occurrence of such a talk looked pretty remote unless extenuating circumstances forced them to come clean to one another. I didn't understand Sir Winterborne's fascination with desiring to harm Meg, nor did I understand why Winterborne was so hateful towards Marcus. An explanation was eventually given, but it wasn't a credible one in my view. Also, Marcus' tendency to distance himself from his emotions was never adequately explained for my liking. Oh well, this book was still pretty good, and I'd probably read it again."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"His sister and his aunt rage at Marcus Langley insisting that the thirty-five year old rake marry and have a son so that the line can continue. The angry Duke knows he needs a spouse, but detests the pushy interference of his relatives. He scares them by showing interest in a loose widow.Marcus travels to his newest estate that he inherited from a penny-pinching great uncle. He is shocked to see the horrendous condition of Fenby and even worse how ill resident Marguerite Fellowes is. He brings in the doctor and nurses the sick woman back to health. He also spends money to help the impoverished tenants. Marcus knows that he has compromised Marguerite, but concludes that he had no choice. When she recovers, they argue about her future. Ultimately, he offers her a marriage of convenience in which after the heir is born they go their own separate ways. However, they fall in love and Marcus wants to renegotiate the deal, but has to convince his spouse even while his enemy sniffs after his beloved wife like a prize.Although at first brush, THE DUTIFUL RAKE seems typical of the Regency sub-genre with an innocent woman and a rake falling in love. However, the superb historical romance insures that the initial look at the lead couple is peeled away so that the true inner essence of kindhearted caring souls emerge with the twist that Marguerite has the scandalous background. The story line focuses on the lead duo with the support cast (friends, family, and foes) enhancing what the reader knows about this delightful pair. Readers will demand to know the tale of Marcus' pal Jack.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"REGENCY - remember REGENCY!Having said that - What is not to understand about our characters attitude and especially Winterbourns petty acts of revenge.

I was waiting for Marc to become suspecious of his friend, Jack Hamilton but he exhibited more brains and trust than I thought he would.Lack of communication between the sexes was very definite in the Regency period and hasn't changed an awful lot in this day and age.Marc showed human decency in offering marriage to Meg and eventually reaped the benefits of love.Great cast of characters - a most enjoyable story - worthy of being a keeperPlease, Please, Please, E.R. write Jack's story - he is a wonderful character and we would like to meet the Earl and Meg again.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED -- Great story - definitely a keeper for my shelf."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"As stated by a previous reviewer, this novel started off good but slowly got wallowed down by miscommunication. I felt that there was enough outside conflict to take away the problems with the main characters' inability to talk about their feelings. After awhile, it became so emotionally draining to read about how miserable they were when all they would have to do is talk to each other! I have read other authors who have also used this ploy but it was drawn out for so long that it got tiresome. I have found this theme to be repeated in her novel His Lady Mistress as well."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"I've read two Elizabeth Rolls books (A Compromised Lady and His Lady's Mistress) both of which I found extremely boring and pretty much hated. I was unsure on this book but I'm glad I took the plunge because THIS book is good.Marcus, Earl of Rutherford is a confirmed bachelor and rake. At 35, he's under pressure from family to settle down, marry and produce an heir because he's current heir is too studious and doesn't want the title. Marcus loathes being told what to do and contemplates a marriage to his current mistress, the widow Lady Hartleigh just to spite his family since he knows they hate her.Upon learning that a distant cousin has died, Marcus goes to settle the estate and finds it in shambles due to his cousin's thrifty ways and a very sick housekeeper. Under the impression that Miss Meg is an elderly lady, Marcus feeling guilty over his cousin's treatment of the staff stays to nurse Miss Meg to health. But Miss Meg is no elderly woman. Marguerite \\"Meg\\" Fellowes has been living with her cousin Samuel since her parents' death and has been treated as little more than a slave. When she gets violently ill, Cousin Samuel refuses to send for the doctor because he's too cheap to pay the bill. Marcus, nurses her back to health then realizes that by staying in the house with her, due to his reputation as a rake he has unintentionally ruined her reputation. Marcus proposes a marriage of convenience when he learns that Meg has no where to go.Now this formula seems typical and predictable but I was pleasantly surprised to find out it's wasn't at all.Marcus' sister takes Meg under her wing and with her guidance Meg becomes the darling of the \\"ton\\" of society. All the while she and Marcus dance around their feelings and struggle with their stubbornness.There is a drag here though. Meg is constantly disturbed by an attempted rape and suffers recurring nightmares and when she's introduced to her attempted rapist in society and he discovers the cracks in her relationship with Marcus he does all he can to taunt her. Meg's problems could have been easily solved by a simple talk with Marcus but Ms. Rolls dragged this like an anchor throughout the story until the very end.Marcus's best friend does his best to serve as an excellent big brother/protector for Meg but he's not substitute for the much needed Marcus.Overall: I'd recommend this book and for an Elizabeth Rolls book (as I said above) this is a BIG feat for me. I'm not a fan of Ms. Rolls but I really enjoyed this book overall."},{"Title":"Dutiful Rake, the (Historical Romance)","review":"I am struggling to think what to say about this book because it really was clich&eacute;d in terms of regency plotting. However, despite this (or maybe even because of this) I loved it.Rake accidentally drops innocent young girl in the soup and marries her to give her the protection of his name. They are too surprised or, in her case, frightened of their sexual attraction to work through the learning curve of life together. The rake reacts in a predictable way and they quarrel, commence separate lives within marriage, both regretting it but uncertain how to make things better. Eventually they do and she is already pregnant with the much longed for heir. As always, the reformed rake (with a heart of gold) makes the best husband.Sounds familiar? Sounds clich&eacute;d? Yes. But it works and it works extremely well in this novel by Elizabeth Rolls. She is new to me - I had only previously read a novella by her in an anthology but this won't be my last time with her. The author writes well and with great skill. I thought her characters were attractive, well-rounded and very appealing and the passion arising between the H/H was well portrayed and highly believable. Despite the predictable plot, the author rises above it and uses the well-worn path to great advantage.

I will say this novel had such a nice beginning. A spirited and independent heroine, and a masculine but not overly domineering hero who was attracted to the heroine without really wanting to be. Well, all that burnt out real quick, and the heroine somehow became timid, and easily led into stupid situations, while the hero became thick-headed and unreasonable.I don't like novels where it's obvious that just a simple conversation between the two main characters will clear the air and resolve their differences -- and they never have that conversation until the last five pages of the book.

I have been long interested in how \\"the .NET people\\" do things even though my personal experience with .NET technologies has been limited to doing a day of training every now and then. From this perspective, I have to say I find a lot of good stuff in this book but it's still missing that something. The author, Marc Holmes, clearly states in the introduction that the book's goal is not to be a comprehensive guide for the tools being used. Instead, his focus has been to show the reader a practical approach to tackling problems involved in \\"delivering software.\\" I had some difficulty seeing that focus while reading.The first chapter titled \\"A Context for Delivery\\" is actually an excellent albeit short overview of the variety of aspects involved when discussing how to manage software configuration, the build process, and the deployment process. The next couple of chaptersintroduce the NAnt build tool and its essential built-in tasks. As a tutorial to NAnt, these chapters felt a bit too lightweight. Chapter 2 is an excellent tutorial for getting started with NAnt and chapter 3 briefly enumerates the most important built-in tasks available. These first three chapters were definitely the ones I liked the most.Chapter 4 presents a simple case study, getting a GUI application for performing XSLT transformations to build with a NAnt script. The author follows through creating the script from scratch, all the way from the classic \\"clean\\" target to checking out the project from Visual SourceSafe, incrementing a version counter on assemblies, running automated tests, static analysis, and packaging the build output into a .zip file for deployment. There's some discussion of NAnt features that weren't illustrated in the previous chapters but not much more than that.Chapter 5, titled \\"Process Standards\\", talks about the case study team refactoring their build scripts towards a structure that supports a \\"standard\\" build script to be used throughout the company's .NET projects. Very little meat in there. Most of this chapter seemed to present a topic of interest only to move on right away, without giving solutions beyond tiny snippets of NAnt tasks. As someone not familiar with most .NET concepts, I found it very difficult to follow.Chapter 6 brings continuous integration into the picture. After a brief explanation of why one would want to implement a continuous integration process, Holmes proceeds to describe CruiseControl.NET and how to configure it to build your .NET project. Again, only superficial coverage of the configuration options available which is consistent with the stated goal of the book not being about the tools themselves. Yet, at this point I realized that the good stuff had all been about the tools -- NAnt and (to a smaller degree) CruiseControl.NET. This pattern continued through chapter 7 which talks about extending NAnt with your own custom tasks. In fact, this chapter does a good job in showing the ropes through developing a FxCop task.Chapter 8 is a good one. It talks about techniques for dealing with the database schema in the context of continuous integration and incremental development. The example scripts do leave a sense of \\"magic\\" happening that I would've liked to know more about, but even as such this chapter can be useful for getting started with automated integration of the database alongside the application.Chapter 9 talks about code generation (with XSLT and CodeSmith) and how to incorporate it into the build process. The examples were a bit difficult to follow and there wasn't much background on the tools (CodeSmith and XSLT) themselves.To finish off, chapter 10 presents some closing thoughts as a summary for all the things discussed in the body of the book. Good stuff, makes a lot of sense. I find it interesting, though, that beyond the first and last chapters I found very little content that I could associate directly with practical delivery other than from the tool perspective.As a summary, I consider \\"Expert .NET Delivery Using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET\\" to be a nice tutorial for NAnt and CruiseControl.NET. Having said that, a large part of the book seemed to be somewhat disconnected from the stated goal of showing a practical approach to problems in delivering software."},{"Title":"Expert .NET Delivery Using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"Holy smokes, what a terrific book! This isn't some fluffy, shallow overview of a toolset; rather it's about real world delivery issues and dives deep into very practical, real world details.Disclaimer: I got this book free as a giveaway for our .NET Developers Group. Some folks might think this could influence my opinion, but they'd be wrong.What's cool about this book is that the author, Marc Holmes (no relation to me), approaches the process of designing a good delivery system/methodology just like designing good software: a few use cases with expected outcomes which are used as guidelines for building up the various scripts needed to get delivery tasks done. He's got a great blurb at the start of the book: \\"Design for delivery.\\" That's how he approaches the tasks necessary to make an end-to-end solution for automated, reliable software delivery.Marc uses one software product as an example through the entire book, starting out with a simple product then moving into more complicated configurations. He uses an evolutionary process to get the build and deployment scripts up and working. He starts out with a simple, rough build script which works, then refactors to demonstrate the power of the tools covered in the book.The author covers NAnt fundamentals in very good detail, but he makes it clear the book's not a reference for any of the tools he uses. He covers features necessary only to get his job done, but that coverage is in great depth and is in very clear detail. He shows off some pretty cool stuff about NAnt, including how to wrap in third-party tools (FxCop, before its inclusion as a nant-contrib task, e.g.), then walks through some good tutorials on extending NAnt.The book's centered around NAnt and CruiseControl.NET, but he also integrates other tools like FxCop and discusses how to use code generation tools to help solve complex issues in build files. CodeSmith is covered in detail for this task.Two things make any automated delivery system particularly difficult: source control and database integration. Marc covers both topics in great depth in separate, detailed chapters. He starts out by laying out the end goal and what process standards should apply to the routines. He then moves forward with basic implementations wrapping Source Safe and database integration into the process.A complete download of all the various build files, tools, and source code examples is available from Apress's website.An important note: I think this book is applicable to cross-platform use. Sure the specific tools are NAnt and CruiseControl.NET (plus several other widgets), but many of the concepts are applicable to folks doing Java development using Ant and CruiseControl. Furthermore, I think this book pairs up terrifically with Steve Loughran's Java Development with Ant. Loughran's book was a terrific eye opener to me for specifics of laying out projects with abstracted build files, plus he hits testing, deployment, and library inclusion too. Both books together really help out folks using Ant/NAnt and CruiseControl/.NET.This really is a terrific book, and a must-read for anyone looking to automate their build and delivery processes."},{"Title":"Expert .NET Delivery Using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"Holmes gives you a very motivated guide to using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET. I'm from the linux/Java world, and am familiar with Ant. So the NAnt discussion was very relevant to my experience. Holmes explicitly says that this book is not a comprehensive guide to the abilities of either package. But in some ways, while not comprehensive, it may well be better than a text devoted to either [or both]. You can see in Holmes' text, very plausible ways for why and how you can use those packages. Going through the chapters, he delves into a detailed practical application. Helps you build a context in which you might use the tools for yourself.I was unfamiliar with CruiseControl.NET. But ended up being impressed with how it lets you do this agile, continual integration. On the broader issue of explicating issues in code delivery, I tend to agree with a previous reviewer, Koskela. Who stated that the book doesn't give a bigger view than that of the tools. Though it certainly does that well."},{"Title":"Expert .NET Delivery Using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"This serves as a good introduction to NAnt and NAnt contrib. Working through the excercises was helpful. The introduction for CC.NET is also good.I recommend this for anyone new to NAnt and CruiseControl. I caution the use of Continuous Integration. It is an excellent way to immediately identify build and integration issues; however, you have to beware of \\"false positives\\". For example, an auto-build everytime something is checked in will determine if that checkin causes a build failure with everything else that is checked in.... however, you need to do some soul-searching to determine if this is what you really want. Do you want to trap failures and correct them, or determine a development strategy ahead of time that will prevent these surprises? The continuous build isn't a bad idea, but it becomes troublesome if you are substituting that for a good development and integration plan."},{"Title":"Expert .NET Delivery Using NAnt and CruiseControl.NET (Expert's Voice in .NET)","review":"Great NAnt & CruiseControl.NET reference for .NET developers.

Did this book even have an editor?"},{"Title":"Porting Unix Software: From Download to Debug (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"Unfortunately a large amount of the material in this book has become outdated -- autoconf (&quot;./configure&quot;) and friends have successfully made hand-configuring most packages a thing of the past. Many of the constraints and issues in the book are not problems on modern systems -- gcc is still a bear, but it's a rare system that doesn't have the space to keep around all stages of the bootstrap.If you have any sysadmin background, a lot of the book will be repetition; but if you are new to sysadmining (or porting), or are willing to skip over the bits you already know, it's still worth reading or skimming.In addition there are still useful tidbits despite these issues. The discussion of terminal information, while a bit esoteric for some readers, is detailed. Although the OS's that the author uses for examples are older, the general principles still apply (especially BSD vs. SysV). The standards information is still useful, and the general &quot;how to persuade a package to compile on a different OS&quot; is excellent.It also could be useful for the programmer -- being generally familiar with this book may help you write code that will be easier to port, and will definitely help you if you're porting your own code (look at the section on emulating unavailable behaviors.)Don't expect to get a full 500 pages of useful information -- but the remaining pages are still worth the read."},{"Title":"Porting Unix Software: From Download to Debug (Nutshell Handbook)","review":"This book is two books in one actually.

Nothing of a rocket science, a book of advises instead. Lots of useful info. Second part is more of a reference. It lists differences between different flavours of Unix.

The mood swings, sometimes abruptly, from wonder, to laugh-out-loud funny, to nail-biting tension.All my favorite characters from the original return, and are joined by the imaginatively-rendered Borijans and their AI GENIUS in a three-way battle for the future of Titan, which is also a battle between science and nonsense, gullibility and guile, compassion and selfishness."},{"Title":"Immortality Option","review":"Considering the massive set and costume changes between successive &quot;Star Trek&quot; movies, which are generally 2-3 years apart, I wondered how well the author would pick up after over a decade.

The main characters are back (with Karl Zambendorf at the top of all of them) and also the background is set on Titan.Being asked to write this sequel by his publisher, Hogan responded that he did not want to as he had effectively finished the story on \\"Code of the Lifemaker\\". Nevertheless, the publisher insisted and Hogan intelligentely found a thread from the first novel to follow an adventure which has weight enough to carry on the story.Although the charm and originality of the initial situation has faded, Hogan compensates with a fast-paced adventure and a satisfactory conclusion to what can be labelled as the series of \\"Zambedorf on Titan\\".Rating=3"},{"Title":"Immortality Option","review":"I LOVED the original &quot;Code of the Lifemaker&quot; so long ago, but 20 years later, I found this sequel to be nothing short of appalling, bad in ways that suggest Hogan has no respect either for his audience or even himself.While the original showed a wonderful imagination, it was grounded in both real science and the way real people behave. The sequel, on the other hand, is grounded in neither, and reads more like Internet fan fiction or an entry in some sort of &quot;bad science fiction&quot; contest. When I read the paragraph where Hogan described the notebook of &quot;correct opinion&quot; the evil media elites distribute to newsrooms as part of the vast, sinister media conspiracy (literally), I had to re-read the paragraph several times, since I didn't want to believe something so comically stupid could have been written by someone who once seemed destined to be one of the great science fiction writers.Nope, he did write it. And into the garbage went this book.If you're looking for wonder and imagination set in Saturn's orbit, check out John Varley's Gaea trilogy instead, and stay well away from &quot;The Immortality Option.&quot;"},{"Title":"Immortality Option","review":"I just finished this book in a late nite read-a-thon! Towards the end, like seemingly all of Hogan's work that I've read, I got drawn into the story despite the sometimes clunky and cliched writing. Hogan is above all an &quot;idea man&quot;-- with very engaging concepts and ideas (it probably don't hurt that I'm fascinated with robots and AIs and all that), but the ideas suffer a bit from his writing style and often flat characterization. If you've read Hogan before, you know what I mean.Even still, it seems very unfair to me to bludgeon this book as UNIQUELY bad for James P. Hogan, as though he suddenly went downhill. I would actually say that this book is better than _The Code of Lifemaker_. It seems to me that Hogan had some time to think about the backstory of his characters more and invent even more intriguing ideas in the time between the two novels. Yes, as one reviewer noted, there is a VERY silly passage about some kind of seamless media conspiracy to spin the news, but that one paragraph only detracts so much from the whole book. Look, in the first book, there was a cigarette vending machine(!) aboard one of the NASO spaceships(!!!!). One must allow for Hogan's little quirks.The biggest &quot;con&quot; about this book, in my humble opinion, is the same con for _The Code of Lifemaker_: The tedious psuedo-medieval gibberish spoken by the Taloids, the naturally evolved race of bipedal machines. After so many thees and thous and other sophomoric attempts at the King's English of antiquity, you really long for the action to shift to the humans or the Borjians or anywhere else...!!! Also, the females in Hogan's books (the few that exist) are either conniving witches, total airheads, feminazis, or baby-making machines... quite literally on the last one! But so many authors (both male and female) are guilty of this, it hardly seems fair to single out Hogan.The pros include: the return of Karl Zambendorf, who has grown personally as in the last book, but who is more than capable of all his old tricks; some hilarious moments with the Borjians, the bird-like aliens whose advanced culture produced the Searcher ships that spawned the Taloids; and above all, GENIUS 5, an AI who is hilarious and winsome and one of Hogan's most fully rendered characters. Despite Hogan's oft-noted clunky writing style, and some very predictable scenes, _The Immortality Option_ contained some genuinely exciting plot twists and developments. Often, just when you think that Hogan has lazily written his characters out of a conundrum, realistic disaster strikes and plans go awry. And without giving too much away, it has a happy ending!"},{"Title":"Modern Elementary Statistics, With Theoretical Supplement and Basic Programming (American Sciences Press Series in Mathematical and Management Scienc)","review":"One of the few statistics textbooks that has a notation consistent with what is found in mathematics texts in set theory, probability, and measure theory.

Another thing is that they never knew for what type of a movie they were making the Saturday Night Fever songs for. They just produced their best in 2 weeks and handed it to Stigwood.

Kim Stevens mentions that they probably won't split up again, but right after the 1981 album Living Eyes, they do. Much to learn in newer books, but not bad for its year."},{"Title":"A Place at the Table: The True Story of Two Men -- Best Friends in Their Youth, Reunited in Adversity","review":"This is a tale of two young boys, one caucasion and one African-American, who were unlikely friends in North Carolina farmland in the late 40's and early 50's. The bond created between these two boys was strong enough to carry on to their high school years when they encountered the trials and tribulations of a newly integrated school. Together they were able to overcome these hardships and continue a relationship through adulthood, keeping in contact and sharing experiences as each man fought his own life threatening disease. This story is an inspiration and an education for all."},{"Title":"A Place at the Table: The True Story of Two Men -- Best Friends in Their Youth, Reunited in Adversity","review":"I was priviledged to know Alan Stoudemire professionally.

I have found that way through this beautiful book. I am an assistant principal and can't wait to share this book with my teachers and students.

A must buy for poetry lovers and Robert Frost fans."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"I bought this one for my daughter who was studying Robert Frost in first grade.

From the cover picture, I'd expected it to contain that one.Still, I'm glad I bought it for her."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"I have read this book by Robert Frost end to end. When I first saw this book I had to read it. I read Robert Frost last year in school. This book can be read to any age at any time. I thik some of Robert Frosts pomes can tech kids about life. That is what I think of this Robert Frost book."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"This book is quite well done and gives a good representation of Frost's work. It of course in an introduction and the poems chosen hit the nail on the head. The illustrations are great and well fit the poem being addressed. There is a very nice introducion in the form of a simple biography of Frost in the front of the book which is quite useful. The addited comments by the Editor are quite good and thought provoking. I cannot recommened this one high enough.Some of the Poems included are, The Pasture, Rose Pogonias, A Girls Garden, Ghost House, Birches, Mending Wall, The Wood Pile and quite a number of others."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"I read Poetry for Young People by Robert Frost. While I do not enjoy poetry, I felt this was a good introduction to his work.\\"The Cow in Apple Time\\" gives the cow some personality by telling how she left the boring old pasture in search of something sweet and perhaps it wasn't a good idea because she ends up with an upset stomach and her milk runs dry.\\"A Prayer in the Spring\\" talks about the end of winter and the beginning of spring. It tells about the dreariness of winter coming alive with the colors of spring and the changes that must take place as time changes.Another of his poems from the book is \\"Now Close the Windows\\" is similar to \\"A Prayer in the Spring\\" because it's about change, but it's the change from warmer days to the coming winter.If I had to pick a favorite from this book, it would have to be \\"The Last Word of a Bluebird\\" because it personifies the crow and the bluebird. The crow speaks about the bluebird who is flying south for the winter. The bluebird left a message for a young girls and it shows concern for the girl to take care to stay warm and not get sick. He also says he will be returning in the Spring when the weather turns warm again."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"Beautifully illustrated.

I enjoyed it immensely - as a writer I was inspired to see that this Pulitzer Prize winner had to actually leave his home in order to write because at first, no one thought his work was high enough quality to publish.He gave up his farm to write. He first wrote his poetry at night, when the farm was still until finally - he focused on his main love - words.The poetry is divided by season, with Henri Sorenson's glorious watercolor illustrations providing the perfect counterpoint and setting to the words of Frost.Savor this book as a beginners guide - and lover's meditation - on the work of Frost."},{"Title":"Robert Frost (The Augustan books of poetry)","review":"This is a nice book to have if you're wanting to introduce your children to poetry, or if you are interested in Robert Frost's poems yourself. There is a 3-page biography at the beginning, and then the poems arranged by season and with accompanying illustrations. Each poem also has a 2 or 3 line explanation, which is sometimes useful and sometimes pointless.Of the Frost poems I already knew, The Road Not Taken and The Mending Wall were included (of course!), but Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening was not. Thankfully, I already have anillustrated versionof that anyway! To be honest, reading through this collection didn't really garner me any new favorites; the three I already knew remain my favorites. But, I do want to introduce my children to poetry, and this book is a good vehicle for that. I'll plan to read through this with my 2 older children (almost 8 and 6) this school year.

She was looking for poetry books which would be appropriate for her age (we live in Australia and she is in Grade 1). What makes this book special is the beautiful illustrations, one for each poem. It is divided up by seasons and has a short explanation of the poem at the bottom of each page as well as some points to make a child think about what they have read. I love Robert Frost's poems, coming from a New England family, my favourite being 'The road not taken'. We have enjoyed this book together and this weekend my daughter is going to show this book to my father and I know they will enjoy it together and talk about what the poems mean to him. It helps bring her American heritage to life."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"WOW !!! This is the first time I have ever left a review for a book I have read and I have read hundreds of books. I think this was the BEST book I have read in a very long time.

It is a book I will keep and read again, which I usually don't do.

Brianne is a modern woman who wakes up in 1856 alone and confused. Hoping she'll wake up from this dream/nightmare, she copes the best she can. She settles for a marriage of convience for survival, thinking that the love and companionship she seeks will never be hers. Constance O'Day Flannery's character development is marvelous. You grow to care for Brianne. I found myself staying up until 3am to see her life unfold, unable to put my book down. As in all romance novels, there is a happy ending, but the afterward to this novel, tying up the time travel plot, brought tears to my eyes"},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"I loved this book.

It is one of my all time favorites, and has a place of honor on my &quot;Keeper&quot; shelf. Everything in this book works to perfection. The characters are well crafted and the situations are believable (even though Brianne goes back in time). The dialog is flowing, and the emotions are strong. It reminds me a lot of &quot;The Flame and the Flower&quot;, but with a spunkier modern heroine. I especially like the Epilogue when the author explains what happens to Brianne's present day body. PS: be careful whom you lend this book to, you may have trouble getting it back."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"I read this book many years ago and fell in love with it. I just found it again and re-read it- yep, still love it! I don't really agree with the last review about the \\"rape\\" scene. It's a fictional book and I took it as that- fictional. It was an important part of the plot, although it may be disturbing to some, you soon forget about it as Constance weaves her magical spell. I felt transported back in time with Brianne and almost wished it were true. I hated that the book ended, and the ending was fabulous! I wish there was a part two and I could continue reading about Brianne and Ryan's life. Not to be, but at least I have this copy and I can pull it out every few years and get swept back in time once again and try to pretend I don't know how the story will turn out. I love this book and highly recommend it to all those who enjoy an easy read that will make your heart flutter and your cheeks flush!"},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"Brianne was on her way to be with her sister while she was having her baby when she had a car accident. When she came too, she walked a few steps fell down an embankment and blacked-out again. When she again awoke it was to see a handsome man telling her that she was a whore sent by his friend as a joke. She thought he was mad, and that everyone in the area was in a historical play (for the tourists). He would not believe she was from the future. Imagine when she finds out that he was really an ancestor of her sisters husband. Read the book to find out what happens."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"I liked parts of Timeless Passion a lot but equally so there were aspects of this novel I found quite annoying.Heroine Brianne is transported back to pre-civil war New Orleans after a car accident outside the Big Easy. She is discovered by Ryan Barrington who owns the plantation that Brianne finds herself roaming about. He is disbelieving of her story that she is from the future and so are the others on the plantation. They are convinced that she is suffering from a head injury and this explains her fantastic story.Brianne feels that the people on the plantation are under Ryan's control and she longs to leave and she gets her wish when she tells Ryan's god parents that her sister is in New Orleans. She arrives in New Orleans thinking the entire town is celebrating an antebellum festival. This almost makes sense but does not explain why there are no cars, electricity or modern thoroughfares or buildings. She still, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, believes that this is all a hoax put on by thousands of people. Brianne rashly puts herself in some danger and is rescued by an Irish woman and only then does she begin to understand that she really has been transported in time.Ryan at first is really, really hard to like. He takes advantage of a drugged Brianne and is less than sympathetic to her plight. He later finds her in New Orleans and offers marriage. And Brianne agrees as she has absolutely nowhere to go and no money.Usually I dislike when modern day people are transported back in time because they want all of their conveniences and modern day beliefs to be operating in their new realm. Here I had no problem with Brianne's progressive ideas, especially her views on slavery. She more than anyone on the plantation truly fathoms the evilness of it and she thoughtfully sets out to prepare everyone for the soon coming war. She educates the slaves and freemen on the plantation.The romance between the leads sputters and stalls than takes off only to sputter again. Ryan does act more honorably toward Brianne but only when he realizes she is who she claims to be. Still his earlier treatment of her was hard to ignore. Brianne suffers from too much stubborn pride and she refuses to listen to those who have only her best interest at heart.This novel rates three and a half stars not so much for the tempestuous romance between the leads but rather for the very admirable heroine and the ingenious plotting by the author. Having her heroine go back into time to try to right terrible wrongs was creative and Brianne's sympathetic nature was easily her best trait. Oh, lastly, I have to say I really liked how this novel ended, it is more than a happily ever after. The author does a very fine job tying up all the loose ends."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"I do not normally read Time travel romances, but gave it shot because of all the great reviews. This was a very good book.**There may be spoilers**The positive for me: The Hero loved him. It felt like he jumped off the page, he was so well written. The supporting cast of characters really brought the story to life for me; they were so perfectly drawn out. She handled the issue of the hero owning slaves quite nicely (remember this is a fictional story).The negative for me: The heroine jumped from strong woman to adolescent child a little too much for me, but because of her circumstance within the story I looked past it and still thought she was likable. The story line revolving around the villain(s) was weak and was resolved to easily.All and All a well written book that brought tears to my eyes during the epilogue and who's characters are still with me weeks after finishing. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"This was my 1st time travel book I've read more than 10 years ago... now I'm 29 and still very much in love with this book. I've collected all her time travel novels and I can't get enough of her stories. This book I've purchased so many times for misplacing it or lending to friends to read. I've lost it again...lol... and just wish that this book was an E-BOOK so I can carry it with me everywhere. The storyline is so good and sweet, the characters have so much personalities. I RECOMMEND this book to time travel romance readers. A very fine piece of art!!! ENJOY THIS BOOK!!!"},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"and I still think about the storyline quite frequently. Not only did I love the characters and how they developed throughout the book, but I'm very much into the New Orleans: it's such a great setting for a romance to take place. \\"Timeless Passion\\" also includes many dualisms, like North vs. South, being a modern career woman vs. being an oppressed wallflower wife, etc. For me, the time travel genre is a great expression of clashing ideals and interests, which can be both hilarious and shocking depending on what's encountered. From a person that reads just about anything she picks up, I'm still a very harsh critic. This book, along quite a few classics, I swear it makes me want to be a writer, too. On a side note, it was clever of O'Day-Flannery to make Brianne so short in comparison to Ryan. We need more characters that aren't portrayed as supermodels so that more people can enjoy these types of novels."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"I didn't want it to end. This book is so powerful and mystic that you wish that you could become a part of it. Tears ran down my face as I finished the last page. Everyone may think romance novels are trashy, and some are, but this book is anything but. Time travel collides with history and passion making a great page turner that will touch your heart and soul. Definetly a keeper. Unfortunatly, I lost my copy, and regret it to this day, since I am unable to find this title anywhere else. Trust me, once you have this book, hold on to it."},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"Of all the time-travel romance books written by Ms. O'Day-Flannery, this is my favorite. It is the story of a young woman, Briane, who drives down to New Orleans to be with her sister while she gives birth to her first child. As she is not familiar with the area, Briane asks for directions and finds herself out in the middle of nowhere facing a car that is approaching her in the wrong lane at a high rate of speed. She drives off the road to avoid an accident, hits a tree and blacks out. When she wakes up she is confronted by a handsome man, seemingly out of another century, who berates her for trespassing on his land.The characters in the book are distinct and believable. The author brings them to life as she gradually convinces them, Briane - and us - that she has traveled back in time to a period just prior to the U.S. Civil War. How a twentieth century woman copes with the shock of this situation and the equally shocking impact that she has on the people of the 19th century is fascinating and holds the reader's interest without endless repetition and/or filler that deviates from the main story (my pet peeves).As I said, this is one of Ms. O'Day-Flannery's best. I recommend it along withA Time For Lovealso by Ms. O'Day-Flannery. I just do not understand why these two books are not available on Kindle and urge Amazon and the publisher to make them available for Kindle readers. These are Keepers!"},{"Title":"Timeless Passion","review":"WOW!!! i wasnt really into reading when i was a teenager until my sister gave me this book to read and i am thankful every day for that so many too many yars later LOL ive read this book over the years again and its still my favorite thankyou!!!!!"},{"Title":"Coastal Maine: A Maritime History","review":"This is the most palatable book of history you will find.

In two pages Moncur gives a better explanation of subnetting than any other I have seen, including not just the usual table-based explanation, but also an explanation at the bit level.This book doesn't cover all topics in detail, you'll need another book, such as the NT Server Resource Kit for that.

And the two men remained friends until Jones' death many years later. This book recounts only a small portion of the plainsman's life, but what is provided relates to us the life of an adventurer, an empire builder, and a conservationalist. Included are stories of the man's trying to rope lions in the Grand Canyon and to his attempt to preserve the last of the buffalo from extinction, after once having slaughtered them to provide meat for the railroad workers. When this book was first published it did not receive very good reviews, but has since been praised for Zane Grey's prose and narrative skills. Furthermore, the people Zane Grey met on this trip with Jones led directly to his creation of such great novels as Heritage of the Desert and Riders of the Purple Sage and set the stage for his entire career. Without this trip and the writing of this book there might not have been a Zane Grey as we know him today. It all began here."},{"Title":"Last of the Plainsmen, The","review":"Zane Grey pulled out all the stops on this tale of chasing wild mustangs, buffalo hunts, cougar hunts, and wild musk-ox. Follow the tale of a rag-tag band of plainsmen led by Col. Jones. A feisty, tough old man who will stop at nothing so he can rope (yes I said rope) a wild cougar and bring it back home. They are a breed of men whose resilience and spirit are the stuff of pioneers and mountain men. The kind of indomitable spirit that won the west, and is the subject of much of America's folklore. Along the way they endure seventy degree below zero blizzards, desert dust storms, starving Indians, and a harsh, yet pristine wilderness of incredible beauty. Zane Grey s depiction of panoramic landscapes such as the Grand Canyon is picturesque. One can almost smell the forest's and sense the loneliness of the wilderness. A great read that was hard to put down. Now for my next task which won't be easy. Picking out the next Zane Grey novel to get lost in."},{"Title":"Last of the Plainsmen, The","review":"This book is an outstanding true account of a trip made by Zane Grey and a plainsman, Buffalo Jones - one of the last. Jones was a famous sportsmen in North America at the turn of the 20th century and Grey a famous author of adventure stories. Unlike many of Grey's fictional novels of the old west, this is an account of a trip made to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon about 1908, for the purpose of tracking and capturing mountain lions. In those days, the North Rim was famous for the number and size of cougars - one mentioned in the book was 10' long, tip of tail to nape of neck, and weighed 300 pounds. The story is riveting with many details of the Arizona high desert and Grand Canyon areas of that era and gives a wonderful account of the Ponderosa Pine forest now known as the Kaibab National Forest. The details given about the behavior of the mountain lion are well worth finding a copy of this classic work. Grey includes a chapter (XV) entitled &quot;Jones on Cougars&quot;, in which he relates the wisdom of this plainsman on the species - gained through a long life in the wilderness including a sojourn as a game warden in the Yellowstone National Park, where he captured numerous cougars alive and killed seventy-two. Although modern views of the mountain lion seem to consider this animal more like an oversized, undomesticated sort of house cat, after reading this book you will definitely treat them with appropriate dignity and caution."},{"Title":"Last of the Plainsmen, The","review":"I was looking for some good westerns and thought this would be a good choice since Zane Grey is a well known and renounded author of westerns.

He presents a comprehensive plan of action for the person in this role and suggests a number of ideas that I would never have even thought about, in which to make the production and creative process a more enjoyable experience. A strong suit in his book is the thoughtfulness and consideration he extends to the personnel involved, such as including visitor's information in the actor's information folders. Kelly includes a glossary of terms in the back of the book, which helps the reader understand the material better. There are a few terms he forgot to include, and he seems to have overlooked a few areas like makeup. (He is also light on the costuming area.) The main shortcoming on this edition--which may have been corrected in later editions--is that it mentions the typewriter more often than the computer and the telephone, rather than the cellphone. Nowadays, the computer and hand-held devices can perform many of the functions the typewriter and the telephone once performed.The appendices are good, giving samples of actual papers he used. However, another book I read (about the British theater) placed the examples in the text describing them. I thought this was a more helpful technique.But, Kelly gives you so much great and practical advice that you don't mind some of the inconveniences. An index at the back is also helpful in cross-referencing topics of interest.I would recommend this book for anyone interested in understanding how the theatrical process should be organized, whether you ever plan to become a stage manager or not. It is good to know all these helpful details, regardless of whatever role you might be interested in filling."},{"Title":"Sergeant Bilko: [The Phil Silvers show \\"You'll never get rich\\"; ten of the funniest stories from the smash hit TV show] (Ballantine books)","review":"Reading this collection of scripts from the \\"Sgt.

Casey Borlen makes decisions based on outside events and on turmoil from within. When Casey Borlen moves to a small town called Jackson to open a restaurant he faces challenges and struggles that he didn't expect. He struggles to run a restaurant and direct the employees and to deal with personal changes in his life.Casey likes waking up next to Sarah. He can't help but think how beautiful she is. Sarah is a bright spot in his life and with her around life is easier.Employees are not always easy to motivate. Eddie didn't like having a new boss. He liked the way the former owner ran the business. \\"Casey resorted to telling Eddie to \\"Just do it!\\" Eventually the two came to an understanding and began to work together.Life seemed good, Sarah was there for him, and the restaurant was going well and then came the River Club. Things got bad after that. River Club was a golf resort. The resort has an expensive restaurant that threatens Casey's business. Soon Casey is caught up in the drinking, gambling and lifestyle that the new club promotes. The price Casey pays is high.Having been a former business owner I can relate to the stress Casey is under. Every new business that comes to town will be checked out by the locals and will take a slice out of your business. The stress affects all parts of your life from financial, mental, physical, emotional and home life. Casey handles the situation different than most. Most owners would not make friends with their competition, nor would they begin to patronize that establishment.\\"Jackson Choice\\" by Gerard Murrin is a good read. The characters are realistic, especially Casey and Sarah. The plot flows along smoothly taking you places you don't expect to go. Gerard is a talented writer.

Much of this was requisitioned from the civilian population and certificates were issued payable in either continental or state funds, depending on the units supplied, upon presentation to court authorities. Thousands of these certificates issued to Virginians were duly entered by the courts, and they provide a fascinating insight into the period of the Revolution. These \\"Publick\\" Claims booklets contain interesting and useful information about the contributions of ordinary people to the Revolutionary War. They provide some details of people's service in the militia or as guards for prisoners of war; they indicate where some bodies of troops were at particular times; and they identify providers of horses, wagons, cattle, grain, or other supplies. Much of the information in these booklets cannot be found anywhere else, which makes the surviving records particularly valuable. Also remarkable is the fact that records survived from virtually every county in the state at that time with the exception of the newly formed Kentucky counties. This makes the collection even more valuable in covering areas which heretofore in this time period have suffered from a lack of personal data. The \\"Virginia Publick Claims\\" are published by counties. In addition to a faithful transcription by Janice Luck Abercrombie and the late Richard Slatten, a complete index is provided for each county booklet.

It's a bit dry, but if you are sufficiently interested in the material than you should be able to get through it OK.The book is divided into sections about Wagner's source material, a history of Parsifal performances, a musical commentary, a discussion of the critical reactions to Parsifal from Wagner's time to the present, and a proposed interpretation. In the &quot;interpretation&quot; section, the author argues that Parsifal must be interpreted as a religious work.I was disappoined with the book, because I was expecting a more detailed interpretation (for example, what actually happens in Act II of Parsifal?)The book is interesting, but was not quite what I was looking for. However, the chapter on Wagner's source material is a necessary prerequisite on forming your own opinion of this work, so those of you still grappling with this opera should consider purchasing this book."},{"Title":"Richard Wagner: Parsifal","review":"I have found the book highly fascinating.

How exciting to see a picture of the copy my father passed to me when I was very young.(The original version (pictured here) has one unfortunately racist line about his expected Chinese servant. This was moderated in subsequent versions. It does not diminish the whole.)I grew up in a remote part of Western Colorado in the 1950's long before the world got connected together. Where my children grew up taking for granted that they had an uncle in Poland and a great-grandmother in Byelorussia, my world was the town where I grew up. Period. OK, every summer we would drive over the mountains to see the grandparents in Denver. But my knowledge of the world was pretty much limited to newspapers and magazines--and this book! What wonderful places they sounded like. And to imagine getting to go to all of those places!Nah! Couldn't happen.But then I went out into the world and I have gotten to see some of them. At the very least I have gotten to know people who have seen almost all of them.Blanding refers to a place called \\"Samarkand\\". What a fascinating sounding place!

Yet I felt this book portrays her regression into a teenybopper mindset who easily hops into a relationship with a man with definitely sinister connections. That's not thrilling: that's juvenile. Easily,she tosses over the &quot;love of her life&quot; and, as she did with a former &quot;Power-Trip Lover,&quot; rubs Silvestri's nose in it. Leslie's belated visitation (after how many years?) and &quot;oh, my goodness&quot; description of his apartment was just a little too difficult to believe considering that Silvestri does possess the couth to be &quot;at home&quot; in an abode of Leslie's stylish taste, and because of the fact that he is enough of an age that has relinquished the &quot;Early Dorm Room&quot; type of decorating. By now, it's simply a far reach, given his stage in life, that the place would be that bad. Plus, the couple's main differences, after all, don't present as intellectual or societal ones (they communicate verbally at the same level and he doesn't eat with his feet), but on the difficulty of blending their occupational worlds, which is a fairly common standoff in most relationships as evidenced when holiday parties cause the stress of crossing territories. So psychologically, given their extremely strong chemistry and depth of feeling evidenced in prior books, this &quot;tossing away&quot; of the relationship makes no sense at this time. In reading the book, the incongruity of the couple's feelings versus efforts somehow overrode the gist of the book and had a disconcerting effect. Suddenly Les seems a mess and looked like some tasteless relationship-randomizer instead of continuing along the maturation process. But, at least the series was continued with the writing of this book and, hopefully, won't be the last in an otherwise terrific series which has been a brainy and entertaining reading adventure."},{"Title":"The Groaning Board","review":"Disappointing ... although still a page turner, I found The Groaning Board to be less than expected. While, fortunately, Smith was less in evidence, unfortunately so was Carlos, the wittiest of the bunch. Another breakup with Silvestri and within minutes (or so it seems), Wetzon has found someone new, not necessarily an improvement. Another sleek &quot;sensitive&quot;, rich lawyer without the moodiness of Silvestri but also without much of an interesting character. Let's hope the next time out will see Meyers back to the level she attained previously."},{"Title":"The Groaning Board","review":"Annette Meyers is a longtime New Yorker and was a former assistant to Broadway producer Hal Prince and vice president at a headhunting firm, and all three professions provide the backdrop and spice to \\"The Groaning Board,\\" her seventh mystery featuring Xenia Smith and Leslie Wetzon.This is one of those mysteries where the secondary stories are just as entertaining as the whodunit. Wetzon, the former dancer partnered with Smith in their growing headhunting firm, acts as her own Watson as she investigates the death of one of the characters associated with The Groaning Board, the gourmet store partway through its 15 minutes of fame. Its principals are fighting over an initial public offering that can stand to make them millions, and the sharks are circling over this potential gold mine.Meyers is a writer with the cheek to install a solitary Fabio in the background of a restaurant scene and razz at his declining celebrity, as well as to insert a quotation from one of the book's characters into the fronts piece. She's talented enough to create Xenia Smith, a barracuda whose cheerful duplicity and unabashed greed manages to retain the affection of both Wetzon and the reader.She also does for New York City in detective fiction what Woody Allen does in film: showing us the glamor and the attractions of the city that never sleeps. To Meyers, New York is a nice place to visit and you would want to live there, and it is be a measure of the city's place in fiction that this attitude comes across as fresh, almost revolutionary."},{"Title":"The Groaning Board","review":".....Xenia Smith and Leslie Wezon are partners in a Wall Street executive search firm.

Barron and MicklynnDevora, a squabbling team whose seemingly irreconcilable differences appears to be doomingthe lucrative business. Not much after that visit, people are being poisoned by food made at theGroaning Board. At least one person, a former girl friend of Leslie's lover, has died. This incidentleads to the break up of Leslie's relationship........When the evidence points towards Micklynn as the prime suspect, she hires Leslie, who beginsto investigate the poisoning. Leslie soon finds her own life in jeopardy as someone obviouslydoes no want her to uncover the truth behind the food poisoning incidents. Leslie may learn that itis safer on Wall Street than it is on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, but that lesson may havebeen learned too late......THE GROANING BOARD is a gourmet's delight due to its brilliant lead characters and theirinteractions and reactions to each other and to other players. The business world is an intriguinglyinsightful backdrop to a well written who-done-it. All seven Smith and Wezon novels are worthreading by fans who enjoy intricately woven characters (think DNA double helix) and a glimpseinside the Manhattan business world...... Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I did not know of Larry Brown until I saw the film \\"Big Bad Love,\\" based on one of his stories. I wasn't crazy about the film but was fascinated by the imagination it emerged from, and gave one of his books a try. For starters, I read his memoir \\"On Fire,\\" about his years as an Oxford, Mississippi, fireman. I thought it would be about fighting fires, responding to emergencies, and what goes on in the firehouse in between. I expected some reflection on the world of firemen, which I understand to be a social order of its own, like policemen.There is all of that and considerably more in this wonderful collection of short essays, many of them dashed off during those off hours in the firehouse, often recounting an experience Brown and his compatriots just had, rescuing someone trapped in a smashed car, putting out a fire, or just screwing around. You learn something of the process of firefighting as Brown reconstructs the events of several fires, including one in the top floor of a building at Ole Miss. He explains how they use the Jaws of Life. You learn about the daily routines of checking equipment for readiness, as well as continual training in CPR and different kinds of fires.But much in the book is unexpected. There are pieces about dogs, hunting, lost kittens, cookouts, practical jokes, watching hawks, petty thefts, driving, drinking beer, and S and V on HBO. Essays that will stay in my memory include his account of a trip to New York to appear on the Today show when one of his books is published and learning while he's there that his wife and son have been hurt in a car accident, then discovering when he finds out they are OK that his dog Sam has died. The mental image of him crying in the airport is vivid and moving.On a more hilarious note is an account of a long day's drive to a training exercise in the Delta, where they arrive late and drunk. On a more literary note, there's his account of setting up a hose to provide fake rain for a documentary film at William Faulkner's home, just down the road from the firehouse. His reflections on Faulkner sitting in the house and writing novels are full of awe and respect for a giant of letters, a giant who had a cup of coffee every night at a local restaurant where he always left a dime tip for the waitress.If you've read or you're thinking of reading Brown's fiction, I recommend this book. It's a wonderful introduction to the man and his world, and you get a sense of the raw material that feeds his imagination."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"Judging from the reviews here, one would expect Larry Brown's &quot;On Fire&quot; to be a travesty of modern nonfiction, an insult to firefighters and rescue personnel, and a rough estimate of the degree to which mankind has fallen from some form of enlightened perch. For grief's sake, people, it's only a book, and a fairly good and compelling one at that. Apparently many people (either in or out of the fire service) have such lofty expectations of their heroes (reinforced sadly by the events of September 11) that to envision firefighters as doing anything more rowdy than a tough game of touch football is to destroy the halos we all love to put on them in our society. Truth is, folks, and this is a firefighter talking here, most of them have the same ordinary, mundane concerns as you and other dead-end jobbers do, especially those whose careers take them down dark paths (as dryly and matter-of-factly as Brown writes them here). They love and hate, they rage and submit, they work and play, they hunt and fish, they drink and smoke, they are ordinary men and women, and they are somehow more important for many of the reasons Brown indicates. What I feel is the book's greatest strength is that Brown's portrayal is as much a myth-destroyer as it is a myth-builder: firefighters, he seems to say, rise above the mundane when asked, and slip beneath it when allowed.Now as for the whole hunting / fishing / cruelty to animals bent that seems to turn everyone off, I suggest you all buy a plane ticket to Memphis, drive south toward Oxford itself, and observe the country Brown writes about and writes from. In case you haven't read any of his other works, it's pretty consistent with other Larry Brown, and yes, it's country-boy living. Some can handle it, and some don't. As for Brown, I think he probably feels as I do: thanks for stoppin' by, and if you see something you don't like, then don't let the door hit you too hard. Frankly, I read Larry Brown for just that attitude and reality, and I wouldn't have it any other way.If you're looking for a glorious depiction of firefighting, or a glamorized portrayal of the Mississippi South, you're invited to read a few fictional accounts of each. But if you want the cold, hard reality of life that only Brown ever seems to bring to light, the pop open a cold one and join him for a tale or two. It'll be, as he says, &quot;mighty fine&quot;."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"The &quot;Chapters&quot; in this book range from 1 paragraph to a few pages. The story follows no logical sequence. Author talks about how he drives while drinking beer with his buddies, slaughters pet rabbits for meat and tells his kids they &quot;ran away&quot;, ran over his kitty accidently with his car, and relates some experiences in passing from the fire department. I felt it was an insult to professional fire service personnel. I would prefer that Mr. Brown not be one of the responders if I needed help, unless no other units were available. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"This is an excellent book about a man who knows who he is, dreams of what he might be, and works his butt off to make the near-impossible real.It's a great book for struggling writers to read because Larry Brown came from nowhere to become one of the great writers of his generation and he did it on the strength of his will alone.There are passages in this book so lovely they make you catch your breath."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"Brown wrote several excellent novels such as \\"Joe\\" and \\"Dirty Work\\" before he passed away a few years ago. Gone too soon, like many great ones. This book, however, is a memoir of his days as a firefighter in Oxford, Mississippi, before he gave up his firehose and axe for pen and paper. More than a book about fighting fires and rescuing people from gruesome highway auto accidents, Brown also writes about life in small town Mississippi and his family. Just like in his novels, Brown can write about matters as mundane as drinking beer or riding around in pickup trucks and still sustain the reader's interest. The man had a way with words. If you've read any of his novels and enjoyed them, you should like these essays too."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I love Larry Brown's writing. So simple, yet so affecting and evocative. This collection of autobiographical tales was written as a reflection on the time in his life from the '70s to the early 90s as an Oxford Fire Department member in Mississippi. That alone would be good enough - his stories tell of the unique esprit de corps in the fire station and of the many harrowing emergencies they would attend. But this book is more than just this. Brown writes of what that life was like as a colleague among the truest of friends, as a professional - sure of his abilities and confident in his training and equipment, as a man coping with moments of life, death and devastation on a routine basis, and as a husband and father living a blue collar existence in a simple home doing simple things.It is these latter recollections which penetrated the most - you feel the soul of the man as he tells of half-hearted hunting expeditions with his sons, planting trees with his buddies in a snowy January landscape, or the heartbreaking episode of the disappearing kittens and the stuggle to settle with himself the ethics of raising rabbits for profit.Intermittently he makes reference to his private passion - writing - and his efforts to fit that parallel vocation in with his home and work lives. These tiny insights are fascinating, and truly give an indication of what kind of a man he was.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I absolutely HATED this book. Not because it was unbearably boring and seemed to be written by a 5th grader, but because of the blatant animal cruelty. I guess I cannot speak for everyone, but I do not enjoy reading about stalking and slaughtering deer, raising rabbits from babies and then slaughtering them, writing about dead kittens and running over them with his car, and reading about how his \\"beloved\\" (and I use the term very loosely) family dog was killed in a dog fight. Not only was the dog killed in the dog fight, it had been in a fight previously and this moron didn't bother to take the dog to the vet, even though it could barely stand up and had injuries to his throat. I bought this book expecting it to be about a fireman and his firehouse. It barely touched on that subject. This book was very disappointed as well as horrifying. If you want to read about the workings of firemen and the firehouse, don't bother. If you want to read about slaughtering animal, this is it. Too bad I had to even give it one star - deserves negative 5."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"Only 20% of this book is related to the fire service and it is adequately written at best. The rest is a rambling bore. Akin to a teenager's journal, it is witless, slipshod prose about the author's pets, drunk driving, raising rabbits, hunting, fishing, and the like. Mind you, I would be delighted to read about firefighter's off-duty life if it was interesting and well-written. This is neither."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"Personally, I would recommend this book because it shows excellent character on Larry Brown's side and he is a great role model to look up to. At times in his life just like everyone else was not perfect and sometimes even terrible but he lived through it and got over the bad things that affected his life as a person and and strived to be the best at what he could be. That is a great example of what anyone should look up to as far as reaching goals is concerned. I definitely recommend this book to readers."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I spent the last year trying to teach college, and in one of our anthologies was an excerpt from On Fire. I liked it so much that I bought the book, but when I started reading the book, I hated it. Then, I ran out of things to read about six months later, picked up On Fire again, and I really liked it. Unfortunately, it is not a book that you can recommend to others because it has so much language and talk about dog's sex lives--and my friends would not be able to get beyond that, because it was hard for me to!This book is hard to review because Brown writes so much about so many different things. It is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about life.The book most profoundly affected me when Brown has to wait in an airport for six hours when he wants/needs to be home--he talks about how those hours have to be &quot;gotten through&quot; and, as a foster parent, I have had to get through hard hours in my life, and the fact that he eloquently captures that feeling of fighting the clock really moved me.If you like dogs, cats, etc. this book will move you even more!"},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I don't know how this book ever got published. It was a rudderless account of unrelated stories about nothing. Many stories revolved around actions you probably warned your kids never to try... and Mr. Brown seemed to be pretty proud of that."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"It certainly isn't about firefighting. It's more about man's inhumanity to animals and the careless ways in which we treat them. If you care anything about animals this book will break your heart."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"This author in no Dennis Smith. I had expected that a majority of the book would involve the author's professional life and his experiences. What I got was a tiresome narrative mainly about his personal life. Who really cares that he had a deer in his gunsight, thinking &quot;This is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen.&quot;, before he kills it. Or all the time he spends drinking beer. There's more but I prefer to just forget the whole regretable experience."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"Larry Brown shares the emotional trauma of being a firefighter in his book On Fire. The book is a true to life account of what it is like to be a firefighter, from the crazy things you do to the heart wrenching life or death scenarios at the scene of an accident. Anyone looking into becoming a professional firefighter should read this book."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"ON FIRE is not a book about firefighting; it is a book about a man's life who also happens to be a firefighter. Brown is a regular guy who worked hard to become a writer, not because he didn't want to be a firefighter, but because he thought he could do something else to contribute to others, doing work as a writer.I think the book is very good. I do not think the book is great. I think the book is worth reading, but I also think if you want to learn more about firefighting there are probably better books out there. Still, I think the book was not a waste of time, as some other reviewers thought it was."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"This novel successfully marries the beauty and danger involved with being both a firefighter and an immerging writer, both a father/provider and a husband. Everything with Brown is presented so straight forwardly and simply that it becomes striated in its own honesty. -- deep like a book should be deep. Read it. You'll laugh and feel from it."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I thought this author would share his experiences of life as a firefighter; I thought wrong. He shares more about his dog not being able to produce puppies than he does about the various accidents and fires he has been a part of. I was shocked by how much he digresses, over and over again he talks about animals which have absolutely nothing to do with firefighting or even his life! The author has written a book that will put the most astute reader to sleep. I wish it had been a bit more interesting, but alas, it was not."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I recived this book when I graduated from High School six years ago. Now I am a teacher and am giving it out to graduating students from my High School.The students that I give this book to are my fire cadets. The love this book. You will too."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"I also purchased Billy Ray's Farm and Facing the Music, Amazon is a great place to buy from online. They always ship very fast and products are as expected at a great price."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"As a professional firefighter I have read many books on firefighting - both fictional and true accounts. &quot;On Fire&quot; is a waste of time and money. Mr. Brown is a poor representative of the typical firefighter. He lacks the pride associated with this profession - both on and off duty. After putting this book aside, I remember only things such as Mr. Brown's drinking, home life activities, and his poor writing style. Your time (and money) are better spent reading &quot;Report From Engine Co. 82&quot; by Dennis Smith."},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"THIS BOOK IS GREAT FOR FIREMAN LOVERS OUT THIER. I WOULD HIGHLY RECCOMEND THIS BOOK BECAUSE IT GOES BACKSTAGE OR BEHIND THE SCENES WITH A REAL FIREFIGHTER! THIS WOULD BE A CARRER LIFETIME BOOK TO YOU LOVERS"},{"Title":"On Fire.","review":"As a lover of Southern fiction (Faulkner, O'Connnor, Styron, etc), I just don't get the praise for Larry Brown. To me, he writes like an imbecile. I do not exagerrate: I see an embicile in my head when I read each line, like maybe Carl Shivers from Sling Blade. His memories are so inane that they should hardly be shared (I watched a man jog past the firestation...)and his writing is so basic and abscent of color. Like bad Hemingway more than anything.Skip it and go read some Cormac MCcarthy."},{"Title":"The descent of man, and other stories","review":"\\"The Descent of Man and Other Stories\\" is the third collection of short fiction from Edith Wharton and was published on April 30th of 1904. Oddly enough there are two versions of the collection which were published the same year. The Macmillan edition included 10 stories while the Scribner's edition only had 9 stories as it did not include \\"The Letter\\". The stories were also in a different order in the two editions. For purposes of this review, I am listing the stories in the order they were in the Macmillan edition.\\"The Descent of Man\\" - Published originally in \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" in March of 1904. Professor Linyard is a man of science who writes a book where he pretends to take the side of religion, expecting it to be understood as a satire of popular scientific books. When it is taken as serious, he goes along with it in order to provide better for his family, thus selling his principles time and time again.\\"The Other Two\\" - Published originally in \\"Collier's Weekly\\" on February 13th of 1904. Mr. Waythorn has married Alice Haskett, who was married twice before and has a child, Lily, by her first marriage. When his business brings her second husband into their lives, and her first husband continues to be part of his daughter Lily's life, he initially becomes upset at the situation. However, he eventually realizes the position she is in and comes to accept the situation.\\"Expiation\\" - Published originally in \\"Hearst's International-Cosmopolitan\\" in December of 1903. Mrs. Fetherel is a new author who manages to get her book published. She is also the niece of the Bishop of Ossining, whose own literary efforts have not sold well, thus preventing him from paying for needed fixing of the chantry window. When her book \\"Fast and Loose\\" is considered \\"harmless\\" by the critics, she gets her uncle to denounce it, thus improving the sales, and the chantry window is able to be constructed, thanks to a generous donation, by a woman who chooses to remain anonymous.\\"The Lady's Maid's Bell\\" - Published originally in \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" in November of 1902. A ghost story, where Miss Hartley becomes the lady's maid to Mrs. Brympton, a woman who is a near-invalid. A previous maid, had died, and Miss Hartley sees and hear things which have driven those who have taken the job between out of the house within six months of accepting the position.\\"The Mission of Jane\\" - Published originally in \\"Harper's Monthly\\" in December of 1902. Lethbury consents to adopting a child when his wife Alice insists. Their marriage was not going well, and Lethbury feels that Jane will keep his wife happy. Initially he is kept out of Jane's life, but as she grows up he is forced to participate more and be a part of both Jane and Alice's life.\\"The Reckoning\\" - Published originally in \\"Harper's Magazine\\" in August of 1902. Clement Westall and his wife Julia have agreed on a different kind of marriage. Julia had been married before, and was allowed to walk away when she decided to. Thus, she wanted for both her and Clement to have the same ability. She is surprised when Clement exercises that option, forcing her to reflect back on what she had done to her first husband, John Arment.\\"The Letter\\" - First published in \\"Harper's Magazine\\" in April of 1904. When Colonel Alington dies, the narrator reflects back on the one story he told that said the most about who he was, and the bravery of one woman and the sacrifice she was willing to make for Italy. This is my favourite story in this collection, one in which Edith Wharton very artfully mixes history, character, and story.\\"The Dilettante\\" - Published originally in \\"Harper's Monthly\\" in December of 1903. After seeing Miss Ruth Gaynor off at the train station, Thursdale pays a call on Mrs. Vervain to discuss his previous visit which he and Miss Gaynor had paid to Mrs. Vervain. Mrs. Vervain tells him a story about how Miss Gaynor doesn't like the friendship between Thursdale and Mrs. Vervain.\\"The Quicksand\\" - Published originally in \\"Harper's Magazine\\" in June of 1902. Mrs. Quentin is upset when her son Alan is rejected by Hope Fenno because of his owning a newspaper which is ruthless in its reporting. He asks her to go see Miss Fenno, but when she does so, she recognizes a bit of herself and remembers the sacrifice she had to make when she married as well as the kind of person her son is.\\"A Venetian Night's Entertainment\\" - First published in \\"Scribner's Magazine\\" in December of 1903. An amusing story about Tony Bracknell and his first time in Venice as a sailor on a merchant ship.This is a very nice collection of stories, with a good amount of diversity in the subject matter and styles. Edith Wharton once again shows that she can write short fiction very well, and that she can use all aspects to create an engaging story which keeps the reader's interest. Not quite as good as the collection \\"Crucial Instances\\" in my opinion, but worthwhile nonetheless."},{"Title":"The descent of man, and other stories","review":"I only had to read The Other Two for my American Literature 2 class which is what I'll be doing a review on. I believe that this was a funny story due to the awkward circumstances of a man, Waythorn, being married to a woman, Alice, who has previously been married and divorced twice. Waythorn keeps getting thrown at her past husbands since Alice's daughter, Lily, was stricken with typhoid. He ends up seeing the first husband because he wants to visit his daughter and sees the second because he is forced to do business with him. All three men seem to be very polite and good natured so it makes you question why Alice was divorced twice before marrying Waythorn. The only reason I give it a four is because the ending left me completely unsatisfied, as did it for the rest of my class. It does make you want more but the harsh reality is that there is no more after The Other Two so you're forced to contemplate you're own ending!"},{"Title":"Testarotho: Volume 3 (Testarotho (DC Comics))","review":"The members of Testarotho are beginning to have their doubts as to whether they're fighting on the right side after the death of Father Garrincha. Arsenal has taken the side of the Corinthians and have judged Garrincha and his team as the parties responsible for the wholesale slaughter of a defenseless village last volume and they have been sentenced to death. Leonedus, Capria, Socrates, and Ginora are all now being hunted not only by the Corinthians, but by their own forces! Could it be that their only remaining allies are the very heretics they were sworn to destroy....Materia!? Will the ex-Testarotho be able to overcome their prejudices and a lifetime of brainwashing in order to survive?Testarotho continues its excellent run even though some moments cause you to roll one eye in a \\"oh, come on\\" expression of disbelief such as the fact that Leonedus was blinded last volume but acts like he can see just like normal. Reminds me of Blind Justice when the guy still wanted to shoot his gun even though he was blind! But supposedly Leonedus has gained some sort of spiritual vision where he can see the true forms of those around him. That's great and all, but how does he keep from running into a wall? And again, where does he keep his gun? Besides these minor incredulities, I really like the story which gets even more twists and turns along with a bit more background in this third volume. It really shows the dangers of what happens when religious extremists control the flow of information. They can declare anyone that opposes them to be heretics. It's cool to see the Testarotho begin to open their eyes and see what the real deal is. The art is great and Sanbe really has a flair for depicting action. Really good manga.I would also recommend Chrono Crusade."},{"Title":"Testarotho: Volume 3 (Testarotho (DC Comics))","review":"All I can say is... Yikes! This series is pretty twisted, in a \\"We all believe in the same God, but you should die anyway.\\" sort of way. I really like this series, it asks a lot of those uncomfortable questions, and it really wants to make you think, and say ewwwwwwwww. This is definatly not for the kiddies, unless you are training a young david koresh, but is a satisfying read. As you move into the later books the story really starts to solidify, and you actually get to know the otherside of those heartless (not really) nut job preists. Overall a very cool read, and I highly recomend it!"},{"Title":"Heat Guy J","review":"Based on the successful Anime, TokyPop has released a fantastic new Manga, Heat Guy J. Set within the spectacular city of Jewde (or Judoh in the Anime version), Daisuke Aurora and his android partner Heat Guy J battle crime as agents for the Special Services, supervised by Daisuke's older brother. This Manga actually contains four separate, self-contained stories.In the opener \\"City Guy\\" a member of the Solloso crime family, found to be dealing in illegal tobacco is found dead as Daisuke investigates. He soon finds himself confronted by the killer, a rogue android that is outlawed in Jewde. The Android knows of heat Guy J and wants Daisuke to call him out for a confrontation. Daisuke refuses and the android attacks, finally getting J to appear for battle.In \\"Rumor Bomb\\" Daisuke is given the rather dull assignment of trying to track down the maker of the \\"Angel Diva\\" trading cards. The cards are being produced without the knowledge of the women shown on them and sold into the black market, making them a hot collectible. A far more interesting case is that of the serial bomber who has already struck several targets in Jewde, but that is being handled by the regular law enforcement until Daisuke and J find themselves caught up in the twisted plot of both crimes.\\"Beast Party\\" finds J and Daisuke attending a swanky, pool part at a hotel owned by the head of the Wei crime family. A beautiful and buxom party guest who throws herself at the mob boss turns out to be an android assassin and Heat Guy J soon finds himself in battle with the gorgeous machine.The last, and best story of the group is \\"Steel City\\". J and Daisuke are attending the Jewde robot expo after hearing rumors that a powerful android named Grendel plans to attack the show. The pair are led into a trap and find themselves facing a massive mecha. But all this was just a diversion as the new head of the Leonelli family sends the powerful Grendel in to kill both J and Daisuke...and J is in shut down mode to cool off from his last battle. Can Daisuke survive in time until J reboots?This was one of the best Manga's I've ever read. The interplay between the over-eager yet lazy Daisuke and the stoic, dedicated J make for great reading as J constantly has to remind Daisuke about their responsibilities. The dialog throughout is zippy, and tinged with hilarious sarcasm. Kyoko, the Special Services secretary is in a constant battle with Daisuke to get his reports filed on time as well as fighting with him over his bullet limit. At it's core Heat Guy J is a traditional buddy cop show, it's just that one of the buddies is a steam-powered Android. The series was created by Kazuki Akane and features excellent artwork by Chiaki Ogishima. In addition to the four stories there's also a nice reference section detailing the series' main characters. Outstanding debut Manga from TokyoPop!Reviewed by Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Heat Guy J","review":"It's obvious the reviewer before me was making a normal male statement of liking this Manga, but if your looking for hot Bishi's, men in action or whatnot, go some where else.I bought this Manga thinking it's be a good addition to my collection. Usually a Yaoi Fan (Bishonen too) by nature I actually took a strange liking to the Heat Guy J Anime. So buying the Manga was the next best thing (I thought) and let me tell you, I was COMPLETELY wrong.The Manga is NOTHING like the Anime.For a start all it contains is Hentai and Ecchi elements (and not the good kind!) it features alot of pictures of panty shots, g-string shots, boob shots of random girls in underwear, bikinis, you name it and overall could put a monkey off.There was only one shot of J in a speedo and that was it for Fanservice for the Girls who liked the series. It was a dull read and disguisting to look at.I suggest unless you like the above mentioned, don't pick it up. Not for Fans of the Anime. More toward Hentai freaks."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"My 6 year old son loved every word of this book and wishes that there were more books about Mr. Popper and his penguins.

Soon the performing Popper penguins became famous.The main characters of this book are: Mr. Popper, Mrs. Popper, Captain Cook, Greta, Janie and Bill. Mr. Popper is a house painter that enjoys reading about Arctic life. Captain Cook is a kind penguin that doesn&#65533;t cause much trouble.This book mostly takes place in the town of Stillwater. The genre of this book is kind of realistic fiction. What surprised me is the end, because the name of the chapter seemed melancholy but ended up being something different.What the author did well is naming the chapters. They were good descriptions of what happens. I think the author&#65533;s style was kind of humorous. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes to read about penguins."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"It was hard for me to get interested in this book. I was bored with it and really didn't want to finish it, but since our school requires our students to read it, I needed to read it so I would know more about the book. If I had been given a choice about what book to use to teach reading skills, I would have chosen a different one."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"At 71 years old, this book is still as popular as it was when published back in 1938! How had I made it all the way through childhood and a looooong adulthood without ever having heard of it?I decided it would be one of the books that 8 yo, \\"J\\", and I would read together. He's been pretty deep into the Wimpy Kid books lately, so I wasn't sure how he would take to some of the more old-fashioned elements of this story. But we really like penguins at my house, so I figured that aspect would capture his interest. I needn't have been concerned. He absolutely LOVED this book!Mr. Popper is somewhat of an absent-minded dreamer, and he often finds himself in the middle of some of the most absurdly ridiculous predicaments -- even before any penguins take up residence at 432 Proudfoot Avenue. Once they begin to move in, though, the chaos is hilarious. One of the most hysterical scenes takes place when Mr. Popper telephones City Hall to find out whether he needs a license for his first penguin, Captain Cook. I won't spoil it for you, but it reads a lot like the old 'Who's on first' routine. \\"J\\" was literally rolling around laughing, unable to catch his breath! I got a kick out of the variant ways characters reacted to seeing a virtual chorus line of penguins walking around town. Some were completely freaked out, which of course was funny, but others took it completely in stride, and that acceptance was laughably ludicrous!There are some illustrations here and there throughout the book which enhance rather than overpower the story. The interior drawings are the original illustrations by Robert Lawson, and they nicely set the story in the 30's as well as show the sweetness of the penguins. The cover art of this edition, by Michael Emberley, is cute and funny.This is a story not to be missed. I think anyone would enjoy the silliness, but there's nothing quite like experiencing this sort of inanity with a kid at your elbow and seeing it through their eyes. I hope you all have one handy to share this comical adventure about what can happen when dreams come true."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Where is Stillwater?The Name of the book I am reviewing is called Mr. Popper's Penguins by Richard and Florence Artwater. The location in where Mr. Popper's Penguins takes place is in a small town called Stillwater. I am pretty sure that Stillwater is a town I'm just not sure where.The First OneMr. Popper's Penguins starts out as Mr. Popper being a house painter at the end of September and stopping because no one wanted their house painted any more. Mr. Popper loves to read about the North and South Poles, mostly about the South Pole because penguins are there. One day he sent Admiral Drake a letter about pictures Admiral Drake had brought back from their last expedition. A few days later Mr. Popper gets a huge crate saying THIS SIDE UP on the side. He opened the crate and to his surprise a penguin looks up at him. Soon the penguin gets a name which is Captain Cook.Captain Cook and Mr. Popper get into all sorts of mischief, For Example; Captain Cook goes and eats two live goldfish. To find out all the other ones you will need to read the book.Newbery HonorThe medal this book holds is true in my opinion; the medal it holds is the Newbery Honor Medal. I really liked this book for some parts where you want to laugh, like when Captain Cook slides up and down the bathtub pretending it is the icy Antarctic ground. Or when Captain Cook gets tangled up with a photographer's camera when he is trying to get a picture of the mischievous penguin. Then there are some parts where you don't know what will happen, For Example; When Captain Cook gets sick and has a temperature of 104 degrees. Or when Mr. Popper gets thrown in jail, which is like the climax of the book. There are a lot more feelings in this book but I won't give them all away.You Have To Know This!I would just like the readers of this to know is that; This book may not lead you to the ending you might have wanted, you don't really have to know anything about penguins to read this book because it will tell you a little, and this book is on my top three recommendation list. I also want to say this book is about a 4th to 6th grade reading level because of its vocabulary.A Must ReadI would put this book on my 2 out of 3 book to read because its just a great story and pretty funny too. I would recommend this book to every kid I know that likes a laugh or two.

I had to have this for my classroom!I teach children with mild to moderate specific learning disabilities who need to regularly experience success in reading if they are ever going to become lifelong readers. What better way to foster desired literacy behaviors than using this delightful tale of an absentminded housepainter, his tidy, yet serious wife, their two children, and 12 performing penguins!After reading this book, I thought that it would be ideal to use as the focus of a thematic unit on penguins. Believe it or not, there are many themes in the book that lend themselves to serious classroom discussion. For example, Mr. Popper daydreams of far-away places. There is the theme of daydreaming, why people daydream, as well as the theme of travel. Students could be asked to journal about their daydreams, as well as their hopes and dreams of visiting faraway places, which leads into a study of the geography and culture of other people.In my 6th grade language arts class, I plan on focusing on the 17 different types of penguins there are, where they are found, some of their habits, as well as studying about polar exploration. Thanks to this timeless tale, I have a wealth information to use for exploration with my own class.Mr. Popper's Penguins is a wonderful example of how a well written trade book can be used across the curriculum, to foster lifelong literacy habits, and broaden a child's horizon."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I read this book in a Book Club with three kids ages 8 and 9.

It was being billed as a \\"children's classic,\\" and not only had I not read it, I couldn't find a soul who had. I felt the need to rectify the situation, if only to satisfy my curiosity.It's the sweet story of a husband, father, and housepainter who is captivated by all things Polar. After writing a letter to Admiral Drake on expedition in Antarctica, the charmed Admiral sends Mr. Popper a present. You guessed it! It's his very own pet penguin! The Poppers name him Captain Cook and set him up in the icebox.As for how the Poppers go from one pet penguin in the icebox to a dozen performing penguins on the vaudeville circuit, well, that's the story. It's a charming tale for younger readers, made all the more delightful by Robert Lawson's illustrations. Even on my Kindle, these reproductions of the originals looked great. While not unpleasant, this innocent tale from the past had limited appeal to this adult reader, but I can certainly see the delight of one day sharing it with my nephew."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"\\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" was always one of my favorite childhood books. I remember a time when I demanded for weeks on end that my mother get me a penguin or seventy after reading this book for the first time (sadly, I was denied). Now, on the anniversary of the release of the film, this new ebook edition has been gorgeously retouched with more vibrant illustrations, a short biography of the authors at the end of the story, and new photos from the authors' estate. If you're looking to pass on this childhood classic to the next generation of kids, look no further than this new ebook version.They did a fabulous job retouching the book, I will give the publishers that much. It's like Mr. Popper and his penguins leap off the page like never before. Then again, e-ink technology can do that for a children's book.I always love Mr. Popper, mostly because I always saw a lot of myself in him; dreaming of far away places but never really having the chance to go. I admired him the chance to return his penguins to their natural habitat, getting to go on the adventure of a lifetime and achieving his dream. I dreamed of penguins and snow for months after I read this book for the first time as a child. Now with this edition, I feel like I can relive those old memories but in vibrant new color like never before.The illustrated biography was also a delightful treat - I learned more about the authors that I'd never known before, and I suspect, hadn't quite been presented in public before (though I have no real evidence to back that up). The photos were a great edition, and I sincerely hope this makes it into a new paperback or hardback hardcopy edition for children's classrooms across the country.If you have a color nook or similar tablet, get this edition of the book. You'll have so much fun reading it to your little one they'll probably nag you that you're paying more attention to the penguins than to them.If you don't have a tablet, get this book anyway and relive some nostalgia of your own.

I'm so glad I did because I found Mr. Popper's story charming and entertaining and I can certainly picture Carrey in this role. Mr. Popper is a house painter who is married to a dull but sweet wife and has two children. He lives a routine, unexciting life and has never been very far away from his hometown of Stillwater. At least, he's never been away physically. His dreams and imaginary travels, however, have taken him to many far away places, including his favorite sites of all: the North and South Pole. Listening to the broadcasts of Admiral Drake and his South Pole expedition have stirred him like nothing else and he can't help but wish he could see the Pole himself. Imagine his surprise, then, when Admiral Drake responds to his letter by sending him a very live, very active penguin! Captain Cook, as Mr. Popper names him, quickly becomes a special part of the Popper family. They all readily accomodate to Captain Cook's needs, including opening all the windows during wintertime and turning their basement into an ice palace, complete with a crystal lake! It's not long before Captain Cook is joined by other penguins and Mr. Popper finds himself with a troop of very creative penguins just ripe for a cross-country tour! Their adventures are by turns harrowing and hilarious, finally landing poor Mr. Popper and his penguins in jail, where the penguins begin to grow listless and sick. Will he be able to save them in time?

Mr. Popper, a painter by trade, spends his evenings reading and dreaming about exploring the polar regions of the world. Polar explorer Admiral Drake is so impressed with a letter he receives from Mr. Popper that he sends him a real live penguin in a crate and life for the Poppers will never be ordinary again. The Popper household, previously neat and orderly, is turned upside down by their new pet, Captain Cook.When Captain Cook becomes ill and nearly dies, he is sent a mate, Greta, to revive his spirits. Soon there are penguin eggs--ten of them--and an entire arctic world set up in the Popper's humble abode. Caring for the penguins nearly bankrupts the Popper family and they can barley feed themselves and the now twelve penguins that live in their tiny ice-filled home. Not knowing what to do, and very attached to their penguins, Mr. and Mrs. Popper train their arctic friends to put on a show that takes the whole family on a nationwide tour. The now famous Popper Penguins perform to packed theatres of cheering crowds, but will the show solve the Popper family problems for good?Mr. Popper's Penguins is a beloved classic with plenty of fun animal antics to delight children of all ages.

Mr. Popper is a zany character. He works the entire summer as a house painter and interior decorator. During the winter he reads and dreams. Mr. Popper reads about all of the places he would like to visit. Among his favorite places to dream about is Antarctica. He reads the works of a famous explorer and even write letters to the explorer. His wife thinks he is crazy to communicate with the explorer, but when he gets a special gift from his hero, his wife knows he is crazy. The gift is a penguin, and he adores it. After one penguin turns into two and two becomes twelve, the house is full of penguins. The penguins carry Mr. Popper on a journey from the poor house, across the stage, through jail, and finaly to Antarctica. The best thing about this book is that even through the sad parts, the story remains humorous. This is a book for grades K - 6. In the lower grades the teacher or parent can read the story to the students. It will be a very popular read aloud book. In the upper elementary grades the students will be capable of enjoying the book on their own. I love and highly recommend this book for all readers."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"As a child, I read Mr. Popper's Penguins more times than I can count. It was my favorite book growing up and every year I tried to get away with using it in a book report just so I'd have an excuse to read it again. 20 years later, I still find myself thinking fondly of those 12 penguins marching through the Poppers' house full of snow and ice waving their little American flags. I loved the thought of the penguins living in the family refrigerator with the special handle on the inside so they could get out when they wished. And just to see what it was like, I also tried playing the piano in gloves just like Mrs. Popper had to. Although some scenes towards the end leave you feeling anxious for the Popper family and their band of birds, the ending more than makes up for it. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age and I know you'll be delighted by its rare creativity and special wit."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I give this book five stars because it was funny and very interesting to me. It is about a house painter and he always did his job like he was supposed to. He worked in the spring until fall and in the fall he went on vacation until the next spring. His wife said that last year he painted the bathroom three times while he was on vacation. I think this book is terrific for all children because I think it is funny. It was one of my favorite books I read this year because it was interesting. At first I thought it was going to be boring because but I kept reading the book and it made me want to read more. I think you should try this book and you might like it. So please try the book. You know and I know that trying is not so hard for me or you to do.

You would like the book if you read the book for your self and you most likely will like the book and the book is not hard to read.

We too, had a basement when I was growing up, but I couldn't figure out how to get my parents to turn it into a skating rink! I was a dreamer, too as a kid, but I wanted to go off with Tarzan, not with Captain Cook. Children should identify also with the more practical Mrs. Popper. Who doesn't have a realist in their life? :) I especially liked seeing Mrs. Popper succumb to the penguins' charm. When I have children of my own, I will be sure and read this book to them. It is one of the funniest books in print for children and reminds me of another favorite old animal book, Dodie Smith's original version of 101 Dalmations!

Not only do I find the story pleasurable but use the easy read to help with my own writing and reading speed of denser materials. I've loved this book since I was little and was first introduced to it in grade school. As for bad reviews, I don't know who your reading to but they must not understand the depth of the story. Not only are you entertained about a man, his family and some penguins, but it also sheds some light on a different time period and contends with creativity in the face of unemployment. If nothing else, you must give credit that this book was a labor of love and that Florence managed to finish it without Richard."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Before we watch the movie, I thought it would be better to read the original award winning book! Children love penguins and love the idea of having such an animal as a pet. Little do they understand how the environment (niche) has to change in order for the Penguins to live.

Mr. Popper is a painter but wants to be an Antarctica explorer along side his hero Admiral Drake. Mr. Popper is shocked when in response to fan mail Admiral Drake sends him a package. In the package is a penguin. The penguin lived in an ice chest. When the penguin got sick, Mr. Popper sent a letter to Admiral Drake and Admiral Drake sent back another penguin in return. There was no more room in the ice chest so they made an ice rink in the basement. Greta and Captain Cook, for that were the penguin's names, had ten babies. Their names were: Columbus, Victoria, Magellan, Adeline, Nelson, Jenny, Scott, Isabel, Ferdinand, and Louisiana. Mr. Popper took them acts they went to theaters all over the world the last place they went was New York in New York the penguins began to act funny. Mr. Popper decided that the penguins were acting this way because of the heat. Then Admiral Drake gave the invasion to take Mr. Poppers penguins to the South Pole. On the boat when Mr. Popper was saying good bye Admiral Drake told him he was coming to. I like this book because it is full of adventure. I don't recommend this book if you do like books with lots of problems."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"My Four-Year-Old is just beginning to be interested in having chapter books read to her. But as she gets stressed out by conflict of any sort, it's kind of tough finding good candidates for her. This is a winner.For those of you who haven't read the book, the basic premise is that a house painter who spends his off-hours reading about (and writing to) explorers in the South Pole receives a penguin in the mail from one of those explorers. Since his work is over for the winter, he becomes very involved in the comfort and care of said penguin (and the eleven other penguins that quickly follow). In the end, he transforms his basement into an ice rink (an idea my daughter wholeheartedly supports, by the way), and spends more than his wife ever thought possible on fish and canned shrimp.I won't tell you how an out-of-work house painter manages to pay for all that (wouldn't want to spoil the ending), but I will say that the process is highly entertaining for all involved. I found myself looking forward to each night's installment of Mr. Popper nearly as much as The Four-Year-Old.Although I personally found the ending to be highly improbable, The Four-Year-Old saw nothing at all the matter with it--except for that little bit of unpleasantness with the policemen and firemen--and has spent many a happy evening reenacting the finale in the bathtub.And now, if you will excuse me, I need to go read Mr. Popper's Penguins to The Four-Year-Old again. I promised her I would as soon as I finished writing the review.(Excerpted from review posted on my blog: Caterpickles-Scientific & Linguistic Engagement with a 4-Year-Old Mind)"},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I read this book when I was a child, and was recently given the opportunity to review it. I will be honest, my 8 year old, gifted, Aspie son asked if he could read it.Through the whole book, I heard him laughing out loud at Mr. Popper and his day dreams, his penguins, and absolutely loving the illustrations.After he read the book, we took him to see the new movie. While he enjoyed the movie, he proudly (and loudly!) announced that the book was, \\"SOOOOOOOOOOO much better!\\" as we were leaving.In fact, he loved this book so much, that he asked us to buy him a hard copy of it, since we had downloaded it on our Kindle.Superb classic, definitely worth buying."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Mr. Popper, a painter, spends in his evenings reading about explorations to the North and South Poles. In response to a letter he sent to Admiral Drake, Drake sent Mr. Popper a penguin. What an adventure the penguin turned out to be. However, after some time, the penguin, named Captain Cook, got lonely. Mr. Popper wrote another letter to an aquarium in order to find out what might be the problem. In response, he received another penguin, which they named, Greta. That solved the problem, however, it created a new problem...Soon there were 10 little penguins. Soon, Mr. Popper, who was in need of money in order to buy food for his family, trained the penguins to perform a little show and was able to take them on the road for 10 weeks.This was such a cute story and an easy read. I really enjoyed it. I recommend that any kid wanting to watch the movie also read the book. This is sure to be a classic that will be in my children's personal library."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I learned only two major things about Mr. Popper from reading this book. First, he's a painter, and second, he really, really likes the polar regions of the world. Earlier today, when I saw a guy painting a bathroom, I almost felt like asking him if he ever dreams about visiting penguins in Antarctica. I tell you, after reading Mr. Popper's Penguins, I'll never look at painters in the same way ever again. Maybe they're all like that.The plot's super-simple and the only part that's even remotely complex is when Mr. Popper is thrown in jail. Such things happen...There's a particular scene in the chapter \\"More Troubles\\" where Mr. Popper tries to call and ask about getting a penguin license. He has some problems being understood over the telephone, and I thought the horribly persistent miscommunications were delightfully funny.I would recommend this book to any kid. It may be a bit simple for adults but there's no denying that it's good, clean fun. It possesses a rare trait in that it's truly appropriate for anyone and it doesn't try to push any agenda. You'd have to be a real stick-in-the-mud to hate or feel threatened by any part of Mr. Popper's Penguins. A perfect kid's book."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"\\"Captain Cook!\\" This book made me want to read word for word.

You have to have a lot of imagination to make this book good.This book is about 12 penguins, Mr. And Mrs. Popper and their children, Janie and Bill. They become famous by doing performances all over the world. It is kind of a long book. Sometimes the details get a little old. I would only read it again if I had to.

I now have several hundred (none alive, unfortunately) in my house, and it all started with Mr. Popper. I recall being as amused by his haplessness as I was by the plot itself, but I also enjoyed his gentleness and willingness to let absurd things happen in his life. He personified &quot;go with the floe&quot; (pun intended) and I wished I could have lived in his house.This book has it all - plot, character, wit - and I've made sure that all the children - of all ages - of my aquaintance have a copy.

Of course, to be fair, it's worth mentioning that my children are still all 6 and younger (all five of them!)When we did a thematic unit study on penguins, I came across this book in our local homeschool store, and it was a HIT! They all begged me to read \\"just one more chapter\\" every night. We went and saw the penguins in another town as a family vacation as a culmination to our study, and the main thing discussed was the book and Mr. Popper, and which penguin looked like Greta and Captain Cook from the book.My boys still dress in all black some days, so they can be penguins. So, to keep the attention of a 6 year old, 4 year old, and 3 year old (and sometimes the 19 month old) it truly IS a classic! I look forward to reading it again to them soon!

I read the book on the way to and from a SF Giant's game (Go Giants!) and was extremely disappointed. The story was dry and lacking in character development. The book zipped through events with very little detail. I honestly think that if this book were submitted to a publisher now, that it would be rejected. It's a cute idea for a book, but the writing was not what I expected for a story that was made into a movie and praised so highly by so many people."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"How would you like to have twelve penguins for pets?

By the end of the second chapter--if not sooner--my boys were completely tuned into Mr. Popper's universe. No questions about why the family traveled on trains instead of airplanes. No questions about ice delivery and ice boxes. They simply enjoyed the story (though they did want to learn more about penguins and whether they could have one as a pet, too).The grammar and language of the book have aged extremely well; you can easily forget that this book was written over 70 years ago!Highly recommended, both for children and for people who want to reconnect with their inner child."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"This charming book captivated me as a child and I was delighted to find that it has been reprinted repeatedly.

He writes a fan letter to a famous explorer, Admiral Drake, who in return ships him his very own penguin. Mr. Popper names the penguin Captain Cook and makes accommodations (like drilling air holes in his refrigerator) so he can live with them. Captain Cook seems to thrive at first, but later becomes lonely, so Admiral Drake sends Greta to keep him company. Captain Cook and Greta have ten babies and the twelve penguins are literally about to eat the Poppers out of house and home.Mr. Popper decides to train the penguins to perform and the show is a huge success. They are invited to tour the country for $5000 a week. Things go great until they get to New York and Mr. Popper and his penguins show up at the wrong theater. They end up in jail and Admiral Drake bails them out. He asks Mr. Popper to allow him to take the penguins to live in the Arctic so the explorers there won't be lonely. At the same time, a man from Hollywood offers to make stars out of the penguins and make the Poppers wealthy. Mr. Popper must decide what is best for the future of his family and his penguins.When I saw that Mr. Popper's Penguins by Richard and Florence Atwater was being released as an audio book I was really excited because this was one of my favorite books as a child. This book lasts about 2 hours and is read by Nick Sullivan. He does a marvelous job - using different voices and sound affects. I thoroughly enjoyed revisiting this childhood favorite - this classic book stands the test of time. This audio book is appropriate for the whole family and would be great to listen to on a car trip this summer."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"This book was completely silly, fun and light-hearted. Great for children and adults alike. The reader Nick Sullivan did a fantastic job making each and every character and penguin come to life in the reading. There was music and sound effects that helped with the ambiance as well. An overall great audio book experience.The story on the other hand is a bit dated and some of the penguin information is now found to be misleading. We all know that the male is the one who takes care of the egg and that there are penguins living in other place than the South Pole. If your children read this book we just need to make these things clear to them if they ask. Also, I was quite disappointed that Mr. Popper never stood up for himself and let himself get pushed around by people he didn't even know. Mr. Popper was a very kind man who never wanted to cause harm to anyone. I guess it was a lesson on turning the other cheek, but man I would have yelled at the lady on the street, she was so mean!"},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I recommend that you read Mr. Popper's Penguins by Richard and Florence Atwater.

They both enjoyed the book more than the subsequent movie."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"This is a short, fun, and completely fantastical tale for children. While the book shows its age, unsurprising given that the book was written more than seventy years ago, this book is best enjoyed if read by an adult to a child.Ignore the modern movie adaptation of the book, and you will find the story is very simple. There are none of the emotional, unresolved issues that run through every member of the family in the movie. Mr. Popper was a forgetful house painter who must have painted every house in Stillwater, sometimes many times over. When he was not working, which was the winter months, he had all the time to sit in his chair and read about the Antarctic. He even wrote to Admiral Drake, a famous explorer, and to his surprise, one day he found a rather large package arrive by express mail, with a live penguin inside. From there begins the delightful adventure and episodes of slapstick humour when Mr. Popper tries to convince a service man to drill holes in a refrigerator and put a handle inside one, or when he calls City Hall to try and find out if a license is needed to keep a penguin. In the early decades of the twentieth century, it is not that surprising that people would not have heard of penguins. The cute birds are after all found only in Antarctica.The book is a happy tale, though you do wonder sometimes just how much the penguins would have liked being outside their native home of Antarctica. But then again, you have to remind yourself that this is a seventy five year old book. Mr. Popper is a fairly uni-dimensional man, a quiet man, a good husband and a good father, and most of all, a good penguin keeper. There are no villains in this book, at least none that are downright evil or mean.The book, in my opinion, given how pervasive digital animation movies have become, may not appeal to older children. That is the reason I said at the beginning of my review that this book may be best enjoyed if read by an adult to young children.If you buy the e-book version, you also get a short biography of the author, Richard Atwater, and his wife and collaborator, Florence Atwater, along with nine photographs."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I Enjoyed reading this cute story about poppers penguins.

Shes a reader and I know she will enjoy this book very much!"},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Penguins are truly the most unique kind of animals. They're small flightless birds who eat krill and fish, spend more time in water than on land, and their fur makes them look like they're wearing a tuxedo. They are very fun creatures to learn about. In this story, one penguin will help a man and his family go from rags to riches.We are taken to the town of Stillwater, where me meet Mr. Popper and his family. Popper works as a housepainter, but he dreams of being a world traveler going to places like India, the Himalayas and the Antarctic. So the closest he can get to that is his globe and a few world magazines. He and his wife and two children, Bill and Janie, live on 432 Proudfoot Avenue, and Popper hopes that adventure will come to him. However, he'll be in for a icy cold surprise.One day, Popper gets a crate sent from an acquaintance named Admiral Drake. He opens it and finds a penguin and decides to name it Captain Cook. Already, Captain makes a messy ruckus in the Popper home, as well as scaring away a service man and getting Mr. Popper in trouble with the cops. Mr. Popper hopes to tame Captain by leashing him while going for a walk, which ends up making a scene and havoc around Stillwater. But as time goes on, a female penguin arrives in the family, and soon two penguins turn into twelve penguins. Mr. Popper starts to see them as more than just penguins, and creates a spectacular show for the eyes.This novel is truly full of charm and heart. My favorite part was when Popper took Captain for a walk around town. Kids will like the book in a heartbeat. It's one of those books that will excite you from beginning to end. Those who've seen the movie should definitely give a try on the book. \\"Mr. Popper\\" will make anyone waddle with joy in this book full of penguins and fun (A)."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"But overall, the book was a great mistake.

They get paid a lot of money in a week and that is exciting because the Popper's were poor. The penguins get into a lot of trouble. So if you like getting into trouble you should read this book.

Mr. Popper is a housepainter, but wishes he could have been a scienteist. He dreams of traveling around the world. He is most interested in the polar regions and reads as much as possible about great Polar expeditions. He receives a very unusual gift after writing a letter to Admiral Drake, an explorer at the South Pole. Everyone is astonished when the penguin, Captain Cook, arrives, but soon the family makes their new pet feel right at home. In a few weeks, the Poppers take in a second penguin from the zoo. The children and penguins enjoy teaching each other games and everything seems to be going well. However, Captain Cook and Greta soon have a family of their own and the fun really begins! Finances are getting low in the Popper household, so Mr. and Mrs. Popper decide to train the penguins to perform and take the act on the road! The audiences love the performance, but some of the other performers do not. Going to the wrong theater leads Mr. Popper and the penguins in jail. When Admiral Drake comes to the rescue, Mr. Popper is faced with a dilemma. He must decided whether to let Admiral Drake carry the penguins to the North Poleto start a race of penguins there, or to put them in movies in Hollywood. Wanting the best for the penguins, Mr. Popper decides to send them with Admiral Drake. To his surprise, he gets to go back on the great North Pole Expedition too!This is a great book! It was first printed in the late 1930s, but students will still enjoy the lively antics of the penguins today. Middle elementary grade teachers can certainly promote studies in social studies, geography, science, math, art, and language arts using this book to introduce a number of activities. A study of penghins, learning ways people and animals adapt, letter writing, geographic regions, and map studying are just a few areas to incorpate \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins.\\""},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"**spoiler alert**This was a very cute book, right up to the end. I loved that Mr. Popper ultimately tried to do what was best for the penguins, but it annoyed me somewhat that he left his family. I would have enjoyed the ending more if they had been able to choose whether or not to go, or at the very least, he had been able to discuss it with Mrs. Popper. I get that it's a children's book, but the idea of them discussing everything up to that point regarding the penguins, then having him decide in the split second between learning that Admiral Drake intended for him to go and actually setting sail seemed completely counter to how their relationship worked. I'm probably putting a lot more thought into the story than kids would, but little details like that make or break good books, and in this case, what otherwise would be a 5-star classic is, instead, somewhat wanting."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"It's all built on a single joke. If you buy the joke, (the old penguin-out-of-water story), the book is great fun. If that doesn't charm you or amuse you or at least hold your interest, then the book can be heavy going. (Just like Jim Carrey movies, as it turns out.) It has some strange sour moments, (family money troubles and the like), and is in the \\"dad's nutsy obsession\\" tradition, which can be fun or not depending on your mood and your inclination.But, that all said, it is well written, it zips along, and it has a certain goofy charm. Certainly a nice addition, and a still-accessible old fashioned volume, to have on the family shelf."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I bought this book for my 6 year old daughter.

Simply charming!"},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I loved Mr. Popper's Penguins as a child, so I was delighted to see a new edition come out as an ebook. The digital version contains the same wording and story as the original, but it also includes a biography of the authors and rare photos from the authors' estate.This is a children's tale of a man who lives an absolutely ordinary life with an absolutely ordinary family, until the day a strange package arrives on his doorstep. When the man opens the crate, out pops a penguin. That penguin becomes the newest member of the family, along with a flock of penguins soon to follow. Mr. Popper and his penguins become the talk of the town, and later the nation, as they perform circus acts to the joy of all. I loved this story as a child, and it was just as charming twenty years later.The illustrations are delightful, and they're some of the best I've seen on the Kindle. They give life to the story and breathe personality into the characters.My favorite part of this ebook edition was the brief biography of the authors.

It was more of an experiment to see how well she stayed with a story if we read a chapter each night.I won't rehash the story, but instead focus on the book's format. With about 20 chapters and 135 pages, each night consisted of about six to seven pages of reading, but since the book was small, the text amply spaced and each chapter contained a small picture or two, it amounted to about ten minutes or less of me reading to her. So, reading a chapter a night was easily managed, permitting a \\"quick\\" bedtime, Q.T. with my daughter and an introduction to longer text stories for her. (Note: she is able to read picture books [i.e. Little Bear, Dr. Suess, etc.] on her own without issue.)In addition to all that, \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" is a good story that is well told, concise and able to give many an adult book a run for its entertaining money."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"My book was about a man who was named Mr. Popper. He was a house painter. He had two children named Janie and Bill. He and his family lived at 432 Proudfoot Avenue. He likes to read books about the Arctic, Antarctica, North Pole, and South Pole. Whenever there was a book in the library about these areas he was the first one to borrow the books.He has always wanted to travel to the arctics. He loved to read about the messages of Admiral Drake that were in the library books. Then, one day the postman came and rang the bell. Finally, some one came and the post man asked,\\" Do the Popper's live here?\\" They answered yes. You have a package. The package was from Antarctica. It had a penguin in it. Mr. Popper named the penguin Captain Cook.Then one day, Captain Cook got sick. He got sick because he needed a friend. He was homesick for all his brothers and sisters. Mr. Popper called Antarctica and asked for them to send them another penguin.One day, another penguin arrived. The Poppers named the penguin Greta. The Poppers wrote the penguins names on the their backs because the penguins looked alike. The Poppers painted the names of the penguins with white paint. The Poppers could tell them apart. Finally, Captain Cook was happy again.I would tell people about this book if they liked animals, if they have pets, and if they enjoy being cold and in the snow. People who like to read things that are funny and people who have a big imagination would like this book. The fourth, fifth, and sixth graders would love it.

It was only because the book wasn't good. I had to agree that the book is dull, boring, and the plot just isn't written well. I know this is fiction and all, I LOVE fiction and fantasy, but this just didn't make any sense. The idea was good, but it was just written out of order, cluttered, and dull.

A modest housepainter and decorator, Mr. Popper has an armchair passion: anything and everything to do with the North and South poles. He has even written to the famous explorer, Admiral Drake. To his delighted amazement thegenerous scientist sends him a real live penguin as a surprise gift! Popper is thrilled, of course, but the family and the house must make considerable adjustments to accomodate the tastes and talents of a pro-social but inquisitive bird.Always dressed in his tuxedo best, the newcomer is named Captain Cook and causes quite a sensation in the quiet town.Enahanced by the illlustrations of Robert Lawson (Make Way for Ducklings) this silly story is a cute book for young readers. Prices and vocabulary seem quaint by today's standards, but kids will enjoy the comical struggle of human-penguin relations. Despite the credit craze of the 30's, the Poppers worry about the terrible expense of extra refrigeration, imported fish and a basement ice rink. But how can a dozen delightful penguins help with their own room and board? This tale remains a fun read froma simpler time."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Unfortunately, when the books arrived, a couple were not in the best of shape.

The author's of the book are Richard and Flourence Atwater. Illustrator Robert Lawson and Publisher Brown Little & Co. The Atwater's have also written five other award winning books. Mr. Popper's Penguins in an unusual but funny book that I would recommend to anyone.Mr. Popper's starts off with him reading his monthly South Pole magazine, and decides to write to one of the people studying the South Pole. When the explorer writes back he sends a package. This package is no ordinary package though. The main point of the story is about a guy named Mr. Popper's who trains his band of penguins to star in Vaudeville Tour.Mr. Popper's is a house painter that comes up with some crazy designs. But his real interest is in the South Pole and all the animals on it. Captain Cook is basically the main character. He is the head of all the penguins but is not that bright. All the rest of Mr. Popper's Penguins are like couples. They just walk in a little line down the street next to each other. So my opinion is that the characters are perfect for this kind of story.The different settings in this book are very creative. The magazine that Mr. Popper got was very detailed. The South Pole kind of looked kind of like the Hawaii version of the South Pole. The houses on the block looked realistic. This is won fiction fantasy book you might want to get.Mr. Popper's Penguins is far most the best fiction fantasy book ever. Thecharacters, the setting and the story lines were great. It is an unbelievably funny book for all ages. Newberry Honor agrees it is a masterpiece.

And when they are as adorable as Mr.Popper's penguins with wonderful names to boot, that is just perfect. This book is exactly that - a perfect little book that is great to read-aloud, great for any age (I loved it) and a perfect size (not too long and not too short) - with illustrations that catch your eye, penguins that pop out of the pages, and the most endearing characters (human and animal).Mr.Popper is a house painter who has lived all his life in Stillwater. When he is not painting (and many a time, when he is painting too), he spends his time daydreaming about travelling to far-off places. He loves reading about them as well and watching any movies he can - his favorite destination are the two Poles of the earth. One winter day, he receives an unexpected gift from Admiral Drake, an explorer - a penguin - and this penguin that he names Captain Cook - changes Mr. Popper and his family's life. Soon, a lonely girl penguin arrives courtesy of the aquarium and this is followed by the arrival of ten baby penguins.How these dozen penguins and the Popper family interact and act forms the rest of this book.

He especially dreams of the Arctic poles. One day, he receives a package from the famous Admiral Drake, a penguin from the Antarctic, and the fun begins.It is fun to see Mr. Popper's passion for his penguins shine through the book - it becomes contagious to his family around him as well. There are also many funny, silly scenes with the penguins that are sure to make kids reading this laugh out loud.The illustrations are also nice, black and white drawings every chapter or so, and can be a good break for kids. They certainly add to the vividness and sometimes even the humour of the book.This is an interesting book because it is simple and entertaining, but also has a good vocabulary. Though it would probably appeal to early chapter book types or reluctant readers, there are words that will also challenge them.

A great family book."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I've lived 26 years on this earth. In those 26 years I've learned a lot about children's books. I've learned which ones are considered the holiest of holies and which are to be condemned and spat upon. So I was completely taken aback when I learned that there was a 1938 children's book that absolutely no one had ever told me to read before. \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" was a delight to discover. Suddenly I was privy to reading a charming story of a man and his penguins, and I had never even heard a peep about this tale from anyone. What gives? Why isn't \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" as well-known and well-read as \\"Cheaper by the Dozen\\" or \\"Stuart Little\\"? There is no answer to this question. There is only this wonderful book, well-illustrated and magnificently written for the younger set.Mr. Popper is a house painter, and mostly a good one. True, he does sometimes fall into fits of fancy, dreaming about the Arctic explorers and the ice floes to the North and South. His wife and children don't necessarily understand his dreams, but that doesn't sway Mr. Popper. One day, out of the blue, he receives word that one of the great explorers he wrote, Admiral Drake, read his letter and is sending him a present. As any child who remembers the title of the book might guess, a penguin comes hopping out of a newly delivered crate the next day. Mr. Popper is charmed by the little guest, and names him Captain Cook. Cook is a curious beasty, and the Poppers do everything from outfitting their refrigerator to taking Captain Cook for walks. When the penguin falls into a deep depression it is only the delivery of a second penguin from the zoo, Gerta, that cheers him up. Soon the penguin pair lay some eggs and the Popper household is privy to ten more lovely jumpy penguins. With money hard to come by it takes a clever Mr. Popper to come up with a way to make his penguins not only profitable, but stars.First of all, make certain that if you are reading a version of this story that you have grabbed one that has Robert Lawson's beautiful illustrations. The same illustrator that's responsible for the lovable picture book, \\"Ferdinand the Bull\\" has switched his focus from beef to fowl. These penguins are remarkably well drawn, from their inquisitive little eys to their ugly webbed feet. If you've never seen a Lawson illustration, here would be a good place to start. The writing of Richard and Florence Atwater is extremely readable for anyone of any age. The phrase, \\"they just don't make \`em like that anymore\\" is unfair, but also kind of true. There's something to the simplicity of this book that you just can't find anywhere else. It is, all in all, just fantastic. And with Lawson's adept renderings of all the characters and situations, you are left in no doubt that this is one of the best books of this or any other age.So a great wrong has been righted. I am no longer in the dark regarding \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\". If you'd like to introduce your kids (or, heaven forfend, yourself) to a fantastic piece of penguin rookery, grab yourself a copy of this l'il number. It's bound to make you a fan."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"My daughter recently brought this book home, and after reading only one page, I went and bought my own copy! I had to have this for my classroom!I teach children with mild to moderate specific learning disabilities who need to regularly experience success in reading if they are ever going to become lifelong readers. What better way to foster desired literacy behaviors than using this delightful tale of an absentminded housepainter, his tidy, yet serious wife, their two children, and 12 performing penguins!After reading this book, I thought that it would be ideal to use as the focus of a thematic unit on penguins. Believe it or not, there are many themes in the book that lend themselves to serious classroom discussion. For example, Mr. Popper daydreams of far-away places. There is the theme of daydreaming, why people daydream, as well as the theme of travel. Students could be asked to journal about their daydreams, as well as their hopes and dreams of visiting faraway places, which leads into a study of the geography and culture of other people.In my 6th grade language arts class, I plan on focusing on the 17 different types of penguins there are, where they are found, some of their habits, as well as studying about polar exploration.

One day, Mr. Popper receives a surprise in the mail from Admiral Drake, the famous Antarctic explorer. Inside the box there was an Antarctic penguin. Mr. Popper was so thrilled to have a penguin as a pet. From that point, the Popper family's life is completely changed.Mr. Popper named the penguin Captain Cook. Captain Coook caused a series off confusing, scary, and exciting events in the town of Stillwater, but eventually it was adopted and adored by all the neighbors. The Poppers have to make many changes and sacrifices to care for Captian Cook. However, they enjoy the fun, the adventure, and the happiness with the penguin. Subsequently, the Poppers inherit a female penguin named Greta from an aquarium in Mammath City. Together Captain Cook and Greta have ten more peguin chicks.Mr. and Mrs. Popper came up with a spendid idea. They wanted to train the talented penguins to perform on stage. The performance was a success and became famous across the country. THe Poppers had a chance to travel from east to west during the penguins' ten-week performance and to earn enough money to pay back all the expenses for supporting the penguins. After ten weeks of performance, Mr. Popper is faced with a very important decision for the twelve penguins' future. He can either take the penguins to Hollywoood to make a lot of money or send them to the North Pole to keep the lonely explorers company.This book is very well written.

This is good 1930's innocent humor which is so refreshing in this day and age."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"I have read this book five times now with 3rd graders. For some reason, I always dread rereading it. But then, during the story, I get back into it. Some stories are like that I guess. Some are Re-readers and some are not.A few things I somehow forget between readings I would like to write here and hopefully remember for next time:1. Mr and Mrs. Popper live in Stillwater! They also visit Minneapolis. A study of major cities and states would not be entirely out of place paired with this book. The penguins visit Boston, Chicago, Milwaukee and New York. I asked the students what states these cities were in as we read, and I did not get a lot of correct guesses.2. The book is filled with fabulous alliteration! Making note of this early on gets the kids looking for it as we read and cements the concept for them. Popper's Performing Penguins3. This time through, I paused when the penguins made noises: \\"gook!\\" and \\"ork!\\" were some of the more common ones. On cue, the students would make the sounds. It really kept them on track following along, and they seemed to really enjoy attempting the sounds in various intonations. (How does a penguin ask a question said as \\"ork?\\" versus making an exclamation of \\"ork!\\")4. A few years ago, I attempted to read the entire book as though it were \\"Mr. W's Penguins.\\" Each time it read the word Popper, I substituted my last name. Well, I ended up forgetting fairly regularly, and the kids were more concerned with reminding me than with comprehending the story. I guess they were paying attention at least.A great book for book club; not a lot of deep, high level themes to pore over. A good 3rd grade starter book, perhaps."},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"Get this book! It is one of the greatest books I have read!

The penguins get into hilarious scenarios where they do something bad and messes everything up. This book was surely a page-turner. It was very entertaining with its style of humor, and the whole idea of penguins. The plot may seem out of whack sometimes, but the penguins living conditions are explained.

First published during the Great Depression, \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins\\" hasn't lost a bit of its sparkle in almost 80 years.Mr. Popper, a house painter, lives in Stillwater (no state indicated, but it snows) with Mrs. Popper, a loving wife but an exacting housekeeper, and their children, Janie and Bill. He works during the summer decorating season and spends his winters dreaming of polar expeditions. Mr. Popper settles in to the first evening of his long winter vacation while Mrs. Popper frets about what to feed her family while Mr. Popper is not working. He turns on the radio to listen to a broadcast from the latest travels of Admiral Drake, a famous polar explorer. The Admiral, responding to a fan letter from Mr. Popper, greets Mr. Popper personally and tells him to watch for a surprise. The next morning, while Mrs. Popper is out at a meeting of the Ladies Aid and Missionary Society, the surprise arrives--an Antarctic penguin, whom Mr. Popper names Captain Cook. Soon a female companion penguin, Greta, arrives, and then ten little penguins who Mr. Popper names for for historic explorers and their patrons.As soon as Captain Cook arrives, he wreaks all sorts of hilarious havoc. It's worth reading the whole book just for Chapter VI, in which Mr. Popper attempts to determine whether he needs a license for his new pet. By the time they have twelve penguins, the Poppers face real worries about how they are going to pay for all the canned shrimp the penguins eat and the cost of installing a freezer plant in the basement so the penguins can live comfortably. This being America, show business proves to be the way out of the Poppers' troubles, and the penguins take their antics on the vaudeville stage from coast to coast. The droll humor of this utterly absurd tale comes not from slapstick or vulgarity, but from the authors' deadpan-serious telling.Based on the Wikipedia plot summary of the 2011 movie, it sounds like the only similarities between the film and the book are (a) a character named Mr. Popper and (b) the presence of some penguins. Frankly the movie sounds like a travesty. If you have seen the movie and think the book must be no good, please do yourself a favor and think again. I can't imagine anyone NOT being delighted by Florence and Richard Atwater's \\"Mr. Popper's Penguins.\\""},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"It makes me want to laugh out loudAnd Mr. Popper is so halarius!!I will read it 10000 more times!!!"},{"Title":"Mr. Popper's Penguins (Newbery Award Series/Cassette)","review":"My 8 year old loves this book!

Every page must be read thoroughly, because each page is packed with vital information that you don't want to miss. There seems to be no filler... just good information. The tutorials are well written and complete. They show common pitfalls to avoid, and sometimes show you more than one way to do things, and the benefits of each way. I found the book &quot;most&quot; useful in it's explanations and tutorials for going between Illustrator and Photoshop. A good chunk of the book is devoted to this. These chapters, plus a couple others also require you to use Photoshop. So if you don't own Photoshop, this book may be a disappointment. The book covers many features of Illustrator, but not nearly all of them. Such a book would be 5 times as thick and expensive. But what it does cover is very well done. I am a much better Illustrator user after reading this book."},{"Title":"Illustrator 8 f/x and design: Add Rich, Versatile Enhancements to Your Artwork!","review":"First of all, the book is not 900 pages as listed above. It is 490 pages. But those 490 pages offer a wealth of information and technique.I had just finished Illustrator 8 Classroom In A Book (still the absolute BEST book for beginners).I wanted to improve my output by a few notches, but I was getting very frustrated finded a book that would help me to reach that next level.I needed a book that was somewhere between the basic lessons of &quot;Classroom in a Book&quot; and the &quot;draw an image and scan it into Illustrator&quot; lessons found in &quot;The Illustrator 8 WOW Book&quot; (which pretty much made that book useless for me).Well, if that sounds familiar, then you need this book. It adopts the format of the classroom in a book series by giving you projects to complete in a step by step format. These are definitely not your beginner lessons, though. The output from these lessons could build your portfolio.It labels itself a book for intermediate to advanced users, but don't let that frighten you. The authors were thoughtful enough to still include the shortcut keystrokes after each command.Another great feature of this book is that it includes chapters on PhotoShop, and the pros and cons of working with each software package, as well as when you should use one over the other.The lessons are in black and white, but there is a full color gallery that shows all of the project images in finished form.There are a few typos, and a few commands that just don't work, but anyone with a basic knowledge of Illustrator should have no problem working around them.I really can't say enough about this book. It was just what I needed to elevate my knowledge and skill to a higher level, while leading me step by step through the process.I wouldn't hesitate to purchase any other books by these authors."},{"Title":"Illustrator 8 f/x and design: Add Rich, Versatile Enhancements to Your Artwork!","review":"I don't know what these other people are reading, but it sure isn't this book. The wording in this book contains a lot of mistakes and if you don't have intermediate skills in the program, you will have a hard time understanding it. Secondly, some of the examples are very cheezy. I was expecting some really cool stuff, but that's not what I found. They're just intermediate how to's that don't impress me. Maybe I was looking for something different and bought the wrong book. I only bought this book because of the other reviews. Shouldn't have trusted them. Finally, the disc in my book is missing the entire chapter 3 samples. I can't do any of the tutorials. Someone needs to teach these people more coherent writing skills."},{"Title":"Illustrator 8 f/x and design: Add Rich, Versatile Enhancements to Your Artwork!","review":"Overall this is a good book but the title is misleading. It assumes that you are working with Photoshop and Illustrator. Most the examples given rely on the use of Photoshop at some point in the process. Some examples rely almost entirely on Photoshop. I currently do not own Photoshop so when I received this book I was rather dissappointed. It really did not help me learn much about Illustrator. I also bought the Illustrator 8 Bible and thought that it was a much better book."},{"Title":"Illustrator 8 f/x and design: Add Rich, Versatile Enhancements to Your Artwork!","review":"I haven't finished the whole book...but it is well written.

It's fluff and \\"feel good\\" material (\\"you're only as intelligent as you are effective! that's all that matters!\\") and should be avoided by a person who's serious about improving their brain."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Improving Your IQ","review":"&quot;Idiots Guide to Improving your IQ&quot; from Alpha Books is misleading, deceptive, and useless at best in improving your IQ. For example, the author begins by manipulating throughout the whole book the definition of IQ into EQ (&quot;Effective Intelligence&quot;), making the title very misleading. By doing this, the content is nothing about improving your intellectuality, but rather your effectiveness. Also, the author's twisted view of IQ thus leads his motives of improving your intelligence into improving your efficiency. Moreover, this book is very deceptive. Instead of explaining intelligence, it goes into the anatomy of the brain and the body. This is incredibly boring, and has nothing to do with improving your intellectuality. Furthermore, this book is useless in improving your IQ. Since it focuses RARELY about intellectuality, and only efficiency, strategies, and anatomy, the reader never improves his or hers IQ. This book would be better titled, &quot;Efficiency in the Workplace,&quot; or, &quot;300 Pages of 'Nothing That Will Improve Your IQ'.&quot; In summary, this book is misleading, deceptive, and useless at improving your IQ. There are a few (VERY, VERY FEW), good points. It talks a little about how to sit for a positive &quot;aura,&quot; and negative/positive communication. Nothing about intelligence, but that's still interesting. Those were the only chapters though that's a little entertaining, but even those chapters were written in simple sentences, and explained as though one was in the first grade. I would recommend this book for people looking for a book titled &quot;Idiots Guide to Effective Work.&quot; Don't buy this if you're looking to improve your IQ, try a puzzle book, but PLEASE don't make the same mistake I did."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Improving Your IQ","review":"It's hard to choose where to begin my praise of this wonderful book... I suppose I'll address the other reviewers compaints first. The book openly states in the first couple of chapters that IQ really is an absurd statistic... the tests were originally designed to determine if a person was mentally handicapped, not to determine how intelligent they were. Besides, if a person walks into a flaming building to take an IQ test, they will obviously score higher than the person who doesn't. However, who would you consider more intelligent?This book is not about raising an outdated and flawed statistic about how intelligent you are. It's about making you a more intelligent person.The book addresses the facets of intelligence that many books on the subject utterly neglect. For instance, mood - how well can one intelligently act when they're depressed, sad, and otherwise run-down? Not very well at all, obviously. But I have never seen this simple yet extremely important factor mentioned in any other book.Now, some other people have been complaining about the book being confusing, or about the brain, which they don't care about. Well,you will NEVER find a book as simply, eloquently, and effectivly written on the subject of neuroscience, neuropsychology, and abstract mental concepts such as intelligence. I was amazed at the simplicity with which the author could convey concepts that other books rambled on and on about for several pages; often these horrendously complex concepts were simply explained in a single paragraph. Not only does this allow virtually everyone to access this book, but it allows this author to fill it with more information than half a dozen other books have on intelligence. Also, this is one of the very few books that clearly explains the connection between intelligence and the brain, which everyone needs to understand to truly improve their intelligence to any significant degree.Is this a book that gives you abstract little word puzzles and mind twisters to allow you to get a higher number on the next IQ test you take? No. This is a book to fundamentally change the way you live, to give you the information you need to be happy, active, wonderfully productive, intelligent, and an awesome example of human potential. In my honest opinion, everybody should have been taught this information in school.The author also doesn't just tell you about these amazing concepts, he has managed to find simple, easy to do exercises that allow you to actually apply every important concept that is presented - and these exercises aren't dry, boring, nor tedious; they're fun, and most of them can be done simply by changing one of the things you do in your daily life. These are the most effective intelligence increasing exercises I've ever seen.Would you rather have a three digit number to tell you how intelligent you are, or a life filled with wonderful achievements to trumpet your intelligence?"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Improving Your IQ","review":"As said in prior reviews, this is not a book filled with puzzles and logic problems. It is not truly a book on how to improve your IQ, as the title implies. It is instead a book on how to be effective with the intelligence that you possess, and how to put it to use.It had a very large section on how the brain reacts and interprets data from the different senses. Very technical. This I was uninterested in. Just give me the bottom line on that, please. I made myself read these chapters just in case the info was needed in the following chapters, but really, a brief skimming would have been sufficient.To sum up the book, to be effective in gaining practical intelligence, you must set goals and work for them without getting sidetracked. It basically encourages you map out what your goals are and what you need to do to accomplish them, then to use all your senses to reach these goals. It tells you how having an emotional link to what you are trying to accomplish is critical.The most interesting part of the book was how your mind fills in information based on past experiences and how you can reprogram your mind to associate positive feelings to things you may have had an aversion to from those past experiences. The discussion around how the mind tries to make things flow smoothly and fill in gaps was also interesting.All in all, it was OK. Like I said, not what I expected, but I did take some useful things away from it."},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Improving Your IQ","review":"Richard G. Pellegrino is an expert in the field of human intelligence and he has produced a well written, scholarly work which undoubtedly achieves its aim of improving IQ. I sold my copy to Russell Crowe for $45 more than I paid for it, and the 'actor' read it in two hours. The title, that is. A year later, after he'd finished the actual book, Crowe called me and said excitedly, &quot;Schwarz, it works! At first I thought this was a great book but by the final page I was smart enough to see that it's the worstest thing what has ever been wrote.&quot;I sat back in my chair, lit a cigar with the $50 note Crowe had paid me for my unread copy, and said, &quot;Russ, you're a genius.&quot;&quot;A what?

I didn't buy it because it didn't offer me any information I didn't already know. I disagree with many of the posters who recommend mind teaser puzzles etc, because they are a big waste of mental energy and they don't really improve your IQ either, they may help you develop a different way of looking at things but so does this book and furthermore isn't being effective intellectually like a precursor to improving your IQ? I would say that being able to use fewer words to communicate an idea effectively is a sign of effective intelligence. What I've learned in my efforts to improve my IQ was one major thing and that it takes a good bit of effort and the willingness to LEARN to improve it. Unless you've worked mind teaser puzzles for a good many years you are not going to pick up one of the books and suddenly start solving them.

It's sense of the line is nearly nonexistent, and the story seems to have been recycled from two previous books (there are references made to her own earlier work in Plainwater and Men in the Off Hours, which I find tacky and a little self-obsessed.)

Is Anne Carson going to wind up being a fluke we all once believed in? What's with these last two books?"},{"Title":"The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos","review":"Anne Carson has written a beautiful book of poems/tangoes that somehow tell the story of a marriage without actually telling a story. We have fully realized moments, conversations (Carson writes amazing poetic conversations, here and in her other works), events -- without all the connections in between. And yet these moments are woven together, internally and from one tango to the next, with language used as the steps of a dance, providing motifs and figures that carry the reader from one page to the next. Dance, games, rules, war, the rules of war, love, beauty, truth, lies and betrayal -- all of these themes run in and out of the complicated pattern of steps. The technique always serves the lyric, however, and we never lose sight of the feelings Carson wishes to evoke. You feel the separate pains of each betrayal (her betrayal of her mother, the not-yet-husband's failure to appear for their wedding, his first infidelity, each subsequent lie), but despite the pain there is no bitterness in this book -- in fact, Carson's final advice is to &quot;hold beauty.&quot; Just as you cannot tell the tale of the lover without telling the tale of the beloved (as the final poem ironically suggests), so, perhaps, you cannot have love, beauty and truth without their opposites. Carson, plainly, is on the side of beauty."},{"Title":"The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos","review":"I disagree with the naysayers.....I just heard Ms. Carson read some of these poems and they are powerful and emotional. These poems are very different from GLASS, IRONY AND GOD or AUTOBIOGRAPHY IN RED but she is just increasing her range. I am amazed at how wide she is able to cast her net, her economy of language, her wide range of references in history, literature, the classics, pop culture. I think when you see her read (and I think her poetry is still great if one doesn't hear her read) her wry humour really clicks....it is amazing how much emotion she is able to convey through her wit....I think she is one of the most unique and refreshing voices in literature today. She is a very exciting poet."},{"Title":"The Beauty of the Husband: A Fictional Essay in 29 Tangos","review":"The storyteller in the The Beauty of the Husband is a woman who may or may not be Anne Carson, recollecting a failing marriage with a beating mind. Like other great stylists - Proust for example, her form of telling a story is peerless. Because after you have grasped the story why go back except to relish in style? As Godard has pointed out, \\"what is art except that by which forms become style.\\" Perhaps Carson herself has written the best synopsis to her book,what is the nature of the dance called memory: Proust used to weep over days gone by,do you?So put on Piazzolla, read this book and answer for yourself what a lover wants from the beloved.

Although Anne Carson was continuing her interesting use of language and her use of Keats quotations was brilliant, the volume lacked universality. It presented a courtship and marriage every dependent upon the particular individuals and their peculiarities. The courtship and marriage of individuals unknown to the reader has limited interest.Fortunately, through the remainder of the book, Anne Carson finally finds her voice for this book. It becomes an interesting exploration of beauty especially beauty in the context of marriage. In one brilliant chapter she gives quotations of elegiac couplets recording the view of a branch through her back kitchen window. After a sampling of seasons, she closes with &quot;Well I won't bore you with the whole annal. Point is, in total so far, 5820 elegiacs/ Which occupy 53 wirebound notebooks, / Piled on four shelves in the back kitchen. . .&quot; She succeeds in painting a picture of a year's psychological response in a truly innovative manner.Any author continually expanding their repetoire will make some missteps. This volume includes some of Anne Carson's missteps but it also includes some exciting innovation. Read and enjoy but don't expect perfection."},{"Title":"The story of Judaism (Schocken paperbacks)","review":"I took a University class were The Story of Judaism, third,augmented edtion, by Bernard J.

Well, it has to be said that this doesn't quite match the perversity of the first book. The main characters are still there: Mistress Shirer (the black dominatrix who runs the Institute) and JK her cross-dressing maid, but I missed some of the other chracters from the first book.Still, it rates very highly compared to most SM writing. I would definitely recommend the book, as I would all of Maria del Rey's book. I just hope that there's a third book soon - the Institute deserves to live on!"},{"Title":"Sisterhood of the Institute (Nexus Classics)","review":"Femenism, anti-femenism, new-femenism, gender roles, this book doesn't just address them, it jumps right into the middle and has a field day.

I know that I'll be able to spot them easier and may even experience fewer break-ins because I'm using better security.The part I like most about this book is that it helps you learn how to block crackers in the first place, detect when and if they do break in, and do something once you detect them.

The plot is potentially interesting, although the few characters that are given more than a stereotypical introduction have not featured greatly so far. My biggest criticism though is that the author's, reasonably frequent, poor choice of words or phrases. This gives the impression that he is relying on a Thesaurus rather than an innate understanding or appreciation of the language. The opening paragraphs seemed cliched, and almost put me off before the book had had a chance to get going. Later in the text, the author has a tendency to misuse words in a way that, for me, immediately breaks the flow of the narrative. An example would be the paragraph \\"But the mutation in batch C73 had decimated the sample killing everything\\". Of the many words the author could have picked for that sentence, it seems a shame he picked \\"decimated\\"; a word with an interesting history and etymology, to describe killing one in every ten, but certainly not meaning to annihilate."},{"Title":"Absolute Zero","review":"The writing did not grab, captivate or entice me to continue this story.

I also found the renaming of Fidel Castro distracting. Not withstanding these criticisms, the action was non-stop and well researched."},{"Title":"Absolute Zero","review":"Overall, I liked the book. I rarely write reviews, instead clicking the LIKE button when I like one, but I felt moved to write something about Absolute Zero.My first impression was that the author took the advice propounded in so many \\"how to write a book\\" books that stress using words to describe the color and texture and scents the scene being described. The O'Malley and Cuban themes, as I started thinking of the various threads/POVs, were overly florid. The Davis theme was more spare, concise, and to me a more enjoyable to read. Some judicious editing would improve the readability of the overly verbacious sections.I haven't seen the print version of this book, but some editing is needed in the Kindle edition. A reliance on spell-check resulted in some errors, such as \\"in Cubation\\" instead of \\"incubation\\" where the spell check was likely told to look for all instances of \\"cuba\\" and change them to \\"Cuba\\". There is also a problem with missing quotation marks, especially the use of quote marks at the beginning of paragraphs that are continuations of someone's speech. The lack of open-quote marks and the loquaciousness of some of the characters had me turning back and forth to see if this was someone still speaking or was part of the narrative. Usually there was an end-quote at the end of the final paragraph, but not always. There were quite a few missing commas, too, as well as misplaced ones.All that being said, the book portrays a compelling and chilling WMD scenario written several years before 9/11. The drawbacks of the writing/editing didn't keep me from reading to find out how the various threads would come together."},{"Title":"Absolute Zero","review":"To right up there with Clancy or Patterson, best I have read in a long time.

The bulk of the book covers Rommel's time in Africa, from February 1941 to March 1943.The book does not appear to be based on any original research, drawing heavily on excerpts from previously published works. The writing is well done, although there are several misstatements and typos. (In this regard, there is one major gaffe, that of the supposed statement by the driver of the car that carried Rommel to his death. This driver claimed in a book by David Irving that Rommel was sobbing as he died. This statement is simply untrue. Rommel, a Field Marshal, did not die in the vicinity of the driver (a lowly SS sergeant with his own axe to grind against Rommel as a perceived traitor to the cause), who left the vehicle and was not allowed to return for ten minutes, long after Rommel was dead. The only person present when Rommel died was General Wilhelm Burgdorf, who stayed in the car with Rommel and stated Rommel died quickly. [Ironically, Burgdorf was so impressed by the quick death achieved by Rommel that when Burgdorf took his own life in the Fuehrer bunker in April 1945 he used the same dose of poison.] Interestingly, Rommel took his Field Marshal's baton with him when he died and it was not willingly returned after his death. Instead, his aide, Captain Aldinger, had to make repeated requests that it be returned to the family, along with the Field Marshal's cap taken off of him after the died and delivered by Burgdorf with the baton to the Fuehrer's headquarters.)Despite these few errors, overall the text is generally laudatory of Rommel and his story is presented in a fairly balanced way, pointing out his weaknesses as well as his many strengths.There are a wide variety of well-selected photos included. In fact, more space is devoted to photos (about 60%) than to text.Several of the photos are, however, misidentified. For example, a photo shown on the back cover and included in the book implies that it was taken after Hitler relieved Rommel of command of the troops in North Africa in March 1943. It is, however, actually a photo taken two years earlier in March 1941 after Hitler presented Rommel with the Oakleaves to his Knights Cross. In addition, another photo suggests that it is of Rommel and Hitler inspecting the Atlantic defenses in 1943-1944 but Rommel is not even wearing the Knights Cross (awarded to him in May 1941) and I do not recall Hitler ever inspecting the so-called Atlantic Wall. And, in fact, this is a photo of Hitler and Rommel outside of Warsaw in 1939. (In addition, there is a photo of Rommel's headstone that has either been doctored or the original headstone altered or replaced. My recollection is that Rommel's original headstone had on the top a large reproduction of the new Iron Cross commissioned for the Second World War, with the year 1939 on the bottom and the Nazi swastika emblazoned in the center, both of these markings are missing from headstone pictured in this book and no explanation is provided.)"},{"Title":"Rommel in North Africa","review":"This book gives has many pictures, pictures of Rommel talking with his men, pictures of Rommel in Tobruk, pictures of his men, and some of the enemy. Some photos are even taken by the Fox himself. But where this book have lots of pics, it lacs words. I mean, you won't get so much written information from this book, that you would get from some other books about Rommel. No new information is given here. However, the photos, all in good quality, makes this book a must-have for Rommel-fans."},{"Title":"Rommel in North Africa","review":"Field Marshal Erwin Rommel of the German Wehrmacht is truly a unique figure from world war II. Described among the allies as a brave and skilled commander, he is really the only one in the Axis countries to be admired by their opponents. While some of this is the natural hype of war, most of it was earned. Although he made many mistakes by being stubborn, there were many good sides to his leadership. Virtually alone among the leaders of all sides, he took great personal risks on the battlefield. The stories about his visiting German patients in an English hospital are hard to believe but are most likely true. His reputation for chivalrous conduct is impeccable, where even Jewish prisoners were considered as captured soldiers, who were treated very well by his troops. Rommel also grew to oppose Hitler both directly and indirectly, a strategy that led to his death at his own hand. Unlike others who chose to spare themselves at all cost, he knew of the forthcoming attempt on Hitler's life and yet he did not betray his comrades.As the title suggests, this book is almost totally devoted to his actions in North Africa. Containing many pictures, some of which he personally took, this book captures the essence of what that war was like. Fought on land that was otherwise worthless, there were no civilians or other infrastructure to get in the way. Men and machines fought it out in a giant war of movement, all undergoing enormous deprivation as finally the Axis side was ground into the acrid dust.While Lande is clearly an admirer of Rommel, his flaws are also clearly described. Often ignoring the need for supplies and attacking when he could not succeed, Rommel proved to be all too human in possessing too much confidence in his ability to win a battle with inferior resources.Over a half-century has elapsed since Rommel was forced to commit suicide over his opposition to Hitler and his suicidal war. As the historical record continues to open up, his standing has not diminished, but continues to increase. In my mind, if he had been given the resources, he would have conquered all of Egypt, Palestine and the rest of the middle East. Had the bomb been a little more effective, he would have probably been the head of the German state after Hitler, a scenario that begs for someone to write an alternate history."},{"Title":"Rommel in North Africa","review":"I was very impressed with this book. It gives a good overview of Rommel's efforts with the Afrika Korps and the photos were really good. I saw a lot of pix I hadn't seen in other books, including some apparently taken by the Desert Fox himself. All around good book. A very easy read."},{"Title":"XML Elements of Style","review":"This is really a good book but it is not a primary reference for XML, nor would you want to learn from scratch here. For these functions I recommend Professional XML by Anderson et.al. (currently mis-identified by Amazon as by Boumphrey et.al). The strength of this book is that St. Laurent really knows why things are the way they are in XML and how to use it effectively. He writes clearly and gives real good advice and insights. The examples are excellent, but it would have been nice to have more of them. I read this book cover-to-cover and enjoyed it."},{"Title":"XML Elements of Style","review":"We used this book as the basis for a quick class on XML here at work. Of all the XML books we have reviewed for this class this book follow the XML 3W commettes standard 1.0 the closest of any of them.It is clear and consise with good examples given through out. It does a good job pointing up problems with non validating parseing tools too."},{"Title":"Germany's high sea fleet in the world war,","review":"This book is no more than an apology to the German people for putting a country at war, then losing it, then setting the seeds to build a new navy and start another war.If you enjoy war history, take a pass as 80% of the book is what's described above."},{"Title":"Introduction to Criminal Justice (with CD-ROM and InfoTrac)","review":"Used this for my criminal justice class.

For instance, children tease each other by singing something like \\"Johnny has a girlfriend\\" on so-so-mi-la-so-mi.Although none of the writers on stylized spoken intonation attempt to identify the musical pitches which they refer to, a reader with musical training might be able to identify those pitches. [...] and see if you agree that the four pitches of American stylized spoken intonation are do, mi, so, and la."},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"The president and the vice president of the United States knew what they had to do to get elected and they gladly paid the price. During their sixth year in office Vice President James Ettinger can no longer live with the guilt so he makes a video tape and sends it to a television news producer and then sends a cryptic letter of apology to his brother. Shortly after the video tape is mailed, James is killed by skilled assassin Olin St. John who makes a clean getaway.The people behind the assassination don't know that the vice-president recorded his dirty dealings until the tape is in the mail. Using his fianc&eacute;e Megan as a pawn, they force St. John to track down the tape and kill anyone who gets in his way. While Megan is held hostage, a worker at NBC watches the tape and knows she is being hunted. She must elude the killers until she can figure out how to get the tape into the right hands so the truth will come out about the presidential election.In the case of THE GREATER GOOD, most of the plot is laid out in the first few chapters but that doesn't detract from reader enjoyment because one key point is left out to the end but long before that the whirlwind plot draws the audience into the storyline. This is William Casey Moreton's debut novel and it is an excellent political crime thriller on a par with the works of Tom Clancy, Tom Grisham, and Dan Brown. No telling what one may find in Wal-Mart as this author will definitely be one of tomorrow's superstars.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"There is a certain knack in writing a thriller. Primarily it has to do with the pacing of the story combined with sympathetic characters.

This books fails in all of those details.It is not that it is poorly written, but we have your basic corrupt republican administartion interested in buying bullets and expanding the \\"evil\\" military. They want to keep a terrible secret from getting loose.Then there is a cold blooded assassin, who starts out good, but makes dumb mistake after dumb mistake.There is the idealistic jornalist that starts running for her life around page 200.And the billionaire bad guys and biillionaire good guys. I'm sure this novel appealed to the New York publishing establishment's world view--does the word cliche mean anything?Finally, when we have a chance for an interesting ending, the author pulls a rabbit out of the hat to make everything better.This plot was terribly predictable."},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"I read a lot of thrillers, and this debut by Casey Moreton disappointed me. As a previous reviewer pointed out, there is very little in this plot that is original or suspenseful. It is instead consists of elements recycled from a lot of previous thrillers -- a corrupt President, a reformed hit-man, a father looking for his lost daughter, etc.The most problematic aspect of this book is the lack of a central character. The author keeps jumping around from person to person, changing narrative perspectives. I therefore had no idea who the \\"hero\\" of this novel was supposed to be. To me, it's hard to write a good suspense novel unless you have a sympathetic central character, and there really isn't one in this novel.If you like suspense novels, I recommend reading Harlan Coben or CJ Box instead."},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"This is a book to spend the night with.

But nothing that happens is all that novel or suspenseful. Everybody chases around until the killers manage to wipe each other out, allowing our heroine to deliver the video tape to some good guys who have the wherewithal to see that the corrupt pols get what they deserve.

I never know how his books are going to end!"},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"In this political thriller, the story opens with American Vice-President James Ettinger drinking bourbon in his bedroom as he laments decisions made in order for him to ascend to becoming the world's \\"Number 2\\" and the toll it has taken upon him during the past six years. Indeed, he and President Yates knew the game would have to be rigged in order to win - and it was a decision they gladly made in order to further their grip on power. No longer able to live with his guilt, Ettinger makes a video tape and sends it to a television news producer, sends a cryptic letter of apology to his brother, and readies himself to announce his resignation the next day. Shortly after the video tape is mailed, however, Ettinger gets shot down by Olin St. John's gunfire, and the assassin is able to escape. What those who planned the assassination were unaware of is that the vice-president recorded his confession regarding the dirty dealings between he, Yates, and this group, and the evidence is now in the mail. The assassin, for his part, has managed to fall in love with a woman named Megan in the course of all this - a woman who he plans to marry - and at this point simply wants the five million dollars he is owed by the corrupt group of government saboteurs so he can get out and live a normal and simple life. The shadowy group involved in the plot kidnaps Megan and begins using St. John's fianc&eacute;e as a pawn, forcing him to track down the video tape and kill anyone who might prevent him from doing so in the process. Her father, Joel Benjamin, finds himself on the brink of suicide in an airport until he happens to spot his long lost daughter. Though he tries unsuccessfully to follow her, he keeps his search going and makes that his mission in life. While Megan is held hostage, a production assistant at the NBC network watches the vice-president's tape and knows realizes she is also now in danger. She must elude the killers until she can figure out how to get the tape into the right hands so the truth will come out about the upcoming election. As you can see, there are several important characters that are interconnected through a variety of events, and the story is continuously interwoven to bring it all together. St. John's indeed does rescue Megan, but not before more mayhem takes place and the faith of a nation is put to the test.This book fits nicely into the \\"thriller\\" genre - from the book's fairly obvious giveaway with the title, onto an intense, heart-pounding, plot-centric story that places the main character in a variety of dangerous situations throughout the tale. Each one of these treacherous encounters is overcome - albeit just barely - as eventually the story climaxes with a final showdown between the \\"hero\\" and the primary group of villains. Here, our assassin certainly is not a traditional hero, yet quickly becomes a sympathetic figure to the reader as he tries to escape the criminal grip bestowed on him by these powerful, conspiring government agents and their plot to be the power behind the curtains in the executive branch. As is fairly typical in the genre, this author often alternates among numerous characters' viewpoints while telling a larger story, showing the reader how all the moving parts are interconnected in a way that lets the reader know the plans of the other characters, especially the villain, before they're carried out. This method seems to actually add suspense because the reader can fully appreciate the peril the character is in before the step into it and also lets us see what obstacles may prevent help from reaching the hero.Although having interconnected characters and storylines is fairly common in this genre, probably the most troubling thing for me in reading this book was the lack of a true main character. Assassin St. John's is really the closest we get, but the book isn't really about him, per se. Outside of the issue with being able to appreciate the multiple character perspectives, but still seeking a more focused, central character as a true \\"hero,\\" I found the plot particularly entertaining. Being a political junkie and social science type helped make for a quick and lively read with a predictable, but still suspenseful ending. I would definitely take another shot on this young author. It's not John Grisham, but it's very entertaining."},{"Title":"Greater Good","review":"I loved the union of stories and never quite knew where the author was taking me.

But beneath the facade lies a life of unrealized potential and dreams. For once Cassia, too, aspired to be a doctor. But meeting Edward Tallow changed everything.Was it the times in which she lived? Women were not necessarily pursuing careers or independent lives, especially if they married and had children. Finding role models for the life she had wanted were in short supply.So, in many ways, it was not inconceivable for women like Cassia to succumb to a more subordinate role.How does the unexpected legacy change everything for Cassia? What starts as an exploration into buying a few treats and investing in a friend's theatrical production extends to renting a little house in London so she can resume her medical career in clinics nearby. What other dreams and fantasies will be unleashed, once she reconnects with old friends and unrequited loves?But will her husband fight her efforts? Will he sabotage her at every turn? And what about the suddenly unanswered questions that have cropped up about the true source of the money left in the trust that has wrought all these changes for Cassia?The upper echelon of society populatesWindfall, with characters who are friends to Cassia, some of whom were debutantes with her when she was living in London with her godmother. Their riches, their values, their own flaws and failings bring many layers to the story and the reader starts to invest in their happiness as well as their sorrows.The richly layered story casts its net wide upon the social scene of England, with its interesting backdrop of the new King Edward VIII, who will eventually abdicate the throne for his love Wallis Simpson. It is a story about love, lust, greed, envy, loss, and numerous misunderstandings. Weaving together the complicated threads to the mystery behind the legacy creates enough tension to keep the reader moving along quickly through this rather dense novel to create a colorful tapestry of characters, plots, and subplots. A captivating five star read."},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"Penny Vincenzi is a favorite of mine and has been since I first discovered her.

She is somewhat envious of her spouse as she also was trained as a doctor, but he insists she stay at home.Cassia is scrubbing the alter steps when she learns she inherited a fortune from her godmother, Lady Beatty, who drank Champagne with the rich, aristocratic and famous like Edward VIII. With a half a million pounds, Cassia has the means to join the upper crust if she chooses or practice medicine to the neglected working-class women as she once dreamed of; something her husband objects to. However, Cassia soon begins to learn that her liberating windfall may not rightfully belong to her; ethical as always, she investigates with a need to learn the truth. Sometimes the truth will not set you free as Cassia learns that with each revelation comes increasing danger.This a typical entertaining Penny Vincenzi historical thriller as the ethical heroine tries to do what is right, but finds that dangerous. Cassia makes the story line work as her actions after learning of her WINDFALL place her in opposition with her demanding spouse and to a degree her children, but eventually she goes after what she wants for herself: providing medical care to impoverish women. Fans of the author and those who enjoy a between World Wars English historical will want to read Ms. Vincenzi's blockbuster bonkbuster as the British would say over a cup of Earl Grey.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"Cassie Fallon though a non-practicing medical doctor is an ordinary housewife with two small kids and wife to Dr, Edward Fallon; when she learns that she has inherited half a million pounds from her godmother Leanora who lived in Paris. Reluctant to spend any part of this fortune, she and her husband start to ponder why Leanora would have left such a large amount of money or any at all for that matter, when they were made to believe that she had died penniless. The solictor has no idea and encourages them to stop worrying and take the money.The Fallons start to spend the first set of Cassie's inheritance on refurbishing Edward's medical facilities which ajoin the house and then they redo their home. Admidst all these renovations Cassie takes a good look at herself and decides that she needs a makeover of sorts. She flies to London where she purchases a new brand car, much to Edward's distaste, and with her desire to restart her medical pratice, Cassie's sets her sights on half-baked and far-fetched plans, letting the money go straight to her head. She enjoys herself on big spending sprees buying clothing, accessories, hats in all colours, and shoes. Anything to make her look chic and not like the old Cassie. Along with the package comes new friends in London who she tries to emulate in dress code, and she has never looked better.Intent on setting up a home in London as she commits herself to working in a clinic there, she becomes extremely selfish with her time spending lots of time away from Edward and her little ones. In fact she now sees her husband's practice in the country as a dead end job and challenges him to transfer to London which would be more lucrative for him, but he bluntly refuses for he greatly dislikes the idea of her working again and he is not comfortable with London or her new found friends. Plus he argues that there would be nobody else to give aid to his country folk. How could he just leave them out in the cold?As her relationship with her husband quivers on shaky ground, Cassie Fallon wings with the jet set, ignoring him and neglecting her children. She tells lies, commits infidelities amd becomes a bigger spendrift as the time passes.With the assortment of loveable and unloveable characters the suspense of this novel is killing. Read it and you'll find out where the fortune actually came from and the circumstances that drove Cassie Fallon to travel to France and even Africa for answers to this big question.As usual, Penny Vincenzi's never fails her readers. This is another delightful one from her that I highly recommend.Heather MarshallSeptember 3rd 2001"},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"I love Penny Vincenzi's books. After buying all the ones available in the U.S., I started ordering the rest from the U.K. or second hand sellers and now own all 13. However, I'm taking my time reading them -- spacing them out so as to have some to look forward to. Like rich food, you don't want to read two Vincenzi blockbusters in a row. WINDFALL is my eleventh to read and I've thoroughly enjoyed it. It's funny about this book, though. The back cover copy calls the main character Cassia Fallon, (the single other reviewer here calls her Fallon, too) yet in the book her name is Cassia Tallow, not Fallon. I find that extremely odd.The book begins when Cassia (for Cassiopeia, after the constellation) Tallow, an unhappy, frustrated housewife stuck in a small village with her G.P. doctor husband and three young children, receives a windfall inheritance from her godmother of more than 500,000 pounds. The year is 1935, so I figure in today's money, that amount equates to around 25 million pounds. The money changes Cassia's life -- enables her to become the person she always thought she would be -- independent, able to resume her medical career if she chooses, able to buy anything she desires. But what seems to be an undreamed of blessing soon shows itself to also be the instrument that may destroy her marriage and her reputation.The story unfolds the way all of Vincenzi's stories unfold: filled with larger-than-life characters, drama, suspense, thrills, sex, jewels, gorgeous homes and clothes, and lush descriptions of the lives of the rich and privileged of English aristocracy.Vincenzi's novels are extremely compelling reading. Once you start one, all you want to do is read it non-stop. WINDFALL is no exception."},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"It was very helpful to find out that this is a book that was first published in 1997.I think it is very misleading for a publisher to change the title and let readersthink this is a new book!"},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"In the mid-1930s, all of England --- especially the jet-setting upper class that brushes elbows with royalty on occasion --- is abuzz with rumors of the new young king, Edward VIII, and his scandalous relationship with the American divorcee, Wallis Warfield Simpson, a love affair that will create a constitutional crisis and ultimately result in Edward's abdication of the throne.This real-life historical drama lies in the background of WINDFALL, Penny Vincenzi's latest book to be released in the United States (it was originally published in the United Kingdom in 1997). The royal crisis underscores several of the novel's themes, most notably the transition between a \\"traditional\\" understanding of marriage and sexuality to one that more closely resembles our modern views. Vincenzi also explores the life-altering conflict between desire and duty and how it seems that a person can have one or the other, but never both.Cassia Tallow, the complex heroine of WINDFALL, discovers her own conflict between duty and desire almost as soon as the novel opens when Cassia receives a large inheritance from her recently deceased godmother whom she had thought was penniless. She is now rich beyond her wildest dreams. At first, Cassia is drawn to the expected luxuries: a fancy sports car and chic clothes that she, as the mother of three young children and wife of a humble country doctor, could never have afforded before.Soon, however, Cassia sets her sights somewhat higher as she realizes that this unexpected wealth might enable her to revive her own dreams of becoming a practicing physician, dreams that were thwarted when an unexpected pregnancy and reluctant marriage put an end to her promising medical school career. But her husband, Edward, who struggled to pass medical school, grows increasingly resentful of Cassia's aspirations. He initiates a war of passive aggression that escalates when Cassia rents a house in London and when Edward sends their oldest son, only six years old, to boarding school.Meanwhile, Cassia's medical work near London has brought her back into the fashionable crowd with whom she associated in her younger, unmarried days. These include the second-rate actor Rupert Cameron, her oldest friend and first love, and the maddeningly stubborn and rakishly attractive Harry Moreton, who has long professed his alternating passion for and annoyance with Cassia. Fueled by her new financial independence, Cassia finds herself making questionable choices that could affect not only her friends but also her entire family. And, to complicate matters, Cassia soon starts to suspect that the inheritance from her godmother might not be quite what it seems, and it could even have a few strings attached.WINDFALL starts by focusing quite exclusively on Cassia's own story, beginning with her discovery of the inheritance and, through a series of flashbacks, introducing readers to the character's history. As the novel does so, however, it also broadens gradually to encompass a dozen or more of Cassia's friends and acquaintances, each of whom has his or her own story to be explored. Vincenzi manages to create the kind of broad, panoramic canvas she loves to paint, as marriages are threatened and destroyed, individuals come to the brink of despair or reinvent themselves in new and surprising ways, and the inevitable happy (but sometimes bittersweet) endings come into view.Vincenzi excels at depicting the upper classes, at describing their elegant clothes and homes, their lavish parties, and also their petty squabbles. Here, though, she goes beyond mere idolatry of the rich, as she contrasts their internal dramas with the far more dire circumstances facing lower- and working-class women like the ones Cassia treats at her birth control clinics. She also explores conflicted and changing ideas of sexuality as they existed in the 1930s, depicting both characters who freely convey their era's prejudices and those who are beginning to adopt more modern attitudes.However, at the center of it all is Cassia, one of Vincenzi's most complicated and compelling heroines. Despite her numerous ethically questionable choices, Cassia remains a genuinely sympathetic character, especially for modern women readers who will rejoice that the available choices for ambitious women have come so far from Cassia's time.--- Reviewed by Norah Piehl"},{"Title":"Windfall","review":"I bought this thinking it was new, but it was a reissue of a book I read in 1997.

All that changes when she unexpectedly receives a windfall, a large inheritance from her entrancing but troubled godmother. Now Cassia can tentatively reenter the sophisticated society she left behind when she became a country doctor's wife, and start to do some good by providing birth control and medical care for working class women who have already had too many babies. Her husband is not pleased, but author Penny Vincenzi is very good at arousing readers' sympathy and understanding for even her most incorrigible or infuriating characters. The panoply of smart, talented, urbane characters that fill the book make excellent company and they each find their most suitable, though sometimes surprising, mate or destiny by the end.

The celebrated and confirmed novelist produces a sweeping epic poem about Jason, (of Jason and the argonauts) his voyages and tragic relationship with Medeia. Though after reading it I felt that it was a logical progression for Gardner come out with this. All of the deep philosophical musings that you expect from him are there, great characterizations, and really most of his prose is very poetic; some of the poetry in this work slips into and out of prose. Absolutely engaging material and often overlooked. A great read for the serious reader."},{"Title":"Jason and Medeia","review":"Who writes epic poetry these days? And even if someone does, how good can it be?Very good indeed, as a matter of fact! The late John Gardner tackles one of the greatest, most rousing tales of Greek myth, one with some of the darkest undercurrents, and retells it for the modern age. Beginning (of course) in medias res, with Jason & Medeia living in exile under the auspices of Kreon, our contemporary narrator allows us to observe Jason spinning his tale before Kreon's court -- and before Kreon's young daughter Pyripta, surrounded by suitors for her hand & dowry.Along with the narrator, we know how the tale will end -- in blood & betrayal, just as Jason's passionate involvement with Medeia began. The poem unfolds with vivid color, psychological depth, and philosophical musings on fate & death. Yet it's always a Story before everything else, one that draws the reader in, just as Jason's telling of it draws in & captures Kreon's enthralled court.The overlay of contemporary images & ideas at times only adds to the power of the poem. Nothing ever seems jarring or out of place -- it's told from a timeless perspective, filled with pity for the plight of Man, tinged with dark humor, recognizing the Gods as avatars of both the forces of existence & our own complex psyches. If Jason & his shipmates contend against an essentially meaningless universe, they do so by striving to create their own meaning. And yet, how blind they can be to their own flaws, how helpless before the flood of unsuspected emotions & hidden drives!Don't mistake this for just an interesting literary experiment. Gardner knows the masters of the epic inside & out, and he's giving his utmost to match their artistry, striving as mightily as Jason himself. And I'd say that he succeeds. This is wonderful reading by any measure, most highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Linux Programming White Papers: A Compilation of Technical Documents for Programmers","review":"This book is pretty much a snapshot of the Linux Documentation Project's documentation.

First, it has far fewer works than its competitor, the Penguin Guide 2000. Also, several features from earlier Gramophone guides have been dropped. There are no longer &quot;alternative selections&quot; -- just the 2 or 3 that the Gramophone editors prefer. So, if you want to know whether a certain recording is a well regarded one, you're out of luck unless its one of the 2 or 3 Gramophone lists. So, there's nothing to help you differentiate most excellent recordings from the rest (and there are far more than 2-3 excellent recordings of most classical music peices). Also, there are no &quot;G&quot; ratings. In previous editions, recordings would also be given 1, 2, or 3 &quot;G&quot;s in order to indicate the level of regard the authors held a good recording in. Finally, the &quot;Gramophone 100&quot; listings are gone. As a final sad footnote, the &quot;beginner's&quot; library can only be called a joke."},{"Title":"Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide 2000","review":"Even before it was revised, the Gramophone Guides to classical CDs never made any pretense to being complete in any sense of the word. Yes, all the composers whose works were to be found on CDs were included, but not every recording of every one of their works. The editors allowed themselves a good deal of leeway in exercising their personal choices. Now the &lt;Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide 2000&gt; has dropped a few features found in the older editions and has lessened its value as a reference tool--but to be fair, it must be judged on what is has retained.Its chief rival is, of course, the &quot;Penguin Guide to Compact Discs,&quot; which in its last edition has dropped the section on compilations and concert recordings (except for piano recitals) but which still tries to cram in reviews of every version of a work that is still available on the major labels. Therefore, out of necessity, it has to say less about each than does the Gramophone listings. And if, as at least one reader has pointed out, the bias seems to Anglophiliac, one can take that into account in making up one's own mind about which CD to purchase. And I do appreciate the section that reviews collections, no longer to be found, as I said, in the Penguin guides.What I do is get both of them whenever they come out and keep even the old ones to double check on reissues and on what I can find in used CD bins. So I will deduct a star for what is not there; but I still want to recommend the Gramophone as very useful when used in conjunction with the other guides."},{"Title":"Gramophone Classical Good CD Guide 2000","review":"The Gramophone Classical CD Guide in years past was a fairly comprehensive listing of classical recordings similar too, yet distinct from, the Penguin Guide (Gramophone included fewer, more comprehensive featured reviews plus additional recommendations while Penguin gave smaller reviews for all it's listings; still the total number of cd's listed in each book, 5,000 - 10,000, were comparable). Gramophone unfortunately, as another reviewer has stated, decided to eliminate the additional recommendations (reducing the number of CD listings by at least three quarters), and have done away with any quantitative ratings (the G's).The new approach, rather than being a thorough discography, is a truncated compilation of Gramophone reviews. Maybe thats what Gramophone wants. I wouldn't say this book has no value, it's just far less valuable to someone trying to build and expand a classical music collection. Their reviews are excellent and that continues here, there just needs to be more (many more) cd listings, especially of the basic repetoire.What I would like is a return to the old format with one change; a constant rotation from one year's book to the next of the primary reviews. The same reviews (with the exception of the 'new' ones that are less than half the total) should not be presented year after year as it is now. Recycle them. For example, rather than putting in the review of Giulini's performance of Mozart's Don Giovani every year, list it under additional recommendations. Put in a different, even if recycled, one (like of Furtwangler's performance). This will at least serve the interests of repeat (at least until now) buyers of the Guide, such as me.The current rendition leaves the field to Penguin. Gramophone now appears to be competing with Svejda (also listed on Amazon) instead. Too bad."},{"Title":"Create Your Own Stage Effects (Create Your Own Stage Series)","review":"Another in the popular series of 'Create Your Own...' theatre books, Create Your Own Stage Effects is aimed primarily at the small scale or amateur level. The main theatrical effects topics are covered including lighting, sound and scenic effects, costume, fast changes, transformations, projection, make-up, properties, pyrotechnics, weather effects, fire, smoke and water, as well as historical and futuristic settings.The effects are well covered from a practical standpoint with step by step instructions and safety measures. Budget considerations also feature, with many cost-effective and ingenious methods explored, though production values and professional results are not sacrificed to achieve this.Like the other books in the series, Create Your Own Stage Effects offers a good foundation for the student or less experienced in an informal and accessible format that also lends itself well as a teaching aid.

I strongly suggest you guys to buy it."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"If you love the piano, this book is almost as important as a good edition of the Beethoven sonatas and the Well-Tempered Clavier. A student of Leopold Godowsky and the teacher of Richter and Gilels, Mr. Neuhaus put together a very inspiring, almost revelatory book on the loftier spiritual and intellectual aspects of playing the piano. I recommend it wholeheartedly."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"His uncle Felix Blumenfeld was a Horowitz teacher.Some of Neuhaus students among many others:- Sviatoslav Richter and Emil Gilels, both considered top 10 world pianists.- The first teacher (the mother) of Andrei Gavrilov.- Radu Lupu.This book is funny as exemplified below by some excerpts:\\"Thinking about art and science, about their mutual relationship and contradictions, I came to the conclusion, for some reason or other, that mathematics and music are situated at extreme poles of the human spirit, that these two antipodes limit and determine the whole spiritual and creative activity of man and that situated between them is everything that mankind has created in the field of science and art\\".I found his above childish thoughts very interesting, perhaps meaning that everything is a linear combination of pure logic (math) and pure emotion (music). As I work with math and like to play piano I will tend to be a \\"complete\\" human being :-)Other of his \\"jokes\\":\\"When Emil Gilels came to study with me in the Moscow State Conservatory, I was once forced to say to him: You are already a grown man, you can eat steak and drink beer but so far you have been fed with a baby's bottle\\"\\"I remember that when Glazunov was about fifty his mother used to tell the washerwoman to be careful with the child's linen\\"\\"To play the piano is easy. I mean the physical process, and not the summit of pianistic art.It is obvious that to play the piano very well is just as difficult as to do anything else very well, for instance to pull teeth or macadam a road\\".\\"I must once more apologize for this excessively long history about myself; that is always somewhat indecent. But what can one do?\\"\\"Carl Czerny, the \\"dry and methodical genius\\" who has tortured generations of pianists wih an inexhaustible stream of studies and exercises...\\"And many more...His jokes are almost everywere. Otherwise the book has several useful recommendations and analysis about the art of piano playing and has chapters on \\"artistic image of a musical composition\\", on tone, on technique and on teaching activity.But be advised: Sometimes the book is a bit verbose, repetitive and philosophical. It is not directed only to technical problems."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"When I first read this book I knew almost notihng about interpritation. Since the first time I read it (because it's worth reading it more than one time) I have begun to play the piano in a totaly different way. There are plenty of usefull tips in it, although the author states that that was not in his intentions. The most important is that you must not struggle for a perfect technique or an nice sound, but those two elements should be the key to a meaningfull interpritation.As a book, it is very easy to read since it combines personal experiences and advice about piano-playing. It makes the reader seek for more similar books in order to learn how great pianists aproached a skore. It is excelent both for the beginner and the experinced pianist, who can get an idea of how the great teacher of Russia teached his famous studends (Richer, Gilels...)"},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"This book is simply outstanding. It should in fact be standard reading for all piano students and professionals alike, and even to some extent qualifies as a reference on artistic piano playing. It is excellently well written, entertaining, funny, inspiring, and very educational. It is well worth reading many times, since the profundity of some of the advice given actually needs digestion and experimentation at the piano to fully grasp. It is a crime that this book is out of print."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"I'm sure anyone shopping for this book knows that Heinrich Neuhaus was the mentor of such giants of the piano as Richter, Gilels and Lupu. Well, here between these covers you'll find the reason why. Neuhaus possessed a great mind and an ability to express himself like no other pedagogue I have read. While reading his book I kept thinking I was reading Tolstoy, not for any similarity of style or substance but because I got the same feeling from both their works, that here is a great man who had lived a full life, and then had the patience and wherewithal to sit down and commit it to paper, thereby enriching piano posterity. This book deserves pride of place on any pianist's bookshelf. I thank the previous reviewer who said that it was a crime that this book is out of print. I paid a hefty amount for what looks like a slim volume, but it is packed with such profundity that I have to consider this a seminal addition to my library. Get it wherever you can, this is one for the ages."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"Lets put it this way.... this is not light reading (is the slang word an airplane book?). It is though one of the best books on playing the piano. Neuhaus is concise, to the point and likes to put out interesting anecdotes, some humorous.This is also pretty advanced so I doubt non musicians could find any utility apart from historical tidbits. Neuhaus taught Richter who taught many others.... and just like we do with other disciplines - we have to pay tribute to the forefather of this lineage/legacy, especially since he helped produce Richter."},{"Title":"The art of piano-playing","review":"This book is on of the most insightful and artistic book that is out there.If you are a pianist/piano teacher you have to own and read this book.In a way it is like a bible for piano playing.Heinrich Neuhaus was the greatest Russian teacher that basically made the Russian school of piano playing to be where it is today.

Follman, a technical writer makes it all make sense. Like many people, I click away at my mouse and enter the world of the World Wide Web without a second thought. This does not mean that I really understand how it works or what it is or even some of the larger implications of what it all means. Now, however, after reading this small gem of a book, which is only 159 pages long, I see it all differently.First of all, she makes the technology understandable by her simple and explicit explanations. She repeats a lot of the basic concepts so that they really do stick. Finally, such words as &quot;bit&quot; and &quot;bitstream&quot; make sense. I now know that HTTP means &quot;Hyper Text Transfer Protocol&quot; and URL means &quot;Uniform Resource Locator&quot;. Finally, I understand what bandwidth is and the differences between cable and DSL and each of their strengths and weaknesses. And, best of all, I can see how it all fits in with developments in the world concerning the spread of language and ideas.Ms. Follman brings a sense of wonder and optimism to what we have now and what she sees for the future. And even though she makes it simple, she doesn't talk down to her audience. A friend of mine who is a computer professional thumbed through the book and remarked how much good basic information it contained. I used to think that this was information I didn't need to know. The truth is I don't. After all, I know how to log on to a computer. But what Ms. Follman does in this book is enrich my experience, give it dimension. And, in my mind, the World Wide Web will never look the same to me again. Recommended."},{"Title":"Getting the Web: Understanding the Nature & Meaning of the Internet","review":".Jeanne M. Follman scores a hit with this book. As a former college instructor who taught the Internet, I can state positively, that I wish I had this book for use as a textbook. She uses a down to earth writing style that will score with teenagers and young people.For those who find the complexities of the Internet hard to fathom, Follman does great job explaining how it works, in fast, easy to understand terms. I learned some interesting historical facts (the development of CGI), that I didn't know about the Internet and thoroughly enjoyed this book.Follman also gives some insights into where the Internet is going and explain why it is important to understand its effects on mankind and our culture.I think this book should be on the required reading list for every High School through Junior College Student in the US. I think it would make a fine basis for further research.Strongly recommended for anyone interested in how the Internet works. The concepts are simple but so important that they should not be ignored. Read this book and pass it on to as many of your family members as possible.Congrats to Follman for a fine book...."},{"Title":"Getting the Web: Understanding the Nature & Meaning of the Internet","review":"When I wanted to learn how to write in HTML, I picked up this book.

Written specifically for the non-specialist general reader, a series of informative, thoughtful essays explain how the Internet relates to the written tradition, how images convey complex information, how the Web enables lay people to become radio and video broadcasts, how open standards provide a way for people from all manner of backgrounds to interact cooperatively, and what happens when traditional barriers to commerce and communication are eliminated locally, regionally, nationally, and globally. Getting The Web is especially recommended for those new to the Internet, as well as those who have wondered about how the web is changing almost all aspects of modern life, culture, society, commerce, education, and governance."},{"Title":"Getting the Web: Understanding the Nature & Meaning of the Internet","review":"To \\"get\\" the Web is to understand what its capabilities are. I am reminded of the fact that a liquid almost always assumes the shape of its container. With any new resource, we must first grasp what it makes possible before we can take appropriate advantage of those possibilities. With regard to the Web, that process of recognizing its potential functionality continues for all of us. Here is an excellent introduction to \\"understanding the nature and meaning of the Internet\\" and especially, the Web. Follman duly acknowledges -- indeed frequently cites -- various sources, such as Berners-Lee's Weaving the Web, as she carefully guides her reader through three Parts: What the Internet Is (\\"the telephone company for computers\\"); Why the Internet is the Way It Is (\\"how computers and telephone companies shape the future of the Internet\\"); and finally, \\"the ways in which the Internet shapes communication and exchange and ultimately, us.\\" I highly recommend this book to non-technicians at all organizational levels who are directly or indirectly involved in e-business. I also recommend it to school and college students who are now preparing for a business career. Finally, I recommend it to owners/CEOs of small companies who are thinking about or already embarked upon e-business initiatives. To all a word of caution: Don't expect more of this book than Follman intended. This is an introduction, a primer really, for non-technicians. As she explains, her focus is on \\"What\\" and (I presume to suggest) \\"Why\\", not on \\"How.\\" After reading this book, you may wish to consult other sources. Follman includes a brief \\"Bibliography.\\" Here are three other books you should also consider: K. Eric Wexler's Engines of Creation, Nicholas Negroponte's Being Digital, and Jakob Nielsen's Designing Web Usability."},{"Title":"Getting the Web: Understanding the Nature & Meaning of the Internet","review":"There is a great deal of noise surrounding the Internet. With all the hype of the dot-com phenomena it is often easy to believe that the Internet is not as revolutionary as once thought. However, that is not the case, and I offer the following point in support. I recently taught some free, introduction to the Internet classes at a local community college. While there were no age restrictions, nearly everyone in the class was fifty or older. Their interests were varied, but most were interested in e-mail and the ability to search for information. In that area, the greatest interest was in finding someone or something that they had encountered earlier in life. Viewing their childlike fascination with what we could find was one of the strongest arguments in favor of how the Internet is changing society that I have seen.Their level of interest was rather high and a common comment was that there was little material available that would explain the Internet where \\"an old dog\\" could understand it. Several students asked me if I could recommend any books that explained the Internet in general, simple terms. This book is one resource that will satisfy that need and most of the major points I was asked in those classes are covered. From now on, when such questions arise, I will recommend this book."},{"Title":"Your Baby's First Year For Dummies (For Dummies (Lifestyles Paperback))","review":"I gave this as a gift to a couple who are expecting their first baby.
