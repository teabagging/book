Wanting to feel the slight warmth of human breath infusing cold darkness, a clutching of fingers across a chasm of hopelessness, I responded gratefully to the vision Camus creates in his metaphorical plague. I was particularly gratified by the swimming scene, a place in the book where two careworn men lay aside their baggage of horror and futility and tear joy from a macabre landscape, making it their own, ever so briefly, as we all do from time to time.

The book also shows how's like to an foreigner with no common life with the city can be afected by the taken away of his freedom to leave the city and how does it afect his relationship with his woman who is outside of the city..

The hopelessness and desolation that the city undergoes in &quot;exile&quot; is shown very well by the nararrator. The strain of feeling helpless in light of the plague induces the people of Oran to ravage the town and put themselves in danger that they have control over. They steal and rampage to regain some sense of life and the feeling of &quot;being alive.&quot; A very insightful book striking to the very heart of mankind"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I remember studying the Black Death at college and how it impacted on England, reducing the population of 6 million to less than 2 million during its relentless onslaught. Modern medicine has largely assuaged such calamities only for the likes of famine, war and poverty to take over as some of the main threats we face today. In Albert Camus' The Plague we share the lives of the community of Oran, Algeria, whose coastal town is hit by an epidemic and what follows is months of struggle for the people not just in fighting the disease but in looking closely at their own humanity.The novel begins with dead rats being found throughout the town, even in a hotel, but the locals think nothing of this and simply gather up the corpses and discard them. When the first townspeople begin to fall ill the novel's protagonist, Dr Bernard Rieux and his colleague, Castel, conclude it must be plague but their fears are initially dismissed given such isolated cases. Not heeding the doctors' warnings proves costly and soon dozens in the town become ill with symptoms including fever and abscesses on the body that require lancing. Beginning with a small number of deaths, the plague soon leads to Dr Rieux designating space at a hospital for plague victims but when that can't cope with the demand the town has to turn to quarantining the infected to try and stop the epidemic from spreading. Camus' book is split into five parts and covers a period of many months from the arrival of the plague to its eventual passing, and a reflection on the consequences of the outbreak.Though Camus denied being an existentialist, The Plague is often regarded as a product of this strand of philosophical thought which put emphasis on the individual being entirely responsible for bringing meaning to their life in the face of distractions such as boredom and despair. The individual is a focal point of the novel despite the plague taking much of the precedence. Over the months a group of characters each respond to the plague in their own way. Dr Rieux is a hero of sorts but his motivation in helping the unfortunate victims of the plague is him simply doing what any medical professional would do. Cottard, after a failed suicide attempt, takes advantage of the epidemic to sell contraband goods. Joseph Grand joins with Rieux in helping the sick in the town which offers a distraction from his problems as a failed writer. Father Paneloux seizes the opportunity to declare the plague as God's judgement on the town and his preaching sees an ever growing congregation flock to his church looking for guidance. The other main protagonists are outsiders both trapped in Oran when the plague forces the town gates to be shut and the inhabitants forbidden from leaving. Raymond Rambert is a journalist doing research in the town who longs to escape and be with his wife. Finally, there is the mysterious Jean Tarrou who is eager to join with Rieux and Grand from the outset in helping victims of the plague, his actions all steered toward being something of a saint. Watching each of the characters unfold during the novel is always fascinating and not all of them live to see the end.Camus' depiction of a plague infested town is frightening and powerful. After the masses of dead rats there comes a time when families are being quarantined, the town is shut off from the outside world and even access to the ocean for swimming is forbidden, something Camus enjoyed in real life. One of the most striking images for me was of an old man that tears up paper in the streets and hurls it into the air to lure unsuspecting cats to him. Once the felines are in close proximity he spits at them! It's a strange scenario but all the more poignant when the plague has hit and no cats or dogs are in sight leaving the old man to wait forlornly for them to return, his life seemingly having no purpose without this daily ritual. While many in the town succumb to an air of resignation there is a strong community spirit in other corners in fighting the plague. It's unclear at times whether anyone will survive such is the ferocity of the plague once it has taken hold of Oran.The Plague is partly an allegory of the German occupation of France (1940-44), of which Camus was all too familiar being based in the Massif Central in 1942 prior to the Germans occupying Southern France. Camus ended up being trapped there, cut off from his homeland of Algeria, as well as his wife and mother when the Germans finally did advance into the south. There is something of Camus in the character of Raymond Rambert who is also trapped and wanting to get home to his wife. Many strands of The Plague can be linked to France's occupation by Germany. The plague in the novel is the equivalent of the Nazi threat, one that goes unheeded by the locals just as France were slow to react during the Second World War. Their swift defeat was unexpected just as the townspeople in Oran do not fear a serious threat from isolated outbreaks of the plague save Dr Rieux who tries to warn the town of the dangers they face. The isolation, despair and uncertainty about the future are brilliantly recreated by Camus who must have felt similar feelings living under German occupation in France. The end of Germany's hold on France must have seemed as surprising as the waning of the plague in Camus' book. There is something of disbelief in the novel that a force beyond the town's control should suddenly wilt and gradually retreat. I'm sure it's no coincidence that in describing the plague in the novel, Camus' depiction could be argued as being akin to that of an advancing and later retreating army.Not being brilliant at understanding philosophy I know for certain that I will not have garnered all the meanings from Camus' The Plague but I think it's one of those novels that you can read at different levels. On the surface it can be read simply as a story of a plague striking an Algerian town, incidentally one Camus was familiar with and despised, and how the community struggles to survive. Going deeper there is the allegory of France's occupation by Germany during the Second World War, a depth I felt comfortable in exploring during my reading of the text. Deeper still is the novel's place as a work of existentialism, a philosophical thought I understand to a degree and can see in The Plague despite Camus' insistence that it is anything but. However deep you want to delve into the meanings I do think the novel is one that can be read by many and still enjoyed.The first novel I've ever read by Albert Camus, I found myself initially intimidated by The Plague wondering if the work of such an intelligent man would be too complicated for me. The novel is thankfully accessible and can be enjoyed by a wide audience. The depiction of an epidemic, its symptoms, the scars it leaves on a coastal town, and finally the individuals in the community are all well conveyed here. It's made me even more eager to try Camus' other works."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"From a previous reviewer it appears that the publisher of this Kindle edition might have missed a few chapters? I wouldn't know as this was my first exposure to the book and the author. Its the only Kindle edition that I could find so that's that. I read it and I really enjoyed it!To me the book sums up visions of future hope and the meaning that it gives to our lives (maybe love but that's a form of hope in the end I think). We are all victims of the plague even if we are never under the threat of exposure and what helps us get through life is hope for the future. When that hope is removed, we make up new hopes and maybe in the end its all made up from the word go but that in no way diminishes its value. While reading the book the word nihilism came to mind but later I read the intro material and the author uses the word absurdism and I think its a better word. The way we usually perceive our existence is made up dualisms that can not coexist especially when it comes down to the big problem that our life can not both be meaningless and have meaning in the same breath. What gives life meaning? The church isn't up to the task as they pile more meaningless bull on top of it and the nihilist doesn't fare so well either as we shouldn't lose our humanity in the process (this seems to be a difference between Camus and Sartre and they had a tiff over Camus' perceived totalitarianism of Sartre's ideas on the matter) and here comes the word absurdism and it fits the bill nicely. I'll let you read the book. It is not a shallow read. Its one of those book that I need to think some more on and I really do like that."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I wasn't blown away by The Plague. The characters were well developed and the story was overall interesting. The book sometimes lost my interest making it difficult to read. I would have to put the book down at times to be able to continue reading through it. Camus likes to use the same types of symbols and themes in all his novels, making it somewhat difficult for someone who is just reading one of his books to understand what everything means without looking into it. I did enjoy Dr. Rieux as a main character, his perspective on things made the novel very interesting.While I thought that the story was interesting at times, other times it got quite boring and was difficult to read. This book could do a better job of telling more interesting tales within the city of Oran while still getting the overall message across. That is why this book received three stars out of five instead of receiving more."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"\\"...and then you found twenty dollars.\\" This phrase usually accompanies dull, predictable, stories that lack an original plot or purpose. It also reflects the intellectual caliber of the person who says it. Either way, narration is an important part of a story, and the effect of a good narrator is seen in Albert Camus' The Plague.What benefit is there in having a narrator relate a story? Well, Camus tells us in the beginning.\\"...a narrator cannot take account of these differences of outlook.His business is only to say: \`This is what happened,' when he knowsthat it actually did happen, that it closely affected the life of a wholepopulace...This is justification for playing the part of a historian...narrator has three kinds of data...himself...eyewitnesses...documents...\\"A narrator can give more than one point of view to give the story a complete, three dimensional feel. Camus' narrator did exactly that, it put the plague in different levels creating a universal dilemma that even relates to the reader. Camus' narrator at the most basic level is a storyteller. The next level is to bridge the gap between his world in Algiers, and to the readers' world. The third purpose is Dr. Rieux as the narrator symbolizing existentialism.\\"...this seems to be the moment for Dr. Bernard Rieux to confess thathe is the narrator.\\"Like Camus, Dr. Rieux has taken himself out of the issue at hand to take on a role of historian/narrator in an act of awareness. He can do nothing, but recount life in a complete truth to show the vicious cycle of life.Camus utilizes the element of narration to create a very intellectual, but slightly dull story of human reaction to problems. In short I hope Camus found twenty dollars, because the story is quite dull."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In the past I have read a few of Camus' books, such as The Stranger and The Fall. I was impressed by both. This work, however, far surpasses the others in its brilliance. I do not be any means agree with the philosophy advanced by Camus in this book, or in any of his books for that matter. I cannot, however, deny that Camus was extremely talented at writing, and if you are looking for a glimpse into existentialism, and don't want to spend a few months slogging through Sarte's \\"On Being and Nothingness\\", then this is probably a good place to start. Camus gives us a glimpse into the existentialist's view of life in light of a disastor of mammoth propostions, and it gives us a (in my opinion) very accurate description of how people react to grave misfortune. Since I am a Christian, I was interested in seeing how Camus thought the Plauge would affect people's religous views. I think he summed it up well when he said:&#8220;Moreover, most people, assuming that they had no altogether abandoned religious observances, or did not combine them naively with a thoroughly immoral way of living, had replaced normal religious practices by more or less extravagant superstitions. Thus they were readier to wear prophylactic medals of St. Roch that to go to Mass.&#8221;While I do not think that what he described is what should happen, I think it is what would invariably would happen. Thus, even is regard to religion, which Camus thought nonsense, he nonetheless provides an accurate description of it."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Albert Camus's The Plague is set in the 1940s in Oran, a small city on the Algerian coast. Camus's style consists of a moderately complex writing style. Camus's entire novel is centered around the following conflicts: the men's fights with one another, each man's fight with himself, and the town's fight with the plague. Camus also uses the unique approach of concealing the identity of his narrator until the closing chapters of the novel, which allows the novel to close more entertainingly. Camus frequently uses figurative language such as similes and metaphors throughout The Plague. These devices are used by Camus to enhance his vast amount of imagery. Camus's motifs of love, suffering, and exile are apparent throughout the action of the novel. The use of these motifs allows the reader to relate his own life to that of the characters in The Plague. The theme of The Plague is the message that it is possible to find love and hope in the worst of situations.In conclusion, I believe that Albert Camus did a superb job in writing this novel. He touched every emotion of his audience when he published a novel that centered on love, death, tragedy, and hope."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"If I had to list 100 favourite novels, The Plague would be on it. It is a profound and eloquent examination of the human condition. Supposedly an allegory of Fascism/Nazism/occupied France (\\"the plague\\")- it doesn't matter if you don't know this or the history behind it. It stands alone as a great classic of French literature. It is rich in feeling and thought. Do not be put off by the title or the subject matter. It is a wonderful novel in every way.

I didn't quite *love* it, but I came very close. I've been a great fan of Camus ever since I read The Stranger. Where The Stranger is a character study of an extreme example of Camus' idea of the absurd man, The Plague is instead an exploration of the way everyday people deal with the absurd--that is, how they come to terms with the vast, impersonal forces that shape their lives and are completely beyond their control.When Camus explores his ideas by actually showing us how the characters interact with each other, the book is quite compelling. However, there are long stretches when he sidelines into descriptions of the townspeople's behavior in general that amount to thinly veiled philosophical diatribes--which are not bad in themselves, but didactic philosophy is not fiction, and it's quite lazy for Camus to set out with the premise of dramatizing his philosophy, then to sidetrack into merely talking about it.Overall, though, the book is a great read, the ideas are thought-provoking, and the characters--when we get to spend time with them--are very compelling. Not perfect, but a book everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Pages were all there what more is needed? Decent read, not for fun but for papers.

The novel focuses on the everyday events and characters of a norther African town that must deal with slow destruction of their lives as the plague spreads.There were various aspects of this novel that I found somewhat unique and interesting. First, the way Camus deals with the slow evolution of the disaese was particularly fascinating. The citizens are in denial that their lives are being threatened. Eventually panic spreads and individuals deal with the dilemma in various ways. Some question the banality of their existence while others take the moral high ground in a percieved battle of good vs. evil. Camus' take on the situation is sad, poignant and frightening all the same time. The characters are richly developed and you start to root for their survival as you get to know them. The book isn't extremely fast paced but this is counterbalanced by its length.In the wake of 9/11, Katrina, and the recent tsunami, this book has more relevency then ever. Many are questioning the meaning of it all and this book examines what happens in the wake of helplesness.This book isn't for everyone. It can put you in depressed mood but it can also be uplifting at the same time. People who exeperience frequent mood swings or with bi-polar disorder might want to look elsewhere.Bottom Line: Great introduction into possibly the best 20th century French author. Gourmet food for the brain."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The most striking theme in Albert Camus's The Plague is the connections and similarities between people strengthening and becoming apparent in crisis. As such it is not as fatalistic and depressing a book as it might seem. Even in tragedy people come through as loving caring people. As the plague hits and sets in Camus stresses how the town's population behaves as one everyone feeling similarly and acting the same. The journalist, Rambert, greatly misses his wife but is in the end conflicted about escaping the town quarantine. He begins feeling he should be allowed to leave since he was only a visitor with a badly timed visit. Many months later, \\"Tarrou...remarked,...if Rambert wished to take a share in other people's unhappiness, he'd have no time left for happiness. So the choice had to made.\\"That's not it,\\" Rambert rejoined. \\"Until now I always felt a stranger in this town, and that I'd no concern with you people. But now that I've seen what I have seen, I know that I belong here whether I want it or not. This business is everybody's business.\\"It shows the strength of people to hang together as people because they should even if they do not want to. In the beginning the town had many people acting somewhat the same but individually and without it being as obvious. By the end, after the affliction of plague, the people of the town visibly act as one connected as it were by the pain they had to survive. It is a reassuring and well conveyed theme in a book so filled with pain."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague by Albert CamusLet's get this out the way right from the beginning: This is not an easy book. It's the kind of novel where you may find yourself reading a couple of pages and then realize you didn't digest any of it and you haven't the foggiest idea of what you just read. You can do one of three things at this point. One, quickly shake your head and decide to read some graphic novel with plenty of cool pictures. Two, keep reading and hope that maybe things will make sense later. Three, go back and read the same two pages over in an idealistic attempt to decipher what you just read.Of course, it's asking a lot to choose the third option, but if you're interested in obtaining a better understanding of life in general and the overall human condition, or even in changing your basic outlook on life, please give it some heavy consideration. Granted, dedicating a significant amount of time to reading a book about a bubonic-plague-like disease that wipes out half of an Algerian city may not seem like something you'll want to while away a potentially pleasant series of afternoons with. But \\"The Plague\\" beautifully and realistically chronicles (expertly translated by Stuart Gilbert) how a hideous disease reveals the true psychological makeup and belief system of not just one large city's denizens but anyone in anyplace in the world at any time; hence, the beauty of Camus's existentialism. Obviously, Camus's scenario also easily translates to the contemporary horrors of 9/11, the spread of AIDS in Africa, or the tsunami-ravaged areas in southern India, etc.Along with his personal brand of existentialism, Camus also hits on several other favored topics, such as the question of religious faith, his own atheism, and his distaste for the death penalty. These diversions from storytelling into semi-philosophical treatises often mean a death-knell for many overly ambitious contemporary literary writers, many of whom were undoubtedly influenced by Camus. But one can hardly fault these writers for their efforts when one considers that, if successful, one would achieve such a lofty form of art. Camus never preaches; he only presents. Indeed, at times \\"The Plague\\" reads like a highly evolved piece of investigative journalism, albeit a remarkably poignant one that avoids becoming sentimental. \\"They had already seen children die - for many months now death had shown no favoritism - but they had never yet watched a child's agony minute by minute, as they had now been doing since daybreak. Needless to say, the pain inflicted on these innocent victims had always seemed to them to be what in fact it was: an abominable thing. But hitherto they had felt its abomination in, so to speak an abstract way; they had never had to witness over so long a period the death-throes of an innocent child.\\"There are many similarities here with Camus's \\"The Stranger,\\" especially when one considers the use of existentialism, but Camus seems more concerned with the idea of nobility in the face of despair when it comes to the main character of Rieux. Though \\"The Stranger's\\" Meursault is more outwardly amoral than Rieux, they both carry with them a kind of impenetrable detachment that can lead to frustration for the reader. Rieux, however, never gives up on humanity or himself, as Meursault ostensibly has. Meursault, accepting his inevitable death and declining to reach out to the few people with whom he has connections, contrasts Rieux's hope that he will one day be reunited with his loving wife and that he will witness the plague meet its inevitable end.\\"The Plague\\" is a book that takes effort and work to comprehend or even to finish. It no doubt is even more rewarding after a second reading. But, not unlike an afternoon at an art exhibit, you may not completely understand what you experienced, but you know you are a better person because of it."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The book in general was an outstanding piece of how society faces horrible things, lives with them takes it all in to the point of breaking down and then rises up to overcome what ever has been thrown at them.In a town of Oran, some would say they had a bit of a rat problem. At First they came out by ones and twos, but after a couple of days, it was by the fifties and hundreds. People started to get worried, not to mention sick at the sight of hundreds of rats dieing in the streets. At one point,There are truck loads of rats that are picked up in the street. The rats were then taken to a place to be burned. One can only imagine the smell of thousands of burning rats.People wondered why all these rats were coming out and dieing in their streets. Well, they soon found out, because what was once a dead rat, became an epidemic to people. Whatever the rats had, people also got. The symptoms were pretty much the same. Fever, achy body, and other graphic details.Dr. Rieux one of the main characters in the story tries to figure out why all this is happening in the town. Many people have different theries but in the end it comes down to one nasty bacteria. After they figure out what it is, they quarintine the town and lock the gates. Dr. Rieux and many other people go through alot of obstacles through the way trying to figure out how to end this epidemic.In my opinion, this book was exciting in some parts,ecpecially when talking about the plague, rats, and people dieing. It gave great detail to what was happening. The author gives great detail to the characters and surrounding, but still lets your imagination run wild. I liked the fact that it was a book of fiction, but also could very easily happen to anyone of our cities. One thing I did not like about the book was that Camus(the author)jumped from person to person and went on and on about them, giving information about them that had no relavence to the story. Through the whole book there are many surprises that will attract you to keep reading. A big one is in the end, but to tell it would just be foolish.

The most common complaint I have heard about it is how long the descriptions are. To appreciate this book you need to read it while thinking about what a brilliant allegory it is to the holocaust.

First they came for the Jews, but we were not Jews so we said nothing Then they came for the homosexuals, but we were not homosexual so we said nothing Then they came for the gypsies and the blacks and the Asians and the old and the handicapped, but we were none of these so we said nothing Then one day they came for us, and no one was left to say anythingI definatly recommend this book.

The subject matter is not pleasant reading, but it is engrossing. I appreciated the lack of moralizing in this work. It is good ocassionally to realize that the world cannot be neatly summed up by authors. The devastations that humanity faces in the form of plagues, wars, tsunamis and earthquakes are not to be reasoned away by mortal men. They are or they were and there is no deeper meaning behind their having been other than that they happened.Camus's _Plague_ is that type of work, untidy perhaps because it refuses to follow the conventional author as omniscient being routine. I believe that you will appreciate this work. I do not give it full marks because this is not really my type of novel.

First, I read The Stranger. Today, I just finished The Plague. Unlike some reviewers who &quot;had&quot; to read the book, I have had the pleasure of voluntarily escaping into both of these masterful classics, which were apparently not required reading for me in high school or college. I did not select them for a summer beach read, but read them after my husband brought them home from the library. Suffice it to say, our dinnertime discussions have had a little more depth of late.One of the eeriest qualities of Camus' writing is how the applicability of his timeless writing gives one pause: in a post 9/11 society, even one of his last sentences in The Plague takes on new meaning: &quot;...in the never ending fight against terror and its relentless onslaughts...&quot;My husband worked on a project in Shanghai during the SARS epidemic there and noted that he could identify with some aspects of the book, especially as he went about the town as a tourist and saw the shopkeepers manning virtually deserted stores. I recall helping supply his suitcase with Purell and dustmasks and wondering if he would wind up being quarantined.I recall shuddering some years ago at a newspaper account of nurses faced with the fear of encountering an unknown, lethal disease at local New Mexico hospitals. The disease was eventually diagnosed as Hantavirus but the nurses at the hospital were merely given ice cream in the employee lounge as some sort of comfort-measure. At the time, I was glad that I had not pursued a career in nursing.Nevertheless, I am in total admiration for the characters of Dr. Rieux and Tarrou and the book has somehow, hopefully, ennobled me, in a way that motherhood and maturity have not completed. I have a much greater admiration for those in the medical profession and much more sympathy for humanity and the plight of being human than I did before reading this book. Would that I aspire to being like Tarrou...siding with the victim in any situation, &quot;...so as to reduce the damage done.&quot;&quot;Hats off&quot; to Camus for changing 21st century lives!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"40 years ago Camus was all the rage.The forgotten student union coffee shop and Greenwich Village Expresso debates of the first half of the 60s weren't all over Communism, unilateral nuclear disarmament (by the US), whether the US had any business in Southeast Asia, what 'we' should do about Cuba' and how enlightened young whites could best help blacks attain the middle-class goals of better living conditions, radios, equal access to public education, housing, restrooms and voting booths. All the various soon-to-be-dead Kennedys were alive, Communism as an ideal was still arguable (though lousily manifested in the USSR and PRC) and Martin Luther King was unknown, both for his 'dream', and for his purloined doctoral dissertation. The value of Christianity was still up for grabs in most of our young minds. An effective Village pickup line was a sneering, \\"What? You don't believe in Free Love?\\" In that hallowed atmosphere we discussed Camus, Sartre and Existentialism. We generally missed the point.Nevermind Existentialism. The Plague is a good book. A great book about humans, stress, isolation and the human condition. A French seaport town stricken by plague finds itself isolated and dying for most of a year. The narrators watch the developments and phases of the epidemic within individuals, the government and the stricken. After a recent re-reading of this book I wonder why we never simply appreciated it for what it is, instead of using The Plague as one of the several platforms for debate in the battles with and for our spiritual selves. I wonder why we refused to see the virtue of the book without forcing it to be something less obvious than it is.I recommend this book for anyone. I suspect it can't be read from any level without appreciation."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"As compared to The Stranger, Albert Camus' The Plague also deals with a harsh outside world that imposes upon the main character, or protagonist. Published only five years after Camus' additional existiential/athiest novel The Stranger, The Plague is a much more developed context that deals with Camus' perspective on life, humanity, and our existence/purpose on earth. His perception on pursuing a normal life in a mad world are much more apparent and noticable than his perceptions in The Stranger of a man that has \\"gone mad\\" in a normal world.The Plague is an excellent, graphic novel that, like all of Camus' works, deals with one basic principal: atheism. While untimely death and disease- in addition to the absence of a wife, he notes that he does in fact have a job. He is a doctor, so he must do his job as a doctor with no questions asked. A reader may observe the manners in which Dr. Rieux, his companions, and prominent men of the community react to the worsening plague that is spreading throughout the city of Oran. Dr. Rieux's conclusion that there is more ot admire in humans than there is to despise significantly impacted my outlook on life; positively, of course.I would recommend this book to young adults, and people that are going through rough times within their lives. Like the many novels of Albert Camus- The Plague is not another one of your \\"happy ending\\" novels. A reader must be able to draw their own conclusions and accept that life is a challenge that should not be taken for granted. Because this book deals with the concept of Atheism, the absence of religion may turn certain readers away from reading this novel. I challenge these readers to look past their passion for religion, as this novel is a touching, refreshing, and a most excellent example of how any town in the world may react to an outbreak of disease, or epidemic."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Set in the Algerian town of Oran, 'The Plague' is superficially an account of an infectious outbreak within the city and of the subsequent response of the townspeople as they each accept the reality of the plague in their own way. The setting and conditions then parallel other 'plagues' of the author's time (and ours, of course) - from abstractions such as ideology, to manifest afflictions such as the fascist occupation of France during World War II. However, because of the amoral and faceless nature of this particular sickness, Camus is able to strip his narrative of useless recriminations and distractions, and instead portray in a rather clinical way the town's response. These reactions vary wildly, yet Camus makes little in the way of value judgments. Although there are characters who, to my mind, act courageously and are self-sacrificing, the author refuses to acknowledge them as heroes, and in the same way stops short of calling those who have taken advantage of the situation for personal gain villains. But Camus is not so detached as to render his story emotionless - instead, it reads as much as I would expect it to, with the narrator sounding exhausted after his ordeal, and realizing that the labels we may feel are handy shortcuts to describe reality before experiencing an extreme trial are generally useless to us once we've emerged onto the other side.This is, I think, Camus greatest accomplishment within this novel - or at least, the aspect that resonated deepest with me. I thought Camus' ability to condense these thoughts into a coherent narrative was particularly mesmerizing. So much so that it overshadows the importance of any literary flaws I felt it had - there are definitely worthy criticisms of 'The Plague' - they were just not sufficient to detract from the primary themes.The plague that visits the town may be effective as a way of illustrating the arbitrariness of life (or its absurdity), and also act as an uncannily apt allegory for the Nazi occupation of Paris, yet I marveled most over Camus' ability to overcome the temptation of writers (and societies) to romanticize grave events like the one in this novel. To often, for the sake of entertainment, or because of previously held beliefs, stories of hardship often have a manipulative emotional appeal, as if the author is trying to rally me into a certain way of thinking by overemphasizing the 'good' and the 'bad' aspects. No writer can completely escape himself enough to achieve pure objectivity, and Camus doesn't either - there are plenty of ideas here he is trying to put across. But he escapes blatant contrivances, and examines human behavior under extreme circumstances, arriving at conclusions I assume he developed while actually experiencing similar conditions - as a member of the resistance during World War II. In this way, the exhausted truths that the main character, Dr. Rieux, comes to terms with by the end of the plague feel verified.One of the central questions Camus deals with in the novel is the obligation of people in such circumstances in the absence of any higher law - whether that is a supernatural law or an abstraction created by man. Without a 'right' or 'wrong', why continue to fight against the disease, the plague - in the face of life's ultimate absurdity, why struggle? Readers will have to determine for themselves if Camus answers this question to their satisfaction - much like the ideas I found within 'The Stranger', there are many of his conclusions that I have trouble reconciling. But unlike his previous book, the 'truths' Camus has tried to present in 'The Plague' sound less like a man who is trying to convince himself as well as his audience, and more like someone who has quietly listed his observations and left the rest to the reader.I think it is unfortunate that 'The Stranger' receives more notoriety than 'The Plague', but it probably has much to do with the pacing, and Camus' tendency in his second novel to sound rather dry and clinical. I think there is a purpose behind that style, or at least it seemed to dovetail quite well with his objectives, but for someone reading simply for the story, I have a feeling they would think it drags. I also felt as if Camus made a special effort in the narrative to hold up dogmatic religion as useless. This is the only section of the book where I thought Camus failed - not so much because I agree or disagree, but because I felt as though he was simply too obvious. These points subtract little from the book's overall effectiveness though. After 'The Stranger', I was nearly convinced I'd read all of Camus that was necessary for me - what a shame it would have been to stop there! I found 'The Plague' extremely thought-provoking, and very influential at this time of my life - and one of the handful of post-war novels I've read that I feel I'd have been poorer for missing. Hats off!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague by Albert Camus merits recognition because it illuminates two universal truths, one that is still present today and one that will always exist. In this seemingly completely existentialist novel, Camus forces us to realize that, however difficult it may be to admit, most of us go through life exiled from the rest of the world. When given a second look, The Plague can be revealed to identify the enemy to which, according to Camus, humankind must never surrender.One thought-provoking topic that can quickly be discerned from the novel is isolation and exile. As soon as the city of Oran, Algeria is quarantined, its residents find themselves alone and yearning for contact with the outside. Although the citizens of Oran do not leave their homes, they realize they have been exiled from the world: \\"it was undoubtedly the feeling of exile--that sensation of a void within which never left us, that irrational longing to hark back to the past or else to speed up the march of time\\" (part 2 page 65). But, tragically, the citizens of Oran are not strangers to this overwhelming emptiness.Even before the town gates were closed to contain the plague, the townspeople already isolated themselves from each other. They did not lead fulfilled lives and, according to the narrator, \\"everyone is bored... their chief aim in life is, as they call it, \`doing business'\\" (part 1 page 4). The citizens of Oran took their families and friends for granted, and concentrated instead on money, as though peace of mind was a given and not something for which one would need to be grateful. Such an attitude has become more prominent than ever in our fast-paced material-driven society, with a staggering number of people pointlessly going through the daily motions without ever stopping to make time for others. This striking similarity makes the novel extremely relevant in today's world.However discouraging this portrait of a discontent city may seem, Camus whispers a secret message over the loud drama of the story, and this contributes to The Plague being a noteworthy novel. Camus portrays characters like Raymond Rambert who join plague-eradicating efforts, such as sanitary squads, in a favorable light. In addition, Dr. Rieux, a main character throughout the story, works tirelessly at relieving the suffering of the diseased. Both men are on the frontlines of the chief conflict in the novel: humans versus human suffering.Although Camus believes suffering and death are the meaningless results of life, he does acknowledge those who at least make an effort to fight these pestilences of the human race. For Camus, surrendering to the inevitable pain and loss in life is not an option, and his characters reflect this ideal. To fully appreciate the undeniable value of The Plague, one must look past the obvious and discover how Camus depicts lifestyles similar to ours and how he cleverly conceals an undercurrent that runs through the novel and supports those who battle against the affliction that plagues all of humanity."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"It's a book, it has words, it works, what else can we say. Used for school and passed the course"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is a story about an outbreak of the bubonic plague in a city of about two hundred thousand people sometime around, as the author puts it, 19___. So we don't know the exact date. But since the book was published in 1947, I assume it occurred during the early nineteen forties. We do know were it took place. It was in the small seaport city of Oran, the capital of Algiers, which is located on the northern coast of Africa, just across the Mediterranean from Spain.I liked this book, but to be honest, it was a difficult read. There's not too much excitement between its pages. That is, unless you're of those people who actively participates in the development and implementation of emergency response plans. In that case, this book should be required reading, because The Plague is a textbook example of what can happen during a major biological outbreak. Everything's in chronological order from the view point of a mysterious narrator. First, there was the trouble of indentifying the exact organism. And then, as the disease progressed, there was the problem of inadequate medically facilities, including doctors, medical staff, and the transportation system to get the sick to a clinic. Then there was the quarantine problem. And since the plague in this story quickly morphed into its more deadly form, pneumonic plague, special consideration had to be given to natural congregations of citizens. Places like churches, shopping centers, prisons and jails, and the list goes on. And if that weren't enough, there simply weren't enough workers, civil or volunteer, to help with the gathering of dead bodies and cremations and burials. And once the doctors and town leaders finally knew exactly what they were dealing with, there was the long wait for life-giving serum, and organized inoculations. Somebody had to decide who got what, when and where. Basically, for the citizens of Oran, the whole thing was a nightmare in epic proportion to anything they had ever experienced.In 1957, the book's author, Albert Camus, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. That tells you right there that the man could write, and write well. But like I said, other than just reading about the detection and management of an unexpected out break of plague, and it's nightmarish devastation of a medium sized city during the early nineteen hundreds, in a sort of ho-hum, day-by-day blow writing style--like listening to a monotonic speaker--I really wouldn't bother paying the money. In fact, I've known several people who just couldn't make it passed the first 150 pages of this 300 page the book. But if you're a student of hazardous threat agents and emerging diseases, or if you just like reading about this stuff, or if you've never read anything by Albert Camus and would like to tee for yourself what he was all about, this book would definitely be the ticket. I give the book four stars."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The item I ordered arrived in a very timely fashion and was in excellent condition."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"the edition was not the one shown in the picture, but the book arrived promptly and in great condition"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I read this book when I was researching the philosophy of existentialism. As far as the 20th century goes, Jean-Paul Sartre was probably more influential than Albert Camus in the movement. Camus wrote only in literary genres whereas Sartre wrote formal philosophical works in addition to novels and plays.Anyway, the novel moves very slowly (about 10 months of people suffering from plague) in a town called Oran in Algeria in the 1940's. Camus' contribution to existentialism was the concept of the Absurd (the condition or state in which human beings exist in a meaningless, irrational universe wherein people's lives have no purpose or meaning) and this concept is present in this novel. Aside from the slow pace, I find the whole philosophy illogical and somewhat ridiculous. The despair of existentialism brings to a head the problems when one abandons God.One of the most interesting parts in the novel is where Dr. Rieux (the narrator) and Tarrou discuss the Plague (which may be interpreted as a metaphor for the struggles of life). Tarrou says of the Doctor's medical struggle against the Plague, &quot;But your victories will never be lasting; that's all.&quot; Then Tarrou asks, &quot;Only, I now can picture what this plague must mean for you.&quot; The Doctor replies, &quot;Yes. A never ending defeat.&quot; (page 128). In another instance, Tarrou and Rieux are discussing God. Rieux says, &quot;Do you believe in God, Doctor?&quot; &quot;No... I'm fumbling in the dark, struggling to make something out.&quot; (page 126). On page 127, Rieux says that he is &quot;... fighting against creation as he found it.&quot; This quote evokes the thought of an existentialist who shakes his fist against the Heavens and then seeks to live out his life in a struggle that is ultimately meaningless. One of the most poignant quotes describes the state of the townspeople, &quot;Hostile to the past, impatient of the present, and cheated of the future, we were much like those whom men's justice, or hatred, forces to live behind prison bars.&quot; (page 73).This novel communicates how existentialists see life: despair, suffering, pain and evil. The &quot;happy&quot; ending could be seen as a mere lull in the storm and I think the novel would have had a more forceful impact if this ending were omitted. The one idea that I could draw from the ending was the idea that we must enjoy the -&gt;moment&lt;- for all its worth because we are only here a for a moment; life is ultimately ephemeral and meaningless. This could be called the existentialist \\"hope\\"; though existence has no meaning we can somehow bravely infuse meaning into it through our choices. Why after all this did I give a 4-star rating? I think this novel is a good example of literary existentialism and I think I now understand the philosophy better. However, the philosophy is desperately wrong so, I took off one star. For a Christian evaluation of the philosophy, see Ravi Zacharias' lectures and his book, \\"Can Man Live Without God?\\"I wonder how this novel compares with Camus' two other well-known works, \\"The Fall,\\" and the Stranger (L'&Eacute;tranger). I will probably read them later this year."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I picked this up simply because I like reading good epidemiology/medical horror stories. I was surprised to find that there is much more to this book than that. This is a really great novel, whether you read it quickly and superficially, or take the time to think about the deeper meanings and morals that really set this book apart from most \\"hot zone\\" style books. I highly recommend The Plague to anyone interested in learning more."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"All I can say is WOW! everyone must read this for themselves so that is why i will only say that."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Slow moving, but very lucid writing. In the end, the book seemed more like filler material than anything else. It's part cronicle, part philosophy, part religious discussion w/o a strong message."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Saramago cannot help but to be compared to Camus, because human nature in extremis is also a strong concern in The Plague. The main character: a doctor by the name of Rieux, experiences the plague first-hand in his hometown. Rieux, like his neighbors, is ignorant to his surroundings. Throughout his experiences, it is obvious that he never looks into the eyes of reality until it is shoved in his face forcefully. He walks out of his door to step on a bloody rat, and instead of blaming infection he questions the waste management of the town. Franois Mauriac, upon exchange of editorials with Camus commented on the history behind the novel as an allegory for the German occupation of France: Controversy has put me up with one among you-certainly not the least formidable. The fever of your novel has reminded me of the pain of those years, the painful memories of my murdered friends, are what led me to the position I took: the Nazis, like rats are they! (30 November 1946) Camus, like Mauriac, took the same position , for he had actually been in the town of Oran when the German invasion took place, and his ties were severed from his wife and child. When he wrote his novel, The Plague, he portrayed himself as a essayist trying to reunite with his family: who is trying to fit in amongst a population who refutes his ideas as a rallyist, and an existentialist. His character: Rambert is a star shining amongst the haphazard and banal of his surroundings. His concerns are valid, and he is a little impatient at times, but as Camus writes: &quot;you can get through the days there without trouble, once you have formed habits. And since habits are precisely what our town encourages, all is for the best&quot; Rambert's first contact in the town is the concierge: M. Michel, the know-it-all of the town, the closest thing the town has to a mayor. M. Michel, as providence would have it is the first victim of the plague, very fitting that this metaphor for Nazist evil has cut the head off the town's leadership, and installed its reign of terror. A major component of this moving book is the longing for the outside world, and the people that live there, that the inhabitants of the stricken city experience. As a result of these feelings, the inhabitants find themselves understanding each other better, as does the reader. And when one day Rambert told him that he liked waking up at four in the morning and thinking of his beloved Paris, the doctor guessed easily enough, basing this on his own experience, that this was his favorite time for conjuring up pictures of the woman from whom he was now parted. This was, indeed, the hour when he could feel surest she was wholly his. Till four in the morning one is seldom doing anything and at that hour, even if the night has been a night of betrayal, one is asleep . Yes, everyone sleeps at that hour, and this is reassuring, since the great longing of an unquiet heart is to possess constantly and consciously the loved one, or, failing that, to be able to plunge the loved one, when a time of absence intervenes, into a dreamless sleep timed to last unbroken until the day they meet again.&quot; this novel has been beautifully translated and it was enjoyable to the end."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"There are more things in heaven and in earth than dreamt of in Camus' philsophy; but it is a lucid dream, as far as it goes. The story takes place in a drab town in North Africa. There is something dreary also about the narrator, who does not so much deny his heroism, as despise it. (Like an alter-ego of the narrator in Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, who despises his villainy.) One does not notice flowers or taste food much in Oran, and one gets the feeling that the buildings are gray. One wonders if Camus knows any other kind of town, or any other kind of life. The book is almost as dreary as 1984, and without the meadow where Orwell's lovers found pleasure. But perhaps that is part of what makes it a great mood piece.The novel's main weakness is philosophical. It seems to me that good philosophy, if not art, having assigned itself so sweeping a theme as the meaning of suffering, will try to represent positions it attacks truthfully. Solzhenitsyn understands his Marxists, and Dostoevsky his atheists. It seems to me this is one place Camus falls short. I found something bizarre in the attack Camus waged against what he seemed to think was the Christian idea of suffering. &quot;There are more things to admire in men than to despise,&quot; he argued. &quot;Everyone is more or less sick of the plague.&quot; &quot;Until my dying day I shall refuse to love a scheme of things in which children are put to torture.&quot; What is bizarre is that Camus seems to think he is attacking Christianity here. Actually, he is echoing some of the truths it has taught Western culture: man made in the image of God, original sin that one might call a sickness, the call of the prophets to rescue the downtrodden.Camus' priest, who says that the townspeople should not fight the disease, is at best one of the straight men out of the book of Job, at worst a heretic. The skeptical doctor, on the other hand, is a figure of Christ in one dimension. Like Rieux, Christians have always &quot;fought against creation as we found it,&quot; because we follow a man who risked his life to heal. Like Rieux, Jesus was not too heroic to show fear or doubt, and also came to a moment of alienation from God. In fact, some say the Gospel first caught on largely because Christians were the only people in the Roman Empire willing to nurse the sick during plagues. By contrast, French existentialists come late to the healing profession.The question that never seems to occur to anyone in this book, or in the reviews below, is, could the state of having no illusions Camus recommends be the biggest self-delusion of all? Considering my own life and those of people I know, the Gospels are more realistic than the Plague, precisely because in them, tones of black and gray fit into a larger pattern that includes more cheerful colors as well. Miracles, the Ressurection, and the reality of a God who answers prayer, are in my opinion truths that must be faced by any person who wants to construct a complete picture of reality. (Not to mention meadows with flowers, children opening presents at Christmas, the sound of cicattas after rain.) Camus limits himself both by artistic design, and by materialistic dogma, to show life from a certain, narrow angle, and does it well. But it would be a terrible mistake to impose that view on all of reality, as Camus invites his readers to do. Camus does not add to orthodoxy, but subtracts from it -- and from life.Camus discovered death, and depicts it well. If he had discovered life, he would have been a more complete philosopher; but perhaps he wouldn't have won the Nobel Prize for literature. Read this excellent book, and let its truths sink into your soul. Then reach for Chesterton, Dickens, or Wu Cheng En -- or even Solzhenitsyn, who went through worse hells than a plague and came out more cheerful -- and see what Camus missed. Better yet, read the Gospels, and see more of it.One minor complaint on the artistic side. How is it that Rieux's friends felt free to drop in on him at all hours during the height of a plague? Considering the doctors I know, this seems to me almost as big a miracle as if he'd laid hands on them and they jumped out of their beds and went home. Author, Jesus and the Religions of Man d.marshall@sun.ac.jp"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Neither as bleak nor as depressing as some readers have found it, &quot;The Plague&quot; seems to me the work of a profound humanist. In this immensely fascinating work, Camus sides with the little man who does what he must in the face of great adversity. The reader really gets to know the book's (almost exclusively male) characters, and whenever one of them succumbs to the raging illness, it always comes as a shock. There are many powerful scenes in the book, and many quotable lines. One of my personal favorites is that &quot;love is never strong enough to find the words befitting it.&quot; Through sentiments like this one, Camus reveals himself to be a humanist, in addition to an existentialist. Sure, the book can be read straight or on a number of symbolic levels, but on any one of them, Camus' great concern for man's lot shines through. This is an important book, and a damn fine read, to boot. A minor quibble: Has anyone noticed the mistake Camus makes in the book? Namely, in one scene, Monsieur Othon's son is called Philippe; 200 pages later, he is called Jacques! But this slip of Camus' copy editor should in no wise deter anyone from investigating this marvelous work."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is such a good book. I don't often read such good quality writing and it actually makes me a little bit ashamed that my language skills are so poor and that the quality of modern literature is so poor by comparison.This is a must read book."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Add to that the author's early death, still fashionable and cool Existentialist connections, and well, Frenchness, and it is hard for anyone to consider his work objectively. The only true test would be to imagine the response of a modern day critic who had no idea who the author was. If I were to put this book to that test, I'm afraid many would say that although competently written, to place this in the top ten books ever written would be a gross overrating of its qualities. A different reaction would result from The Stranger/Outsider, a strikingly original work that few who've read it will forget. I would have given the book 3 and a half stars if that was an option, but 4 just seems too many.Why Camus only reveals who the narrator is till very late in the book, forcing some to re-read it, is revealed in the Appendix of The Myth of Sisyphus, in his analysis of Kafka's writings in the light of his concept of 'the absurd'. He points out here that part of the magic of Kafka is that very often the unexpected or open endings of his stories force a re-read on the reader. However, a re-read of this book in the light of the information of who the narrator is only brings to light several flaws in the story, situations where the narrator was not present, and could not possibly have had any idea of what had happened. It is hard to believe that the author overlooked this, but equally hard to believe that the oversight was intended for some effect it would have on the reader. Thus, when it is ultimately revealed that the whole time it has been Dr Rieux narrating, it seems rather implausible.Finally, the book has some moral ambiguities, such as a doctor fighting to control an epidemic, who out of 'humanitarian' grounds allows an individual to break the quarantine and possibly cause it to spread to other cities or countries. It is truly immoral behaviour for any doctor not to prevent such a breaking of the quarantine, as hard as it must be on the individual, and it is the height of selfishness for anyone to think that they should be the exception to the rule, when all others remain separated from their loved ones, or have lost them. All in all, I'd find out some more about this book before buying it, and don't assume that because you like the genius of The Stranger/Outsider, that this is anything like that. Like I said, a large part of Camus' fashionability in the English world is due to his Frenchness (many English speakers have a snobbish passion for French literature that throws a golden light on anything of French origin), his Existentialist connections, Nobel Prize and early death. Keep that in mind when trying to judge this book's qualities by the rave reviews you'll read here. Interesting, but not essential reading."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Life is hard and then you die. In this story, that view of life is concentrated. We are all on a conveyor belt relentlessly moving to death. Camus speeds up the belt dramatically to force the reader to think about the meaning of life."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"On the surface, this is a story of a plague outbreak in colonial Oran, Algeria, but Camus is actually giving an extended allegory to the Nazi Occupation of France while reiterating his idea of the Absurd.The good Dr. Bernard Rieux is comparable to Charles DeGaulle in his constant effort to battle against the forces of oppression. Rieux along with Dr. Castel warn the city government of the dangers of the plague, but the government drags its feet. This is comparable to the feet-dragging and mismanagement by the French government in response to the German Blitz of World War Two.The worst characters in the novel could also be considered the most colluding members of French society to the Nazi occupation. The character Cottard seems to revel in the new \\"occupation\\" by the plague. It makes him feel less alone and that everyone is suffering through the personal struggles he must deal with constantly. He greedily excuses himself from responsibility to fight the plague at all. Camus is probably comparing Cottard to the fascist Vichy Government set up by the Nazis after France's fall. Cottard, because he is a fascist, is delighted that everyone must now conform to his sick ideals.The public itself represents the general French public during the occupation. They try to escape the plague by going to movies and plays, but soon reality stops them from enjoying even that when the actors all start dying from plague. This demonstrates Camus's belief that most people were indifferent and chose to be helpless during the occupation (Camus founded the left-wing Resistance newspaper Combat).I quite enjoyed all the allusions made in The Plague. A good novel for all readers and a definite must read for fans of existentialism."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Several years ago I made a concerted effort to upgrade the quality of my reading material. I wasn't exactly a comic book aficionado; however I had failed to read most of the classics during my years of formal education. Since that time, I've read more than my fair share of Dickens, Steinbeck and Hemingway. I've also dabbled in some of the more recent, highly acclaimed literature, happily in some cases, in others not so much. It was never my intent to go so far as to take on the heavy lifting involved with works by such authors as Sartre, Nietzsche or Camus (I'm certainly no philosopher), however upon picking up a copy of Camus' The Plague, and reading a few paragraphs, its brevity convinced me to take a shot.This relatively short work, easily read in two sittings, is concerned with an outbreak of Bubonic Plague in the Algerian port city on Oran at some point in the 1940s. While there is some description of the disease and the impact on the city's populace, as you would expect, the bulk of the novel concerns a handful of the citizenry (a broad cross section), their experiences and mental state as the outbreak gradually worsens and society begins to break down.It has been said that the Plague is an allegory for the Nazi occupation of France and that may certainly be true, given the time frame. In any event, while this is not my preferred style of work, I was pleasantly surprised at the accessibility of the prose and had no problem appreciating the author's message. That said, it is unlikely that I will seek out other such work. At least now I can say that I read Camus."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Extraordinary! I can't remember loving a book as much as this one--for the way it's structured, for it's sweeping themes and philosophies, for the poetry of the sentences, and the way it moved me emotionally."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book will stay with me for a long time.It chronicles an epidemic of the plague in a French port town in Africa. Well written and deeply meaningful in its implications on life, love, and spirituality, the characters drew me in to their lives and heartache as the novel progressed. The character set is small enough to allow readers intimacy with them in a way that isn't possible with a larger cast (I'm looking at you One Hundred Years of Solitude!). Camus won the Nobel prize for literature and it's easy to see why- the man spoke to some of the most pressing struggles of the human heart with compelling stories and crisp dialogue.What also marks 'The Plague' as a cut above the ordinary is its power to inspire readers to further research the subject matter of the novel. What is the history of the plague? What factors are instrumental in its recession after it sweeps through a community? Do we have effective means in our day and age of reversing the course of the disease should it take hold in one of our cities? These are are the questions I am left with at the end of the novel. In this way, the novel promotes science education as well as philosophical and moral questioning.I tend to get quite evangelical about great books I've come across and this novel is no exception: everyone needs to read this book."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"... especially his reputation, awards and other works, I picked this one up on a suggestion from a friend \\"Read any of Albert Camus?\\".First opinion is ... dark. Camus writes with a dark tone which, given the subject matter, is very fitting. His narrative explores all aspects of the individual situations the book takes us into. For me, the plague, is somewhat of an allegory that could be adapted to any situation. Like an invading army shored up at the borders, the Plague, creeps inward and decimates a small town. This could be likened to change, of any description, deemed for the worse. The town in the book becomes isolated causing introspection among the inhabitants.Why us? Well, why not us? What did we do to deserve this? Well, in all honesty, nothing. Change happens regardless.I like his work, I like the detached aspect of his writing. It's very moody and there's a sort of helplessness that, at first resisted, becomes accepted. He does, very beautifully, highlight the amazing human ability that is adaptation. Humanity survives above everything else.It can be a struggle in places and, to be honest, there was more than once I wished I was reading something else. Reading other critical reviews, this translated version is not the best. Again, I'm not a Camus expert so I have nothing to compare it too. I'll read more of Camus' work as, already mentioned, I like his mood setting and exploratory nature."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I read this immediately after reading The Stranger, Camus' most famous and critically-acclaimed novel. I thought that novel was outstanding -- a clear classic from the very beginning.This novel, while very good, does not rise to that level. Camus' straight-forward and unique storytelling style is not present to the same degree in this novel, and the story is less enthralling.That being said, this is a very good and enlightening novel. It poses important existential questions regarding life and relationships in the face of inevitable death and humanity. Some characters become heroes in this novel; others give in to weakness. The novel, at its core, forces the reader to ask himself what he would do in the same situation."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I was incredibly taken in by The Plague. The languaga is so ,agnificent that I imagine the original French must be even more so. The way Camus conveys the mindsets of the townfolk serves as a perfect example of the hu,an condition."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Alright, this book is fairly long and many times a dry read, just like most literature. It is much easier to pick up a page-turner with a cheap cliffhanger at the end of each chapter, finish it in a couple of nights, and promptly forget about it. When you finish THE PLAGUE, you are subject to a feeling of complete satisfaction. It's a book you don't forget.Almost every aspect of human nature is covered in Camus's novel. It catalogues a very simple event: a plague strikes a city's population. Not in the Crichton-thriller way, but in the more subtle, Nobel prize way. The inhabitants first choose to ignore the plague, as if it is just a passing occurence. Trade continues, occupants go about their daily lives; no change. Then the people start to notice, filtering their observations upwards to the city council. After prolonged debate, the city council is eventually forced to close the gates of the city. The general populace continues to ignore the problem, politely asking if they can leave the city to visit their aunt, if they can leave because they are not a resident...you know how it ends. Everybody stays, fish in a barrel for the virus.Eventually the people become outraged, and finally grow weary of the struggle and tacitly accept their roles as the victims. The novel follows the exact pattern that children, dogs, or any other animals follow when they are confronted with an unsolvable problem: denial, polite engagement, outrage, placidity/acceptance. It's a very interesting look into the human character and the interpersonal relations built within are fascinating as well.Without giving too much away, it is safe to say that Mr. Jolley is right in his assessment of this book; it is no exaggeration that THE PLAGUE is one of the top ten novels ever written. You're in for a very thought-provoking read which rewards you at the end. Truly a book that you can appreciate for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"During the late 1980's to early 1990's, it seemed as though nothing could stop the relentlessly increasing toll of AIDS on the gay community in the United States. Having known of this novel but not having read it, I finally turned to it in the hope that it offered some kind of insight into a time when gales of death swept over gays as much as it did the inhabitants of Oran. Although the book may be read on several levels, I was familiar with the description of it as an allegory on the Nazi occupation of France during World War II. (Camus risked torture and death as a member of the Resistance at that time.)Its chronicling of human beings varied and invariable reactions to catastrophe will ensure this book being read long after we are all dead. Doctor Rieux, from whose point of view the story is told is very much like another of Camus' heroes, Sisyphus. Numbed he may be, but he will not give up. No matter that the he can do nearly nothing for the tormented sufferers; he will still try to alleviate their agonies until the end. Even if the doctor himself should be plague-stricken, he at least dies resisting, knowing that he has fulfilled his thing-to-do, his raison d'etre. By contrast, the Jesuit Father Paneloux in his facile homily towards the beginning of the book complacently notes that the pure in heart have nothing to fear, and that the plague is God's test of sinful humanity. Unfortunately for the good father, after several weeks of the just and unjust alike being mown down, he witnesses the hours-long, excruciating death of a young boy while helping the doctor tend the sick and dying. Admirably, Camus does not set up straw men here, the most harrowing part of this book (perhaps of any book). If Doctor Rieux cannot believe in a God who would permit children to die in torment, then the priest admits that God's actions are completely incomprehensible, i.e., his neat teleology is proven to be made of gossamer when push comes to shove.There are lines here and there that stick to the reader: \\"Are you not afraid of the plague, Madame?\\" Doctor Rieux's elderly mother (who has been leaving supper out for her late-returning son) is asked. With her capital good sense, she replies that at her age, \\"there is not much left to be afraid of.\\" While the city is sealed off from the outside world, the habitues of the cafes sit silent and disconsolate, knowing now the loneliness of exiles, or of prisoners \\"forced by man's justice or man's hatred to live behind prison walls.\\" \\"Even the past savored only of regret...\\" because the townspeople were in the grip of \\"memor[ies] that served no purpose.\\"Finally the plague relents and the city gates swing open. Life resumes with its little rituals and pleasures, but the plague only sleeps, awaiting another day when it will go forth into the streets and houses of the happy city.Those who lived through the AIDS epidemic in the United States can never forget not only the plague itself, but the other \\"plagues\\" of willful ignorance, deliberate fear mongering, and hatred (naked or disguised) that followed, and that Camus addresses metaphorically. These have subsided somewhat now, due partly to apathy and partly to the unwillingness to be risk embarrassment at the memory. (At least shame is not completely dead.) At present however, there are ominous clouds on the horizon ranging from a possible global influenza pandemic to potentially severe economic dislocations triggered by unprecedented and unsustainable levels of public debt. Gay men have borne witness in their bodies and souls to the evils of disaster itself and the fatuous complacency, malevolent fantasy and scapegoating that so frequently follow. Also the unexpected courage, and love that so many found in themselves. Anyone wishing to gain an appreciation of these things at second hand would be well advised to read this book."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is one of the truly great books. It is by far Camus' best. It opens with the description of Oran and already in the first pages Camus creates a world. The story as it will be told is filled with interesting characters. And it is one of the few novels I can think of that really gives a sense of a collective action and drama of a city perhaps a civilization struggling for its life against the Plague.Camus story has more than one hero. But the principal one Dr. Rieux in his silent devotion and his consistent effort to resist and stem the plague is the major one. His seeming stoicism combined with his courageous activity seem to define for Camus the ideal human stance in the face of a now indifferent and now cruel universe. Camus in this book is providing a parable of how Mankind struggles with Evil. And the Evil some say he is referring to is the evil of Nazism in the second War. But the Evil too can be seen as a kind of general Terror which recurs and recurs in human experience. The story of the book, and this is one of the most powerful things about the book is dramatic. The struggle against the Plague is the community's collective struggle and we follow it in the action of the novel. Camus traces the Plague by tracing its reactions on different characters, including one who profits by the Plague, who is freed of his criminal exceptionalism by it. There are also lovable minor characters such as the would - be - writer who writes over and over again the sentence of his novel. And there is too the Priest Father Paneloux and his effort to use the language of Theology to deal with the Evil he is seeing day by day. All these characters most notably Rieux in his relation to his second wife go through the Plague together .And the story of how it ends and how a certain relief comes to the city present in a way the triumph of the human efforts and at the same time a kind of proof of how Man is simply a toy in the hands of forces beyond his control. The Plague in any case Camus makes clear is not destroyed forever, but is gone for now , and will recur again sometime in the future as Evil continues to recur in human history.My brief summary does not in any way do justice to this remarkable and moving work, written with great restraint and beauty."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The book is fantastic; Edenbook's sloppy, negligent conversion to kindle is a waste of your time.What Edenbooks does is take a public domain work, run it through a substandard text recognition program, then foist it on the public without so much as a proof read. It is basically one long text file, without chapter headings or Kindle-enabled sections.There are so many typos, many of them confusing grammatical typos that lose sentence ends and, combined with their spelling-check word-swapping, create strange meaningless run-on travesties, that the reading experience is ruined.These guys are parasites on the ebook world, trying to manufacture income from as little work or care as possible, and churning out unreadable garbage that gets good reviews anyway because all the reviewers are reviewing the original work, not Edenbook's incompetance. Amazon should shut them down."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In &quot;The Plague,&quot; Camus updates a medieval horror to the twentieth century to introduce a new concept to his main literary theme of man faced with the absurd. Coming hot on the heels of World War II, it could be seen as an allegory of the eternal struggle between two major human forces -- love and hope on one side, death and destruction on the other.The setting is Oran, a medium-sized city on the Mediterranean coast of Algeria, home to many French and Spanish foreigners. With an inspired sense of tension and drama, Camus builds up the plague as a series of morbid omens: A few dead rats turn up in the streets, their numbers soon growing into the thousands; a woman approaches a doctor's passing car, screaming in pain as blood drips from her crotch; people begin to suffer from buboes and ganglia which stiffen their joints and precede their death; a stricken opera singer falls dead upon the stage during a performance as the audience watches in sickened dismay. The city's government and medical establishment quickly move to quarantine the infected populace, and the city gates are locked and guarded by sentries to prevent people from entering or leaving, which results in panic and chaos.How a city handles a plague has been covered in Daniel Defoe's journalistically toned &quot;A Journal of the Plague Year&quot; (1722), but Camus's novel is less about the disease than about the sensibilities of a group of specific characters. The central figure is Dr. Bernard Rieux, an important local physician who helps to organize &quot;sanitary squads&quot; which try to isolate the infirm. The events of the plague are recorded by a diarist named Jean Tarrou, who, as a staunch believer in the right to life for all people, represents the novel's humanist conscience.A moral dilemma is personified by a journalist named Rambert, who has been quarantined in Oran and wants to get back to France to see his wife, illegally if necessary; ultimately he makes the brave decision to stay and aid the sanitary squads, persuaded partly by the knowledge that Rieux's own wife is away in a sanatorium for an unrelated illness. There are also two comical characters in the shapes of Joseph Grand, a municipal clerk who is working on a novel but is so fastidious a stylist that he can't get past the first sentence; and Cottard, a criminal who postpones his suicide when he notices that the authorities are currently much more concerned with suppressing the plague than prosecuting him.Of course, the plague eventually subsides of its own nature, although its turning point in the novel coincides with, and may be related symbolically to, a shocking decision made by one of the main characters. The impression Camus gives is that, after the celebration of the return to normality is over, the people will probably go back to living very much the same way they did before, which suggests that human resilience is stronger than a need for faith."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Although the book's dramatic story and setting makes for interesting reading in and of itself, I found it more interesting to consider what the philosophical implications of the book might be. Camus used the story of the desperate circumstances of the people in this town to put forward important ideas about philosophy and living, and in that case, we might ask what those are?To recap the story briefly, the small town of Oran on the Mediterranean seacoast is hit by plague, and the town gates are closed. The town inhabitants, now sealed off from the rest of the world, are left to their fate, and must survive as best they can.Against this grim backdrop of events, a Dr. Rieux, the existentialist in the story (and perhaps Camus's alter-ego) is put to the test, and it is his views and character that Sartre is most concerned with. For the doctor, there seem to be two main questions that are at stake here. First, he sees the plague as synonymous not just with disease and illness, but with all the evils which afflict mankind. To Rieux, the plague symbolizes man's age-old fight against evil itself. For him, the question is, can man fight with plague? Can man, in fighting the enemies of mankind, defeat and kill the enemies of mankind?And second, is it possible for man to come up with, in the face of such a deadly and implacable enemy, a philosophy equal to the threat of the plague, a modus vivendi, to counteract and combat the \\"modus morituri,\\" perhaps, that the plague represents? Can man engage and defeat such an enemy, in an existence which Rieux regards as a brief exposure to pleasure, and a prolonged exposure to pain, and now deadly disease?The Plague is an interesting, dramatic, and poignant account of one existentionalist's attempt to come to grips with these questions. The only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I found Camus's writing style a little dry, but that perhaps had more to do with the translation. ..."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Amazing! Not only do you get the whole text of this great novel, but extensive commentary, history, criticism, plot summary...and a friggen linked table of contents??!!!! ....for 99 cents? This is too good to be true...awesome."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Picture yourself in a town where people were dying wherever you turned. You observed that there were dead rats on the ground and began to remember what the real reason was behind the rats. You finally discover that the bubonic plague resulted in the death of these people and now the living people in your town will have to be locked up so that the disease doesn't spread. This brings us to the theme of The Plague by Albert Camus, which is suffering and how human solidarity in the book helped to try to fight off the plague.The main form of suffering in the novel is seen in the victims of the bubonic plague. The infected initially suffer from lumps and buboes, high fever with an early morning respite followed by delirium and a raging thirst. As the disease progresses, the pain worsens to the point of intolerance. Death is almost a relief.In addition to the physical suffering described in the novel, the plague also causes psychological suffering. Because of its highly contagious nature, Oran must be cut off from the world. The isolation of the town creates all levels of suffering. People suddenly find that they are separated from their loved ones and suffer a great sense of loneliness and loss. Supplies of food and other necessities run low, causing the citizens, especially the poor ones, to suffer hunger and shortage. More importantly, they constantly fear that there will not be enough to sustain life in Oran. They also live under the constant fear of contracting the plague, as they grieve over the loss of family and friends who have succumbed to the disease.Another major theme in the novel is human solidarity in times of trouble. Largely due to the efforts of Tarrou, a gifted organizer, many of the citizens of Oran band together to volunteer in the struggle against the plague. They work harmoniously and diligently to support the medical team as they battle the disease. Grand abandons his literary efforts in order to join the volunteers; he comes to give his help each afternoon after work. Othon joins the fight after the plague attacks his son. Rambert joins the effort after his attempts to escape are thwarted. Even Father Paneloux, who believes that a priest can have no friends and that the plague has been sent by God as a punishment, contributes his share to the fight against the Plague by joining Tarrou's team. Each link in this chain of human solidarity finds strength to fight the plague by joining with others.Suffering and human solidarity were the major themes of this novel. Suffering was displayed throughout the whole novel but human solidarity developed when everyone got together to try to stop the disease. That solidarity was not only important in the past but is also necessary in modern times. The more human solidarity the more we can achieve. I recommend the book The Plague by Albert Camus because it not only includes historical facts but also develops a story for that time period. It gives you a first-person view of what it was like to live through the Bubonic Plague with all the hardships and low medical advancements at the time. I think that The Stranger and The Plague provide the same level of entertainment."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"First of all, let us be clear that this review and, I suspect, most if not all of the others posted here are not of the novel La Peste by Albert Camus but of The Plague by Stuart Gilbert. Unhappily, my command of French is woefully insufficient to tackle the original novel by Camus himself, and I am unable to evaluate Gilbert's accuracy as a translator. I do know that translating nuances, intimations, and implications from one language and culture to another is incredibly difficult and involves far more than merely substituting an English word for a French word. Idioms are not even subject to literal translation if they are to convey any sense to the reader. I have the feeling that what we are reading in English is, regardless of the literal accuracy of the translation, second best to reading the original novel.I find in The Plague statements of the amorality of the universe and observations that sustaining strengths must originate from within a person if, indeed, that person is to be sustained in an uncaring environment. When the quarantine gates slam shut and isolate the denizens of Oran, each must confront the facts of his isolation and come to grips with his separation from the rest of humanity as best he can. Camus/Gilbert portray a broad span of reactions to the situation. We have Cottard, a man with a shadowy past fearful of being accosted by the authorities who actually welcomes the plague for it takes the spotlight off him as it were and conveys some reassurance that he will not be apprehended after all. We have Grand, a man striving to express his emotions in the pages of a novel he is writing, whose devotion to his creation is such that the disease is rather irrelevant to him. Rambert is focused on escaping the town to be reunited with his newly wed wife. The priest, Paneloux, first seeks to explain the plague by man's sinful nature and rails against that nature in his sermon, yet subsequently leaves off blame to seek succor, which he believes lies in an unswerving, selfless, unquestioning love of God--regardless of whether or not man can comprehend the actions of that deity. And these are but a few of the citizens whom one meets in the course of the story, each with different outlooks, plans and reactions to the unforeseen situation.We see how many men change over the duration of this trial by disease and isolation. Paneloux, of course, changes from railing against man's failings to striving to explain the unquestioning love that man should feel toward God's actions, even those that appear arbitrary and cruel. The magistrate Othon undergoes quite a transformation from a municipal bureaucrat to a volunteer in an isolation center. Rambert even leaves off his escape attempts to become eventually helpful.The universe, of course, cares nothing for man's situation, much less for his philosophies and actions. No change in a man's heart or action, neither beneficence nor avarice, neither acceptance of reality nor delusion (and poor Grand finally finishes 50 pages of his novel, each one containing nothing more a slight variation of the opening sentence) protects one from the plague. Neither Paneloux's religion nor Grand's pathos nor Othon's generosity nor his son's innocent youth offers protection from the ravages of the epidemic. Neither sympathetic acts (Tarrou) nor criminal acts (Cottard) have the slightest effect on one's fate, nor does there appear to be any grace from a benevolent deity for which one can hope. In short, there is nothing a man can do or hope for that will amend his fate. Even Dr. Rieux, the closest character to a \\"hero\\" in the novel, is fated to lose his wife, who is not even within the city. The best that one can do is to find an internal strength with which to avert despair or madness, to continue to do what one feels he must, and to live or die as he may chance to do.The masculine pronoun appears throughout these thoughts intentionally, for all of Camus/Gilbert's characters are male. The few females of whom we are told anything at all (Rieux's and Rambert's wives, for instance) are external to the story and are important only through their impact on the feelings of the male characters. Some readers find this novel dark, and it is true that no hero comes to save the day, that no miracles occur, and that there is no particularly happy ending. In fact, once the crisis has at long last passed, the world keeps on pretty much the way it was before the upheaval. Nothing particular has been learned and nothing gained. Still, Camus/Gilbert remind us that each man has only himself to cling to, that hope resides only within the psyche of the individual, and that seeking succor from any other source is an act doomed to frustrated failure. There is also the promise that, when man needs to be reminded of this, the plague will return, a hard philosophy but perhaps a realistic one."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"My son had to read for high school literature class - content was disgusting - Not recommended for young adult"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Actually, this is the kind of book that confirms my prejudices against Nobel prize winning literature, it is a mere construction, the characters are not human they are robots.This is a book about one city's struggle against the plague, where we get to meet a variety of characters of which none are lovable or even believable. Why does Camus write a book when he obviously has no interest in the subject, and no passion for what he is doing. There are no humour in this book, only a few obscure details carefully planned out within the book. For example the guy who is trying to write the perfect novel, who is still working on the perfection of the first sentence, Camus does not seem interested in this character, instead you get the feeling he's just been sitting at home making up these characteristics. This book is indeed what intellectual bullshiters like to call &quot;classic literature&quot;, the language is perfect and of course without any nerve or anything else indicating that the author is putting down a part of himself in the writing, and of course there is no change of tone in the book indicating any emotional commitment by the author, the book just struggles on in the same silent tone, on and on. For Camus literature doesn't seem to be an artform, it's just work, and the only part of him that goes in to it are his opinions.Did Camus commit suicide or was it really a caraccident that ended his life, one might ask, and it surely wouldn't soprise me if it actualy was a suicide, because there are no hope in his books, just mere depression, he can't even see how pathetic he seems painting the whole world black, convincing himself that he is the only one suffering. No, grant the nobel prize to authors like Boris Vian, Raymond Queneau, Georges Darien, Alfred Jarry and Paul Bowles instead, because boring pessimists as Albert Camus are not good representatives for 20th century literature.My conclusion therefore is that I can recommend noone to read this book, because reading it doesn't give you anything back, it's so boring you have to struggle your way through it, and it has a tone that makes you depressed, because there's no hope, the world is black and nothing you can do will make anything better."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I have to say, I did not understand this book. I am probably one of the top english students in my high school class, one of the most capable of staying open minded while reading any book.But this book I simply could not understand.

I can't tell you what translation it was that I did read, but maybe it was partly that...maybe it was because I was also reading an extremely poor translation of the Death of Ivan Ilyich at the time, but for whatever reason, I feel as though I missed the big idea of this book.To me, the only thing that is memorable is the amount of death.However, I am extremely willing to give it another go-- but it will have to wait until I get through my Russian kick and until I read a few pages of several different translations."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The story that Albert Camus wrote is wonderful. It shows what happens when a society is under stress of a uncontrolled medical disaster. But besides from the story, I didn't really like it. I'm not sure if it was because it was translated from french, or if it was written this way, but the book was very confusing because the narrator would jump from person to person without warning. One person would be telling the story, then another person would be, and then at the end you found out that only one of the main characters was the narrator. Very confusing!But... If you're like me and you have to read this book for a school research paper, I would reccomend it. As soon as you get over the whole character/narrator thing, it an easy read that goes by fast. There is also plenty of academic information in reference books and online for doing a research paper on the book."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I found the book extremely dull and boring. I can on the other hand understand and apprecitate why it's regarded as a classic. Camus'es style of writing conveys emotions very well and is more suited for a people who are very much into philosophy.Camus used the word \\"abstract\\" in a way I never thought of using it and found that very interesting. The plague represents an \\"abstraction\\" because it is so difficult to comprehend. The plague kills many people and forces everyone in the city into internment camps. The book centers around three characters one of whom is a doctor. The three characters are unusually contemplative and philosophical. This is what dulled the book for me. The characters simply didn't seem like real people and I could not see them as anyone I'd ever meet. Another thing about the story that bothered me was the fact that the events described was a fictional account of events taking place in an Algerian town, yet Arabs are seldom mentioned. There is no mention at all of the Arabic language or Islam. There is no trace of Arabic or Islamic influence anywhere. No one in the book has an Arabic or Islamic name, there are no Muslims anywhere. There are many parts of the book however that mention Christianity and churches. So it's also very culturally biased."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book is a real disappointment after reading &quot;The Stranger&quot;.

You can literally read the first 100 pages of this book (maybe less), and the last 20 or so, and you haven't missed a beat.There are two types of people in The Plague: those that are separated from loved ones, and those that are not. How much time can you spend recreating the exact same descriptions of the emotions of these two groups, which rarely (if ever) changes in a way that isn't painfully obvious or expected.Seriously, if you DO read this and get past the 100 page mark and start seeing how painfully stagnant this novel is, just know that it continues to the last page (with the exception of the very mild and sloppy cessation of the plague, and the even MORE painfully obvious confession of the source of narration)."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague, set i"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus' masterpiece of secular humanism shows the importance of hope and compassion in the midst of horror on a grand scale. Very 20th century.

The Plague provides rich characters who demonstrate &quot;authentic&quot; living in the face of adversity and danger, and shows the reader that life, real life, can only be realized by looking danger in the face and thumbing your nose at it. Camus does a magnificant job of integrating the often impenatrable philosophy of Heidegger and Sartre into a wonderfully woven work of literature."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Rarely in the history of literature has a work of art risen beyond its time period, beyond its own temporal moral lessons. Camus writes of the &quot;rats,&quot; the metaphorical Nazis, that infect an empty city, rip it apart, plop it on its head, expose it nude. And he shows us those who fight back (&quot;two plus two equals four&quot;) and those who wimp away. Camus wrote the novel in a small town called Le Chambon in 1944, where 5,000 Christian saved 5,000 Jews. And today, do we not witness those who slink from confrontation? those who carry forth Cicero's duties? those who profit? those who die? And is it not best to ask, in the end, where is the meaning? Camus answers."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I was disappointed to see a negative review about such a powerful work of art... until I read it. The only bad review on Amazon was, fortunately, based entirely on total ignorance of the subject of The Plague. Ignorance is easily forgivable and even more easily curable.Albert Camus, in writing the Plague, was not out to write a nice story... if it is even possible to write such a story using the Bubonic Plague as a vehicle. Camus' goal in writing the plague was the conversion of Catholics, disenchanted with traditional belief systems after the horror of Hitler's rise in WW2, to existentialism. While I certainly can't describe all the ins and outs of existentialism here, I can say that one astute observation the reviewer made was that there was no hope. Existentialism is (in part) the erradication of hope in onesself, thereby reaching &quot;inner peace&quot; and so happiness. If one doesn't hope, one has no Wants to be unfulfilled; he who never knows disappointment and who just lives his life as he sees best will be truly happy. To Camus hope was the quickest way to death of the soul and the body. If one observes while reading, the characters who hope die of the plague. The characters who are able to push aside hope and just live, doing what one must do, are the ones who survive and, in the end, are happiest. It would take pages to explain the whole novel and the whole message therein and to answer all of the &quot;what about&quot;s, but it is worth educating onesself just to be able to appreciate what Camus has accomplished. Armed with some knowledge of the true subject matter one can finally see that not a single sentence is out of place, not a single word does not contribute to Camus' purpose-- the gentle welcoming of readers into the arms of existential philosophy. Before reading The Plague one should learn something about existentialism and Camus' beliefs, or at least buy the Cliff's Notes. After education and reading, one may not agree with Camus (I don't, personally) but one must at least acknowledge the work of a master."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Many of my college friends (that was back in the 1970s) cited this book as very influential in creating their \\"worldview.\\" I have heard many people talk about \\"The Plague,\\" and how it embodies Camus as the hopeful face of the 20th-century philosophy called existentialism, that was systematized by Camus' friend, J.P. Sartre. I never read the book until a week ago. The reason I picked it up was to write about existential ethics and heroism for a post-graduate ethics class.It's a tough read. This is not to discourage anyone, but be prepared to read about characters who have no choice to look death and human suffering in the eye. These are, after all, the two evils man constantly stuggles against, according to existentialists. Camus' heros don't face the kind of evil that is exciting to read about. There are no car chases or flashy bad guys who are as seductive as they are dangerous; there is only a city on the north coast of Africa, a bunch of dying rats who point toward the coming disaster but are ignored by the people; and a cast of half-a-dozen or so central characters whose actions and reactions in response to the ever-worsening plague, are what Camus wants us to focus our attention on and to ponder.If you're looking for a serious inquiry into human nature and how tragedy can bring out the best in at least some people, The Plague may be your cup of tea. It will interest philosophy students, particularly those familiar with Heidegger and Sartre. Camus' biographers have researched his notebooks and found that he was very intentional about writing a novel that put his characters in an unescapable \\"existential dilemma,\\" and as a philosophical allegory, The Plague is a brilliant piece of work. But to be honest, this isn't the kind of book I'd have read if I wasn't doing it as part of my academic studies. Besides, though I think Sartre, Camus and their existentialist brethren have made some important contributions to thought and literature, my own point of view is much different from theirs!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Amazon customers: Don't be like me.

Great stuff."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus is not writing about the plague, as graphic as some of the descriptions of disease may be. He is writing about the human spirit and how it deals not just with adversity but with absurdity. The least appropriate response to the plague is the most common -- that of banality. For many residents, life just goes on but becomes infinitely boring. For those who strive with evil and death, life becomes infinitely valuable and infinitely interesting. Think of Rieux, putting in his 20-hour days. Even the miscreant Cottard finds meaning in the plague; for him, it means that all the inhabitants are in the same situation as he is.Quite a remarkable work. A true classic."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book, first of all, has a great theme. The theme of endurance and carrying through is a wonderful moral and is expressed very clearly. The problem I have with this book is that it is slightly boring at some points. It seems to go on and on sometimes and I think Camus could have written this in a lot less space. I had to read this for a class and I chose it because the plot sounds interesting. And to the book's credit, it is one of the few books that actually is what the summary says it is. The book is deep, but not so deep that the reader can't understand it. It is a good read, but dull at some points."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Albert Camus, whose life was dominated by World War II and his participation in the French underground resistance, and whose enigma it was to try to understand how such chaos and war and pain had come to the world in which he lived, realized in his book &quot;The Plague&quot; the perfect metaphor for war.One character after another is portrayed in his city of birth, Oran, Algeria as they cope with a &quot;plague&quot; visiting their city, and keeping them prisoners there. The plague, of course, is the war, and Camus' poignant understanding of the human condition and the idiosyncratic ways in which evil is generated by human actions and inactions is the foundation of this superb work of fiction.His life's work, was to promulgate the theory that we are each responsible for one another, and that every action matters and reverberates within the universe. It is a kind of existentialism and a recognition of how inertia and neediness undermines the will toward good. In his work \\"The Fall\\" this double nature of human beings is fully realized. In \\"The Plague\\" we are deeply moved by how human beings behave within a state of crisis.Camus' insights and his philosophy have deeply influenced my own thinking when trying to cope with the present and to understand the horrors of the past, IE the Holocaust and human evil. He offers both insight and hope."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"\\"All I maintain is that on this earth there are pestilences and there are victims, and it's up to us so far as possible, not to join forces with the pestilences.\\" The Plague, by Albert Camus. The citizens of the town Oran are wrapped up in themselves. \\"The truth is that everyone is bored, and devotes himself to cultivating habits. \\"Our citizens work hard, but solely with the object of getting rich\\" (The Plague, 4). Camus uses the plague upon the town to address the indifference among man. He also uses the concept of existentialism to fight the indifference with regards to the society's suffering. This is shown by the citizens of Oran uniting to fight that which is inhuman. \\"The plague had swallowed up everything and everyone. No longer were there individual destinies; only a collective destiny, made of plague and the emotions shared by all\\" (The Plague, 167). Tarrou, an important character in the novel stated, \\"That, too, is why this epidemic has taught me nothing new except that I must fight at your side\\" (The Plague, 229). He himself is a visitor/outsider. He helps play in the development of Camus' values throughout the book. He at first does not care or aid the citizens of the town. He ultimately becomes aware of his responsibility to the citizens of Oran. He learns to act upon what he knows to be right Tarrou is represents what man can be and do. His actions demonstrate conforming to existentialism. This novel is not for everyone; it is not an easy read. The novel lacks action but has great imagery. The Plague by Albert Camus is pretty good on many different levels and is worth reading is one is interested in existentialism."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I initially approached The Plague with feelings of apprehension. It looked unapproachable and dense. When I actually got into it, I found it to be very interesting and to have characters that I could sympathize with. I especially liked Doctor Rieux, the narrator. There were some very beautiful descriptions of nature spread throughout. Even as the plague is killing hundreds of people throughout, the characters go on with their lives and endure. Sometimes you can almost feel the isolation and loneliness of the people, locked up in their homes by the plague and their own natures. I guess that Camus was trying to tell the reader that although life is without meaning, people can try to put meaning into it by doing good and working for just causes."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague takes place in a quiet little picturesque town which has been besieged by the plague. Albert Camus tells the story from the perspective of a doctor living in that town. Having never personally lived in a town that was quarantined, I cannot verify the factuality of the story, but the picture Camus draws is truly scary. He recounts the doctor's daily experiences from the first few signs of the plague, to the entire town in a panic and uproar, all the way to the plague's mysterious disappearance. It is somewhat gruesome in parts, so if you get a little queasy, this book may not be for you, but if you are interested in how humanity overall faces the prospect of impending death, and it's helplessness before the reaper, this will prove to be an enlightening study."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I've read this book twice now, and each time it seems richer and more relevant to life in the modern world. It has something to say about disease, about world war two, and even about what it means to be human.The different characters of the novel are fascinating, and their situations stick with the reader long after you conclude reading. Perhaps the most shocking scene, the death of a child in the middle of the novel leaves a big impression. This event itself almost sums up Camus's views of human nature and the random, meaningless nature of existence.This is a classic and a great read. It will make you think about &quot;big issues&quot; for a very, very long time."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I'll most likely get kicked in the teeth for disagreeing with a famous literary philosopher like Camus, but after reading The Plague, I really feel it fell short of proving what it meant to illustrate, &quot;that there are more things to admire in men than to despise.&quot;This is my third Camus story (The Fall and The Stranger being the first two), and while I like his style, I felt that The Plague strove too hard to be optimistic about humanity. So much so, in fact, that he was rather selective with what human aspects were covered.The main characters that the narrator follows are interestingly unique as individuals, and are worth reading the book for. However, in striving to prove that people are better than they are worse, he eagerly uses the individuals as template examples of how good people can strive to be at heart, while at the same time glossing over the negatives taking place in the background. The corruption, profiteering, and class separatism that take place in the quarantined town are mentioned and briefly described, but never examined as the inherent evil or indifference that are the true plague of man.A great story worth reading (and interesting views on how people chose to live and dedicate their lives), and excellent characters, but in the long run the characters are not examples of human nature, but rather exceptions to the rule."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I wasn't as taken by the Plague as others. The story raised some strong ethical questions had any of us been put into the same circumstances. Unfortunately for me, the plagued itself lingered a bit too long. I never felt a sense of attachment to any of the characters. On the other hand, Camus offers short bursts of great insight regarding the struggles of being human."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Anyone who dares struggle through this book must be in search of some life changing insight like I was. But insight can not be sought after, it is a gift. I spent too many hours dozing off during this long read only to come away with one life lesson - ENJOY LIFE as Rieux and Torreau did during their friendly swim! And if you want to enjoy life then don't struggle through this book like I did.I must admit though, I began the book sympathizing with Rambert - wanting to flee. My views haven't changed, but now I realize the value of perseverence, determination, and love.If you have the time to persevere through a long and sad book then give this one a shot."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"very very very good book. powerfully and masterfully written...the reaction of the different characters to death, the plague, and being quarantined really brings out their true natures....the portrait of the doctor in the book is so intense and thought provoking. touching upon the human condition and psyche. i think that camus has a deep understanding and judge of character."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"So many stories are about Joe or Eva or Ricardo. This is a novel that elevates itself beyond the personal to the social; it addresses how Joe or Eva or Harry will behave themselves regardless of who they are, dependent on the social circumstances in which they find themselves; and in the social circumstance of The Plague, they generally rise above who they might've been elsewise.

It's a novel about a French colony in Northern Africa that becomes infested with the bubonic plague. The town is cordoned off, preventing anyone or anything from coming or going to prevent the spread of the disease.About the inhabitants, Camus writes, \\"...they came to know the incorrigible sorrow of all prisoners and exiles, which is to live in company with a memory that serves no purpose. Even the past, of which they thought incessantly, had a savor of only regret. For they would have wished to add to it all they regretted having left undone...\\" Thus there are many parallels to prison life here.He also writes, \\"On the whole, men are more good than bad; that, however, isn't the real point. But they are more or less ignorant, and it is this that we call vice or virtue; the most incorrigible vice being that of ignorance that fancies it knows everything, and therefore claims for itself the right to kill. The soul of the murderer is blind; and there can be no true goodness nor true love without the utmost clear-sightedness.\\"The story examines the different ways the main characters deal with the threat of death, the loss of their loved ones, and their isolation. I was most interested in the criminal, Cottard, who actually welcomes the plague and resulting quarantine because it means the authorities are too busy to deal with him. \\"The thing he'd most detest is being cut off from others; he'd rather be one of a beleaguered crowd than a prisoner alone.\\" I've met people in prison with life sentences like this. They wish the world would end tomorrow and they'd rejoice because they would know that they're not going alone.Review Written by David Allan ReevesAuthor of \\"Running Away From Me\\""},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Oran, \\"a large French port on the Algerian coast,\\" is ordinary and unprepossessing, \\"treeless, glamourless, [and] soulless.\\" In the spring, sometime in the 1940's, the townspeople notice a strange and unsettling phenomenon. Dead and dying rats are appearing in alarming numbers. It turns out that these doomed creatures are a portent of a virulent epidemic that is about to bring Oran to its knees. \\"The Plague,\\" by Albert Camus, translated from the French by Stuart Gilbert, is an account of a city under siege, its inhabitants in the iron grip of a deadly bacillus that picks and chooses its victims, regardless of gender or age.Dr. Bernard Rieux has other preoccupations. His sickly thirty-year old wife is about to catch a midday train. She is going to a sanatorium in the mountains where, Dr. Rieux hopes, the bracing air, nourishing food, and peaceful atmosphere will reinvigorate her. After Madame Rieux departs to take her rest cure, Bernard and his fellow physicians notice that various individuals in Oran are exhibiting alarming symptoms: high fever, swollen ganglia, raging thirst, and lumps of fibrous matter under their skin.\\"The Plague\\" is a study of how average men and women--aside from Rieux's wife and mother, few females have speaking roles in the narrative--handle extreme duress. Raymond Rambert, a journalist, hopes to escape Oran and reunite with his lover; Monsieur Cottard exploits the emergency to enrich himself; Jean Tarrou jots down his observations in a notebook and organizes a voluntary group of helpers to improve sanitation; Father Paneloux, a scholar and Jesuit priest, delivers fiery sermons exhorting his congregants to accept the Divine will; and the municipal and medical authorities arrange for quarantines, organize special hospital wards, and implement various measures to counteract the disease. As the death toll mounts, people begin to panic, since there is no sign that the plague will abate in the near future. What will become of them all?Eventually, Oran is cut off from the outside world; no one may leave or enter. The people wait and, in some cases, pray that they and their loved ones will be spared. Camus' evocative descriptive writing enables the reader to smell Oran's fetid air and picture the unfortunate victims as they writhe in a fevered delirium, waiting for death. After a while, burials become hurried affairs. Even those who remain healthy \\"drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows....\\" Oran became \\"a defunct city in which...darkness had effectively silenced every voice.\\"What can we derive from this allegorical work? Some will conclude that human existence is meaningless and capricious, and that our endeavors to thrive in business and carve out a successful niche for ourselves in society may be so much wasted effort. We might want to place more emphasis on the here and now, since tomorrow does not come with a guarantee. Others will applaud the altruism of people like Dr. Rieux, who wears himself out tending to the sick and dying. Since \\"The Plague\\" was published in 1947, it is possible that Camus was indirectly indicting Frenchmen who collaborated with their Nazi occupiers during World War II. Whatever interpretation we accept, \\"The Plague\\" clearly demonstrates that crises bring out the best in some and the worst in others. Those who have compassion for their fellow citizens offer support and assistance; they take part in cooperative measures to fight the pestilence. The self-centered worry only about themselves and their families. This classic work of fiction is an indictment of man's folly, shallowness, and short-sightedness and also a tribute to his selflessness, generosity, and grace under pressure."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is a great book...no doubt about it, but some of the style was difficult. I am sure it will go down in history as one of the great philosophical novels of our time, but its not perfect."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The novel begins with dead rats found throughout the town, but the locals think nothing of this and just gather up the corpses and throw them away. When the first townspeople begin to get sick, the novel's protagonist, Dr Bernard Rieux and his colleague, Castel, conclude it must be plague. However, their fears are initially dismissed given such isolated cases. Not heeding the doctors' warnings soon causes dozens in the town to become ill. Beginning with a small number of deaths, the plague soon leads to Dr Rieux designating space at a hospital for plague victims. Then everything becomes overwhelmed. Camus' book is split into five parts and covers a period of many months from the arrival of the plague to its eventual passing, and a reflection on the consequences of the outbreak.I know that I didn't get all the meanings from The Plague but I think it's one of those novels that you can read at many different levels. On the surface it's a story of a plague striking an Algerian town. At a deeper level, there is the allegory of France's occupation by Germany during the Second World War. Deeper still are all the complexities of existentialism. However deep you want to dig into the meanings I think the novel is one that can be read by many and still enjoyed."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"nature of destiny and the human condition was written very well by Camus in this novel. It touches Absurdism, human nature and fate in a very good way.I think the book should have been shorter but nothing is perfect :)"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book was written quite some time ago and was amazed on how the author seemed to apply the agony and despair of the plague to relate to the here and now without ever knowing it. I don't think much will change if a disaster as the plague should hit now or in the future. Most people will react the same way as in the book never wanting to believe what was actually happening. The narrator, Dr. Rieux, seems to have detached himself from the horror of the plague and seems almost nonchalant about it which gives it a weird twist. The writing is really good and this book will remain among my bookcase of classics."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague was a great compelling reading, characterized by the story of a little town in North Africa and its habitants.One day Dr Rieux, the protagonist, is walking around the town and he steps on a dead rat.He keeps walking and he begins to see many of them. After that many people die for doubtful cases, the town is declared of being under a plague contagion and It's put under Quarantine.Dr Rieux is not the only important character of this book . Cottard, a prisoner that is using Oran to hide from the officials, has an important role in message that Camus wants to send. During the Plague he is not the only one with our freedom and he is free of going around, this would help him to find his meaning of life. An other character is Father Paneloux, the town priest. At the beginning of the book he gives a speech where he says that plague is a punishment of God for the sinners of Oran. Later in the book he would change his speech where discuss the right way to believe in God. This really plays an important role in the message sent by Camus.Raymond Rambert is also an other very important character. He is a journalist that ends up in Oran during the plague, at the beginning he wants to live to go back to his wife but after he is convinced to stay to help to fight the plague.This leads to a very interesting fact of the book,as the town starts getting closer,and people starts helping each others , the plague starts going off.Camus with this book tries to send a message to the audience. He asks a question\\" how shall we live?\\". He argues through his characters that living his not about when we die but the right now.He tries to say to the audience that we shouldn't do good in life for external awards or fro praise of others but we should do it for the praise itself, it's a worth while effort.I really liked this book and I highly recommend it, especially to people that are worry about their future and their meaning of life. I read this in a very quite place were nobody was around me,which allowed me to feel the isolation of Oran.It also helped the understanding of Camus's messages which allowed me to really appreciate it. . This book really sends very deep messages that open your mind to new ways of thinking."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague which Albert Camus wrote in 1947 is a story about how the plague invaded the North African Mediterranean town of Oran. Towns people first notice something is wrong when rats invade the town and begin dying. Camus traces the town's reaction to the plague and its invasion and take over of the town itself.In many ways The Plague seems sparse or even languid with characters drifting helplessly against the invasion of the disease. But behind this there is much for provoking thought. We are confronted with our inability to make sense of war and disease although we also seem unable to stop trying to make sense of these.While the narrator claims that there are no heroes in the fight against the plague, clearly there are those who work deligently against the disease while expecting no reward. So we are left to question what is the moral obligation, during times of crisis. Should one grab a chance for happiness or do what is needed?Each of Camus characters are interesting and as in the slow build of story and events, Camus slowly builds the characters aroung their words and actions until the become quite intriguing people who we want to keep with us after their story is over. One such character is Tarrou, who comes to Oran shortly before the plague and seems to have no particular purpose. While talking to Dr. Rieuxabout the plague he says,\\"each of us has the plague within him;no one, no one on earth is free from it. and I know, too, that we must keep endless watch on ourselves lest in a careless moment we breathe in somebody's face and fasten in infection on him. What's natural is the microbe. all the rest--health, integrity, purity (if you like)--is a product of human will, of a vigilance that must never falter.Whether The Plague is about disease, WWII, or the absurdity of the human condition, I found it to be a worthy read and one which will stay with me."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"What a wonderful book. The author is a true renaissance man, emerging as a hero from the totalitarian horrors of WWII to create a great work of peace and reconciliation. The style is a little disconcerting at first, with dispassionate reporting by an unnamed narrator (who is only identified very late in the book), but it rises to great and memorable heights when describing the trials and tribulations witnessed by the narrator - 'the hag-ridden populace a part of which was daily fed into a furnace and went up in oily fumes, while the rest, in shackled impotence, waited their turn', the seemingly mundane observation that 'on the whole, men are more good than bad ...' There is a great cast of 'average guy' characters, including an 'insignificant and obscure hero who had to his credit only a little goodness of heart and a seemingly absurd ideal' and the compassionate anti-capital punshiment hero, who comes to the realisation that we all have plague."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague, don't mistake it for a 'Novel', and the Writings of Seneca are the only two things that western philosophy after early Greeks brought out that is worth internalizing IMHO. They answer the question that is more important than why we are here and where we came from. They tell us why we get up every morning and carry on as humans despite the unavoidable reality of death that will fulfil our forms when the time comes.As to the mechanical part, yes, the kindle edition is good, it is in fact a good translation of an extraordinarily difficult piece of writing. This is the one piece of Camus I do not manage to read in French, the language is too intricate but don't let that scare you, it reads well. Couple of spelling mistaken, probably due to scanning more than anything."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book is not exceptional. But I can not can not blame it on Camus. I think some weight must lie on the translation. I previously read &quot;The Stranger&quot; -- the new translation, which was much better than the first translation I had read a few years back. I am inclined to say that the translation of &quot;The Plague&quot; that I read is not a good interpretation. One of Camus' virtues is his monotone voice when describing events with a sense od detachment. &quot;The Plague&quot; has a lot of good moments and is definitely worth reading, but it feels as though the translator, Stuart Gilbert, is placing flowers where there should be none. Camus' beauty is in its barren deserted descriptions. This book should be retranslated by Matthew Ward who did an excellent job with the Stranger. I will definitely write to the publisher suggesting this, and so should all of you who decide to read this version. Regardless of all this, it is a book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Albert Camus' magnificent novel, \\"The Plague,\\" is the only book I've read a dozen times. This month, I'm reading it yet again with ever-increasing respect for the author's skill and radical commitment to honesty. Only George Orwell comes close, in my opinion.SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL, ANYWAY? \\"The Plague\\" was first published in 1947, just two years after the close of World War II. The storyline is relatively simple:-- Thousands of rats start dying in Oran, Algeria, an ugly seaside city that was then part of the French empire. (Note: A real plague scare swept Oran in 1944.)-- The disease quickly spreads to human beings, who begin dying in ever-greater numbers.-- To prevent a wider epidemic, the local government closes down all routes to the outside world.-- Inside this grim, pestilential setting we witness the best and worst of human nature.-- More importantly, the novel raises huge questions about morality, God, fairness, praxis and human suffering.Unlike lesser writers, Camus doesn't offer up any easy answers. He never accepted the label \\"Existentialist\\" and his work certainly can't be forced into a box, literary or philosophical. And no matter what your high school English teacher said, \\"The Plague\\" isn't an allegory about fascism, atheism, nihilism or any other \\"ism.\\" It's far more ambitious, and far less formulaic, than any allegory.In his own powerful way, Camus forces us to confront the most uncomfortable question of all: What if life really is meaningless? What if all of our suffering, joys, effort and achievements count for nothing in the grand scheme of things? Simply put, what if there is no \\"grand scheme of things\\"?Each character in \\"The Plague\\" is both a real person and a symbol for something deeply perplexing about the human condition. They are living contraditions who slowly tear apart the false fabric of conventional wisdom.Our lead character is Dr. Bernard Rieux. He's a humble champion of human dignity but also a fatalist without much faith in anything - except practical action and perseverance. On the other side of the spectrum is Father Paneloux, a militant Jesuit priest of Oran who insists the plague is God's punishment on the local population. Paneloux is a classic example of dead faith masquerading as certainty. He reveals the emptiness of \\"true believers\\" who abandon humility in favor of arrogance.Even the novel's strangest characters pose difficult questions: Monsieur Cottard begins the novel by trying to commit suicide, but then finds new reason to live as death sweeps across the city. Why? What does this signify about hope in the face of doom? Other characters are by turns greedy, loving, selfish, delusional and even comical (e.g., the man whose hobby is spitting on cats). The one thing you won't find in \\"The Plague\\" is a neat, tidy ending that resolves everything for you.As a Christian, I find myself coming back to Camus often because he challenges my faith and understanding of the world. He not only \\"overturns the applecart\\" of simplistic theology, he sets it on fire and throws it off a cliff. In fact, Camus' radical honesty reminds me of a certain Jewish carpenter who uttered these words just before he was executed: \\"I came to bear witness to the truth.\\" But what is truth?, asked Pontius Pilate.Jesus (like Camus 2,000 years later) remained silent, refusing to answer that question. The implication is clear -- at least for me."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"To an extent, all of Camus' novels are vehicles for his philosophy. Camus' philosophy begins with a simple idea, that life is absurd. Camus did not believe in God -- did not believe human actions hold any ultimate higher meaning -- he thought \\"death would undermine the value of anything that precedes it.\\" From this, Camus drew that life was \\"absurd.\\" In The Stranger, Camus illustrates this principle of the absurd. Only towards the end of The Stranger does Camus bring up another point in his worldview, and that is, that life is worth living. In The Plague, Camus introduces a concept he called \\"Revolt\\"; that is, revolting against the absurdity and meaningless of existence. It seems like an oxymoron, but here Camus wants to try to make sense of an absurd life.There you have a brief overview of Camus' philosophical ideas. In the Plague, Camus briefly criticizes the Catholic Church. If you are a Christian who is particularly sensative to opposing world-views, you may find Camus' non-faith to be offensive. With an open mind, however, it is likely you will find much said by Camus that is true. Actually, this book often feels a lot like a christian parable.If you want a straight and simple story as opposed to Camus' philosophical ideal laced story, then you might look elsewhere. Still, read the rest of my review. You may find the plot, which I will discuss next, is something that interests you regardless of philosophy.The city of Oran is quarantined due to the outbreak of a deadly plague. No one is allowed to leave or enter. The narrative focuses on a handful of people living in the quarantined city, as well as on the general conditions of life in Oran while the plague wreaks havoc. Actually, the native begins just before the plot, and ends shortly after the quarantine is lifted. The characters discuss life during plague conditions. Their activities range from writing a book, to trying to escape, to discussing football, above all, the main focus is given to combating the plague. About the Oran--bureaucracy, religion, burial procedures, and quarantine conditions are popular plot points, as is attempting to define the general outlook of the populous during the hard times of Plague infestation. One of his common themes is separation from a loved one.I hope I have been of some help. Personally, I find Camus' ideas to be captivating. I loved the Stranger and the Plague, and look forward to reading more of his books soon. Although the Plague reaches farther than the Stranger, I cannot conclude that it is the better of the two novels. Personally, I felt Stranger to be more to my liking; Stranger felt more natural and therefore more complete as a novel; whereas the people, places, and events of The Plague felt constructed as if only for novelistic purposes.I strongly suggest you at least look at thisThe Plague, The Fall, Exile and the Kingdom, and Selected Essays (Everyman's Library)before you buy the Plague, or any other work by Albert Camus. Thought it is Five Dollars more expensive, it includes 4 books and 2 essays (The Plague, The Fall, Exile, Myth of Sisyphus, and Reflections on the Guillotine) and a helpfull introduction from David Bellos. It draws from two translators (Gilbert and O'Brien) and has a durrable cloth bound frame that should outlast any paperback."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus made one of the best novels in the XX century with this merciless story .

Intentionally he tries not to do moral judgements about other characters and he tries not to qualify them as &quot;heroes&quot; or &quot;cowards&quot;. However, the novel is inhabited by many heroes and many cowards and at the end is clear that the novel is, more than anything else, a moral novel.The plague is pityless. It is like another character itself and behaves as a terrible statistic, constantly getting more and more victims which number is reported daly by the newspapaers.Dr. Rieux and other few charcters fight consistently against death and suffering. There are no rewards, there are no punishments. There is only life, death, and different attitudes towards all of it.Paradoxically, the &quot;objective&quot; style of the novel produces on the reader (at least on me) a great feeling of proximity. At the end you will be fond of Dr. Rieux, Rambert or even Cottard. The Plague deserves several readings and definetively five stars.By the way, an interesting thing would be to compare this novel with &quot;Blindness&quot; by Saramago."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"As a proper young existentialist, I read this in high school and loved it as a statement on the meaninglessness of life. But when I returned to it nearly 30 years later, this time in the original language, I felt a far deeper sense of awe at the characters and their interactions, all of which lead to their growth, even if in sorrow. WHile their dilemma is something I will probably never experience, I identified strongly with the characters and their philosophical dilemmas, this time as a middle-aged man whose life course is set and who has his own family and love. The French is spare, but utterly clear, giving the book a mournful texture in its North African context.The book is so rich that I do not believe one can pin down or define the principal themes: we all interpret it from the perspective of ourselves and where we stand at the time that we read it and they are ever changing. I believe that that is what defines a true classic: it is universal yet endlessly reflects back to the reader's subjectivity."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus' The Plague is one of the most profound and important literary achievements of the last century. It is an allegory for the human capacity to inflict the ultimate iniquity, taking one's life. If you know anything about the WWII and especially the death camps you will have a clearer understanding of this work, for that is what The Plague is really about. Suffering and random indiscriminate death, utmost lack of compassion and yet somehow survival of all that is good about the Man. It is a book that is not easy to understand if you're reading it and thinking that boubonic plague is an actual threat to the people of Oran (an allegory for mankind). Mankind is the greatest threat to itself. I wasn't supposed to tell you that. The book is self-explanatory. Camus didn't want the reader to delve into The Plague thinking that it was about the holocaust. He gradually and brilliantly makes it clear by his amazing use of descriptions (which are the apparent source of trouble for all the readers who don't quite know what the book is about). I had tears in my eyes at the end of the book just when Camus seemed destined to pronounce the inevitable human downfall but he left us with a ray of hope. Camus was a genius. It is not easy to understand his work, especially when he chooses not to be easily understood. It is not a work of existentialism. It is a loud plea for existence and the consummate triumph of life. This is not a book for everyone. It is a must read, however, for people whose IQ's are in triple digits."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"\\"The Plague\\" is perhaps the best novel I have ever read. It combines a searing indictment of man's relentless march towards self-destruction with Camus' personal love of life and recognition of the value of love.I highly recommend reading \\"The Stranger\\" first, if only to appreciate the evolution of Camus' writing stlye and outlook. Whereas \\"The Stranger\\" was published in 1946 and was perhaps a pessimistic reaction to the horrors of WWII, \\"The Plague\\" (1948) has a much more reflective and philosophical feel to it and at offers hope through the inate goodness of many of its characters.Certainly \\"The Plague\\" can be viewed as an allegory for man's never-ending brutality, and perhaps specifically, the ever-present prospect of senseless war. For that reason alone, the book is timeless and relevant and should find a place in any personal library as well as any concientious list of books that have the power to change the way we think. Based on this assessment, Albert Camus must be included with such profoundly influential and philosophical writers as Plato, Shakespeare, Voltaire, Thoreau, Kafka, etc,. Those not moved by the contents of this book should check their pulse."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"For potential readers and previous reviewers who are reading this book literally (i.e., as about a real plague), try instead reading it as an allegory. An allegory is something that can be read on various levels. As such, it can have more than one meaning: a surface meaning and a deeper meaning.The surface meaning is about a plague, but remember where and when Camus lived. Perhaps Camus is trying to say something about living in Nazi occupied France. Maybe the plague acts as a symbol for the Nazis. See if reading the book this way changes your opinion or deepens your appreciation."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is a wonderfully eloquent translation of the classic work. Admittedly, the book takes a while to get going, as it fleshes out the setting and the characters in a manner that is very dry and objective, though the writing and the language is quite expressive and somewhat engaging.At about the book's halfway mark, it begins to flourish with incredible depth and unravels some striking insights into the human condition, observations which are rather common-sense at times, but never before stated with such clarity. Like hitting you over the head with something which has been around you for so long, but you had never before taken the time to notice it.Camus exhibits an uncanny and multifaceted understanding of people, morality, and of human nature. The language and the style of the translation is strikingly British, I found it very cohesive and almost melodious in its tone. Overall, a must-read for anyone who's into classic literature, it is truly a poignant summation of what it means to be human."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is easily one of the best ten novels ever written, far surpassing even the erstwhile classic The Stranger. Whereas we examine an uncommonly cold-hearted man in a normal world in the pages of The Stranger, in this novel it is a harsh outside world which closes in on a group of fascinating characters. It is in this much more developed context that Camus' most remarkable notions of humanity, life, and existence can be fleshed out and communicated more effectively. The lessons of good, normal lives in a world gone mad are much more instructive and meaningful than the observations in The Stranger of a man gone mad in a normal world.A word to the wise: when large numbers of rats come out of the woodwork and commence dying nasty, bloody deaths in the streets and houses, something is definitely wrong. In the port city of Oran, the population ignores the signs of danger and only grudgingly admits that an epidemic, a form of the bubonic plague to be exact, has taken root in their city. The protagonist, Dr. Rieux, is a doctor who finally helps convince the authorities to take extreme measures in the interest of public safety and to eventually quarantine the entire town. Over the course of the novel, we get to observe the manner in which Dr. Rieux, his companions, and prominent men of the community react to the worsening plague and its social consequences. Dr. Rieux has just sent his unhealthy wife off to a sanitarium before the plague breaks out, and he must suffer her absence alongside the stresses of working 20+ hours a day trying to save people's lives while accomplishing little more than watching them die horrible deaths. Dr. Rieux's attempts to make sense of everything is a basic pulse of the story; an atheist, he cannot find happiness but goes on day after day fighting the disease with all his might because that is what he as a doctor is supposed to do. His friend Tarrou supplies much of the knowledge we glean about the reactions of society as a whole as month after month of isolation continues in the face of death's greedy fingers. His journal records small but important facts about all manner of men, yet he himself cannot be said to find ultimate peace. We first encounter M. Cottard after he has hanged himself and been saved before death. A criminal type yet not a bad man, his initial worries over inquiries into his suicide attempt fade away as the plague's grip on Oran tightens. He emerges from a self-imposed exile to actually become a communicating member of society; he alone seems to enjoy the plague because it makes everyone else like him, forced to live each day with the fear of a brooding, horrible fate. Then there is M. Grande, one of my favorite characters in all of literature. A simple civil service employee, he devotes himself to volunteer work computing plague statistics and the like while still continuing his fervent efforts at writing a novel. Grande's wife left him years earlier because he got too wrapped up in his work and lost the words to communicate his love for her; he began writing a novel in an attempt to find those words. With great devotion and commitment he works on his writing, determined to produce a perfectly crafted novel, one where each word is meaningful and necessary for the story--in short, one that will inspire the future publisher to introduce it to his publishing house cohorts with the phrase, \\"Hats off, gentlemen.\\" After untold months of dedicated effort, Grande has yet to get the first sentence to sound exactly right; he engages all of his efforts into perfecting this one sentence, sure that the rest of the novel will fall into place after it is perfected.These main characters are all fascinating character studies. Not all of them live to see the plague's end, but each of them struggles to find meaning in his own experience--e.g., one character continues living because that is what is required of human beings, to go on fighting for life in a meaningless world; another character seeks to become a saint of sorts by helping his fellow man fight the pestilence. The overriding message I was left with at the end is that life is worth living despite the arbitrary cruelties of an unforgiving world because there is more good in man than there is evil. I found that the book delivered in fact a rather darkly uplifting celebration of the human spirit; one's loved ones give life its meaning in a hostile world. The Plague succeeds in ways The Stranger never could because the characters in this novel are utterly human and represent diverse aspects of the lives of each of us."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"&quot;The town itself, let us admit, is ugly.&quot; So says Dr. Bernard Rieux, the narrator of Albert Camus', The Plague.The Plague takes place in Oran, a small Mediterranean town in North Africa. Not only does Dr. Rieux find Oran ugly, he find its inhabitants boring people with little involvement in the actual business of living.One day, Rieux steps on a dead rat, then another and another. Soon, he sees them everywhere, littered among the bloated corpses of Oran's inhabitants. Rieux and the Oranians ignore the problem at first, blaming the sanitation bureau for neglecting its duties. However, they soon discover that the dead and dying have a far more sinister tale to tell.Although Rieux is the narrator of The Plague, several other main characters do exist. Jean Tarrou is a hapless man who has the misfortune of wandering into Oran during the plague. He quickly becomes a friend of Rieux's and his chronicles of Oran's ordeal appear throughout the book. Raymon Rambert is a French journalist who simply ends up in Oran during the time of the plague. Although longing to return to his beautiful wife in Paris, Rambert is forced to remain in Oran. Jospeh Grand is a writer eking out an existence in Oran as he attempts to write the perfect book, while Cottard is a prisoner who is using Oran to hide from the officials who want to execute him.Oran is quarantined and its citizens must find various ways of dealing with this catastrophe. Some simply accept the inevitable and wait for the disease to strike while others turn a blind eye in the hope that if they do not see the plague, the plague will not see them.One problem, however, affects all of the town's inhabitants--money. For the first time, Oran's port is closed. They cannot buy nor can they sell. They struggle to survive on their own with little fresh food and basic medical supplies. Only Cottard is happy, because while Oran is under quarantine, Cottard can consider his dismal life spared.As the situation in Oran worsens, and little can be done, Father Paneloux, the town's priest, tells its inhabitants that the plague has come to punish the sinners of Oran and further tells his congregation that the plague will cease upon the town's repentance of its sins.After a long and forceful sermon by Paneloux, the town does, indeed, change. Grand begins to have problems writing even one sentence containing a conjunction. He trembles, mutters, gulps and exhibits other qualities of a man on the edge. Rambert attempts to escape to France, first legally, then, when that fails, illegally. The two men finally calm themselves and join Rieux and Tarrou in their dedication to overcoming the plague. Paneloux, himself, finally joins in these efforts. Strangely, the plague, which has come to kill, has served in uniting men of different beliefs and visions in one life-affirming quest.Once Oran becomes united, the plague begins to level off. Another victim dies, however. Father Paneloux becomes ill after witnessing the slow and agonizing death of Jacques Othon, a young, innocent boy. Chastised, Paneloux retracts his earlier, sophomoric message and decides that the plague is part of a plan that must be accepted.As the survivors celebrate, the plague claims one last victim, the man who was its greatest enemy. While this man's life is gone, the others who have battled the plague find their lives forever changed.The very first chapter of The Plague is short but filled with immense foreshadowing and extensive descriptive passages.We find it easy to see why Oran becomes such an easy target for death and disease. Oran is not only ugly and ordinary, it is built so that its back is turned to the sea. In fact, the changing seasons in Oran, says Rieux, must be discriminated in the sky, for the town is an unrelieved monotony of grayness and its inhabitants are already living on the fringes of life.Ignoring the simple pleasures of life, Oranians are nevertheless hard workers, but ones for whom money has no meaning beyond its mere possession. Love, too, is foreign to the citizens of Oran. They marry and have children but the concept of love for love's sake is unknown to them. Their very inauthenticity and narrow views make them prime targets for the plague and when confronted with it, they have precious few resources for dealing with the calamities it presents.The greatest piece of foreshadowing, however, and the one that sets the book's theme is the sense of alienation and entrapment. Both the living and the dead remain trapped behind the walls of Oran. Freedom, truth and beauty all lie within a stone's throw, but, until the plague forces them to look, the Oranians remain blind to the beauties of the world outside.The message of Oran is as clear as the sea that sparkles within reach of its walls. Beauty and truth are always ours for the taking. If we choose, however, to turn our backs on the riches that are ours, disease and death await us and only the luckiest among us will survive."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The plague is an allegory, for fascism and totalitarianism. The novel deals largely with individuals' varying reactions to the plague as it emerges and settles in on the city of Oran. Only those who act or are important in the development of the scene are named, and though many of the characters perceive reality differently, we are able to sympathize with where they are coming from. The novel is about overcoming indifference and performing good acts that we are all capable of. Camus makes it clear that there are no heroes in the novel, only people who recognize their responsibility and embrace life. Even though the plague is ultimately \\"defeated,\\" there is no typical happy ending, for the plague bacillus never dies. This novel is still entirely relevant to our world today. The central point of Camus' writing is \\"the absurd.\\" The absurd is characterized by the confrontation of \\"rational man and the indifferent universe.\\" Camus dismisses ideas such as transcendence, or a leap of faith, there is no existential commitment. He looks to embrace the absurd, to keep it alive. Camus is very much a moralist and a pacifist; he deplored one-sided views of any political situation, and broke off relationships with other prominent writers of his time such as Sartre, whose ties to Communism and justification of violence Camus abhorred. He did not wish to take sides in the French-Algerian war. Camus did not seem to identify with a particular people, a belief system or any form of certainty, but viewed man as being in constant revolt against the powers that tried to enslave him, keeping him from living. Camus would rather embrace the absurdity of life than a frail system. Camus did not accept, as other \\"existentialist\\" writers of his time did, that humans were born into the world as nothing and it was up to the individual to entirely assert his own identity through his/her acts. \\"For Camus a man's acts could reveal an intrinsic integrity or dignity which were always there but which had laid dormant and unasserted until he was made to face the absurdity of his mortal condition in an immortal universe.\\"(Masters, Camus: A Study). How The Plague deals with Reality:- Subjectivity, shows how one person's reality is not the same as another's. It is only when people begin to realize that they are indeed \\"in the same boat\\" as one another (that they have common interests and a common spirit to fight for, and that they needn't be alienated from one another) that the plague can be seen as a real problem which needs to be fought, rather than an abstraction which must be hidden from.- Shows how many cannot comprehend the enormity of a situation until it falls upon them, still often triggering disbelief.- Looking at the \\"small things,\\" people's reactions, etc. which \\"history\\" might ignore.- Paying close attention to the conditions of the society; the indifference and apathy that helped to allow the plague to take hold.- In historicizing an event like the Nazis occupation and plundering of Europe, it seems all too easy to look past the indifference which allowed such events to take place. The view in much of Europe was that it was someone else's problem, and even after their own nation was attacked, many merely tried to adapt, acted to appease the Nazis, or hoped that it would soon pass... they still saw it as someone else's problem to take care of. Camus was born in poverty in Algeria, somewhat of a \\"stranger\\" in France during the German occupation, but he found himself confronted with the situation, nonetheless, and was a key contributor to the French resistance army. One of his most important contributions was his work as the editor of Combat, the major underground resistance newspaper informing others of the problems and giving voice to a movement that all individuals needed to recognize their place in.I hope that in reading Camus' Plague, you will be inspired and recognize the great relevance this novel still holds."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Here's the deal on this Kindle book from EbookEden. Most, if not all, of the commentary and analysis preceding the book are copied verbatim from Wikipedia, without any attribution. The book itself is the translation from the French by Stuart Gilbert. However, the version from EbookEden has typographical errors not in the printed version and--worse--lacks chapters, which the printed version has. The chapters in the printed version I have from Vintage Books are marked by a graphic symbol, rather than numbers, but clearly mark transitions. The lack of chapters in the EbookEden version makes reading the book awkward, and oftentimes very confusing. Moreover, where the printed version uses dashes for emphasis, the EbookEden Kindle version substitutes commas, which deemphasizes what the author sough to emphasize. In other words, they have changed the book.Had this been the only version of \\"The Plague\\" that I read, I would have lost some of its meaning. Yes, this EbookEden Kindle book is cheap, but for the damage it does it should not even be free.

You could compromise your experience or an author's work by buying on the cheap."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is about love, exile, and suffering as illuminated by living around death. What is the meaning of life? For many, that question is an abstraction except in the context of being aware of losing some of the joys of life, or life itself. In The Plague, Camus creates a timeless tale of humans caught in the jaws of implacable death, in this case a huge outbreak of bubonic plague in Oran, Algeria on the north African coast. With the possibility of dying so close, each character comes to see his or her life differently. In a sense, we each get a glimpse of what we, too, may think about life in the last hours and days before our own deaths. The Plague will leave you with a sense of death as real rather than as an abstraction. Then by reflecting in the mirror of that death, you can see life more clearly.For example, what role would you take if bubonic plague were to be unleashed in your community? Would you flee? Would you help relieve the suffering? Would you become a profiteer? Would you help maintain order? Would you withdraw or seek out others? These are all important questions for helping you understand yourself that this powerful novel will raise for you.The book is described as objectively as possible by a narrator, who is one of the key figures in the drama. That literary device allows each of us to insert ourselves into the situation.Let me explain the main themes. Love is expressed in many ways. There is the love of men and women for each other. Dr. Rieux's wife is ill, and has just left for treatment at a sanitarium. Rambert, a journalist on temporary assignment, is separated from his live-in girl friend in Paris. Dr. Rieux's mother comes to stay with him during his mother's absence, so there is also love of parent and child. The magistrate also loses his son to the plague after a desperate battle. Separations occur because of the quarantine on Oran, which causes love to be tested. What is love without the other person being present? The characters find that their memories soon become abstractions. But they reach out to establish new love with each other. Tarrou, who is also caught in Oran, decides or organize a volunteer corps to help with the sick and dead. Rambert decides to stay in Oran to help after having arranged to escape the quarantine. The survivors find succor in increasing closeness with each other. Rieux and Tarrou become close, almost like brothers. Even Rieux's patients become people with whom he develops an emotional bond, even though the waves of death become an abstraction as he can do little to avert them. The priest figure also helps to explore the notion of love for God and God's love for us. The exile theme is reinforced by the quarantine. People cannot leave Oran. The disease itself causes that exile to become worse. If someone in your household becomes ill, each well person has to be quarantined. So you may be living in a tent in the soccer stadium wondering what is happening to the rest of your family. Cottard is a criminal who is on the run from the authorities. He is in despair as the plague begins, and tries to kill himself. The distractions of the plague keep the authorities from troubling him, so the period of the plague is an exile from his criminal past.Suffering is easy to explain. Bubonic plague came in two forms in the book. Both brought painful and rapid death, with few reprieves. There is high fever, painful swelling or difficulty in breathing, and enormous pain. Those who tend the suffering also suffer, from the enormous workloads, the sense of futility, and the fear that they, too, will be next.Camus does a nice job of pointing out that these themes also recur in everyday life. We just don't see them very clearly. The people in Oran live in an ugly city that deliberately built itself away from the beauty of the ocean on a sun-scorched plateau plagued by winds. They take little time to enjoy each other or the ocean, because they are caught up with making money. Commerce is their passion. So they cut themselves off from love, in an exile of spirit, which causes them to shrivel and suffer emotionally even before the plague comes. Tarrou also describes is own sense of the plague in everyday life when he discovers that his father is a prosecuting attorney who helps bring criminals to the justice of a firing squad. Even that faint connection of not trying to stop the legal killing causes Tarrou to feel like he carries the plague within him.The book is masterful in its use of metaphor. In the beginning, dying rats and small animals presage the plague attacking humans. At the end, their return presages the return of normal life to Oran. The scenes alternate between illuminating the main themes in the context of the physical plague and the emotional plague. Religion is used as a bridge between the two, raising the fundamental question about what God's purpose is in unleashing the plague. The priest is fully tested in his love of God through this development, which is one of the most moving parts of the book.I have read the book both in French and in English, and found this translation to be a perfectly appropriate one. There are few nuances that you will miss by reading this in English. Obviously, if you read French well, you should read the book in its original form.This book is an excellent example of why Albert Camus was named a Novel Laureate in Literature.After you read this great novel, I encourage you to consider the subject of complacency. That's the author's ultimate target. Where are you complacent in ways that cost you love, closeness with others, and happiness? What else is complacency costing you? How can you help others learn to overcome complacency in loving, happy ways without the spectre of death to help you?Enjoy a more wonderful life by refocusing on what is most important!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"An overwhelming feeling of meaninglessness is the enemy in all of Camus' work. The Plague is a parable about living with this spiritual dilemna which puzzles and threatens existence. But it can be read on a number of levels at the same time. You can read it as symbolic of Nazi occupation of France, or French occupation of Algeria, or any such condition where men feel hopeless in the face of historic events, time, the universe. Camus' characters are often close to surrender or indifference but some basic human need urges them on and makes them continue despite awareness that there is little chance of success. Camus loved the pure earth best of all and his scenes which place a man alone looking at the sea for instance have an instinctual feel that sets him apart from someone like the exclusively cerebral Sartre. It is a book which changes each time you read it. What is happening in the world at the time you are reading it affects your interpretation of what this book is saying. Parables are powerful because they work on you in ways that are not always specific, like myth. They feel real or they don't. This book captures the feeling that existence is an ongoing struggle against(and perhaps this is part of the book power and appeal)an ultimately unnamable and unidentifiable foe."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"What is the meaning of life?

Despite that, I highly recommend it to you... Why?. Well, the reason is simple. The plot of \\"The Plague\\" is merely a way of understanding something that has to do with our everyday life, and the way we live it.Succinctly, the story begins when a plague strikes the North-African town of Oran. People at first try to ignore the clues that show that something bad is happening. When they cannot help but recognize that things are seriously wrong, a quarantine is declared. For those inside the walls of Oran, reality changes: death is omnipresent, and loneliness and despair, feelings they must confront. Different people react in diverse ways to the same reality, and we get to know about them through the narrator of this book, that also happens to be one of the protagonists. The real question that most of the persons in Oran ask themselves sooner or later is whether is it worthwhile to fight against the plague, when the outcome in that unfair war is almost certain death...I won't give you the answers they find, if any. For that, you need to read the book... However, I can tell you Albert Camus' opinion. Camus (1913-1960) thought that it is in the fighting against evil that mankind finds its greatness (and maybe justification, who knows), even if we face what might seem at first sight a desperate situation. In a way, I think that for Camus the plague was in this case an allegory of evil, and our attitude against it. That evil changes faces, but always reappears, and it is again time to make choices, and decide what kind of attitude we will take. It is only in the right decisions that we will find the meaning we were searching for.Again, recommended...Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Even in translation, the simple beauty of Camus' language cannot be ignored. *The Plague* depicts urban life as it is really lived with wonderfully descriptive detail. Camus' insight is profound for its simplicity: to get on in life, people must form habits. As we watch the man who spits on cats and the man who sifts peas, we realize that these habits become the defining characteristics of our existence. During the plague itself, the moral indignation of the church is aptly demonstrated as an absurd imoposition. The wrath of God and the redemption of heaven have no place in the plague-stricken town of Oran. It is in this sense that Camus' allegory is revealed: we are always in times of plague. We must fight our human battles and rejoice in our human feelings. In doing so, our lives become meaningful. Such a book as Camus' should be classified under both &quot;World Literature&quot; and &quot;Philosophy;&quot; and a third, &quot;Classics.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Of course there have been more than enough positive reviews of The Plague to make any effort on my part sound rather like preaching to the choir. What I would like to add is that, reflecting what another reviewer mentioned, this book is radically different in both its message and delivery from Camus' other masterwork, The Stranger. While I think the latter is ultimately the more effective and groundbreaking of the two, Meursault and the 'absurdity' which governed the context for his execution never reached me with the kind of explicit emotional honesty we see here displayed in Dr. Rieux. The Stranger is a thinly veiled philosophical treatise on man's powerlessness while The Plague is a book which recognizes other, more crucial, aspects of man: namely, empathy, compassion, fraternity and bravery. I found each of these characters, from the deeply conflicted Rambert to the frighteningly psycopathic Cottard, intricately sketched and almost tangibly real.As a side note, and to finally address why this book is given four stars instead of the full five, I would just mention that Camus' fictional style has always seemed a bit bloodless and guarded to these eyes. He is a master philosopher and an utterly engaging social phenomenon, but as a writer of prose he pales in comparison with people like Faulkner and Graham Greene."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This is a a magnificent novel from a wise, understanding and compassive writer. The story is simple: the city of Oran is stricken by a terrible (and metaphorical) plague spreaded by rats. As soon as it is universally acknowledged, the inhabitants start trying to survive, both physically and emotionally. But each one does it their way, often hanging on to the past which is all they have left in the face of the hideous present and the very uncertain future.The main character is Dr. Rieux, who takes charge of organizing the medical response. He is helped by a curious and moving character, Grand, a man who is trying to write a novel but gets stuck rewriting forever the first sentence, always remembering a lost love and growing to be resigned to his future. There is Cottard, who enjoys the odd situation created by the plague, after trying to kill himself: it seems the plague has given him something meaningful to live for. And Rambert, the foreign journalist who tries time and again to escape the city, only to be deterred by his conscience. The female presence is notoriously scarce. The tone is apparently cold and distant, but it is written with a mastery which gives us a glimpse of the humanity of the author. It's hard and real, and the human spirit in the face of such a disaster shines through.Interestingly enough, this novel seems to contradict Camus's manifested existentialism, such as the one portrayed in &quot;The Stranger&quot;. Strange that an existentialist would write a novel where he seems very clearly to send the message that life exists and is important, that it has a meaning, even if obscure for us mortals, but that somehow it is valuable and deserves to be preserved even by sacrifice. Camus seems to have grown up by the time he wrote this great parable."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Although the Plague is not my favorite Camus, that honor belongs to The Stranger and The Rebel, it is nonetheless a great allegory for the grinding nature of life under occupation by a foreign dictatorial regime.Just as Camus experienced first hand the way in which the Nazi occupation of France beat down the spirit of the French people, in The Plague he parallels that with the way in which an isidious disease can beat down the will of a city's people to live life.Perhaps, the way in which he dealt with the disease itself was rather cursory. Relying, on traditional bubonic plague of medieval vintage as the disease which wipes out large chunks of the city's population, but still I think that is rather irrelevant because in a sense The Plague is a story of evil and apathy. Evil and apathy that creeps into the hearts and minds of the residents of a city gripped by disease, or of the citizens of a nation thats been conquered by a fascist army. The novel may move a little slowly, but I urge anyone who starts reading The Plague to finish, and they will eventually gripped by it. Plus, the novel certainly has a lot to teach us in the twenty-first century and should be read if only for that reason."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is definitely one of my favorite novels. It is beautifully written and overwhelmingly insightful. Upon reading it I immediately fell in love with the characters and felt great empathy for their situations. Each character is wonderfully portrayed as both tragic and triumphant. Camus aggresively pursues the meaning of life with an unexpectedly optimistic view considering the bleak situation of the novel. One thing that bothers me about the book, and about Camus' work in general is that there are no central or ever particularly relevant female characters. Woman only ever serve as the objects of the males' affection or interest. Despite this bothersome flaw(?) I recommend this novel to everyone interested in the human condition, their fellow man, or perspectives on life."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In this adroitly crafted morality tale, Camus draws the reader to the following conclusion: it may only be by suffering deeply that Man is capable of truly fathoming the gift of life.Painting a wrenching descent into doom, Camus demonstrates through some very clever case studies how Man too often is willing to choose the path of least resistance in daily living. While \\"the only true ideas are those of the shipwrecked,\\" it often takes Mankind too much time to unite for the common good, the author suggests, making obvious parallels to the Nazi experience that befell Europe only a few years prior to publication of this novel.Camus weaves his magic subtly, methodically thrusting the reader into a vortex of dark passion, on the premise that discomfort at best, or pure adversity at worst, may be a necessary tonic against complacency. In this way, Camus suggests, The Human Race may finally inch toward living up to expectations - God's, or its Own."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Amazing novel, and one that needed to be written. Far to often are those without a god condemn as morally void. But Camus presents us a world where it is not a connection with God that produces moral responsibility, but, rather, the adandonment of man by God. Camus logically shows us that we are a moral animal because we need to be. We are faced with a universe of ultimate absurdity and infinite void. We have no being we can put our trust and faith in but our selves and our fellow man. I really can't stress how wonderful this novel is. It is what one should read after finishing Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment (whichis fantastic in it's own right, though I whole heartedly disagree with the philosophy behind it), to see the oposite, more logical, philosophy. Unfortunetly, I must dock off a star for Gilbert's translation, which reads more like Dickens then Camus at some points. In a perfect world Mathew Ward, the brillant translator of the vintage international version of The Stranger, would come out with a translation of the Plague. Oh well, C'est la vie..."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Camus reached fame with his elaborations about the concept of the absurd (the purposeless search of the meaning of existence in a universe void of any)in three works: The Stranger, a novel; Caligula, a teathrical opus; and The Myth of Sisyphus, a recopilation of philosophical essays.In his second famous novel, The Plague, we find a different Camus. Perhaps, more concerned about moral values and solidarity between human beings, in the face of massive destruction.The plot of the novel unfolds in the city of Oran, Algeria. The central image has to do with a rat invasion that causes a plague epidemy, with disastrous consecuences. Here we find metaphorically portraited the invasion by the Nazis in 1943 of non occupied France (Camus said that the Nazis came like rats).Then we find a description of the evolution of the plague, the reaction of the authorities (at first, self denial), the progressive isolation of the town from outside world, and on the onset the \\"normalization\\" of the tragedy (people grow accostumed to live with it, and become zombies). After the evolution and the growth of the problem, the inhabitants become completely isolated from the outside, and become prisoners in the inside, due to the drastic measures taken by the authorities. The plague becomes a collective problem that requires recognition and reaction by all. We have here a clear metaphorical reference to the need of a collective reaction to the Vichy government by all the citizens. The call to participate and react becomes a moral issue. Camus then describes with certain detail the soccer stadium where people are forcibly concentrated by the authorities, and this is an allusion to the Nazi concentration camps. More than the persons, the protagonist of this novel is the city.In the sense that the values of solidarity and participation against a common disaster or enemy are called for, this novel is much more developed, from an ethical standpoint, than The Stranger. IT MAKES POWERFUL READING."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I think I actually prefer this to &quot;The Stranger&quot;. That novel was excellent and concisely explained Camus' philosophy, but it lacks the humanity and realistic characterization that is so rich here. All the characters are well defined and believable, but also unique, and they never feel incompletely sketched or generic. Equally importantly, Camus does an excellent job showing the way these different personalities react to their horrible situation, which makes the plague in question seem all the more real.&quot;The Plague&quot; is also a more uplifting slice of existentialism than &quot;The Stranger&quot;. (What? Uplifting existentialism?) Yes, the novel creates a universe indifferent to mankind, but the novel's real stress is on individual responsibility and the necessity of struggling against evil. In a world full of various plagues, Camus encourages us to attempt to be healers. Here, he delivers the theme powerfully in a wonderful novel."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I won't add to the many, many very positive reviews on this list, with whose praises I agree. Rather, I wanted to point out that surprisingly none of the reviews seems to catch the book's plainly allegorical nature. &quot;The Plague&quot; was written by a star of the WWII French resistance and, according to his biographer Herbert Lottman, he first began sketching the novel out during the Nazi occupation of France (during which time he was a newspaper editor living variously in Paris and the south of France, as well as an executive at a leading French publisher and secretly an editor of a leading resistance newspaper).The bubonic plague, as it appears in the novel, is fairly obviously a symbol for Nazi ideology. Like a disease, that ideology invaded and infected many in occupied France. The resistance fighters of that time were thus like heroic doctors battling the disease, and &quot;The Plague&quot; is a chronicle of the moral nature of that fight as seen through the subtle lens of Camus' own moral conception. Camus himself admitted as much in an important essay he published after &quot;The Plague,&quot; written in defense of his novel.Understanding this allegory helps explain that &quot;The Plauge&quot; is at once a work of political philosophy and a further gloss on the moral dilemma first directly faced by Camus in &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus,&quot; &quot;The Stranger,&quot; and his early play &quot;The Misunderstanding.&quot; It is useful, incidentally, to read &quot;The Plague&quot; in connection with Camus' philosophical work &quot;The Rebel&quot; and his play &quot;The Just&quot;; Camus himself saw the three works as an interrelated &quot;triptych&quot; (so says Lottman). Again, understanding this novel's allegorical nature helps explain the relation between the three works."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"&quot;The Plague&quot; is the archetypal piece of existentialism. Camus touches upon the human condition which in turn makes us ponder our own existence. Although the book is a trifle long, we as readers must be aware that a key characteristic of existentialism is attention to the mundane, this provides us with long descriptions of seemingly ungermane concepts. However, this book is a must for anyone who is interested in questioning man's existence, the belief in god, and the absurd. This book was translated from French, so at times, the book's sentence structure may seem akward. But the real importance lies in the extended metaphors that do not unfold immediately."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"'So the only thing for us to do was to go on waiting, and since after a too long waiting ones gives up waiting, the whole town lived as if it had no future.'The small city of Oran is an ordinary city filled with people who possess ordinary values. That is to say, the make love, they work hard at their jobs, they attend church or swim in the nearby bay - the swimmers far outweigh the churchgoers - they drink wine, they laugh, they live. They could be the people of any town, though the narrator admits early that in Oran the pursuit of money outweighs the pursuit of happiness, but isn't that, as well, indicative of a normal city, a normal people, a normal time?Dr Rieux has recently said goodbye to his wife, who is traveling to a sanitarium as a last ditch effort to cure her ailment. He is a calm, mannered, thoughtful man who does not want to show emotion at her parting, because he needs to be strong. After she is gone, a dead rat is found on his balcony, something the manager, M Michel, declares must surely be a prank on behalf of the local schoolboys.But soon, other rats are found in other areas. Not just the hotel now but elsewhere, all around the city, rats are bleeding and dying. In a matter of days, thousands of rats are dead.Dr Rieux continues his rounds as normal, checking up on his patients and discussing the rats. He does not know what has caused their death and agrees that it is unpleasant, but for the moment there is nothing more to do than burn the bodies and continue living. Returning home from a patient, he finds his manager, who is very sick and has developed ganglia on his neck, as well as two black patches on his thighs. 'It's like fire,' he whimpered. 'The bastard's burning me inside.'The next day, the hotel manager is dead. In the words of the narrator, 'Michel's death marked, one might say, the end of the first period, that of bewildering portents, and the beginning of another, relatively more trying, in which the perplexity of the early days gradually gave place to panic.' And he is right - the deaths, few and far between, steadily rise. Soon, people want an answer and, along with a committee of other doctors, it is decided that, although they will not admit the epidemic is plague, they will treat it as such and quarantine the city. Whatever has arrived shall be treated as plague, which is the same as saying that the plague has entered the city of Oran.The narrator allows himself the luxury of chronicling not so much individual stories of plague victims and their problems as the story of Oran itself. Long, thoughtful stretches of text discuss the implications of plague and quarantine, and what it means to the community as a whole. If the entire population is involved in the same problem, has no goal other than that of surviving through he plague, then what is there that a man can do? What can call him forward to act and live as a man should?If we consider that a person living under the spectre of the plague can have no future, then it is up to them to determine the course and flow of the present. But with death everywhere, how is it possible to plan? Too often, we push aside our needs and wants and dreams to an undefined future, a point in our lives when we are free to do as we wish, a hazy 'then' that may never come. When plague strikes - and the narrator argues, quite firmly, that the plague will never be defeated, that it will always come back, when we least expect it and when we are least prepared - our endless future is limited to the abrupt, defined point of tonight. If we wake up alive and plague-free, we may continue living, but our only hope can be to last until we fall asleep and the cycle repeats.While the large majority of the novel is involved with the philosophical aspects of plague - and it would be a weak reader who cannot stretch the metaphor of the plague to that of war, or, more broadly, that of life and living itself - there are characters and situations. There is Rambert, a young journalist who is desperate to leave the city, to be with his fiancee. Or Grand, an old, worn civil-servant who spends his nights composing a novel such that, upon reading the first sentence, his publisher will declare 'Hats off, gentlemen!'. There are deep implications in the character of Grand, for he has never progressed beyond that first sentence, instead refining and enhancing the sentence such that the rest of his work suffers. Again, the metaphor is clear and honest.A note should be made of the friendship between Tarrou and Rieux. At first theirs is a compatibility of thought, a shared understanding of the dogged forward movement of life, but their relationship grows beyond that to become something quite special. Tarrou, it is revealed, has dealt with the plague all his life, has dealt with the different aspects of a plague that is present in all people, and potentially in all situations. When God is not the answer, when hope is not the answer, when there doesn't seem to be an answer at all, they understand that the answer can in fact be something as simple as doing what you consider your best, no matter how terrible the odds.Camus writes with a steadied, sure hand. He is as capable with writing the 'grand overview' sections of the novel that deal with the overall impact of the plague, as he is in developing the friendship of Rieux and Tarrou. At no time does the novel stumble, there is a clear flow and progression of both though and plot, as the culmination of the plague becomes the culmination of the philosophy Camus is expounding. The end of the narrative is both sad and amazingly uplifting, if we consider that, through an unbelievably difficult time, man was capable of rising above and beyond the shroud of plague, and becoming good not for its own sake, but for the sake of goodness itself.The message he has is one that is timely, important, and utterly necessary. The plague is our lives, for we are under the eternal plague of an absent death that is approaching rapidly. Given that we know we shall die, the question becomes, how shall we live? Camus argues through his characters that living is not about when we die but the right now in which we are alive and breathing. We should not do the good in life, and be good purely because of an external reward or for the praise of others no, we should do good because in itself, it is a worthwhile endeavour. Consider: if we praise a man for doing a good deed, aren't we then implying that this good deed is out of the ordinary for the character of man? Is it possible to live in a time when goodness itself is an extra-personal characteristic, and not one that is inherent within all people? Camus says yes, goodness is inherent, and if, in a city ravaged by the plague, ordinary men and woman can do good things, then there is hope for our now - we don't have to relegate it to a distant future that may or may not come to pass."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In Camus' novel a compassionate and conscientious physician struggles against bubonic plague threatening his city of Oran Algeria, while a smug priest exalts in the seeming return to the faith by a populace cowering in fear before what they might perceive as the wrath of God. The author has the final word as to which of these two men finds favor in the eyes of the Lord--the omnipotent entity in this fictional world being, of course, Camus! Let me just say that the outcome was very much to my liking!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I enjoyed this novel much more than The Stranger. Camus takes more time to ponder the deeper questions of existence, arriving at an answer both very French and very admirable. Our protagonist, Dr Rieux, works against a raging and frightening disease, not always knowing quite why. The Why is worked out with the novel, however, not at \\"the end.\\" It's impossible to read this book without realizing why the French invented the Medecins Sans Frontieres in 1971; they see compassion as a human duty. Yet Christians looking for a fight won't find one here.Father Paneloux, the impassioned Christian character, preachs a popular sermon saying that the Plague is God's punishment for the wickedness of the people of Oran. A traditional and increasingly vocal view among Fundamentalists (and I don't mean just Christians). Yet even though Paneloux condemns others, he selflessly works for them. Yet after the priest's own sudden death, Camus avoids any direct condemnation of religion. Instead, in the section where Tarrou questions the doctor about his beliefs we read: \\"(Father) Paneloux is a man of learning, a scholar. He hasn't come in contact with death; that's why he can speak with such assurance of the truth-with a capital T. But every country priest who visits his parishioners and has heard a man gasping for breath on his deathbed thinks as I do. He'd try to relieve human suffering before trying to point out its excellence.....[Rieux said that] if he believed in an all-powerful God he would cease curing the sick and leave that to Him. But one no in the world believed in a God of that sort, no, not even Paneloux, who believed that he believed in such a God. And this was proved by the fact that no one ever threw himself on Providence completely. Anyhow, in this respect Rieux believed himself to be on the right road-in fighting against creation as he found it.\\" (The Plague p.119, 120)This is no straw man argument, Paneloux represents a very mainstream Christian argument about theodicy. Camus's The Plague is a great novel for many reasons, only one of which it does NOT condemn Christians as the \\"enemy.'Still, it is a middling-long novel, and a bit dreary at points. And as a stylist, the radical Camus is, well, let's face it, a bourgeois. But this is a novel rich in philosophy; by which I mean, less about pat answers than interesting questions. Worth reading and rereading."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"It isn't trivial that Albert Camus studied philosophy. In this book, the Nobel Laureate uses a \\"plague\\" to explore how different people react to the hardships and incomprehensible nature of what is thrust upon them. It takes place in the town of Oran, where one day the rats start dying off, and the people quickly follow. The town is sealed off, and the characters have to deal with the isolation and and the bleakness of their circumstance, among other things. This is an excellent book about humanity, but if you are looking for a horror story or something filled with obvious bestseller suspense, look elsewhere. Camus keeps the reader interested throughout, but the interest is in the character of the people he populates the town with, not necessarily with the disease itself. I'd highly recommend it, but just know what you're getting into."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In the city of Oran, something very bad is happening. Albert Camus' The Plague is a masterwork of 20th century literature as it examines the devestating effects of a deadly and bloody plague that breaks out all over the city. In the wake of a quarantine, Dr. Rieux and a handful of survivors band together to do what they can. In the long run, the only thing that any of them can really do to overcome the odds, is live. Though there are times when it is drawn out, The Plague manages to deliver an incredibly compelling story that examines human nature in the wake of incredible adversity, and it has never been done better since. The shocking imagery and perspectives presented here only further show Camus' mastery, and the equally shocking poignancy will surprise you even more so. Definitely not for everyone, The Plague is a masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"\\"There are no more cats. The sight of all those dead rats strewn about the street may have excited their hunting instinct; anyhow they all have vanished\\" (27). And that's how it all starts. The Plague tells the story of one town's experiences with the plague and the characters that try to help the sick and try to survive in the process. Dialogue, like the quote above, allows the reader to visualize the descriptions of life in The Plague. The theme focuses on the plague, which might be misleading. Don't jump to the conclusion that the plague automatically leads to millions of death, but The Plague does have a storyline with substance and death knocking on the door is only one part of the big picture.This book is definitely worth reading. It provided me with insight into how our society could change any moment. With the threats of \\"weapons of mass destruction\\" and \\"biological weapons\\", the thought of an outbreak or \\"plague\\" is always possible. I also saw a connection to how we could be living our lives today and what our society could've been. If at all, read it because it is titled The Plague. Hearing the word plague intrigued me enough to read this book. I thought death and destruction before I opened the cover, but I was treated to not only that, but touching stories like of a husband and wife who were split apart and families with loved ones dying."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"A grim tale and yet when I put it down, I felt elated, alive."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I am re-reading this book after studying this in high school many years ago. Back then, I was told that this book described human philosphical struggle against a meaningless universe. Be that as it may, I find this book even more intriguing as we start to deal with the SARS epidemics (April 2003). The similarity between the epidemics described in Camus' book and the Asian SARS epidemics is striking, particularly people's reaction to the crisis. No need to intelluctualize the story and call it a poliltical or philosphical allegory. This book is even more disturbing when it is read as a literal (fictional) documentory."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"A tremendous work that reads like a &quot;relaxed&quot; thriller.

Simply put, I havenever felt so much empathy, save for those I know to be real.The Plague explores and develops every emotion and mythictheme confronting humanity. Faustian, Biblical, Existentialthemes, and more, are all expressed in language so agonizinglysimple and beautiful that one need not even consider themto derive greatest enjoyment from this work.

And, perhaps,again..."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I don't wish to comment on the story itself (I haven't even finished the book, in fact); merely on its style and wording. I know a bit of French, and understand the form of the language. As I read Gilbert's translation, I can see that form and style. Unfortunately, it makes it difficult to read in English. I get the impression that Gilbert tried to present the English version as close as possible to a verbatim translation of the French, and it really inhibits the flow. I find that I'm constantly caught up trying to disentangle sentences, and it makes it very hard to focus.To be fair to the translator, I've read (or attempted to read) another of work of Camus, and found it equally difficult to get through. That was a non-fiction work called The Rebel, and I assumed it was the philosophical nature of the book that made it so dense.

Although some may find it hard to read, I found it very enjoyable. Camus makes an excellent point using existentialism, symbolism, and desript writing. His book tells of the past, present, and future. It will make you realize what life could be like in hell, and how it might somedaybe in our lives. The Plague will make you think about how your life is now, and how with a blink of an eye it could change."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The novel, \\"THE PLAGUE\\" isn't as important to read \\"for the story\\" (although there is one), but for the philosophy of how Albert Camus approached life in this world of overwhelming absurdities and destructive evils.The \\"plague\\" which confronts the populace is symbolic of the tidal waves of destructive death and life devaluing realities we encounter from our conception, to when we first open our eyes to \\"the world\\" . . . and througout our existence \\"to the grave\\".If it isn't indiscriminate sickness or diseases, then war . . . or the erosion of civil rights and freedoms . . .or a myriad number of indignities attacking \\"human dignity and worth\\".What makes us \\"superior\\" to that existential absurdity and allows us to triumph over its pulling us into meaninglessness is that we can stand and face it . . . and stand in opposition to it . . . simply be \\"being better than it\\". Jesus said \\"if you have done it to one of these the least of my brethern, you have done it to Me\\" . . .And so we rise and live the more nobel life, despite the culture of death and devaluation of human dignity on a one-to-one basis. We help who we can . . . in the way we are able . . . where we are . . . even in the face of seeming hoplessness. Camus' philosophy was that it is more important to live a real nobility, a real morality and be perhaps that one small light . . . that one tiny spark . . . no matter how dark everything else might be . . . because if our light goes out then who's will there be to shine? . . . if not us then who?Albert Camus, as an existentialist philosopher who was a member of the French Resistance and saw the indignities of evil and of war didn't merely \\"talk the talk\\" but he \\"walked the walk\\" -- against all odds.There is a term, \\"annonymous christian\\" . . . perhaps Albert Camus was one such person . . . his writings and \\"The Plague\\" expound a christian approach without claiming to be one. And people of faith . . . or of little or no faith . . . can all learn something from reading Albert Camus . . . and from reading \\"THE PLAGUE\\"."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"There are different ways in which this book registers with the reader. The metaphor of the plague did not represent war to me at all when I read the book, but rather other things, like the way societies can become \\"quarantines\\" of their own volition, how this particular society had \\"quarantined\\" itself long before the plague arrived; the fact that nothing the \\"authorities\\" do to deal with the plague really helps, but in fact, in contrast to the plague, are revealed as being empty systems, and who, I think Camus seems to imply, are rather deserving of the plague, not so much because of any outward travesty they have commited, but because merely they have forgotten, neglected something: which is LIFE. They have been suiting themselves up all along to receive the plague; they have tailored themselves to receive nothing else. So what do we expect?That is a little of what I got from this book. Which is to say that one can get quite a lot from this book. Yet the reason I give it four stars and not five is not so much because of the writing, which does actually seem to lack a substantial middle section, but rather because of Camus's philosophy. His existentialism presupposes things in order to maintain his \\"heroic despair\\" (the practise of the doctors in the book and their volunteers), and thus, in a way, ceases to be existential. That of course doesn't negate it altogether; the doctors perpetually pluck away at their work, without trying to figure any \\"ideal\\" that would reassure them of what they are doing, other than to keep doing, the doing being their testament as it works itself out, a sort of animal hatred of the plague simply because it is a plague; and that is their stamp of life. This is great, but it is not all. His \\"heroic despair\\", while definitely admirable, is not truly existential after itself, and does not completely satisfy by itself. It does not end there."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In a perfect world, I would have given this book 3 &amp; a half stars, However, Amazon only allows full star increments. The novel was better than 3 stars, but not quite 4 stars.This is a story about a horrifying plague that takes place at a large city in Northern Africa. It does deliver on all of the advertised scenes of human anguish in their defenseless struggle against an enemy they cannot see. One can easily identify with the main character of the book, an overworked doctor who does his best to grapple with a microscopic foe that is intent on defeating his every effort to suppress the plague.As expected with Camus, it is also an existentialist novel. It explores how the &quot;problem&quot; of natural evil is apparently no longer answered satisfactorily by the Judeo-Christian tradition. It also toys with the thought of a possibility for sainthood for those who wish to be magnanimous in this life, but do not believe in God.The one serious issue I have with this book is with the ethics of the doctor. Throughout the book, there is a journalist from France who believes that it is &quot;unfair&quot; for him to be quarantined with the rest of the locals when he was, after all, just passing thru. This is a very human and understandable plight. However, the fellow not only devises plans of escaping from the city (and thus breaking quarantine) but even divulges these plans to the doctor. Instead of having him incarcerated for his intentions, the doctor actually encourages him to escape. That would be such a blatantly irresponsible course of action for a doctor to take that it goes well beyond the normal &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; that we should have when engaging literature. The whole point of a quarantine is to isolate a disease so that it does not spread to other cities and countries. For a physician to go along with the aim of a person to break the isolation is nothing short of despicable.Other than that criticism, however, the book is everything it's cracked up to be. An important postmodern work."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"\\"The Plague\\" by Albert Camus tells the tale of an Algerian city struck by the bubonic plague. Over time the city devolves and hope gives way to despair. Camus uses an impartial narrator to tell the story of many different characters who all react differently to the plague.Like Camus' nonfictional work he consistently asks interesting questions with no apparent answers. When the doctor, Rieux, is asked why he helps the city even though his work increases his chance of death he cannot readily give an answer. According to Rieux the reason is because it is his job. As the plague lingers the doctor develops a stronger bond with the people. \\"The Plague\\" has many interesting characters and is an enticing book but Camus typically leaves the question of \\"why\\" a character acts unresolved.Like the works of Kafka \\"The Plague\\" is open to different interpretations. Most likely it is an allegory about French resistance to Nazi occupation with the underlying assumption of Absurdism. This creates a compelling novel but a weak philosophical discourse."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"And his way of weaving a story together about something as horrendous as this, in a time so different from now, just kept me coming back for more the whole time."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This novel, written by the great existentialist Albert Camus, is one of the greatest novels that I have ever read. It is far better than even The Stranger, also by Camus, or even Graham Greene's The Heart of the Matter. It is the story of a cluster of characters, each in his own way quite well developed. Of course, the physician stands out as the main protagonist. They reside in a city that is quarantined to prevent the spread of a plague that, while tragic in its own right, brings the characters to new self-understanding and leads each to new behavioral highs or lows. It is great reading, it is not too long so it can be read in a day or so, and it is sure to offer the reader many opportunities for self-examination (which, I found, takes longer than reading the book). I give this an A+ and it is among the works that I most highly recommend!"},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"In light of the constant scare of chemical warfare we are faced with in this age where even the barbarians in the middle east have access to technology, this book still has much to offer.There is one major theme in this novel and that is stay maintain a level head. Many of the casualties in the story are victimized by their own fear and irrational actions. From the rushed and fatal antidote to the brutallity inside the quarantined city.This book also holds relevence to the fear that had gripped society in the 80's with the AIDS scare."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is another of Camus's magnificently constructed plots, a story created as a way to present his philosophy of life and existence.The novel is about a plague that sweeps the Algerian city of Oran. Characters deal with the plague and the imprisonment they face because of the disease in different ways, but all characters mature greatly along the way. Interestingly, the ethical, noble, and charismatic characters like Dr. Rieux and Tarrou-just like Camus-are atheist. Both characters think all humans are bound up with a destiny of death, and that their existence has no higher spiritual dimension.Another interesting transformation that Camus portrays is the religious point of view presented through Father Paneloux, who's explanation of the plague at the beginning was a punishment sent from God to the people of Oran for their sins, but when Father Paneloux sees innocent children are suffering, Paneloux's explanation of the plague changes to say it is a possible divine test from god of people's faith. Paneloux reaction when he got the disease was very predictable as a religious man. Even though, Camus always rejected religion, the way he dealt with Paneloux ending shows a tremendous respect to what humans choose to believe.The process of maturity transforms each character based on their ethics and morals. Again, Camus has an outstanding way of analyzing humans and existence.Not to ruin the pleasure of finding out; but the reader might enjoy the special reflections of Camus's own understanding of people on the development of Raymond Rambert, Joseph Grand, and Jean Tarrou. At the end of the novel Dr. Rieux, the narrator, presents a brilliant summary about human suffering and their ability to forget or ignore life's absurdity."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"First, this text is not for anyone looking for fast-moving action. It can move very slowly at times as Camus often takes several pages to describe the mundane scenery. There's no real plot as one would expect in a novel; but rather, the story moves slowly from the onset of the plague to its end, with detailed descriptions of a few of the characters and (less-than-shocking) descriptions of people's suffering.But the reason I give this text five stars is for its beautiful language. It's not meant to be a fast-paced action-packed novel, but rather an ethnographic looks at humanity. I can only imagine what the original French might sound like, since the translation itself is already absolutely chilling. Take, for example, \\"...they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress\\" (73). Camus is a genius for metaphors, and brilliantly employs in this text to illustrate some of his most prominent existential and absurdist thoughts.An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"A sensitively written piece of literature examining the strength and weaknesses of the human spirit and ultimately a study in humanity. Bound together by a common tragedy (the plague itself), the reader sees through the eyes of an array of characters, each with their own philosophies and convictions and ways of handling the stress that the plague brings upon the town. This is a philosophical tale sure to leave the reader with much to think on upon its conclusion.I enjoyed this book, found the language very colorful and vivid, and paused a few times to jot down quotes. I believe this to be a book that anyone interested in sociological studies, psychology, ethics, and humanities would be interested in. Not to mention that this is a must-read for lovers of the existential Camus."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"Albert Camus never fails to shed light on the stark being of the human condition. The Plague is a thought provoking, page turning, mind boggling, and philosophically-laced novel. If you're looking for a book that creates an existentialist vibe and evokes drastic change in society during a period of turmoil, then The Plague is for you.The Plague begins with a gruesome and unexplainable observation of rats coming out of the woodwork and dying in some of the most painful ways possible. From the deaths of the rats stem a series of similarly bizarre human deaths in which the protagonist, Dr. Rieux, is assigned to investigate. Rapidly and unmercifully, the death toll rises and no effective cure is available. The city becomes quarantined and Dr. Rieux enlists the help of some of the unexpected characters. Soon enough, the society evolves into a more pacifist state that comes to terms with the plague that ravages what they once knew and loved the most."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"I really enjoyed this book for its insightfulness and bringing a sense of reality to a fictional plague. The book is basically about the plague and the tolls it takes on a city and the ways that the people remain buoyant. The narrative is compelling and analyzes the ways in which different characters, but mostly what the whole town loses and gains in the plague. This is the third book I've read by this author, and they all explore the theme of dying a happy death if there is such a thing. Don't know what else to say but that its insightfulness into a fictional plague will keep you going."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"The Plague is an okay read about survival during a plague. It is low key and non-sensational and even has a passage that says that the author wants to record the events without sensationalism. Unfortunately, this grim, manly stoicism makes the book a little boring.The book makes you think about how you would react during a time of extreme crisis by reading about how the main character, Rieux, and the citizens react. When normal life comes to a standstill, Rieux and the citizens of Oran are forced to think about what is important in life. They are slow to understand that their lives are changing permanently because of the plague. They find it unbelievable that their daily lives could be interrupted by the pestilence. Fear causes the citizens to seriously reflect on their lives because daily routines and mundane consciousness have been disturbed after the death of Michel from the plague: \\"And it was then that fear, and with fear serious reflection, began.\\"They are taken by surprise by the plague and believe that it cannot happen to them: \\"In this respect our townsfolk were like everybody else, wrapped up in themselves, in other words they were humanists: they disbelieved in pestilences....How should they have given thought to anything like plague, which rules out any future, cancels journeys, silences exchange of views.\\"The stoppage of normal life is inconceivable to those who have not experienced the plague. It still remains hard for the people to comprehend the plague and its history of horror as the spring comes on: \\"...cartloads of bodies rumbling through London's ghoul-hearted darkness, nights and days filled always, everywhere, with the eternal cry of human pain. No, all these horrors when not near enough as yet even to ruffle the equanimity of that spring afternoon. The clang of an unseen streetcar came through the window, briskly refuting cruelty and pain.\\"Rieux himself has trouble comprehending that the plague would become full-blown in a such a town as Oran, which has its share of eccentrics such as Grand: \\"He realized how absurd it was, but simply could not believe that a pestilence on the great scale could befall a town where people like Grand could be found, obscure functionaries cultivating harmless eccentricies.\\"I particularly liked Rieux's reaction to Rambert's accusation that he was reacting to the plague and the people affected by it too abstractly. Rieux silently mocks Rambert's idea that he lives in a world of abstractions: \\"Could that term \\"abstraction\\" really apply to the days that he spent in his hospital while the plague was battening on the town, raising its death toll to five hundred victims a week....Still when an abstraction sets to killing you, you've got to get busy with it.\\" Rieux plays on the word \\"abstraction\\" when substituting it for \\"evacuation\\" of the person who has the plague and has to be forcibly removed from the family who resists. He says that \\"...of course, he had pity, but what purpose did that serve?\\" He has to follow the rules of the quarantine during the plague. When children fall ill the mothers wail with \\"distraught abstraction\\" every evening as the doctor makes house calls. Rieux feels \\"bleak indifference\\" coming on as he handles so many cases like this. Rieux uses that indifference to survive the long hours of dealing with plague victims, remarking that, \\"To fight abstraction, you must have something of it in your own make up.\\" He finds solace in his lack of emotion. But he does not expect Rambert to understand what he is going through. Rieux actually deals with heart-rending situations, but he must shut himself off from feeling too much pain about them."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book, whether inadvertently or not, revolves around Part Two when a child dies from the plague and Father Paneloux delivers a sermon about God's vengeance for man's sin. Dr. Rieux criticizes this sermon by noting that the innocence of children should not incur God's wrath. Paneloux's retort is quite shallow, when he says that God \\"tests\\" us through suffering. Camus is essentially doing two things here: he is citing the existence of evil to do away with God's existence and is asserting a basis for his own simplistic morality. That is why Part Two is the center of the plot. Camus sets up straw men such as weakly constructed arguments of the sermon and puts them in the mouth of a Christian authority. We see this in his earlier book \\"The Stranger.\\" He has severe hangups with clerical authorities. He seems to have been influenced by his countryman the Marquis de Sade who wrote \\"Dialogue between a Priest and a Dying Man.\\" Camus's view of morality has to do with being loyal to family and friends, being fair and being brave in difficult situations. Ultimately, he considers suicide as a possible response to the absurd in life, such as the absurd in the Plague. In \\"The Myth of Sisyphus,\\" he says that the proper response is not suicide; rather, the proper response is revolt. Such is shallow understanding of human life. Camus contradicts himself in his struggle to justify his patent denial of sin. For example, in his straw man argument about the existence of evil as a basis to question God's existence, he holds God to a moral standard while denying the same: if ultimate reality isn't moral, you can't morally condemn it. Evil in the world is the result of man exercising free will. Without free will, there can be no love. However, with free will, the potential for evil exists. Evil is irrational by definition; hence, its casualties includes children, animals and other innocent parties in its midst. Evil is like a hand grenade that harms everything in its path, irrespective of one's moral excellence. In accord with Camus's expectations, shrapnel or bombs should take detours around good people. Ironically, Camus proffers a world view that supports evil men since it renders their evil actions morally neutral. He undercuts himself again and again like this. His writing meanders like Kafka to the point it conforms to no literary style at all. Novels seem to be a platform for his godless preaching. The Plague certainly strikes one this way. As to how to determine right and wrong, the formula is simple: Love God with your heart, soul and mind and love your neighbor as yourself since love will not murder, steal, covet and so on."},{"Title":"The Plague","review":"This book has no emotion, depth or human insight.

Unfortunately my introduction to it was tutoring for an introductory class. The material is well written and organized but far too densely written, particularly for students who have never had a logic class before and are coming from questionable mathematics backgrounds. That there is no index of symbols just makes navigating the text that much more difficult.On another level, the author seems to eschew a good many things that many other logic courses--at least those I've seen and taken--use in depth. Things like Modus Ponens are barely touched on in favor of &quot;v E&quot; (disjunction elimination). This seems unusual for an introductory textbook in the field, though I am not familiar enough to know for certain."},{"Title":"Modern Logic: A Text in Elementary Symbolic Logic","review":"It is important to be forewarned that this is not a good text for an introductory logic class. I have taught classes using several other texts, and, although they had their flaws, the Forbes' text has flaws that are almost unsurmountable for the typical lower-division college student. The explanations, though creative,are not clear enough, and the flow of topics is out of sorts. For example, the exercises which accompany the sections start out too difficult to be any aid in helping the introductory student grasp the techniques. In short, for upper-division courses or for people who already have a logic background, this is an interesting book and might be worth a look, but it fails miserably as an introductory text."},{"Title":"Modern Logic: A Text in Elementary Symbolic Logic","review":"I used this book in my logic course.

The treatment is mainly formal, but enough intuitive and philosophic explanation is given to reveal the motivation for the symbolic machinery. The use of interpretations for testing validity is helpful in relating logic to the worlds to which it could refer. Basic classical logic is thoroughly covered in chapters on sentential, monadic predicate, and full first order logic. The rules presented for introduction and elimination of logical constants are clearly justified; the proof strategies are varied and relevant to the notion of logical consequence being developed. The concluding chapters on modal, intuitionistic, and fuzzy logic, while brief, provide substantial exposure to these systems. Throughout the book, interesting material comparing various types of logic is to be found. Altogether, definitely worth the effort."},{"Title":"The Ghost of Tricia Martin (Sweet Valley High, No. 64)","review":"Like I said in an earlier Sweet Valley High review, Steven Wakefield is still obsessed with his dead girlfriend, and this is mentioned in a few SVH books.This time he leaves poor Cara Walker to chase after some girl who resembles Tricia.

I was never personally a fan and read a few of the books then lost interest. It did have some deeper issues besides fashion and romance and the barbie-like Wakefeild twins Jessica and Elizabeth are thankfully only in the backgound in this book. Their brother Steven really misses his dead girlfriend Tricia and finds a girl who looks a lot like her and decides to date her, basically dumping his current girlfriend Cara. He keeps thinking the girl is his lost love Tricia and his reality is shattered when..gasp..he discovers this girl is a different person with her own life and identity and is, in reality very unlike Tricia other then the fact they look alike. This book is actually mildly spooky and haunting and delves into heavier topics than the other SVH books I have read. Of course, when I was in high school this series was already getting a bit dated. The characters never seemed real to me and it really sounded like they were written by an adult who wished they were back in high school, rather than from the view of a teenager. Therea are a lot of 80's and 90's references and I don't think these books are the 'timeless' sort. I also feel that the older books might seem a little shallow and unsophisticated to girls of today.

Amazingly, slaves of very diverse background thrown together under the most adverse conditions managed to somehow reconstruct a great deal of their African culture and transmit it to American-born generations. This courageous cultural achievement has been a major factor in sustaining African-Americans through centuries of tribulations. The author wrote this in 1941 to celebrate the survival of Africanness in African-American culture. It was a pioneering work by someone who was not himself an African-American and subsequent scholars, particularly those from the African-American community, have gone far beyond it. But as you can see from the unfair way that some people disparage such legitimate outgrouths of African traditions such as rap and Ebonics, there is still much that can be learned from this book."},{"Title":"Understanding the Tarot Deck: Being Fragments of a Secret Tradition Under the Veil of Divination","review":"This is Waite's Pictorial Key to the Tarot, which is the same text as published by U.S. Games and Samuel Weiser, but with a couple of bonuses.The first bonus are two sections written by Gertrude Moakley - an introduction which gives nice background material on the deck and a section describing the rules of the tarot game, which I couldnt find elsewhere.The second bonus is that cards' pictures are not black and white outlines, as in U.S. Games' and Samuel Weiser's editions, but rather have shades of gray.

This book is NOT the one to get.Though I have found the Rider-Waite deck to be the most accurate and useful, A.E. Waite's explanation of it leaves much to be desired. One gets the impression from leafing through this volume, that Mr. Waite knew very well what he was talking about, but was frustratingly unable to convey it in plain language for the layman. The card descriptions are loaded down with mystical mumbo-jumbo that perhaps made sense to an initiate of the Golden Dawn, but is going to leave a modern Tarot dabbler scratching his head in perplexity. Even in the chapters where Waite presents simple divinatory meanings for each card (the same as what's printed in the little booklet that comes with the Rider deck) the interpretations seem arbitrary since Waite does not sufficiently explain WHY the card would mean that. Many of the possible interpretations are wildly contradictory, and I have found some of them to be inaccurate and misleading. Overall not a very helpful book."},{"Title":"Understanding the Tarot Deck: Being Fragments of a Secret Tradition Under the Veil of Divination","review":"This tarot book is a basic edition of the meaning behind the cards.Arthur Edward Waite and Pamela Colman Smith created the current standard tarot deck, mostly used today.Yet,this book is fairly brief.And there are many other more imaginative tarot books around thesedays.My only qualm with this book is that it is too abrupt and not expansive enough, in it's characterizing of the individual cards.I would read this divination book again,because it's still a tarot pictorial classic."},{"Title":"Essential Incredible Hulk, Vol. 1 TPB (Marvel Essentials)","review":"Ol' Greenskin did not rake in as much green at the box office this summer as the movie moguls might have hoped, but there should still be enough interest generated by the film version of &quot;The Hulk&quot; to send a few people looking at Volume 1 of &quot;The Essential Hulk.&quot; Collected within the pages of this trade paperback are the six issues from the original comic book of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; and 32 stories from &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; (issues #60-91). This becomes important because in the case of the latter we are talking 10 page stories because the Hulk shared space in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; with first Giant-Man and then the Sub-Mariner. Not that any Marvel superhero is particularly suited to this abbreviated storytelling format, but the Hulk certainly seems to be rather ill matched. After all, within each and every 10-page story Bruce Banner has to change into the Hulk (or visa versa), all without anybody getting a clue to the transformation (&quot;Where did Doctor Banner go!&quot;). That is why the original six issues of &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; stand out in such marked contrast.But beyond that I think the idea of the Hulk is better than the stories. The combination of the Dr. Jekyll &amp; Hyde transformation with the Frankenstein monster is inherently interesting. Those classic references also explain why the better stories seem to be those in which the army is going after the Hulk rather than the less than stellar super villains who pop up. Sure, the Leader would be rather ironic from the viewpoint of Dr. Banner, but the best conflicts with the Hulk involve not brains versus brawn but the one against the many. When &quot;Thunderbolt&quot; Ross has the U.S. Army go after the Hulk, then we are cooking with gas. Very few bad guys can go toe-to-toe with ol' green skin (notice they bring in Hercules) and the general rule is someone like Boomerang trying to stay one step ahead and avoid the inevitable for as long as possible. The validity of this viewpoint is certainly validated by this summer's blockbuster film (playing is a theater near you NOW!). That also explains why the soap opera elements, with the Hulk coming between Bruce Banner and Betty Ross are more appealing. That is actually what provides the continuity over the course of these stories. Then there are the supporting characters, with Major Talbot, the son-in-law General Ross really wants, and Rick Jones, the teenage side kick who has no powers (at this point in Marvel history), just a big green secret.The end result is okay, but certainly not the best Marvel was putting out in the early Sixties. The origin story is arguably the best of the bunch. Stan Lee writes all of the stories and Jack Kirby does most of the art, but you will also find the pencil work of Steve Ditko, John Romita, John Buscema, Gil Kane and other diverse hands from the Marvel Bullpen. The Ditko drawn Hulk always strikes me as looking rather strange, but there is something to be said for Bill Everett inking Kirby's layouts. So there is no reason not to pick up this volume of &quot;Essential&quot; Marvel reprints, it is just not to be high on the list, except for the buzz generated by the film."},{"Title":"Essential Incredible Hulk, Vol. 1 TPB (Marvel Essentials)","review":"Right now the Incredible Hulk is one of the most famous comic books of our time. But like the X-Men, it was not famous at first. Hulk's first series was crushed after only six issues. After that he was stuck in guest star limbo for about a year(but he got a major role in the early issues of the Avengers) until he was brought back in Tales to Astonish #60, but the stories were only half as long to make room for stories about Ant/Giant-Man (and later the Sub-Mariner), which were also halved. It wasn't until Tales to Astonish became the Incredible Hulk(Volume 2) with the 102nd issue that Hulk was back in his full-length comic. But I'm getting ahead of myself there- ah yes, the premise.Dr. Robert Bruce Banner was an atomic scientist working at a New Mexico missile base when he was caught in the test-explosion of his very own invention, the deadly G-Bomb. Irradiated by the gamma rays, Banner know possessed the ability to transform into the Hulk under conditions which vary throughout the series. As Banner, he is an intelligent yet weak human. As the Hulk, he is a large green monster-like person with bulging muscles and a limited vocabulary. Unlike other superheroes, Banner often cannot control the Hulk or his transformations(except when Banner's mind winds up in the Hulk's body at times). As the Hulk he is also hounded by the military and General Thaddeus \\"Thunderbolt\\" Ross, father of the woman Banner loves. His only confidant early in the series is Rick Jones, whose life Banner saved before he was caught in the G-Bomb's explosion. At times Rick is the only person who can control the rampaging Hulk except for maybe the beautiful Betty Ross.This anthology contains all six issues of The Incredible Hulk (Volume 1) as well as issues 60-92 of Tales to Astonish-but only the Hulk's stories are collected. For the other, non-Hulk stories you'll have to check Ant-Man Essential or Marvel Masterworks: Sub-Mariner.The Incredible Hulk (Volume 1) is one of the only problems with these stories. After a sensational first issue the series starts to degenarate. Changes are made to the Hulk in nearly every issue which are changed later(for instance in Isuue 3, Hulk is exposed to more radiation which allows him to fly and gives him a mind link with Rick Jones. The mind link disappears by Issue 5, and the flying is later retconned into just wide leaps.) The villains are weak too. I enjoyed Gargoyle, but the Toad Men and all the Communists(these comics were made during the cold war in the 60's if I forgot to mention) bring down the first issues. The only ones who become ongoing villains from the first six issues are Tyrannus and the Ringmaster's Circus of Crime. Don't get me started on the Metal Master.Tales to Astonish fulfills its name, as it's filled with cliffhangers, fresh villains and less commies (they get REAL annoying after a while). There's Hulk's greatest nemiseses, the Leader and the Abomination. There's guest stars like the Chameleon and Hercules. The first appearances of Boomerang and the Secret Empire, who move on to be pains in other people's asses. There's also the Leader's wide range of mechanical Humanoids. The story also evolves into one that may be more familiar to modern day readers: a man fighting the monster within him while on the run from the military. It also intriduces Major Glenn Talbot, a charming soldier who hates both Banner and the Hulk and falls in love with Betty Ross instantly. And it gets much better in the second volume.Classic stories by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. But if you bought the Marvel Masterworks Incredible Hulk Volume 1, you'd get it in color and see that the Hulk was colored gray instead of green in the first issue, which makes way for a vital retcon much further down the road. You also would have paid more money, but you would have gotten it in a more durable format with clean, crisp pasges unlike the Essential's flimbsythird-grade pages.

Then I started reading the graphic novels that came out after those stories and they made me want to find out more about the origins of this awesome character.So I went out and picked this up from my local comic shop. At first the stories were pretty bland, Banner turns into Hulk, General Ross wants the Hulk dead because Ross feels his rep/manhood/ego/whatever is inferior compared to the Hulk.However once the first like 10 stories or so were out of the way, we really start to see how tormented the Hulk is and how even though he just wants to be left alone, no one will respect his wishes. People want to kill him, recruit him to their cause, or manipulate him to do their dirty work, or fight other people for them.The silliest part is when he fights a villain that I can only describe as Tiddlywinks Man, who also wears a \\"blouse.\\" Yes, he called his jacket a blouse and he flicks tiddlywinks at the Hulk).In the book we see cameos by Hercules and Namor. Also there are references to the Fantastic Four and the Avengers once in a while.If you're a fan of the Hulk, this is a must have!"},{"Title":"Essential Incredible Hulk, Vol. 1 TPB (Marvel Essentials)","review":"Don't make me angry, you wouldn't like me when I'm angry.... never spoken in this volume, just for the hard of understanding. I read Marvel's superhero comics when I was a kid and they were wonderful. The Hulk was never a favourite of mine and so when I bought this to reminisce I found I did not know literally any of the stories although I had long known the origins of this character.I discover now that the Hulk was discontinued after six issues, and then re-born in Tales to Astonish, before once more (and after this collection) meriting his own dedicated book. These early tales do fall a little short of the later standards this series achieved but they are genuinely essential for all the fabulous ingredients in the Hulk's basic family melodrama. To wit: the hurrumphing Thunderbolt Ross (a loud noise in trousers, a general of very little brain); the rather unrealised love interest, his daughter Betty; the kid who caused it all and would not go away Rick Jones; and the eventual introduction of Bruce Banner's love rival the tortured soul of Major Glen Talbot.The scripts are fascinating. Stan Lee didn't bother to consult his previous editions and wrote from memory so he managed to mis-remember details such as what triggered the Hulk to change (this was intially night and day but evolves throughout so that ultimately he can more or less do it when he sneezes too hard) and the art work was handed around like a piping hot jacket potato so the variability in it is sometimes hilarious - the Hulk would have a hard time matching up to his passport photo if it were not for the fact he is big and green. Lee even spells Talbot's name differently at times.But it's such good fun and its where it all began - the setting works well intially, on the isolated military testing base, but ultimately comes to suffocate the plot lines and restrict the development of the character who is hardly a menace to mankind if all he ever does is prowl the desert. The best way to deal with the Hulk militarily would have been to ignore him completely. Ah well, it's only fiction. Thin on super villains to give him a fight (with the exception at close of the Abomination) but not on kitchen sink drama, this volume is truly essential even if it's one of the less coherent starts in life for a giant Marvel character. Read it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Essential Incredible Hulk, Vol. 1 TPB (Marvel Essentials)","review":"I wasn't sure that I'd enjoy this entry into the Marvel Essentials series, but I was thoroughly surprised. If you can get past the Hulk's continuity problems as Stan Lee tinkered with the basic formula, it's good writing.

Have for years but i recommend this for hardcore fans who want to read the green guys early adventures and see where the character came from and how he developed. The first 6 issues are cool albeit a bit corny on the dialog, everything else that follows is sort of disappointing if your looking for comprehensive or cohesive plots. Many of the stories have Hulk wandering around where he suddenly gets adbucted by some strange being from another dimension and is either attacked or used to do the villians bidding. This seems to repeat over and over especially in Vol 2. Once in awhile the Hulk/Betty relationship is explored and its one of the nice aspects of Hulk, and thus pretty much always has been even in future issues. I love Hulk. I love the action and I love the history behind him that is presented in these 2 books. A few of Hulk's greatest foes encounter him for the first time here, but for the most part the stories were hard to get through for me because of the very, very corny 60's dialog. I also find it annoying that characters seem to describe things that they do in mid action, like &quot;Oh, no I just fell of this mountain, I hope I can hang on or I'll be doomed.&quot; Get these if your a huge Hulk fan, if you've never been interested in him I think you'd find these way too cheesy even as an introduction to the character. But I can't say these issues are all bad, they just had a certain way of writing comics back then that seem really silly by today's standards. If they release a Vol. 3 you know I would pick it up in a minute, but more for nostalgia's sake then the weight of the story telling."},{"Title":"Essential Incredible Hulk, Vol. 1 TPB (Marvel Essentials)","review":"A good collection that includes the first Incredible Hulk series (issues 1-6 from 1962) and the Hulk stories from Tales To Astonish 60-91, but should have included more.

I've given it 5 stars because at the time of my reading it, I enjoyed it very much. Like other reviewers, I loved the photos and the general layout of the book, but I wouldn't say this is a reliable biography of Marilyn. In fact, much of the information in this book has been proven over the years to be nonfactual, or unsubstantiated, and of course controversial. Nevertheless, it's entertaining if you treat it as a fictional novel (based on fact) rather than a true full account. Even though it was entertaining and the photos are breathtaking, I can't recommend this book to the reader who is interested in a factual narrative of her life. If you're still keen, then get it for the photography and take the rest of it with a grain of salt - unless of course if you're able to swallow the conspiracy theories that Marilyn's death involved the FBI and CIA or believe that sleazy Slatzer guy was once her lover."},{"Title":"Marilyn: A biography","review":"I have been re-reading Norman Mailer's Marilyn- his take on the life of the legendary screen star Marilyn Monroe at a time when I have just viewed the American Masters documentary on the musical career of the singer/songwriter Joni Mitchell. And although there is no obvious connection between the lives or the talents of the two women there is a tale of two generations hidden here. Marilyn represented for my parent's generation, the generation that survived the Great Depression and fought World War II, the epitome of blond glamour, sex and talent. To my more \`sedate' generation long straight-haired blond Joni represented the introspective, searching quiet beauty that we sought to represent our longings for understanding of a seemingly baffling world that we had not made. As the this book and the Mitchell documentary points out however they \`represented' our fantasies they also shared a common vulnerability attempting to be independent women in worlds dominated by men. Such is the life of the great creative talents.Mailer traces Monroe rise from poverty, the struggle to find herself, through to the rocky and some times sleazy road to stardom. As always with Mailer one gets his take on what the symbol of Marilyn meant to my parents' generation, and, let us face it, especially men. His portrayal does not evoke his preferred hipster, beat personality but its counterpoint in the 1950's the heyday of Marilyn's fame. Mailer also goes through Marilyn various affairs with men particularly the doomed marriage to the playwright Arthur Miller. Finally he gives some very interesting details on the behind the scenes drama in the creation of many of her well-known films. Marilyn, while she was alive, never drew my eye for the reasons that Joni Mitchell did. But much later, having seen the classic The Misfits in a film revival theater, I will say just one thing about her looks and performance in that film. Wow. The marriage to Miller may have not worked out but she did right by him and herself with that performance. Yes, indeed."},{"Title":"Marilyn: A biography","review":"This book contains some of the best and last images ever taken of Marilyn. There are also quiet a lot of pictures taking on various movie sets, mainly &quot;The Misfits&quot;. As highly as i recommend this book for the photography alone, i can not totally endorse the written part by famous writer Norman Mailer. He borrows heavily here from another biography and touches on the theory that Marilyn was murdered..all without any proof. One get's the feeling that the text borrows also a lot from the Authors imagination rather than fact. I would ordinarily give this book 5 Stars for the pictures and the oversized format. Also..GREAT COVER!"},{"Title":"Marilyn: A biography","review":"it is really kool to have something from the past.i just love it and now i no a little more about marilyn."},{"Title":"Marilyn: A biography","review":"I read this book in high school, and Mailer nails it!

Thanks for everything.Everyone who loves Marilyn Monroe should read this book."},{"Title":"Marilyn: A biography","review":"In this book the author describes the tumultuous career and life of Marylin Monroe. One gets the impression from reading this book that there are only 3 roles for actresses in Hollywood namely \\"Babe\\", \\"District Attorney\\" and \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\". Sadly Ms. Monroe did not get past the 'Babe\\" stage of her acting career. This book is just one of many biographies on this actress who has had more books written about her than any other deceased celebrity. One gets the feeling from reading this book that if Ms. Monoroe would have lived until her sixties then she would have just been another \\"has been actress\\" largely forgotten by the Movie Going Public and would have gotten 5 lines in her Obituary on page 10 of any newspaper like her contemporary actress Gene Tierney did. I give this book 5 stars for the valiant attempt by the author in his efforts to illustrate the complexities of this sad,lonely lost soul."},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"\\"The Outbreak of Rebellion\\" is John Nicolay's story of the early days of the Civil War. Written just twenty years after the events it records, it begins with the rumblings of secession in South Carolina and continues through the first Battle of Bull Run/Manassas. It gives, while not a contemporary account, one based on living memory. On these pages the reader gets an up close view of Abraham Lincoln and is taken back to the days of secession, Fort Sumter, the mob attack on the Sixth Massachusetts in Baltimore, the death of Elmer Ellsworth, issues that made their way from Missouri and Kentucky to the White House and the demonstration of pro-Union sentiment in West Virginia only to name a few. Written by President Lincoln's private secretary, it has a strong Union flavor.Although short, this is a good history. It has sufficient facts to qualify as history, but it is also a period piece, bringing the spirit of the times to the reader. One example of the partisan prose with which this book is filled is Nicolay's assessment of President Buchanan: \\"his condition of mind predisposed him in a remarkable degree to fall under the controlling influence of his disloyal counselors. He possessed the opposing qualities of feeble will and stubborn prejudice; advancing years and decreasing vigor added to his irresolution embarrassed his always limited capabilities.\\" It is better written than many Civil War memoirs. Read it for its spirit, the spirit of a Union triumphant and take the history is a bonus."},{"Title":"The outbreak of rebellion (Campaigns of the Civil War)","review":"This history of the outbreak of the Civil War is unique in presenting it from the perspective of Lincoln's personal secretary. The man was a participant, and on the legal aspects gives some very clear headed arguments. Much of the precedent goes back to the aftermath of the American Revolution. There were two steps to creating the federal government of the United States. First, each colony had to declare independence from England (which they did together in one document). The individual colonies could now agree to enter into a larger confederation of colonies. It was not at all clear that this would happen, as many had different interests. For that reason the constitution does not outlaw slavery, and fails to address whether member of the union can later secede. These and other touchy issuies might have been deal breakers.The Southern Secession required a similar process, which raised some paradoxes. Nicolay argues that, constitutional ambiguity aside, none had the authority to issue articles of secession. Simply put, it is not among the defined powers of the governors or legislatures. Their oath of office requires them to support and defend the constitution of the United States. But secede they did, after which -- as independent states -- they were free to enter into a new confederacy. Here is where Nicolay finds contradiction in their arguments. They seceeded over the issue of states' rights. But having done so, promptly surrendered them to a new confederacy. Nicolay says, probably due need for immediate action, the confederate constitution was largely taken from the original. Among key changes, the statement that all men are created equal was striken. But there was also no provision allowing a state to secede from the new union. Essentially, Nicolay argues the states' rights issues was merely a pretext.He points to a single man as setting events in motion -- Governor Cist of South Carolina. He wrote a letter to other governors asking, if South Carolina should secede, would the others follow? The answers were ambiguous, but things were set in motion.Nicolay argues that the slavery issue was only vital to a very few states, and even there only to influentual land owners of the deep south. For the ordinary person there was little or nothing to be gained:\\"Drills, parades, meetings, bonfires, secession harangues, secession cockades, palmetto flags, purchase of fire-arms and powder, singing of the Marseillaise -- there is not room to enumerate the follies to which the general populace, especially of Charleston, devoted their days and nights. There was universal satisfaction: to the conspirators, because their schemes were progressing; to the rabble, because it had a continuous holiday.\\"Of all the states, only Texas submitted the articles of succesion to the people for a vote. Texas was a special case because it had only been in the Union about twenty years. Sam Houston was disappointed because he expected the Federal army to help police the Mexican border, but they did not. Houston's scheme was to secede but not join the Confederacy. He believed Texas could conquer northern Mexico, gain access to the Pacific, and be positioned to suceed as an independent nation. The legislature threw him out and went with the Confederacy.The battle of Bull Run is especially well covered, and turns out quite unlike the simplified accounts. A good survey of the struggles in the border states is also given.* * *This book is part of a series of 12 short volumes on the land war published in 1882-3. It took congress twenty years to finally allocate funds to all the documents and communications sorted through. Americans could at last have an inside look at who actually said or did what, and when.While that massive project was still underway, the publisher of this series persuaded highly qualified people - most of them participants -- to produce a quick readable history in light of the new information.M.F. Force (\\"From Fort Henry to Corinth\\"), says, \\"The main source of information is the official reports of battles and operations. These reports, both National and Confederate, will appear in the series of volumes Military Reports now in preparation [by] the War Records office in the War Department.\\"Alexander Webb (\\"The Peninsula\\") adds \\"To be of any practical use, all history, and particularly military history, must be gradually sifted and reduced to small compass.\\"Jacob D. Cox (\\"The March to the Sea - Franklin & Nashville\\") sums up purpose and limitations: \\"The class of readers which has been most in mind [includes] includes the surviving officers and men who served in the war. [My] aim has been to supplement their personal knowledge by the facts ... of recent research. To give unity and symmetry to the ... campaigns here told, by examining each in the light of the plans and purposes of the leaders on both sides. The limits assigned... made it necessary to choose between the narration of incidents which would enliven the story, and that fullness to strictly military detail which seemed necessary to make the several campaigns clearly intelligible, and to enable the reader to judge, with some degree of satisfaction, the character of the operations. ...the effort to do so will give to each a broader understanding of what the great game of war really is.\\"This is what these short works accomplish in spades. With good maps at hand, the text is easily followed, often with amazement at the sorts of things that can and do routinely occur on campaign and in battle. We see armies so pestered by the random and unforeseen that one wonders how anything is accomplished.But the above assumes good maps - and here the books fall short.Cox: \\"The maps ... are reduced copies of the official surveys made by the engineers of the army. ... In reducing them it has not been possible to preserve all the details of the original... The reader is presumed to make reference to an ordinary hand-atlas... To have illustrated the text by larger and more elaborate maps would have thwarted the purpose of the publishers to put the series within the reach of all.\\"You do need more detailed maps that supplied in most popular military atlases. There are several solutions. If the maps in a particular volume are printed clearly, they can be enlarged on a Xerox machine. Alternately, simply google under Images for, say, \\"Wilderness, 1864\\" and you'll likely find an amazing variety of choices to print out.Back in the 1880s, the full sized official government maps were available in a large folder. These were photo reduced to a still legible size, and presented in color, in an 1891 oversized book titled \\"The Official Military Atlas of the Civil War.\\"B&N; reprinted this book in 2004, photo-reduced 10% (to 13 x 16 \\"). You can get a used copy on Amazon for $20.00. The only odd thing is that all maps are placed completely randomly, apparently whatever will fit where. You have to consult the appropriate index, which will list all plates (facing pages) containing a relevant map.* * *To give a sense of the value of these books, (1) I've posted some of my personal maps from these books. When a caption isn't attributed, it's mine, warts and all.(2) You find remarkable eyewitness observations such as this in Palfrey's \\"The Antietem and Fredericksburg.\\" The Union having been defeated at 2nd Manassas must move to block Lee's attempt to cross into Maryland or Pennsylvania. The fastest way for these haggard troops to do so is to march back through Washington and then west.\\"Washington and its environs presented singular sights in the early days of September, 1862. The luxury and refinements of peace contrasted sharply with the privations and squalor of war. There are few prettier suburban drives than those in the neighborhood of Washington, and no weather is more delightful than that of late evning there, when a cooler air comes with shortening days. As the shadows lengthened in the golden afternoon, well-appointed carriages rolled along those charming drives, and by their side the ragged, dusty, sunburnt regiments from Pennsylvania trudged along. Rest, cleanliness, ice, food, drink, every indulgence of civilized life were within reach, but our hands could not be stretched to grasp them. ... The carriages returned to their stables, the fair ladies returned to the enjoyment of every pleasure that Washington could confer, but the Army of the Potomac moved steadily northward to bivouac under the stars or the clouds, and to march again in its tatters through the dust and the sunshine, through the rain and the mud.\\"(3) The actual communications among commanders is fascinating.(4) Basically working through these books with maps is a quick read, but also has the fascination of working through a book of logic problems. The essential information available to commanders is in your hands also. What to do is not always clear, but I came to admire the ability of most generals to \\"let a situation develop,\\" then \\"read\\" it, and take actions.The complete set:(1) The Outbreak of Rebellion - John G.

Many publishers offer cheap digital scans with illegible maps and text that is difficult to read -- apparently this reviews stepped on one such land mine.The best editions by far are those from DSI digital scans, with flawless text and clear maps. Most of the have the \\"Look Inside\\" feature so you can see for yourself.For some unfortunate reason, DSI's editions usually don't appear when you search these titles. Try searching a title with DSI after the name, but even that doesn't always work.The Da Capo edition is also good. It's editions are a little smaller in size but of high quality and with excellent contemporary introductions.Final comment - I'm no expert or professional Civil War buff, so don't treat anything I've written as such.

From this book, it is apparent that this method of spiritual transmission is the most important live link to the tradition of the Prophet Muhammad.The sections on the Shariatic bases of the Sufi methodology are also a great boon for those who are constantly confronted by the banal criticism of prosaic Muslims who harp on the need to conform to Quran and Sunna.

I purchased my first bonded leather one in 1999. Since then I have purchased many other study bibles and was not satisfied. I have concluded that this is the best study bible created. It is so nice to have the option of reading the bible text without a load of commentary being stuffed in your face. If you want a commentary, go buy one! The more I study the Bible, the less of man's opinion I want. This bible allows you to read and research any topic on your own using scripture only. I LOVE MY THOMPSON-CHAIN!Get the Genuine leather or a Calfskin because as a new Christian, you may not get the full use of the bible right away, however, as your thirst for God's precepts increases, this Bible will not disappoint. Kirkbride bibles are built very sturdy and the genuine leather will ensure that the bible lasts longer outside of a cover. This is the best Bible I own."},{"Title":"The Thompson Chain-Reference Study Bible/Kjv/Burgundy Leather","review":"To be most helpful to you, I have included information about Thompson Bibles in general, and about the NASB in particular. I'd also like to point out that there are apparently two companies that produce a \\"Thompson Chain Bible.\\" The one I reviewed was produced by Kirkbride. My suspicion is that they make a nicer bible than \\"that other company.\\"My Bibles get used every day, so when I decide to replace one it needs to be something that is going to last. After looking at Bibles for three days at various bookstores, I recently bought a Thompson Chain NASB. I love it.The page layout is very pleasant to the eye. While I don't agree that the Thompson Chain system is totally free of denominational bias, it is pretty close. If you don't want to use the Thompson study system, it sits unobtrusively off to the side of the page. Chances are though, you'll use it a lot. Other Bibles I've seen give you about one third of each page with some commentator's opinion of what he thinks God's word says, which gets kind of annoying. Plenty of textual notes (refering to manuscript issues) are provided in this version.About the construction: My first Thompson Chain was a NIV with bonded leather. I bought it in 1985 and it's still holding up. My new one is the genuine leather and should hold up just as well. I've seen other reviews where people complain about shoddy workmanship, cheap paper, or the fact that its printed offshore. My 1985 version was printed in Canada (not US) has similarly thin paper, and has held up just fine. I think that this one will also. Unlike some of my other similarly priced study Bibles, the leather on this Thompson Chain NASB was not shiny. It has kind of somewhere between shiny and satin, but quite attractive. Inside both covers there are plenty of blank pages for notes.I also have the NIV version ISBN 088707166X, the KJV version, and the NKJV all of which I have purchased in the last six months. The NIV version is thinner and easier to carry due to the print being smaller, and the fact that the NIV contains less textual notes. The helps in the back of the Bible are the same, but the concordance in the NIV is better than the concordance is the NASB. The NKJV is the biggest and heaviest of all. Surprisingly, my new Thompson Chain NIV, KJV, and NKJV are printed in the USA. (The NASB Thompsons are printed in South Korea.)The KJV Thompson is the thinnest version available at a mere 1923 pages. It's concordance is the best of the Thompsons. There are no textual notes in this version. In other words, there is nothing to alert you that different manuscripts don't contain the longer ending in Mark, all of 1 John 5:7, or Acts 8:37. The paper in this version appears to be different (not as smooth) than that found in the others.Like I stated earlier, I compared Bibles for 3 days and ended up going back with a Thompson. The only other Bibles in the same league are the old version Scofield (not availible in NASB), and the Open Bible (which I also have). The only things that I would like to see improved are the concordance, and the introduction/background information for each book of the Bible. Don't get me wrong, the concordance is decent, but since everything else about this Bible is excellant it would be nice to have a concordance that is on a par with the rest of this Bible. My guess is that they went light on the concordance to make room for the excellant indexes/helps/archelogical suppplements. Having said that, this is still about as big of a Bible as you would want to carry as it is fairly heavy!While the NASB isn't a large print Bible, it has the largest cleanest type of the Thompsons. Its concordance leaves some things to be desired. If you need an excellant concordance, and the size of the type isn't a huge consideration for you, give the NIV version Thompson Chain a look.If you like the NASB your choices are somewhat limited when looking for a serious study Bible. When shopping for that new study Bible, try out a Thompson. Chances are, in the NASB the Thompson Chain is your best bet."},{"Title":"The Thompson Chain-Reference Study Bible/Kjv/Burgundy Leather","review":"I love the New King James Version, put out by Thomas Nelson, but I loath Thomas Nelson Bibles. This is how I happened upon the Thompson a few years ago as I was relieved to find a NKJV not made by T.N. I first bought an NKJV in bonded leather. After 2 years of very heavy use, I bought an NKJV in genuine leather, and later a handy size KJV in genuine. All three of these Bibles are wonderful in every way.The Thompson Study system is very helpful and they've graciously spared us from a myriad of religious cliche and personal opinion. The page layout is smart. The Bible text actually fills the page and all study helps and references are relegated to the side margins. There are so many ways to use the studies and references, I am unable to number them here. The concordance is as extensive as any I've seen. The 14 maps are colorful and very well done. Simply put, it's a complete, Jesus-exalting study Bible designed with excellence.The construction of these Bibles is equally impressive. The paper is just right--not too thick, not too thin. The print is dark and sharp. Their font is subtil and very appropriate for the Bible, if you ask me. The red words of Jesus are RED. They're not muddy brown; they're bright, deep, beautiful red. They are printed consistantly page to page, not some pages lighter or misprinted, as the Thomas Nelson folks are plagued by.Now that I own three Thompsons, I feel about them the way a good ol' boy down in the South feels about shotguns. &quot;I have more than I need, but not as many as I want!&quot;"},{"Title":"The Thompson Chain-Reference Study Bible/Kjv/Burgundy Leather","review":"I love the New King James Version, put out by Thomas Nelson, but I loath Thomas Nelson Bibles.

I studied the political propaganda in Brazil's Estado Novo, a dictatorship that controlled the country from 1937 to 1945. So this book was an actual breaktrough: for the first time I got a work that explained exactly what I wanted to know. It is, basically, divided in two parts: the first half is dedicated to Chakotin's experiences and theories about Pavlov's conditional reflexes; much of it may not interest historians (I'm one of them) or be considered yesterday's news; although, it's fundamental to understand author's ideas. The second half is devoted to the practical observations of his paradigm, understanding the political phenomenons of the Twentieth Century using the theory he'd explained before. This section dissects efficiently those mechanisms and details that are able to lead a political regime to victory or debacle. A little story to highlight the impact of such ideas: in Brazil his first, and unique, edition was in 1963; a year after a military coup took place, and Chakotin simply disappeard from book shelves and libraries: it was too dangerous for those leaders to keep this great book among the people."},{"Title":"The Preacher and His Preaching (Reprint of the 6th Edition)","review":"book for anyone who preaches the Gospel of Christ and needs anointed pointers on how to divide the word of truth correctly."},{"Title":"The Preacher and His Preaching (Reprint of the 6th Edition)","review":"I believe it was a great book and I will encourcge anyone to buye it."},{"Title":"The Preacher and His Preaching (Reprint of the 6th Edition)","review":"I have found this book to be a valuable source on the subject of preaching.

On the one hand it is an important catalogue and typology of British basket hilts. The book contains hundreds of clear photographs of basket hilts, often from multiple angles. Many of these hilts can't be seen elsewhere. It also classifies the hilts based on a logical typology. This is certainly a book that deserves a place in the libraries of all sword enthusiasts.However, the book also has a somewhat surreal quality in the way it focuses on the hilt to the exclusion of the rest of the sword or indeed the sword as an indivisible whole. It's a bit like reading a book about cars which only talks about their bodies, refusing to even acknowledge that they have engines and wheels. Ignoring the blade of a sword is like ignoring the engine of a car, it misses the whole point of the item. A sword is not an art object, it is a specialised tool that only really comes to life in the hand of a skilled swordsman. I have to wonder whether the author has ever fenced? Reading a book about swords by someone who isn't a swordsman is like reading a book about cars by someone who doesn't drive. I was left wondering how someone could know so much about swords and yet not really understand them at all.So while this book is a very useful tool, it lacks the information necessary to know what (in the absence of being able to personally heft it) the sword was really like, blade length and width, weight, point of balance, centre of percussion etc, all with a picture of the whole sword. As the author of a book on how to fight with the basket hilted sword, I found much of use in this book, but so much more that was missing. One of these days I would like to see a book on swords by someone who doesn't just know a lot about swords as dead objects, but who also understands them as a practical tool.Stephen HandAuthor, English Swordsmanship, Medieval Sword and ShieldEditor, Spada, Spada II"},{"Title":"British Basket-Hilted Swords: A Typology of Basket-Type Sword Hilts","review":"It has amazing pictures. I saw some basket hilt designs I had never seen before.

One with as close up of the basket and one of the whole sword. Perhaps more pictures where the basket hilt is not symmetrical on both sides. They should also give statistics of the weight, length, point of balance, profile and distill taper measures. Modern sword collectors and practitioners are very acutely aware of the meaning of these statistics and what they mean to performance.

The next best was Sir Richard F. Burton's THE CITY OF THE SAINTS, about a journey to see what Mormonism was all about and to meet with Brigham Young.That Horace Greeley's book should be third in this line-up is no disgrace. There is so much self-conscious mythmaking about the Old West that eyewitness accounts of intelligent observers are as rare as hen's teeth. Before the completion of the Trans-Continental Railroad, any journey across the Great Plains was attended by danger, discomfort, and memorable encounters. It is unfortunate that there so so few good accounts.Greeley was first and foremost a newspaper man. He had a sharp eye for what he thought would interest his readers (unlike Twain &amp; Burton who wrote sub specie aeternitatis) and did not disappoint. His descriptions of the Indians, the rigors of the road, and the struggling communities a-borning west of the Platte make for fascinating reading.This is one of those great books to take along on a car journey through the Rockies and Great Plains."},{"Title":"An overland journey from New York to San Francisco in the summer of 1859 (New editions of classic commentaries on America's past)","review":"It was really great, I'm just kidding I haven't even read it yet, but I am going to mainly because I'm related and like to read."},{"Title":"New Photograde: A Photographic Grading Guide for United States Coins","review":"Ever since the invention of the Sheldon Scale in 1949, our hobby's first numerical coin grading system, the complex and confusing art of coin grading started to become more logical and clear. Originally, this grading method was only intended for valuing our country's first cents minted from 1793-1814, but instead was gradually applied to all US coins. Even though popular, and improved into the modern ANA grading system we have today, it isn't flawless. It still can be quite frustrating, no less argumentative at times when we have our own opinion of what each grade should look like. This is where the book, Photograde has been an invaluable help for straightening out this touchy side of the hobby, even before numerical grading was fully used. From the first time I bought this book from Amazon.com, I have regarded it as one of my wisest purchases of numismatic books. Its many black and white photos gives the reader a visual aid for grading a particular US coin along with helpful descriptions. Sadly though, it does not include photos for the uncirculated grades as they are very difficult to photograph accurately. Nevertheless, in addition to grading, it also has many excellent chapters about the minting process, cleaning coins, storage, authenticating, etc. They make for very interesting reading. I get a kick out of how they list several ways of retoning (or recoloring) coins that have desirable surfaces. One way they mention is to fry coins made from nickel in a frying pan mixed with a little cooking grease! Bye George! there is even a little humor stirred in! This is indeed a book that beginners and veteran coin collectors will use till the binding falls apart!"},{"Title":"New Photograde: A Photographic Grading Guide for United States Coins","review":"As the owner of a popular Internet rare coin store, I receive many e-mails requesting information on the current value of gold coins and silver dollars that have been inherited, found in lock boxes, or given as gifts many years ago. Almost all are described as being in &quot;good&quot; or &quot;almost new&quot; condition. The majority of those who seek information know very little about their coin, even what denomination or type of coin they have. Many want to think their coin is new, but the majority of these coins are not. There can be a huge difference in the sales price of a coin based on small differences in condition.&quot;Photograde&quot; is the first reference we provide whenever someone is not sure about what coin they own or what &quot;grade&quot; that coin may be. James F. Ruddy did a magnificent job in carefully assembling black and white photos of all United States minted coins from the late 1700's to the present day. &quot;Photograde&quot; was first published in 1970 and has had several revisions. In 1972, &quot;Photograde&quot; was designated as an official grading guide by the American Numismatic Association. It is a superb reference for new and experienced rare coin collectors alike. These photos are much more than simple reference pictures, however. For each specific coin type, up to seven pictures are used to demonstrate the subtle wear differences between minimally graded coins and those considered &quot;About Uncirculated.&quot; Coins graded About Uncirculated (or better) normally are worth significantly more than lower graded coins. To those who are not familiar with the values of rare coins, using the pictures in this book to &quot;match&quot; the condition of their own coin with the picture goes a long way in solving the question, &quot;is this coin worth as much as I hope it is?&quot;In addition, &quot;Photograde&quot; provides excellent information on the current coin grading &quot;scale,&quot; oversight of commercial coin grading services, and important information to consider when thinking about purchasing rare coins.This is an easily understandable reference which should be alongside every coin collector's work area. It carries my strongest possible recommendation for inclusion in your &quot;Top Three&quot; purchases of books on coins and rare coin collecting. A definite &quot;Five Stars!&quot;"},{"Title":"New Photograde: A Photographic Grading Guide for United States Coins","review":"It is accurate! Yesterday I graded a coin VG 8+ in less then a minute it is easy to use and the descriptions are great. The only thing is it is not in color which makes it harder. All together it is a wonder full book!!!"},{"Title":"New Photograde: A Photographic Grading Guide for United States Coins","review":"This book is exxentially an extended version of the coin conditions/states table that you'll commonly find in coin magazines. This book is much, much more complete and comprehensive as it covers all U.S. coins in circulation (no commemoratives) and has photos and key points of wear for each grade from About Good to About Uncirculated. This edition also has interesting chapters concerning the cleaning of coins and artificial toning. This reference is a great help to inexperienced collectors of USA coins who are building eclectic collections. Don't feel that you need to buy this book new, the grading information is static and, as you will learn much from this book in a short time, it won't be used much thus used copies are likely to be in excellent condition.

The areas to be scrutinized are much broader than the head of the arrow. A better book for the beginner is HOW TO GRADE U.S. COINS by James L.

Although I first read and enjoyed this book in Junior High School, it wasn't until my later service in Cyprus (UNFICYP) and Israel/Syria (UNDOF) that I came to appreciate the similarities between the United Nations and the Corps Diplomatique Terrestrienne. Farcical bureaucracy, inefficiency, a focus on process rather than \\"doing the right thing\\"...it's as if Keith Laumer was around today and viewing the UN's pronouncements on North Korean attacks on the south, their inaction in Syria, and their installation of known despot nations on Human Rights panels!"},{"Title":"Retief of the CDT (Jaime Retief Series #6)","review":"Once again, Jaime Retief delights by deflating the pomposity of our world's pretentious managers, diplomats and politicians in the guise of the Terran Corps Diplomatique in a series of pithy short stories.

I'm still searching for the story about Refief and Mangan on a world beset by volcanic activity (mostly mud volcanoes), with a fragile ecosystem, where the mud rats delicately balance the crab grass, which holds the mud world together.

He was born to a impoverished family in Russia and untimately died on his private island purchased with the millions he made during his dance career--a true-life rags-to-riches story. But it is so much more...What a career Nureyev had! As a child he danced to provide an escape from the poverty of his youth. Almost forcing his way into Russian ballet schools, he astonished even his detractors by his grace and vitality. Solway recreates the scene of his defection from Russia in gripping detail. From that moment on, Russia's loss--which they tried hard to ignore, not even allowing Nureyev to see his mother until she was on her deathbed--became the West's priceless gain.In the West this amazing young man turned into a human dynamo, insisting that contracts be written to allow him to dance every night rather than the customary once or twice a month. Solway follows his transatlantic crossings in dizzying detail as he dances one night in New York, the next night in Paris, and the following night at a festival in mid-Europe. He extended his career far beyond the usual span for a male dancer, eventually forming his own companies so that he could continue to perform. He insisted on learning the stylized awkward steps for modern ballet, and his name filled many houses for benefit performances with modern dance groups. He staged and choreographed many classical ballets, acted in motion pictures, and acted the part of the king in &quot;The King and I&quot; on stage. In his declining years, he learned conducting techinques, and led several European orchestras in concert programs.My son gave me this book for my birthday, and included with it the video &quot;Fonteyn and Nureyev.&quot; What an inspired gift! Words can go only so far in describing dance--even the words of the dance critics whom Solway generously quotes. Nureyev's partnership with Fonteyn is the stuff of legends! This unlikely pair--she supposedly near the end of her careet and he just starting his--packed houses and evoked hour-long curtain calls with their emotion-packed virtuoso performances so clearly evident in the video and convincingly described by Solway.In this day and age we are fascinated by the details of the sex lives of celebrities. Here, too, Solway does not dissappoint, although almost everything she quotes is not from Nureyev's mouth but from companions who may perhaps put their own personal agendas ahead of the literal truth. Nureyev became a icon for the gay community, and some were angry that he did not use his death from AIDS as a beacon for their cause.Whatever his motivation, here is the gripping life story of a man who was driven to accomplish more in his half-century of frenzied life than any of us could possibly imagine. I am immensely grateful for Nureyev's richly creative life and, as well, for Diane Solways carefully detailed account of it."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"With all the good reviews this work is receiving here, I feel that I must point out some of its short-comings. While the information in the book is exhaustive (sometimes to the point of seeming pretentious, as when Solway spends a footnote to provide the married name of an informant after having used her maiden name on the same page--why not just use the established convention of writing first, maiden, and last names?), the obvious research seems often tenuous. Solway's sources are frequently not identified; she writes numerous quotations without noting speakers' or informants' names. Are they Nureyev's words? Did one of his friends or family members say them? Did Solway invent them? How is one to know? How is one to credit the accuracy of a statement at all without the author's establishing of the source's credibility?There is, of course, a great deal of credited information here, probably most that is not related to the dancer's sexual exploits already in print elsewhere. There is much that I did not know about the &quot;hidden years&quot; in Russia and near the end of the dancer's life. If the information is accurate, these bits are a valuable addition to the permanent body of knowledge about Nureyev (the reason for my 3 star rating).However, I found the tone of the book uncomfortable. While it is presented as a serious biography, it seemed more akin to a (very weighty) gossip column to me. One other Amazon reviewer noted the presence of lots of stories about Nureyev's lovers (about 2 1/2 pages of speculation on whether Dame Margot Fonteyn was one of them--no definite conclusion). There are also the requisite _enfant terrible_ stories. But mostly missing are the stories of Nureyev's sweetness and generosity. I remember hearing one of his female colleagues say that, if you wanted him to dance for free at a gala you were planning, &quot;all you have to do is cry a little&quot; and he would do anything you wanted. I remember witnessing his evident devastated humility when he accidentally overbalanced a young Royal Ballet ballerina and nearly dropped her from a &quot;bum lift&quot; in a performance of _Fille mal Gardee_. This man could hardly have been the one described by Solway.Solway does give attention to Nureyev's enormous drive, courage, and indomitability. In that, she is fair to him and to his legend. However, despite the length of the book, there is much missing from it, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"The book gives impression of reading a work of psychologist. From the beginning to the end of the book, Diana could perfectly describe Nureyev's complex personality: disadvantaged childhood in Russia and aspiration for exposing a new world, warm Tatar blood and rudeness, egoism and ambition, brilliant talent and hard work, subtle sensibility and perfectionism, amazing beauty and extreme sexuality, the factors which contributed him becoming a great dancer of the century. Metaphors she used are funny and sharp as well. Finally, book gives very good information about the history of ballet, the culture that formed the background of the ballet etc.Thanks Diane for this great job and thanks for giving a pleasure to the fans of Nureyev."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"Compared to all the previous books about Rudolf Nureyev, Diane Solaway's &quot;Nureyev: His Life&quot; stands out as the most detailed, most researched and most complete account of the ballet dancer's life. Those who are interested in Russian culture, Tatar history, ballet, lives of gay celebrities, lifestyles of the rich and famous, etc. will find this book totally fascinating."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"Although verbose and extremely detailed, still enjoyable and a fast read.

Solway does a wonderful job of engaging the reader from page one onwards."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"Nuryev's was such a fascinating character & led a very interesting life. The author did an excellent job writing his life account. I can hardly put this book down."},{"Title":"Nureyev: His Life","review":"Diane Solway's biography on Nureyev is a tour de force that sets out to accomplish what Virginia Woolf aptly christened to be the hallmark of a good biographer: \\"Almost any biographer, if he respects facts, can give us much more than another fact to add to our collection. He can give us the creative fact; the fertile fact; the fact that suggests and engenders\\".Meticulously researched and righting many misconceptions and misleading reports (including Nureyev's very own autobiography which veered towards convenience with the truth, not unlike the genre of autobiographies), Solway's book avoided the usual pitfalls pervading biographies written on famous but controversial personalities.Solway meritoriously stayed on neutral ground in her account of Nureyev's life and many loves, a far cry from biographers who tackled their favorite subject matters with a tad too much schmaltz and partiality. Solway's biography was devoid of sensationalism, not an easy feat considering Nureyev's history marred by self-interest, debauchery and promiscuity.To Solway's credit, Nureyev's story was a matter-of-fact chronology penned in an appreciably elegant prose. The book chronicled the Russian danseur's story in such a way that allows readers to luxuriate in the intricate plots and subplots of Nureyev's affairs, rendering us the voyeuristic satisfaction of living life vicariously through one of the most influential dance performers of our times. The gastronomy of supplemental knowledge presenting ballet as an art form and entertainment; summaries of visionary dance choreographers that made and continue to make classical ballet/modern dance tick; exposure of the who's who in the dance world plus the plethora of scores that brought ballet performances to life. Supporting the assemblage of all that was written were diligently selected photographs culminating in a pheonomenal biography on Nureyev. In summary, Nureyev: His Life's is an evenhanded biography on the golden boy who took the world by storm for over two decades and a faithful narrative of the flawed private being underneath the veil of success and glamour.A must-read for anyone in search of an unbiased chronicle to Nureyev's life story and his contributions. 5 stars."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"this GN was well reviewed. I bought it, and found it ordinary. Nothing a few dozen twilight zone episodes have not covered."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"This brief graphic novel is Alan Moore's attempt at doing a Cthulhu mythos type story and Moore falls a bit short. The basic (very basic) plot tells of an undercover FBI agent who is trying to solve a series of gruesome murders that are similar, but have been committed by several different people in different locales. This agent specializes in being able to find connections where others can't, although if the average reader can't see these connections you'd have to be brain dead. Moore tosses in a lot of Lovecraftian references such as Clark Ashton Smith' Zothique and Robert W. Chamer's \\"The yellow Sign\\" as well as nods to Arthur Machen as well. Those who are familiar with Lovecraft and those who influence him will roll their eyes at \\"club Zothique\\" and those not familiar won't know what in the hell that Moore is talking about anyway. It's all a little much. This is definitely a book for adults with the violence, language and racial slurs made by the FBI agent about blacks. One wonders where Moore was going with this angle. It had no bearing on the story at all. The art by Jacen Burrows was decent but not enough to make me recommend this one."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"Well, I've read some other Alan Moore's graphic novels, such as V, Watchmen and The killing joke. I thought those were fantastic, very creative pieces of art.Then I read that the Courtyard will be finally available and that it's probably the best he has done, very intricate plot, blablablah and what do you know? my hopes went sky high.What I got was a short story, macabre, dense, nicely delivered, but that was pretty much it. The plot is very straight forward, it didn't impact me as much as I thought.Maybe I didn't get it, maybe I'm still expecting this to be a serie, with subsequent installments, maybe I need to be more Moore to understand the deepness.Right now I think it was a very expensive item for what I got."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"I am a big fan of H.P. Lovecraft and the Cthulhu Mythos. Many authors have done a wonderful job adding to this mythos. This story is not one of them. In fact, the most entertaining thing about the book was the introduction.Alan Moore does a fine job showing us that he is familiar with many details of the Mythos. He does this the same way he showed his familiarity with Victorian literature in The League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen.But unlike in League we do not have a story to hang the references on. We are introduced to an investigator who specializes in seeing the patterns in chaos. He is very good at his job. He is currently undercover looking into a series of unconnected murders.My real problem is that the story has only one character. He starts off as a genius seeing connections no one else can. But then, when the obvious is in front of him, he sees no onnections whatsoever.The story is very nicely illustrated in a clean black and whit by Jacen Burrows but clean art cannot save a story that is not there. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"This is the most poorly executed HPL homage I have ever had the sad duty to own."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"This is something you cannot do. The Cthulhu mythos begins and ends with Lovecraft as far as I'm concerned. It's just not scary when anyone else tries it. Don't get me wrong I love Moore's earlier work. From Hell is the last thing he did worth buying and it could've benefited from major editing. If you're interested in Alan Moore check out Watchmen, V for Vendetta, or The Complete DR and Quinch. If you're interested in the Cthulhu mythos go for Lovecraft."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"This book blew my mind! Unlike most people who probably read it, I had no idea it was a Lovecraftian piece, just that it was Alan Moore's first horror comic in something like a decade. So as I read it I was confronted with a vaguely unsettling sense of familiarity, until I realized at the end exactly what this monstrosity was and started over from the beginning! Notes in Yuggoth Cultures #3 (another Lovecraftian collection by Moore) reveal that The Courtyard was originally intended as part of a novel (Yuggoth Cultures) wherein he treated Lovecraft's 36 sonnet &quot;Fungi From Yuggoth&quot; cycle as &quot;literary fungi&quot; (basically taking each sonnet and writing a story based on or inspired by it) So this is NOT like the many lovecraft pastiches out there which just invent more extraterrestrial deities, it's Alan Moore's warped take on Lovecraft's universe. There's even some mystical concepts worked into the tapestry, the like of which might be somewhat familiar to Promethea readers, except they're twisted to fit a very Lovecraftian end...I must have read this thing four or five times by now, and each time I read it I pick up on things I didn't notice or didn't understand before. I don't have the companion (yet!) but I'm sure it enhances the reading immensely..."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"I picked this up at my school's library(along with 100 Bullets, go figure) and read through in about 20 minutes. Well, gee, that was short. Very Lovecraftian ending, which still intrigues me, and some nice hallucenogenic visuals...but what happened? It was like a short story that didn't feel the need to elaborate on its characters at all, therefore, I don't sympathize with any of them. So yeah, if you want the actual experience of this piece, just forego this 20-minute noir fix and pick up the Companion--which makes little sense to me that it needs a companion when it's but one issue that anyone can manage by themselves.The companion is just under the price of the hardback copy and has not only the script(like I said, why buy the comic?) but more original art, essays, and the references that are practically required for the HPL uninitiated. Interesting little read. I think I just spent half the time reviewing the book that I spent reading it."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"I first read Moore's short story The Courtyard in Starry Wisdom back in 1994. I did not have a favorable impression but after all these years I guess it was because the whole book put me off (still does; haven't yet read the sequel). I only recently found out he made it into a comic. Avatar has just issued a full color edition, which is how I encountered it. Jacen Burrows provides the art and Juanmar the interior colors.The story takes place in Red Hook and it owes a good deal to HPL's story The Horror at Red Hook. Again strange horrific crimes are taking place and a federal agent is sent to investigate under deep cover. Like HPL's Malone, Agent Sax is world weary and deeply prejudiced. Moore does not shy away from the racism that suffused the original story; in fact it makes this comic that much more gritty and realistic. To solve the crimes he traces everything back perhaps to a drug being sold in a club in Red Hook. Under deep cover he attempts to get a sample so he can nail the dealer. He succeeds after a fashion.The story is taut and intense, very compelling. Language and imagery are graphic, but I did not think gratuitously so. It all fit so well with the mood being created. The artwork and colors are superb. For Lovecraftians, there are quite a few HPL place and character names that pop up in the narrative. It is a nice diversion to place them all; any assiduous fan should be able to do it. But better still, the story's horrors that slowly reveal themselves are quite Lovecraftian in their sensibility.Previously I thought Fall of Cthulhu was the finest Lovecraftian comic book, and it was great although I was let down by the way the series wound down. Now I think this title by Moore takes the crown. Anyone who likes mythos comics should read this book."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"Very good story but first let me clear some things up. The book is not double long like it appears in the picture above, that is actually the front cover on the right and back cover on the left, but the size is about the same as a comic. Second it is in black and white, which is alright but unfortunate because of how beautiful color makes the covers look.Obviously this story doesn't seem to appeal to everyone. I haven't read lovecraft so maybe in comparison it sucks, I am however actively interested in the occult studies, and I'm going to go out on a limb here and say if you're neither interested in the occult or lovecraft you're probably going to find this very unenjoyable, that is to say it's definitely geared towards those audiences.If you like horror it's my understanding that you should run, not walk, and get yourself some H.P. Lovecraft to read immediately. I'd also like to recommend to anybody who wants to know more about this occult stuff that Alan Moore himself is so enamored with to check out Robert Anton Wilson as soon as humanly possible.I liked this book, it spooked me, or was that me just working myself up? At any rate it was a cool fun twisted good time on the edges of sanity with an FBI Agent, Presidential cover-up Evil Rock bands, drugs, flaming weirdoes, and the elder gods. Not to be missed by those especially attuned to receive this transmission."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"Wow, that was creepy. Good fit with the disturbing Lovecraftian sensibility, and I liked all the literary asides.

Not for small children, unless you are raising sociopaths."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"An undercover federal agent is on the lookout for a peculiar drug that's sweeping the underground music scene. The agent, Aldo Sax, traces it to a rock concert where he's directed to a mysterious fellow with a veil over his mouth who speaks with a lisp. But what's that strange language he speaks? And will Aldo make it back to reality once he's tried this drug?This odd short comic book has undertones of HP Lovecraft as the weird language the dealer and the rock group speak sounds a lot like the kind of stuff Cthulu and shoggoths would say. Then there are the hallucinations once Aldo takes the drug, the depictions of which look pretty damn frightening yet reminiscent of what most people would think of as the kind of stuff Lovecraft wrote about.Jacen Burrows' artwork really makes this book stand out. His artwork is always top notch but his work on the hallucinations really put this into some of his best efforts. Also it's worth noting that while Alan Moore is credited here, his input was the idea of the story - Antony Johnston wrote the script.A pretty decent, bizarre comic book to read, it's worth picking up \\"Neonomicon\\" by Alan Moore as that is the sequel to \\"The Courtyard\\" and includes it as a prologue to the book as well. I think Lovecraft would have approved of this nasty little nightmare of a book."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"All the low ratings for this book are by fanboys of the \\"Cthulhu Mythos\\". This Graphic Novel is much BETTER than the stories by Lovecraft in my opinion. I wonder how many of these fanboys can PRONOUNCE \\"Cthulhu\\" (the pronunciation is given in a history of Lovecraft, and nobody would guess it). Come on fellow Courtyard Lovers -- make your ratings known! It's so depressing to see such a great graphic novel (followed by the great series \\"Neonomicon 1 through 4\\") being downgraded by these deadheads!"},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"When this first came out, it was like a little light shining through the casmos. Alan's here, and he had work to do. I always like looking at Moore's work, and I always like it when more picks up something tasty and makes it better - in a way it isn't really supposed to be done anyhow.When approaching Lovecraftian stories, I have seen a lot of things happen in a story and I have dealt with some nasty people. A lot of the Gods are nasty as well, and that makes you think of followers sometimes and Gods sometimes but you forget the whole thing is cemented by people. That is why I really like this guy. He is a person and not just a doodle.One thing I like about him is he is flawed. He is even a racist, classist, and one of those rare birds that believes they belong on top of the roost. Still, the Badge seems to help him with his tteth and his other elation has him going as well. The one thing I have to say about this is that it is not kid-oriented, should not be considered that way, and should be seen as one of the first real horror comics. Not only do you have the tools, but the dream.The dream.I love this book and the color brings more out. It is like s 5/5 with more. Great and then some."},{"Title":"Alan Moore's The Courtyard Deluxe Hardcover Set","review":"This is an Alan Moore Chtuhlu myths short story, beautifully adapted for comics by writer Anthony Johnston and artist Jacen Burrows.FBI agent Aldo Sax is investigating a number of unconnnected but identical murders committed by the most unlikely of suspects. All of them candidly confessed to the murders they committed, but no more. All of them were spotted speaking similar gibberish and were probably buying and using drug from the same Courtyard...Follow agent Sax as he uncovers what is behind the murders and stumbles upon much, much more than he expected.This book is downright scary and, in typical Alan Moore fashion, touches upon many hemes at once, adapting them to his sensibilities and making them relevant and poignant.At some level, this is a story of urban decay and hash social commentary. The neighbourhood Sax is conducting his investigation in is squallid and drugs seem the only real escape from its murdering depression. On some other level, this is a Lovecraftian horror tale, but it is brilliantly executed and would make Lovecraft proud: The Boston writer and his literary peers often visited each others fantastic worlds, and Moore does nothing less here, paying homage and at the same time bringing his ample palette to the picture.Lastly, this is typical Moore because it is another hymn to the power of language, another look into its many facets and recesses, this time boldly going into almost non-human territory (again, Swamp Thing readers would say :-).A lot of merit also goes to ANthony Johnston for choosing this stunning format based on a grid of two vertical panels per page, which really gives Jacen Burrows' artwork the deserved room to breathe, while avoiding to turn this into a spalsh page slugfest or a simple illustrated prose story. So Burrows' considerable illustration talents are once again out to great use and turned into storytelling brilliance. My favourite pages are the last ones, as Sax receives three hits of the mysterious aklo drug and the artwork becomes incision-like (when he takes the drug) and the art breaks the basic panels pattern to delve into two 3-panels double page spreads and a full 2-page spread for the drug induced vision, before going full circle and showing the first panels of the story again, but with a decisive, perverse twist.This book come with my highest recommendation to all fans of the crime and horror genres this book mainly belongs to, to all fans off poignant social commentary, and to all fans of the authors."},{"Title":"Jerusalem: An Anthology of Canadian Jewish Poetry","review":"This book is a beautifully packaged collection of poetry on Jerusalem written by many of Canada's greatest poets including A.M.

It is a welcome first look at this great saint and also it gives detailed information on Naqshbandi Sufi practices and beliefs. It should appeal to all those interested in tassawuf and also of religion in the Subcontinent as well as to the millions of admirers and disciples of Grandshaykh, Hazrat Amir al Millat who was the Ghawth [spiritual helper] of his age.

In this respect, Albright and Mann have done their job well. In other areas, however, I have mixed feelings on their work on the gospel of Matthew. This review will concentrate mainly on the introductory material, since like all commentaries, this is where the authors establish the basis from which the commentary proper flows.Albright and Mann immediately get off on the wrong foot. In their discussion on the canonicity of our four gospels, they apparently try to establish the superiority of the four gospels to justify their inclusion in the New Testament. This leads to a discussion about why noncanonical gospels are not really gospels. They conclude other apocryphal writings &#65533;were slanted to a form of belief about the person and work of Jesus which finds no expression in the pages of the New Testament&#65533; (xix).This approach is very problematic. It puts the cart before the horse by making the canonical works an arbitrary standard to judge other claimants retroactively. It assumes a uniformity of belief of the New Testament authors that does not exist. Finally, the New Testament authors were hardly objective themselves; their portrayal of Jesus is just as slanted as any of the other gospels. As Albright and Mann point out, orthodoxy was not something that jumped up from nowhere. What we now call Christianity today was more akin to a cauldron of various Jesus movements often competing with each other. Most of these groups wrote about their ideas about Jesus. These writings influenced each other. It is from this cauldron &#65533;orthodoxy&#65533; emerged. Our four gospels were among the earliest. This means they had more time to spread and become popular. Attaching names of apostles or their immediate disciples added to their popularity. As their popularity increased, early Christians regarded them as supporting the orthodox position. Church councils ratified their popularity and strengthened the gospels&#65533; orthodoxy by making them the standard for Christianity. In today&#65533;s parlance, we might say Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John became canonical because of better marketing, not necessarily because they were superior to other written gospels. This renders the authors&#65533; discussion of what is and is not truly a gospel to irrelevancy. Things could have gone another way, and if it had, the situation would be reversed.Any discussion on the authorship and sources of Matthew always confronts us with the so-called synoptic problem. How is it Matthew and Luke appear so much like Mark that the latter has only about fifty verses unique to his gospel? Further, how is it that Matthew and Luke have so much material in common not found in Mark, although one likely did not have the other available? The dominant answer for years has been the two-source theory. Both Matthew and Luke had Mark available to them, which they used to establish the narrative framework of their own gospel. They also both used another document, called Q, which explains the other material they have in common. Material unique to Matthew came from other sources, written or oral, that was not either available or used by Luke. Matthew was not simply a cut and paste job; the author, who probably was not the apostle, shaped and structured the material to reflect his own theological views and the needs of his community.Albright and Mann reject this hypothesis. They argue the gospel authors wrote the synoptic gospels essentially independently based on oral tradition. They depended on each other rarely, if at all. Matthew was the author of an Aramaic document from which the Greek gospel was based, if not our gospel itself. Albright and Mann argue so often against the two-source theory that this work is more of an apologetic against it, rather than an exposition of their own view. They caricature the theory and continually raise &#65533;problems&#65533; against it. However, they have not given us a unified and coherent theory to replace it, and what they do give raises more questions than it answers. Further, unencumbered by their caricature, the two-source theory can readily handle most of the &#65533;problems&#65533; raised against it. It therefore remains the dominant theory on the origin of the synoptics thirty years after the publication of this commentary.Their discussion on Matthew&#65533;s use of the Old Testament is more promising. According to Albright and Mann, the quotations are not simply proof texts pulled randomly to bolster the author&#65533;s case. They are midrashic commentaries similar to ones found in the Dead Sea Scrolls and elsewhere. Moreover, they form an important part of the gospel&#65533;s structure. The rest of the introductory material covers the way Matthew handled various topics. These discussions are handled better than the discussion on authorship. I found their argument that the Kingdom of God and the Kingdom of Heaven are separate realms weak. However, their discussion on the word &#65533;hypocrite&#65533; is especially illuminating. Albright and Mann have divided the commentary itself into translation, notes, and comments. The comments are usually short. They have already covered much of the material in the introduction, so the reader rarely misses anything important to the discussion. In other cases, particularly regarding the historicity of a pericope, a better discussion of the issues involved would have been helpful.My final judgment on this installment of The Anchor Bible is mixed. I can still commend it to the general reader, since the writers mostly did a wonderful job in making their positions understood. The commentary also has some bright points worth considering. However, it reads too much like an apologetic for me to commend it on scholarly grounds."},{"Title":"West Federal Taxation 2002: An Introduction to Business Entities (West's Federal Taxation: An Introduction to Business Entities) (v. 4)","review":"this book should has a CD, I will buy this book if it includes CD"},{"Title":"Murder of Justice: New Jersey's Greatest Shame","review":"Jones documents more information in his book than any other thus far. While he presents his conclusions about who was responsible for the kidnapping, he leaves many avenues for other verdicts that may eventually come along. While the book is difficult to put down, there are times when the author presents needless details. On several occasions, he leads us through several pages that eventually go nowhere when a brief paragraph would have been sufficient. I have read dozens of books on the Lindbergh kidnapping case but this is the most complete so far. The book will make the reader very cautious concerning police and prosecuting practices in capital cases."},{"Title":"Murder of Justice: New Jersey's Greatest Shame","review":"When I first met Wayne Jones, I had no opinion as to Hauptmann's innocence of guilt. Mr. Jones informed me that when I finished his book, I would be convinced of Hauptmann's innocence. He was right! This book is packed with inconsistencies and lies told by the state of New Jersey in their effort to end the embarrassment caused by the handling of the Lindbergh kidnapping investigation headed by H.

He was a convinced believer in Hauptmann's innocence.However, there are three substantial problems with this book. First, it is a tedious read at best. The writer rambles incessantly and one cannot read this book for more than fifteen to twenty minutes at a time without taking a break or screaming. The book is about 150 pages too long.Second, there are enormous factual errors and inaccuracies throughout the book. Mr. Jones was clearly researching and writing with the express goal of finding Hauptmann innocent. Consequently, there is no objectivity.Finally, Mr. Jones has printed numerous rumors and tabloid tales from the 1930's and cited them as fact. The equivolent would be for a writer seventy years from now to claim that aliens visited the Earth during the 1990's based upon citations to the World Weekly News and other supermarket tabloids."},{"Title":"Murder of Justice: New Jersey's Greatest Shame","review":"Thanks to Wayne, my grandfather's story can be read by people who will finally believe what he believed to be the truth about the kidnapping of the Lindberg baby.

We are brought up to beleive these things about women which are simply not true! If we take the time out to understand women and look at them from a scientific realistic perspective which is not through society or religion, then we see the truth about women. Once we understand women and our role, we understand God. The truth about women in today's religous eyes is looked at as terrible, but the truth is the truth, if we dont understand women then how can we understand God, A man that calls this science foolish and devilish is a liveing breathing walking devil.

It's the real deal."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The great thing about this book is that it explains and lists many of the clues/body language that women tend to give off, which you can use to figure out how to engage them. Some of these clues are obvious and some of them you've never thought of. But, knowing and understanding the female body language, will at least give you the confidence to approach and give it a shot with a girl. I think the hardest part of trying to pick up a girl is that a lot of the information out there is wrong, or it's piecemeal, and it contradicts itself. It's not like your dad show's you how when you're a kid, if he even know how. The System gives you a step by step, organized way to approach and seduce a girl. Face it guys, you've probably never really put a lot of effort into learning, improving, testing, and executing the technique of seduction. Well, in this case, someone has and I've found that it saved me a lot of time and I guess, rejection, going out armed with the info in this book. I mean, what I really needed was a step by step guide that I could follow and not have to figure what to do next when I'm out there. That and the knowledge to understand many of the reactions and signals that girls can give off really boosted my confidence and ego, and chicks can sense it. While nothing is ever definite, I can say I've had very good results. Maybe it's the confidence I have going out there with a plan that has really helped, as opposed to the walking around with the uncertainty and fear of having to come up with some luck, some wit(humor for you meatheads), some dollars/drinks just to land a girl or even just a number. It's up to you, this book is a good read and sure beats listening to your idiot friends tell you how pick chicks."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I know these are discussion forums but I fell compelled to comment on some of the other reviews I've read here:1) YES the essence of the system is based on that initial eye contact... so what? Does that make it bogus? Of course not -- if you think you can be butt ugly & dress like a slob and get laid and this book will tell you how to do it you will most certainly be in for a disappointment. What this book does tell you is that there are 1% of women out there in your environment that WILL have sex with you very soon IF you play your cards right... that is what the book shows you -- how to play your cards perfectly to have sex with all of those women.2) I don't think anyone should pay credence to the women's reveiws on this book -- of course they wouldn't think highly of the book b/c it digs too deep into their psyches... and they don't want to (or can't) admit that what the author says about how women think/act is indeed TRUE.I found the book very hard to put down... it is an easy read that can be finished in a couple of hours -- but I think it is chalk-full of valuble information. On top everything I found it highly entertaining to read and often found myself laughing out loud!I haven't yet gotten laid using the techniques outlined in the book but I think that is due mostly to my lack of time these days than anything else. I am however implementing the techniques at my place of work (a large medical center) and am confident that I will copulate with a fine young damsel in the very near future -- and this will in large part be due to this book.A big THANK YOU from me to the author on a job very well done!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

So I'm no longer a newbie at this. I actually bought this book a few years ago and read it for the second time last week.I remember being quite impressed by this book the first time I read it but now I feel it's been left in the dust of the newer books out there. The System comprises pretty much of the authors system, his method for picking up women and you are taught what this is. It's very basic and the author even admits that it will work only on 1% of women, which he calls the \\"1% rule!\\" This ratio is disappointingly low and will involve having to try and make \\"eye contact\\" with 100 girls a day to get one to talk to you!By reading anything by Richard La Ruina you can increase this percentage considerably. But before that you should readDestroy Approach Anxiety - Effortlessly Approach Women Without Fearwhich actually teaches you how to walk up to any girl without fear and start a conversation! I've found that to be the most helpful book on actually approaching a girl and get talking to her. Making the approach should be the first step you make and then you should read into the more advanced tactics to really help you out.

The System","review":"For those of you who claim this does not work, I can only say that you do not understand women and may the Gods have mercy on you.This book is a great summary but not a step by step how-to manual. You need to GRASP ITS SPIRIT. A big drawback on this book is that it did not put enough weight on \\"confidence,\\" which is the No. 1 reason why women are drawn to men. Confidence is not about you raising your chin etc. but about how you feel about YOURSELF. From inside and out, you must be completely confident about who you are and the way you are! If you cannot master this, at least learn how to pretend to be or act to be. Think the greatest lover of all time, Casanova, what would he do? One time, he was caught red-handed by his lover when cheating with another girl. He had the confidence, nerve and skill to manage a menage a trois out of the two girls!!! Act as him!!! Yes, it's a skill anybody can learn. It just takes some practice. The rest of the stuff, having money, being handsome and having 6-packs, just icing on the cake. If you still think those are important, you are just flatly wrong!1. Women don't love how when men cook for them?Here's how a female friend of mine described the first time with her ex:\\"He made me a 4 course dinner, I am sorry, 5 course dinner. The last course, we ate in bed. It was DELICIOUS!\\"There's no better \\"trick\\" then asking a woman to come for dinner at your place! If you don't get this, I must say that you are hopeless.2. It tells you ONLY to approach women who are staring at youMaybe you don't know how to read, it actually says approach women who take an interest in you, not staring!3. The system doesn't workThis book is obviously a beginner's book. You cannot buy this book and think that you now have it all but you can surely start practicing and working on your skills. If you start hitting on women, you are doing it wrong. You cannot and must not make your women feel like that you are hitting on them because their defense shield would come up lightning fast. The system does work! You are just not skilled enough yet. So keep practicing.What if it doesn't work? What if the women tell me that I am !#$@# and should leave them alone? Blah blah blah! Let's say it really doesn't work after you tried all of them. What did you really lose? A few minutes of your life talking to the girl that you like is not a loss on my book. Here's the real trick that got me into all this. The bottom line is that you lose absolutely nothing! This is like gambling but you lose nothing and you stand a whole lot better chance to score gold!!!So keep it up and do not give up! For those of you who really want to advance your skills, get The Art of Seduction, for which I also wrote a review."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The proof that this book is necessary can be found in some of the pinheaded thoughts written in reviews here. The hypocrisy and mind set of some women never ceases to amaze me. None seemed to have an issue with the feminized work \\"The Rules\\"... the definitive guide on how to catch (ie: trap) Mr. Right a few years ago. Yet when a man writes a book about (gasp) getting laid, we have to read childish thoughts here about how us \\"poor slobs\\" need proper hygiene and \\"will sleep with anything\\".Men have been searching for the instruction manual on women (without any success) forever. Any guide that can help men overcome the age old imposed ideology that the mutually pleasuring act of sex is somehow a gesture of giving (\\"what's in it for her\\") for a woman, and yet taking for a man should not be viewed as a threat, but as enlightenment that is long overdue here in the 21st Century.Perhaps some women like Erotica Reader who wrote the \\"Nice Try\\" review should give that some serious thought (between rejecting Mr. Wrong's, of course). Maybe you might even get to the point of actually understanding that sex is SEX, and is NOT necessarily love, a chance to barter goods for services rendered, a guilt ridden act of indentured servitude, a means to quantify your self worth, or a prelude to lifelong pair-bonding commitment. I know, that's asking a lot, but maybe one day your type will evolve."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is a DEFINITE BUY.

It shows you how to get them in bed the same day you meet them.Frankly I like the book because I recently got single again and wanted to do it right this time. I stumbled around the last time I was single until I got a girlfriend. This time I think I want to have some more fun before getting committed again. I think this book is giving me a pretty good start."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This is a great book, if you are desperate for sex and just want to have sex with any female that's WILLING regardless of what she looks like. I can paraphrase the entire book:Go out to bars and make eye-contact with every girl you see. If no one makes eye contact with you, go to a different bar. When a girl makes a lot of eye contact with you, go talk to her, talk, talk, talk, then try to bring her home.There are SOME good points in the book, like why stay in a crappy bar all night with no women, drinking yourself silly when you could go to another bar that does have women. And keep your head up and make eye-contact. I did notice after reading this book that I normally look down or at the floor instead of looking up at oncoming girls. So that's definitely valuable. I keep my head up now and look for eyes.But all this book does is help you find the girls \\"that are looking\\". It doesn't help with girls that aren't looking. And what really hot girl is going to be looking?? It says NOTHING about what they look like. Per this book, going into a bar and making eyecontact with a 200 pound woman who is a 5 on the 1-10 scale and taking her home would be a succcess. I don't need sex that badly. I'm not interested in taking home \\"anything\\". I'm interested in meeting very attractive women. This book does not help with that at all. It takes the \\"Take what you can get\\" approach. No thanks. I think that's bad for your self esteem. I've read other pick-up books and I'd recommend \\"The Game\\" or anything by Mystery or David D'Angelo before you waste money on this book. And if I can soapbox for a second - Don't feel bad about reading Pick-up books. Pick up is a SKILL, just like anything else. There's no need to feel shame for learning a new skill. It's all just social-skills. A skill frankly that most cute girls have us beat at because they are hit-on ALL the time. I for one want to level that playing field."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

The System","review":"This book gives a person scant sound advice on how exactly to approach women (even the so-called \\"1%\\"-ers) that make eye contact with you and are (purportedly) interested in sex with you that day (beyond what's simple common knowledge). And even if you do get a desirable woman out in public to make eye contact with you (which often only happens in a setting conducive to it - e.g., like a bar, a classroom, a ballgame, or the beach, whereby people spend more than a few passing moments in the same general space), you'll still need a large dose of confidence to pull it all off. Her eye contact only indicates her initial interest in you; and you'll most likely still need to open your mouth and talk and build attraction (aka \\"escalate\\") at some point to cross the goal line. (And if you have that sort of confidence and ability you really wouldn't need this book in the first place, because there's not enough quality info in here to improve your game.) Maybe I missed something? Though, I'd say if you have absolutely no experience with women, then there's some minor tidbits in here that will help. (Such as the signals a woman will send when she's interested, or the little bit on flirting.) But these same topics have been covered at such great length and depth (and much better) by so many authors that I wonder why anyone would think (unless they haven't read anything else similar) why this book is superior (in any way) to those others... There's simply not a lot of substance here in the supposed 208 pages; of which a lot is semi-pornographic sketches and large-type print in a paperback book. All told, you're getting a quantity of text equivalent to about 1/4 of a normal-sized book; so don't expect an \\"Art of Seduction\\"-type treatise with this one. I'd be very skeptical of anyone that gives this book more than 2 stars. Or maybe they've just never read another book of this type. The fact is that if you're a little experienced you'll already know what's in this book; and if you're not, this book is only a smattering of what you'll need to know to be truly successful with women. The author may be a bona fide pickup artist, but (in my opinion) he's left out too many of the critical details for this to be worth your hard-earned money."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I'm a ball player so I've really never had much trouble getting girls. I got this book because all my buddies kept talking about it and kept asking my opinion. I never felt any guy should need a book to get girls but after reading this book I had to give some credit to the author. In essence, the title tells the entire story. Also, the stated goal of the book according to the author is \\"to be able to meet a girl, seduce her, take her home, and have sex with her within minutes of meeting her\\".Of course that caught my attention and as I read the book I found the author to be very focused on explaining how this can be done. I've never had a system but I had to admit that a lot of what was explained in the book is what I've always done with my buddies to get girls.I belive this book will work for guys that need a little help with getting girls. I think the book is right about a lot of the things it says about why guys aren't able to \\"close\\". I think the 5-step process will be good for guys because it's like a cheat sheet of what to do.Other things I liked about the book: stories of his success and failures; identifying the right women; cooking for women on dates; understanding how women think and what their needs are; understanding your own limiting thoughts. I think these are all key things that every guy should understand.My buddy got the illustrated version with the sexy pics. I got the unillustrated version which catches a bit less attention."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I only gave this book 2 stars because it felt like a disspointment. Purchasing this book over the internet without looking through the book first at a local bookstore was a mistake. The System had a few good points, but on the whole it basically restates common facts like making eye contact, playing hard to get, and some basic psychology of women. When I first got the book I was surprised that it was so small; easily readable the first time through. Mispellings and typos also caught me offguard for a published book with such a distinguished ranking on Amazon. I wish there were more precise intructions/outlines for do's rather than dont's(ie. miroring a woman's bodylanguge). My advice to you is to skim through the book before you purchase it to see if its of value to you. I am considering purchasing The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene as a necessary follow-up."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"If you dated in high school or if you've ever had sex, this book will teach you nothing. It's like reading a gunnery manual written by pacifists. The \\"System\\" is boring, trite and useless."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I just read a review from someone who did NOT read the book. I thought her assumptions were interesting though incorrect. Since I did read the book here is my review of it.This System tackles an interesting challenge. How can you pick up a girl, have sex with her, yet do it in a respectful way. I like this book because it's the only pick up book that I've read that actually shows you both sides of the coin. Women are not featured as targets or victims. They are featured as powerful and intellectual individuals who are capable of making decisions about their own sexuality.At some points of the book I was surprised at Valentine's candid approach. It's the only pick up book that I've read where the author said\\"I never lie to women! There's never a reason to. When you lie, you have put the burden of the relationship and her feelings and her life on your back. Don't lie, tell her the truth.\\"In many ways, this book goes way beyond pick up techniques and teaches the psychology of interpersonal relationship between men and women. Men are advised and taught how to understand \\"the mental game\\" before even trying to approach a woman.I also found the body language approach to be compelling. We all know that 80% to 90% of all human communication happens non-verbally (body language). From the initial eye contact to sleeping with a woman to follow up (believe it or not Valentine discourages one-night-stands), the author shows how to read every move a woman makes so you are always at least one step ahead of her. He expresses that the ability to read women body language gives you the power to determine if and when you would like to take her home.The book also discourages \\"pick up lines\\". It actually teaches us how seduce women by establishing a connection with them verbally. It teaches you how to have conversations with women that will make you more interesting to her. Any communication or psychology professional will recognize the theory of 100% communication in this book. Non-verbal + verbal = 100% communication. The book teaches how to achieve this level of connection and how to use it to have sexual relationships with women.The book is only 208 pages and at the end you have a feeling of wanting more. After reading it (less than 2 hrs) I felt like I had just crammed a human relationship class, a sex 101 class, a sociology class, a psychology class, a male and female sexuality class, and a communications class. I felt like I understood how all these schools of knowledge interact together (I was a good student but I think I missed the link between all these things while in college).I recommend this book highly to both men and women. I think it has essential information for single men trying to meet someone. I think it's also critical for women who would like a better understanding of themselves in a social environment and in relationships."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

Within a very short time (minutes) of making the online purchase, there was an identity hack against my credit card. Coincidence?I'm reconsidering making future purchases through Amazon."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I purchased this book because I enjoyed reading Doc Love's articles on Askmen.com, however this is NOT his book. This book is more comical than of any practical use. To be honest, I would not try any of these techniques on women unless you are already very good with women."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I just graduated from college, and I must say that this was one of my most useful text books. I've gotten more attention from women,I feel more confident, and I know their secrets. Knowledge is power, and this book gives you everything you need to know. thanks"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"A male friend of mine had a copy of this laying around his apartment, so I borrowed it.Unbelievable. While some of the advice is useful (for more than just nerds--some guys really just can't get in touch with how a woman thinks), most of it is sexist trash. Not only does it tell a guy what kind of girl he should date (she must meet specific personality and looks criteria), it tells a guy that he should drop a woman at any time who isn't giving to him and sucking up to his standards.A note: I'm known as the female misogynist of my friends. I'm old fashioned and anti-feminism. But this book insulted me. The way it describes women reminds me of how pure-bred dog enthusiasts talk about their dogs. If it doesn't have the proper pedigree it belongs on the streets. If it's not the perfect color or the perfect temperament, it is crazy and you should get rid of it.Further more, the criteria a woman has to meet does not actually match up with any women I've ever met. Even the most self-empowered, confident, fun women get insecure sometimes. That doesn't mean they're a crazy narcissist (like this book insinuates). It means they're a WOMAN with HORMONES and bad days.This book teaches men how to be the same jerks who I always avoid. It teaches men how to treat dating like buying a dog. \\"If the bitch doesn't meet your standards, put her in the pound.\\" That's the vibe I get from this book. Women and men may not be created entirely equal, but women are NOT show dogs.Don't buy this book. It might get you laid, but it will never teach you how to have a good relationship."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book opened up a new world for me. I've not been the luckiest guy in the world with getting girls. It's not for lack of trying and I'm not shy I simply don't get luck very often. I just assumed that that was the way it was and that I could do nothing about it, until I read this book.What's funny about this is that I'm pretty proficient with all kinds of technology because I read a lot. I never imagined that I could actually read a book and become proficient with getting girls. I was actually surprised (well shocked really) when I tried some the things mentioned in the book. I was so surprised that I went and read the book a second time, this time with a highlighter and note pad. It works! I had sex with two different girls in the last 3 weeks. That's more than I did last year.It's a new world for me. I don't see myself as every being a player or pick up artist but this year is starting out pretty good. I certainly recommend this book for any guy wanting to meet and take home girls. This is not a book about relationships it's like a tech \\"process\\" manual that walks you through everything you need to do from the point of seeing a girl to actually having sex with her (all in the same day). I never even knew this was possible."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Straight up, the reason why this book is da bomb is that Valentine doesn't sugar-coat the facts about getting laid. I'm not looking for a wife, I'm looking for some booty. This book is about how to get the booty the same day you meet a girl. It's a straightforward, simple, honest and to the point book. But at the end, what I learned changed the way I think about women and the dating game.I always thought I was a player but the girls I rack up now are beyond anything I could have imagined even a year ago - and I've only had the book for a couple months now.I gotta give props to Roy Valentine the \\"International Player\\". Any guy that wants to get some serious booty should read this book. This is the closest thing I've found to a sure thing."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This System is one of those little gems that you can only be surprised by when you read it.My friend told me about it but would only say \\"I used the system\\" or \\"she's an A girl\\" each time I asked him how he knew she would go home with him.I got the book and from the moment I picked up the book to the moment I turned the last page I didn't put it down. Chapter after chapter I felt like \\"I wish I knew this my whole life\\". It's filled with the unusual and it challenges you to look at yourself introspectively before even trying to go out and pick up girls.From the beginning of the book it delt with issues that no other book seem to even want to touch like the thoughts that limit us regarding getting girls. I kept shaking my head. I didn't realize the personal beliefs that were limiting me.The book then launches into its primary goal - to show the skills required to go out and get laid. Some things that I thought were cool are:(1) The top 10 reason girls sleep with guys (page 38)(2) The 1% rule - how to identify girls that want to sleep with you vs girls that are just a tease. (page 50)(3) The girl game, which is basically a women psychology section. It show you how to know what women are thinking when you meet them (page 63)(4) How to sleep with multiple women at the same time (p185)The book takes you through the steps needed to identify and seduce any woman in any situation all the way through how to close the deal (p 133). It's amazing!The section about using his \\"Panty Dropping Recipes\\" to seduce girls was very different. I cracked up on his personal stories of what he did right while developing the System and what he did wrong.I've been using the book for a few months and am surprised at the change in my personal life. The girl that I woke up with this morning (that I met at the supermarket last night - no kidding) asked \\"how did you know\\"? I just smiled."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I thought I did some things in my life but Roy's my new hero. This guy writes about how he got girls in Japan, France, and all over the world. I'm a traveler too and I could identify with him on some of these things.So why do we need these kinds of books? Well, if we knew everything about getting girls we wouldn't be reading these reviews. We also wouldn't be interested in books like this. The truth is, I learned more from this book than in years of dating. I went out and tested the SYSTEM and it does work. Well, she was just an average looking girl but it did work - and yes, I was a little surprised. Maybe I'll eventually get that super model with a little practice.I'm not sure if you'll find it helpful if you want to find someone to marry but if you just want to go and and get some action then this is the book that I recommend."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

Just because they say it wont work doesnt mean its true"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book is the most fun and educative one that I have read in recent years. I randomly picked it up and now it's my dictionary/manual. I wonder how Roy have collected so much knowledge in one life and put all of it together in a nice way. Roy, I wish that I was able to read your book 15 years ago, when I was a teenager. All my life I sadly listened to my friends sexual adventures hoping that they were mine. Now it's the other way, thanks to \`The System'.Every word and instruction in the book is more than perfect. Sometimes being over confident about myself, I deviated from the rules that Roy listed and guess what I was badly shot down. So my sincere advice is just to follow every rule and just the way he said.Now you know why I said that I owe a lot to Roy Valentine."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I bought this book thinking it would help my game. Well I havent yet tried it , but his ideas are interesting. Meanwhile, the editing of this book is terrible, with tons of misspelled words. Other than that, the 1% rule has some merit. This book seemed stupid in that it really is just common sense ideas. I think you could try some of the stuff, and it will work, but alot is BS."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"It's an OK book, but I have one major gripe with it: it has a lot of generalizations and not enough specifics in it. Like, it brushes over the topics without going into depth about them, as though it expects you to find half the information in that book elsewhere. I'd say skip this one, it's not worth the money + the shipping & handling. Because although it has some good ideas, you have to basically already be a playa in order to put them into practice. I, however, am not."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I read through the book over the past few weeks. I have begun using the technique described in the book, and my success has increased incredibly with women. The book does an excellent job of describing a sure fire way to meet the women who want you!I high recommend it."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"To be honest, I was a little bite sceptical: hey, I'm French !!! But after few pages, I was really in and I just wanted to finish it to know all the tricks. The result: This is an excellent book that I recommend to all the guys (it's a shame, I am already married...). This is a very easy readable book, with simple tricks that can be applied on a daily bases.I gave it to one of my friend and by applying the rules, believe me, his life changed.So, just buy it, try it and be sure to catch girls every time you want. I'm waiting for a French version now."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This is a wonderful book ever I read and worked for me like explained. I never got laid before reading this book, now I feel myself like a champion :-) I go to the bar, go to the beach, go to shopping mall, I get the girls everywhere. Thanks to the writer and Amazon for keeping such kind of books."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Every man should read this book. I realized that when I was successful with women (which wasn't very often), I was using the principles of The System: how to identify the 1% of women who will are interested in you, how to approach them properly, how not to appear too interested, how to keep alive the fantasy of romance. The System can be applied anywhere, including at online dating sites, where I have found it very effective. I also find the System very effective on the subway and at the grocery store.Until I read the System, I never turned down a hot girl because \\"my calendar is just too full to see you.\\" Previously, I wasted my money on a couple of other dating/relationship books that turn guys into the \\"nice guy\\" who never has a date. (I already was that, and I was still a loser.)The vignettes of the author's pickups are interesting, but the sample dialogues are far more useful. I wish that there were more sample dialogues, especially at the introduction stage.Every guy with any blank space on his calendar needs this book!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Guys, you have to buy this book. I got the book a few weeks ago. I have to say that my game has improved alot since then. If I could give the details here I would but needless to say I've been enjoying a great level of success with women since I read the book.The System is a hidden gem. Once you find it you can't believe that you didn't know this stuff already. It's brilliant in its simplicity. I would like to thank Roy Valentine for writing this book. It's done wonders for my social life."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I Read the book the same day I received it 4 weeks ago. The next day a girl began flirting with me and has done so every day since then. Other girls have been doing the same. Is it a coincidence? I realize the sky's the limit now and I think my tastes in women have even changed. These principles are based on science and not some kind of nonsense. Understanding these principles will increase efficiency and effectiveness; instead of wasting time butting your head up against a wall, you will be able to simply open the door and walk through. Even for a guy who's not out to have sex with women, but wants to broaden his choice of beautiful women to date, this book more than does the job.Thank you Roy, for your excellent work!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The material in this book is certainly the best I've read on dating. I've read most of the other book as well. The concepts are pretty simple and my first reaction was that - hey, I do some of these things and it never worked. What I learned however is that by following 'all' the steps in the System my level of success has increased dramatically.I agree with other reviewers that this book is very necessary in the market. I'm not interested in a relationship at this point in my life. I'm still young and am focused on my career. There are books that teach women how to find a partner. This book teaches men how to take home girls the same day you meet them. No frills, no long term dating, no spending hard earned cash.Overall, I like the book because it's simple (5 steps that anyone can learn). Also, because I've tried it and it really does work. Mostly however, because it's a pretty good read.I think guys that are looking for ways to improve their game should get this book. It cost less than what you would spend to buy a girl a drink at the bar."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Those of you who have been in the game a while will read this and see that the author hits all the major points. He's written up what most of us had to find out one (un)happy hour at a time."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I have to admit that I wasn't a believer. The book teaches you how to master one night stands and then turn the one night stands into booty calls. The idea is that you can get laid anytime anywhere. Well, that is the promise at the beginning of the book. This is not for the faint of heart.I figured however that if it was that easy, everyone would be doing it. It wasn't until I read the book and tried it that I became a believer.The book breaks down picking up girls into 5 steps that even an idiot can follow. But then backs up the steps with details and examples. I read the book in a couple hours and was out the next day to try it. I started noticing things that I didn't see before. It took me about a week to \\"close\\" on the first girl. I met her at Hard Rock Cafe. She was with her girlfriend and I was with my buddies. I guess I had the steps memorized by then because I didn't miss a move.The next morning I was leaving her apartment with a big grin. Since then I have only been improving on my game. It's an amazing thing. I never thought it was possible but I have to say that the system works. A must buy for every guy."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The first guide on \\"dating\\" I ever read was written by a woman. This was your typical how to be the \\"nice guy\\" book. You know the guy all women say they want but in reality would never date, let alone sleep with. So it was very refreshing to me to read \\"The System\\". He spares us the nice-guy stuff and tells it like it is. You have to be nice but you cannot be *perceived* as too nice.From the book title you would think this is a very shallow book. But there are some very interesting concepts presented here. An example is how to handle a conversation... my favorite quote is \\"the more you let them talk about *them* the more they think they know *you*\\"... this is precious and not so obvious advice.I just don't give the book 5 stars because I think it sets some unrealistic expectations. If you are really good looking and *very* confident this \\"system\\" may work for you but I doubt it will work for the average guy. Nevertheless, there's a lot to learn from this text and you will be better of after reading it. Well worth your time."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The stories were funny and the book was entertaining. I got through the book in one night. The 1 percent rule and the Girl Game were the most insightful. So simply! Either way, the main point is that I used the system and got laid yesterday. I only bought the book a week ago."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The best way I know how to judge something is if it works or not.I just read this book and think it's the most incredible book I've read on picking up girls. I found it impressive because the concepts is based on using body language to tell when girls are interested as well as when they are ready to go home with you.Morever, I like the book because it showed me how to complete avoid rejection when approaching, talking to, and closing on girls.I bought the book about three weeks ago and I took home a hot girl last night. I almost gave up after a couple weeks of trying to identify 'A' girls with eye contact. I got a couple phone numbers but it wasn't until yesterday when the true power of this simple little book was put to use.I admin that I'm no stud and this is the first time I've had sex this year. Not for lack of trying but this is just not one of my strong points. I read some other books and took a class but it just didn't work for me.We're having dinner later so I can't wait to see if I'll be able to get her in bed again tonight. I can't recommend this book enough for guys who have trouble getting girls to have sex with them. It certainly works for me."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"It's actually a common sense...get muscular, be handsome....have a lot of money....blah."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I had really high hopes when I decided to buy The System. The first chapter was really good and I was really excited to read on. That's because it talked about thoughts that limit a man's confidence like thinking she's a good girl and wouldn't put out, which could stop you from talking to her. From there it was disappointing. I am not going to write what I thought but instead I made a brief list of suggestions found in this book off the top of my head:-Lift weights-Make eye contact-Go to the beach before sunset to meet girls.-Go to the mall to meet girls-Make eye contact with girls in church.-If a girl brushes up against you in a bar it may be a good sign.-Show her photo albums of trips that you had mentioned to her.The book even provides cooking recipes to make for \\"B\\" women to make for dates. The recipes looked good but it's not what I wanted.This book is not what I wanted but I realize that some people may like this sort of advice. Unfortunately, didn't get anything out of this book."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This was a nice try but a little off the mark. It reminded me of those little commercials in the 50s on how to be popular. Remember those?So as a woman, may I counter the ideas in the book and try to help some of you poor slobs out by giving you the REAL tips to getting \\"laid\\"?1) DON'T call it \\"getting laid\\". And if you bought this book, hide it.2) Take a shower and BRUSH YOUR TEETH (if you really want to turn her on wear cologne...smells are VERY important)3) Did you ever think about what's in it for her? How are YOU going to make the potential sex worth her while? If you don't know how to turn her on, how in the world are you going to get her off? Start out by reading \\"She Comes First.\\" You can mention that that is one of your favorite books while seducing her...it might help.4) Instead of trying to focus on \\"looking in her eyes\\" a certain way or silly things like that...try REALLY looking at her. What is sexy about her? We know you guys will sleep with anything, but stop for a minute and ask yourself why you want to sleep with this one? You might become GENUINELY attracted to specific things about her and when a woman feels that kind of attraction, she is more open to having sex.5) Don't make promises you're not going to keep. Be honest. We really do like that better. The sex isn't better when you trick a woman.6) for a woman you are dating or seeing several times, get her little things to get her in the mood...like an erotic book. Try Bedtime Stories for Women by Nancy Madore. That's a good one. You could even read it to her.7) ASK HER to have sex with you.8) If at first you don't succeed, try and try again. Don't be such babies. It is not the end of the world to be turned down.Good luck!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book can be summerized in a page at max. Some of the tips are insightful like not approaching girls in groups larger than two in a bar. At least half the pages in the book try to convice you that the ideas in the book really do works. He has a few very good &amp; interesting ideas but he repeats them again and again in the book. I think he is trying make sure that you understand his ideas but this book could really be an article. It may not be a fair comparion but I think The Art of Seduction by Robert Greene is a lot better &amp; a more dangerous book. This book is more of a guide for dummies, but better than many I've read on the market."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I was made to read this book after a guy friend wanted a girl's opinion about how much it works, and I can vouch that definitely most of this book is 100% true. This book hits the nail on the head when it comes to reading signals from women. I didn't even realize that when I was interested in a guy I would try multiple times to make eye contact, but it's completely true! A take home message from this book is that stop pursuing the women who AREN'T interested, and start learning to read signals from the pretty girls that are into you! Seriously, no matter what your type, there are girls out there who are into that. And I don't think the book stressed enough how important it is to keep in contact with a girl after you hook up with her...not only does it not make her feel like crap, but why throw away free \\"companionship\\"?"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book teaches you the mental game played by men and women while dating. The book starts out with the internal perceptions that men have about women and how it limits us in out attempts to seduce women. It also deals with the way women deals with and respond to men and WHY?I learned a lot from this book. It has clear examples on how to pick up girls as well as the psychology behind why some men are successful with seduction while others are no. I recommend it to anyone looking to improve their game."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I've read everything on the subject of seduction. SO its hard for me to view books as someone who is reading it for the first time. I've also read hundreds of articles on seduction and posted the best of them on my website The Seduction Bible. So lets just say, im educated. THat being said:This book is good if you've never read anything else. It's good if you don't want to spend the $40 it takes to purchase an E-book with more practical information. It does give you some great points in attitude, appearance, and general perspective of women. But it is missing the meat. It is missing the precise art of the mystery method. or the pure logic of cocky/funny.But then again... Like i said I've long since needed to read these books and now only read them to review for the readers of my site, the seduction bible.Bobby Rio"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book is the most fun and educative one that I have read in recent years. I randomly picked it up and now it's my dictionary/manual. I wonder how Roy have collected so much knowledge in one life and put all of it together in a nice way. Roy, I wish that I was able to read your book 15 years ago, when I was a teenager. All my life I sadly listened to my friends sexual adventures hoping that they were mine. Now it's the other way, thanks to 'The System'. Every word and instruction in the book is more than perfect. Sometimes being over confident about myself, I deviated from the rules that Roy listed and guess what I was badly shot down. So my sincere advice is just to follow every rule and just the way he said. Now you know why I said that I owe a lot to Roy Valentine"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I liked the book. It's very small and easy read. Somewhat practical. Sort of points you in a direction, but does not have any specific steps."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Imagine yourself being a young, healthy guy and then you meet a Kung-Fu master and he teaches you everything about fighting. You are not afraid to fight anyone anymore and you know you will win, Well, now imagine yourself being a healthy guy and then you read this book and now you can pick up girls whenever you want to. What I mean is that you will need some training and you might fail sometimes but I guarantee if you have little or no sex now you will actually meet girls who will want to merry you and become obsessed with you through this book. I am not joking. Do I have to say more. The sale of this book should be controlled and I am not kidding you."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I read it then I read it again. This is the most impressive book I've read in a long time. It's pretty directed towards taking home women the same night you meet them. It's also pretty good with tips on things to do and things to not do. it made me think a lot about the things I was doing wrong.Super book. I recommend it to anyone in the market to get girls or if you just want a good read."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

I would admit I didn't try the methods as I believe they are just as bad as mine haha.If your coming up empty with dating or even if your looking for the love of your life then my highest recommendation goes to the book that helped me find my Fiancee \\" How to get the woman of your dreams using the Internet\\" The Autor has found out where to look and how to get any person of the opposite sex you want online and shares it with all of us. A homerun for us searching for true love!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I picked up this book out of curiosity, expecting to be disgusted, and I wasn't. It is a book aimed at men who are looking to get laid quickly, but I don't find it disrespectful. The author does not depict women as stupid, unworthy or the \\"enemy.\\" He is not advising men on how to trick women into [getting physical] with them, and doesn't suggest promising something that won't be delivered.Rather, he outlines a very specific strategy for finding willing (...) partners that I think would probably be effective. Basically, he advises men who want [to get physical] how to figure out which women are attracted to them, how to approach them, and how to determine if those who welcome the initial approach are interested in them [physically], either immediately or at a later date. He explains (and I think quite accurately) how women view their more superficial interactions with men and how to ingratiate themselves with a woman who already is interested in them.This isn't going to be as helpful to a man who wants something more than a playmate, but it will certainly give a man more women to evaluate. And many of his suggestions on interacting with women would serve men well in dealing with girlfriends as well as more casual bed partners."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

The System","review":"I've been dating for a long time and have to say that I found myself smiling a lot while reading this book. The book was very vivid with its description of events in the author's life and was very entertaining.I think what I took mostly from the book was the concept of a process to pick up girls. I have certainly tried most or all the things in the book but not in such a direct and structured way.I think I'm now enough of a believer in the System that I'm already trying some of the techniques. I will have to see if my \\"Close\\" rate increase significantly over what it currently is. If it does, then this book is worth a million dollars."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"There is really not that much to picking up girls. If you read this book and do what it says you will get laid. Much of it is true such as not wasting your time with girls that are in a group and the girls that are out there just to boast their ego and spend your hard earned cash.I think this book could use more on being discrete when screwing girls. Even if you can get some girl to come home with you word may get out that you are just out for sex. That's not a good thing. Even if someone gives you eye contact and everything, you may want to think twice before proceeding, you don't know who they know and who they may tell even if you have sex with them."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

I re-read the book to help solidify my own approach and now I am confident to approach women in situations where I was not comfortable prior to reading The System.It breaks down the art of closing the deal so that anyone can do it and the book gives you tips on what NOT to do. The author's real life examples really help in explaining the approach."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book identifies and documents the specific steps used by successful players each time we pick up and take home a girl. No kidding! I play football for (...). I'm no stranger to getting laid. Frankly, I never stopped to think about \\"a process\\" but as I read this book, I could see the same steps that me and my friends used in the clubs, bars, after the game etc. It was kinda weird reading the book because it was so right on.I hate to endorse anything but I think that guys that use this system will be able to go out and get the cheerleaders and the 10s of the world. I bought a couple copies for my less fortunate buddies that are still trying to figure this out. I figure it could make a good christmas gift."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The author approaches the subject directly (hence the title).His approach to meeting women is different from the other top pickup artist's in that, like marketing, he's targeting a very specific niche of women. His technique works, and it will save you a lot of wasted effort if \\"Getting Laid tonight\\" is indeed your goal.Guys like Style and Mystery definitely have game to teach, but if you're seeking a specific result, you need to focus on that (otherwise, your results will vary).It's nice to be able to work a bookstore and come home with a few phone numbers, it's also nice to bring home a female guest for books, coffee, and a bath. Fill out the edges of your game, grasshopper.Study Mystery, Style, and Brett Tate-they'll teach you how to turn women on. Read \\"The System\\" too, and learn how to manuveur your new friend neatly into the Jungle Room.Forget anyone who tells you that you can't achieve your goals with women. Learn from the masters, and know that there are dudes that are WAY uglier than you scoring left and right because they had the fortitude to push through the negativity.Much excellent advice for both the novice and the wolf. The System is a must have for your personal development program, highly recommended."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book was great.

The author seems to have a deep rooted hatred and fear of women, tho he claims to love them. He imagines that we have all sort of elaborate games complete with point systems that we use with men, but his whole book is all playing games with women & about knocking hot women down a peg or two. For every \\"sucess\\" story he tells (a tale of how he got some \\"hot\\" women to take her panties off for him in 5 miniutes) there are probobly 50 stories of women telling him to take a hike and laughing in his face at his foolish, cheezy, pick up games."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

Before I was blessed with the knowledge from the sex God, Roy Valentine, i had no self-confidence. Now, no women is untouchable. I owe every happy moment of my last two months to this book and I would recommend it to anyone who is ready to really start living life."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I recieved The System a few weeks ago and so far I've liked what I've seen. I have met many women (thoug I admit I haven't been going out a lot, like 1 or 2 times a week), and two of them took me to their apartment inmediatly :). One was a 26 years old girl who was sitting with a friend at a restaurant when I approached her (she was giving me MAD eye contact, waving and all that stuff), and the other one was a popular ex-model of 36 years old who I met at a friend's party. I can't complain so far. I'm sure I would have still more success if I got out at least 4 nights weekly or drive to many places during daytime.The most I like about the book is that if you read it well, when you go out and start having sucess, you feel confident that you can get laid whenever you want, and the desperation disappears. Still, you must put what you read into practice and experience what it is said there by yourself, not just read it and hope that some girl with enter your house to get you laid, that's for late night movie scripts.I want to make a few points though: from the reviews I've seen some guys who apparently have read other seduction materials and expect this to be hardcore stuff or something like that. Contrary to that, the book is very simple, so simple that during and after reading it, you say \\"&iexcl;I knew that, that's pure logic\\" but if you think about it, yes, it was very logical stuff, but had you tried to apply that sometimes?Let me explain, the main rule of The System is the 1% rule, which basically states that wherever and whenever, at least there's always 1% of the girls ready to go to bed with you (ex: in a 100 people bar, there's minimum 1 girl you can lay that same day). Yeah, you can say sarcastically \\"wow what a great discovery\\" but as I asked above, \\"ok mr. smart guy, but have you actually been out there looking everywhere until you find that ready-to-bed girl?\\"... ask yourself this and you will know if you are just another one critizising or a happy person who's confident that he can get laid the same day if he's motivated to go out until you find that 1%.I should add that I also read lots of dating material and that sort of stuff in the past, however, most of that is focused on building attraction, manipulation, pick up lines, complex techniques and all that sort of stuff you find by reading \\"The Game\\" by Neil Strauss (a great eye-opener book by the way), things that make your interaction with women complicated and focuses more on your ego than on getting laid. However, even for an experienced guy in other seduction material, after dropping all that complex stuff, this is a refresher. You will actually GET LAID (that's the only purpouse in the book), not spend lots of your time going out approaching the wrong women for 'practicing' your 'laser-beam attraction-hypnosis self-delusional powers'. Get real, just get laid and enjoy. Read The System and APPLY IT.Now for the bad stuff. A few things that I think the book missed.First, the conversational stuff lacks in depth. Why? because Valentine recommends asking questions, show interest and just flirting (that is not expaded too much). For more socially inept people, the ask question dynamic will make them feel a bit unconfortable during the blank spaces of the conversation, while the socially skilled will know how to advance and/or fill the voids. My recommendation is to get confortable with that conversational method first by trying what the book says with women friends, co-workers and all that stuff. Then it will be easier when you want to get laid. Also, more explanation in the bodylanguage section would have helped more.Another thing is that if you live in a small city or a not so big metropolitan area, you will have to go out more because the 1% will be more difficult to be found. So in that case you must then persist, do what the author says and go bar from bar, until you find the adequate target, and that could take you lots of gas and a vehicle of you own if the places you frequent are very distant one from each other. Basically if you live in a smaller urban area, you must be prepared to spend more time looking for your 1% and some days wou won't be able to find the same-day-lay girl (especially if you are in a more conservative country).Last, but not least, is the physical aspect. In order to boost your sucess rate of eye contacts (one of the first setps to identify your target), being in great shape and dressing good imrpoves your 1% to maybe more than 15%!! depending on your genetical looks. So I believe Valentine should have expanded that part of the book.So, as a conclusion: If you are an average guy who doesn't want to lose time and energy trying to become a 'pick up artist' and just want to get to the point: sex whenever you want, read this book, get into the gym, prepare to travel a lot around your city and start going out a lot! everywhere! It is guaranteed that getting laid will now depend on your choice (the choice to just get up and get out from your house) and you will actually start getting laid. Good luck in your journey to unlimited sex.UPDATE: I've found the perfect complement for the bodylanguage section. It's the wonderful written \\"Undercover Sex Signals\\" by Leil Lowndes. Believe me, it's a gem.And for the talking section, I suggest any of the conversational books from Lowndes too, and/or becoming a more social person.Enjoy, you have all you need to enjoy great sex (just don't forget to give them many powerful orgasms!)"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"The entire contents of this book could fit on one page of paper.The remainder of the book is filled with art and babble. There's even recipes in the back (not kidding).Do not buy this book unless you want to learn first hand how to get ripped off today."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Roy Valentine's book \\"The System\\" is deceptively simple. However, it only works IF you have the time to implement it. otherwise, you should be getting laid every week instead of every day as the book promises (At least until you acquire enough girls for booty calls, which the book also recommends). It also would help greatly if you live in a large city where the 1% rule can be implemented. Otherwise, you will run out of girls to seduce quickly.This book gives the average man the confidence and the BASIC verbal skills and techniques necessary to get laid every night. However, unlike what the book says, you should be reasonably attractive to women in order to seduce 1 out of every 100 girls (the 1% rule), based on my experience. Generally, if this book was a college course, it should be called \\"Getting Laid 101\\"."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This is the most underrated book I have run across in a long time. I call it underrated because I've never heard about this book until recently. What's interesting however is that it works. I've had the book now for only 2 weeks and I have already closed from literally following the book's advise. I've read the other books on the subject and have tried to follow them but most of these kind of books are a lot of fluff and ego crap. Just a waste of money. I even went to a couple seminars and that was another big waste of money.The System is simple, to the point, filled with great examples of how to use the \\"5-Steps to Success\\", and most importantly - it works.I'm not sure how much more I can recommend this book but to say that I've always wished that there was a simple and easy way to go out and pick up a girl whenever I felt like it. I always thought it was impossible but now I know different. This is the real thing guys. They should teach a class on this in high school or college. Great book. Thanks Roy Valentine."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"this book could have been written in 50 pages. this is one of the worst investments i have made in awhile. it has decent things to say. but for the most part, it is watered down and expects you to know everything else about how to deal with women. and even though it has some good suggestions, these suggestions are often very incomplete. for example, how exactly do we know if a girl is type A/B or a distraction? that question is never really answered."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"For the record, I'm neither a geek nor a stud. I make this point because I noticed the top 2 reviews said that you have to be one or the other to benefit from this book (which is a bit contradictory).Actually, I'm not even a player. I found about the book while surfing the net for books I could use for my sociology dissertation on modern day sexuality. Needless to say, I understand the reason for the controversy of this book.The book is about \\"getting laid\\" and having \\"booty calls\\". But the author dissuades men from cheating, or lying to women. The book is about meeting girls, but the author believes that nightclubs are the worst place to find willing women. The book is about taking home girls but the author encourages men to talk to women, learn about them and call them back. He doesn't subscribe to one-night stands where the man says, \\"I'll call you\\" but never does.On the surface, the system is a simplistic book about getting laid. Upon closer observation, however, the book is an interesting mixture of sexuality, sociology, scientific process, and morality.The controversy therefore will continue because everyone who reads this book will come away from it with a different point of view. Where you are in your life and your personal experiences will determine your personal opinion of the book."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"WOMEN are a headache!!! They drive me nuts. I have tried to figure them out for as long as I remember. People like family members, friends and peers give different advice but none seems to be on point; they just tell you a little bit of the truth but they can't put everything together.Fortunately, during my quest for the truth about women I have encountered &quot;The System&quot;. It is absolutely amazing how this book can tell you everything relevant there is to know about the nature of women.The book has answered all of the inconsistencies on women that I have thought about over the years:(1) why are the hot women I am attracted to not interested in me; yet the ugly ones that I refuse are all over me.(2) why do these really hot women go to clubs yet they don't want to hook up with any guy.(3) how do you easily identify women that are truly interested in you.(4) how to avoid being used by women.(5) how to stop wasting time with women.After reading &quot;The System&quot; I have a complete understanding of what I am to do when dealing with women; this book ended my frustration with them. I have verified and applied the techniques in this book and they have worked many times; I have also experimented following my old routine with women; after applying my old techniques I have seen how they don't work at all and lead to utlimate failure; yet when I applied &quot;The System&quot; it has always given me rewarding results.One of the most memorable things this book has taught me is how to be prepared for that one moment of truth. It shows you how Michael Jordan doesn't waste his shots but just waits for that opportunity and takes full advantage of it; Jordan takes advantage b/c he knows what he is doing and teaching you what you are supposed to do through understanding how women interact is what this book prepares you for.Knowledge is power and I feel that this book has provided me with a lot of power in one of the most important aspects of any man's life.I hope you find &quot;The System&quot; to be as insightful and useful to you as it has been for me."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"It's interesting to read the reviews about this book. It got me curious enough to buy the book to see what the fuss was all about. So here's my take on it.I think the book is very good. It's 208 pages of male/female psychology mixed with sociology wrapped in somewhat of a flowchart of steps required to pick up girls. It was quite entertaining - which was a surprise, and it hit on some pretty undeniable points about how women think and what men need to do to use this to our favor. But in the end, the book repeated goal was to teach men how to get laid today.Given that goal, I think I understand why the big fuss. Simply, it's unimaginable that the average guy can go out and get a hot girl any day of the week. I think most guys refuse to believe the possiblity of this. I had to think back to my own experience and the brilliance of the book is that it correctly identified the things that I did when I did get 'lucky' with one night stands in the past. If this has never happened to you then I can imagine the confusion.I think the negative reviews are mostly frustrated guys that have given up on every meeting women or others promoting competing books. The system may not be the answer for everyone but I do belive it's better than anything else I've read so far."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I'm not sure where to start but this book is mind blowing. I learned more about girls from this book than I ever imagined possible. I went out today and tested the steps in the book. I couldn't believe it. I got a girl back to my apt. I had a pretty good time with her - almost a home run. She's coming back tomorrow. The point is, I've never done this before. I mean, to go out and come home with I girl I just met.Anyway, this is the most amazing book I've ever read. It's so awesome. It's a must buy for any guys that wants to take home girls."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I thought this book was very enlightening, and what I liked about it was the reader focused content. The author definetely had an idea about the type of reader that he wanted to address in this book. The type of reader that I am referring to is one who is too nice. The nice guy that always finishes in last place or the one who gives the woman too much power. The validity of the content was questionable to me with some of the stories and illustrations of the material, not to mention there were alot of typos so he should fire whoever his editor is. I would recomend this book to any guy who wants to expand his perspective about his approach with women. I have yet to see any success with the material that I have read but I am going to read it again to solidify the techniques."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I was hoping that this book contained some useful theory on how to pick up more women but I was very disappointed with it. The suggestions contained are vague and boring. Reading it I felt like it was all common knowledge. There are some good points here and there but overall a poor book."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"My girlfriends were acting so weird I finally asked one what was going on. She said my boyfriend had been hitting on every woman in our circle. I called my sister to boo-hoo and she said he had tried with her, too.After I kicked him out, my sister and I were turning the mattress and I found this book. My sister said this was the stuff he was trying. We called my girlfriends over to party and we read this silly system out loud. What a hoot! Women can't read a single page without laughing.I found out why my friends were acting so weird. My boyfriend's act was so obvious that my friends thought I must be testing them to see if they would betray me. The Valentine System is so juvenile that every woman who has read it giggles that no one smart enough to read is stupid enough to believe any of this will work.All these rave reviews testify that only dorky men would buy this book. If you need The Valentine System, you need a lot of OTHER things money won't buy."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

The book is very informative but what is particularly interesting (maybe even unique) about this book is the 'PROCESS' that was presented. It's the only step by step guide that I've read that takes you from the moment you see a girl through each step required to acutally getting her in bed."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

Even if you are looking to just get a date and not laid. At least you'll know when your in the middle of a situation that was outlined in the book. I would recommend this book to the shy and rejection limited. He deals with thoughts that limit men from having the right mindset to overcome their fear of rejection. Be patient and read, you won't be sorry."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I read this book over the weekend. I just ordered two more copies for my brothers who are away at college. I think they'll enjoy the college experience a lot better than I did.It's an incredible book. I wish I had it a few years ago, but I'm still going to make up for lost time."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I read this book because the title suggested that the author had some valuable information to deliver. Unfortunately, the only advice the author gives you is completely worthless. Basically he tells you to go for women that give you eye contact. Unless you are very good-looking, the only women that will notice you are fat and or ugly. In fact, I did an experiment in a variety of venues to see how much eye contact people would give you. It is surprising how often most people do not want to look another person in the face, in the workplace, in clubs, shopping, etc. Don't waste your time here guys."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I have no idea why I got this for my Kindle. Maybe just for kicks - I don't know. Most of the advice is lame - the reviewer who said this could fit on one piece of paper is correct.One thing that I did think about - aside from an occasional moment of self destructive nihilistic fervor - why would any man or woman want to meet someone and immediately have sex with them? I mean most of the women I am around are professional and would probably be fun in bed. But these ladies are almost all married and have self respect. If I was younger and single and employed this system I would be afraid of getting an STD. I am not being shrill and talking about AIDS, but herpes etc - something that can haunt you for a long time. If we assume what this guy says is true (maybe, but I doubt it) the odds are that he has contracted an STD from one of these stellar ladies who he has picked up. I have nothing wrong with getting some action, but come on, you have to vet the woman a little. If shes dripping and smells like a petri dish something is wrong; or, if she has open sores and track marks, amybe you should go bang someone else.On the other hand, this is such BS that I doubt it would really work or would really add to anyones repitiore if they already get laid on a regular basis.That being said, for fun I tried seeing who would give me eye contact, etc. I went out alone to a bar and spoke to some women - all were what author calls Type B or ignore or whatever he says. One chick was mega cute but I had to pull back because I am married. I don't think I would have gottne her, but we did exchange business cards. (She looks like Anne Hathaway - nice bangs)I went out with a female collegue and noticed that I got exponentially more \\"eye contact\\". (But anyone reading this book knows that that happens a lot as women are always into other chicks guys or at least curious)All in all, this would be a good book to read if you got it for free. But don't waste your dough. And, if you do use a system, just make sure you don't get some disease from a skank with no self esteem who confuses sex for intimacy."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I've purchased a few of these humphelp books more as a joke than anything else. For the most part I rely on my buff bod and winning smile to score with the chicks down at the local bar, but I have had far less success in the connubial bedroom. To be frank, my blushing fifth bride has put on more than a few pounds since our son Chad was born after that glorius election of 2000. She likes to eat and refuses to exercise (a losing combination to be sure). And, of course, she claims she's not interested in the munky munky. Well, Ol' Hops isn't shy even when the hips are of the hippo--and they most certainly are in Bessie's case. It helps when I'm on the sauce (which is most nearly all the time), but sometimes I just can't get the Old Fat Pajamamama to commit. So, I enlisted this book as a guide.Well, here's the deal. It doesn't work. My unwilling whale of a wife refused my continual eye contact (stressed as the key to success in this \\"system\\") and even called me a \\"creepy, staring, drooling, nutjob\\". I tried charming her with some sweet phrases (not stressed enough in this book, if you ask me--and I am an expert) and was once again rebuffed. I gazed as longingly as I could into her eyes and repeated the munky mantra of love (\\"you are so big and boootiful\\") about seven times before she snapped the book SHE was reading closed (something about Japanese women and how THEY don't age or get fat--what a joke that is, by the way) and trundled out the door of our increasingly leaning trailer. Needless to say, I spent the remainder of the night without the munky munky. A poor investment--both the bride and the book."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

One of them has infiltrated our secret systems. I don't know how it happened but I suggest we call an emergency meeting of the executive committee and begin an inquiry.

The System","review":"Personally, I found this book interesting because it gives you a set of guidelines, tips, and different scenarios or stories to consider when handling women. I feel this book is more for men just entering the dating scene."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"Just got finished reading this book. The best points: how to use eye contact; how to use body language and not get rejected; getting into how girls think - like the Girl game; the 1% rule was pretty unique; dialog for guys to talk to girls. Things that would have been nice: more details on pick up spots; the examples were good but more examples would have been nice as well.The book is pretty precise in its approach. It's really different in that its not about dating, it's about how to take home girls the same day you meet them. I thought the book delivered on its promise. I definitely recommend it to anyone looking to go out and not come back home alone."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I just recieved this book in the mail and read it in about an hour. This book is amazing, everything he writes in here is genius. The eye contact and how to find the right chicks is perfect! Everyone who is saying this book is crap are just pissed cause its going against their own game.The book is very easy to read and very easy to follow, I cant wait to use the skills I learned in this book on some chicks.If you have doubts just read the book, you'll be surprised and amazed"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I'm from a small town and have always accepted the 'normal' beliefs that I had growing up. I found this book to be challenging at first. Not because it was wrong but because I wasn't raised to think like this.The System woke me up to a reality of the way women think about sex and sexuality. I had to test a lot of what was said in the book and am still surprised. I have already seen the positive change in the way women interact with me since I've started applying the ideas outlined in this book. I now feel that I 'connect' with women better than I ever did prior to this. I have to say that socially, this book has had an impact on me like non other so far.I certainly recommend this book to anyone who want to learn more about social and sexual interaction between men and women."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I have each step and most of this book memorized because this is just amazing info. I've been doing pretty good since I bought the book a few months ago but New Years eve blew my mind.I went to a New Years Eve party. I used the System on this girl. Right when I was about to do the Close step, her girlfriend showed up. I worked on her a little but all the signs were there, just like Roy said. I did the close on BOTH of them.I woke up on New Years day with TWO girls in bed with me. I never thought it was possible. I am the KING of the world!"},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I disagree with a lot of the reviewers regarding the worth of this book. It certainly is not as good as something like How to Succeed with Women, but the strategies and tactics are practical and undoubtedly effective. Certainly a few superficial objections to it could be made, such as its pages not really outlining a system per se. It more proffers advice and best practices, yet its recommendations are intuitive and valuable. Also, its organization probably annoyed more than a few readers as the author introduced certain scenarios and then abruptly turned away from them without letting us know what we were supposed to be learning from the tale. Further, there's too much wasted space and empty pages. The important thing, however, is that a lot of these observations are pretty strong. I appreciated his words about women preferring bad boys, his 1 percent rule, scoping, the girl game, and that many women support their lifestyles via free dates with men. Yes, your money would be better spent with something like the Copeland and Lewis book, but The System clearly isn't bad."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I would definitely rate this book very high. It was informative, funny and best of all - it works!I've had the book for over a year now and the level of action that I have gotten in the last year is better than all my prior years combined. I'm writing this review because I'm actually getting serious with someone now that I met by using the system. You have to be able to meet them before you can marry them and this book certainly shows you how to meet them ... plus some.I know it's difficult for guys to believe how easy it is to hook up with girls and that relationships can come from these encounters but it's true.Anyway, great book. Thanks Roy for writing it because it literally changed my life."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today!

I'll sum up the book for ya....Don't waste time on scoping for girls that don't make eye contact with you, they're not attracted to you. When you notice that a girl holds her stare and smiles at you or gives you a double look, charge on in for a conversation. Once in make her work for your attention, don't give it away that you're attracted to her. Once you're convinced she's into you, go for the score.....That's it...."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I picked this book up when i was beginning to get good with women. I had no theory or anything, i just did what seemed natural to me. I wanted to get even better so i picked it up and decided to do as it said. Whosh - game gone.First - this book tells you not to touch women. ANYONE good with women will tell you that touching, or Kino is the MOST IMPORTANT THING. It is VITAL. This book tells you the opposite. It's like telling somebody to go skydiving without a parachute. You're bound to crash.Second - it tells you ONLY to approach women who are staring at you. Anyone else isn't interested. This is SO WRONG. Almost as wrong as the first.Don't buy this book if you are planning to succeed with women."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"I think the sign of a really good book is the controversy regarding it. I saw the same with the DiVinci code and Rich Dad Poor Dad. I think The System is one of these books. It brings the passion out of you. Its simplicity is almost unnerving. I've never had a problem with women but read this book because a friend kept talking about it. What's interesting about this book is that it pulls all the pieces required to pick up a girl the same night and take her home and put it into a simple 5 step process that any idiot can follow.I was very impressed and learned a lot from the book. Not because I did not know a lot of these things but because I did not really have a true process (a system) that I could use in any situation. I was simply going with gut instincts before.Anyway, this is a great book for beginners as well as experienced players. Now instead of working at getting lucky when I meet a girl, I'm simply following a system. Most of the time I know what the girl is going to say or do even before she does herself."},{"Title":"How to Get Laid Today! The System","review":"This book is very small and easy to read, however nobody can seriously believe that you can get laid within minutes just following this method no matter how do you look like, how much money you have, etc as the author claim. I don't buy either that the author of the book has slept with even half of the girls he claims so easy. Let's be realistic here: you need to be good looking, funny, good conversation, dress nicely and a good car will help as well, no matter what method you use to close with someone in one night. Period.Having said that, The body language section of the book is really good and there are a few interesting ideas, like classifications, steps, non verbal communication, etc... some tools that can be used to try to understand a little bit better how women think. I agree with the author that many times women send us signals we can't understand and here we have a few ideas to decode them."},{"Title":"Capitol Records 50th Fiftieth Anniversary 1942-1992","review":"Two stars. It's gorgously applied paperback coffee table book, those kind of showoff photos with a little text books that you put out to impress company, a living room prop kind of book. It weighs a ton (a literal exaggeration, true) -- well, a few pounds, at 217 or so pages, heavy slick almost cardstock paper, not so great binding. A very big paperback photo album paperweight. For content, you can think of this as a kind of very exaggerated sales brochure of past acts. Even what little text it has is spaced deeply apart to stretch out the appearance of content, like the double- and triple-spacing trick used by undergrad students to stretch out the apparently length of a skimpy term paper. More or less, each artist mentioned gets maybe two paragraphs of anecdotes. But it does have beautifully applied photos (how many are new to anyone outside Capitol, I can't say).My particular gripe with having bought this book a few years ago as a shot-in-the-dark attempt to get some decent information about Capitol artists generally is the complete lack of THE two major reasons I bought it: a sessionography from the A&R; dept. (I've had 30 years of contact with the librarian(s) there via paper letters/lists back and forth about specific artists trying to run down A&R; matrices on specific artist interests), and a near complete lack of any record discographies. What's a discography, you ask: a list of records --78s, 45s, album sets in whatever technical variation. If you're looking for recordings, indispensible--if you're looking for come and gone, forgotten acts and ghostly failed recording legends that sunk without a trace, which is something like 80-90% of all records/albums put out.This is a coffee table book. Think of it as those slicks my dad used to pick up at the auto dealers back in the '70s: gorgeous photos of next year's models with no text. This is Capitol Records version of those auto brochures."},{"Title":"Give 'em The Ax (Dell D213)","review":"Give 'Em the Ax, A.A. FairDonald Lam returned from the South Seas, he had suffered from a tropical disease. The meeting has some sly humor. Miss Georgia Rushe entered the office for help. She had been friendly with her boss Ellery Crail, then went on vacation. When she returned her boss suddenly got married! Mr. Crail had hit Irma Begley's car, and an offer to repair her car and pay her bills soon led to a quick marriage. Georgia wants Cool & Lam to investigate Irma and the Rendezvous business she wants Ellery to buy (Chapter 1). Lam discovers Irma had been in an earlier accident (Chapter 2). Chapter 3 tells about the Rendezvous clubs that operated in the afternoon. Lam is recognized and told to leave. Lam interviews the other man who was sued by Irma Begley, and meets someone from the Rimley Rendezvous. Billy Prue has information, and explains it to Lam. But when she returns to her apartment she finds a dead body (Chapter 5).The police arrive to take their statements (Chapter 7). Bertha Cool was traced from her earlier accident (while investigating). Lam learns about the dead man's nephew (Chapter 8) and his relationship with Billy Prue. Lam gets a surprising telephone call after the murder weapon is found (Chapter 9). Who could have planted it? Could a clock be changed to create an alibi? Billy Prue tells Lam about Stanberry's racket (Chapter 10). Chapter 12 explains how multiple parties can be held liable for one accident. But one party can make a deal with the plaintiff. Is there a reason why this case should be settled out of court? Can a person be sued to sway their testimony (Chapter 13)? Or to influence a witness? The testimony about the accident sounds like a real court case (Chapter 14). [This is a lesson in testifying about an auto accident when unprepared. If you are ever in an accident write down all the details as soon as possible. Lawyers earn a living by analyzing testimony and making opposing witnesses sound stupid.]There is a surprise when the lawyers want to settle out of court (Chapter 15). Miss Rushe had a change of mind. [There is more humor in this chapter.] As part of the settlement Lam gets the names of the witnesses and the license numbers of every car that was there. Lam reviews the notes and finds a surprise that leads to a solution of the conflict (Chapter 16). Lam figures out why the handle of that ax was sawn through (Chapter 17). Detective Frank Sellers arrives to conclude the story; the ending is a surprise (Chapter 18). The last chapter ties up the loose ends. [I found the ending to be sort of tacked-on]. Did the famous Fall River murders inspire the method of hiding the ax?"},{"Title":"Small and Miniature Turning","review":"This book is a wonderful guide for all of use to be inspired, to get our lathes out an make some magic of our own.

The government of the Republic of Brazil decided to suppress a religious sect of perhaps 7000 members, some of them violent and lawless, living in a remote rural area; the sect denied the legitimacy of the Brazilian Republic. The ensuing campaign lasted ten months, involved the deaths of hundreds of Brazilian army soldiers, and culminated in the extermination of the sect; these days it might be considered genocide.The book's author, a formal professional Brazilian army officer, covered the campaign for \`O Estado do Sao Paulo', Brazil's equivalent to the New York Times. He was horrified. So he wrote this book, which has beeen compared to everything from Lawrence's \`Seven Pillars of Wisdom' to Dickens, Carlyle, and the prophet Ezekiel. Originally published in 1902, it has been in print in Brazil ever since.The book is tough reading (and is no easier in Portuguese than in English; Samuel Putnam, the translator, did a superb job.) So why should one read it?For one thing, it poses in the starkest possible terms a dilemma we still face from time to time. Under what circumstances, and to what extent, is it ethical for an elected representative government to coerce an organized group of its citizens who sincerely deny the legitimacy of the government and the laws?And, it forces the reader to ask: What is history? How should it be written? How do the facts of history depend on cultural assumptions? Euclides da Cunha, like Thucydides, could find no suitable model for what he wanted to write, so, like Thucydides, he invented his own. I think this book could serve as fertile ground for a productive discussion among social constructionists and their adversaries.The thoughtful reader will also ponder on what central message da Cunha was trying to convey; in later life da Cunha declined to clarify this. One possible answer is implied in \`The War of the End of the World', a novel drawn from da Cunha's book by the Peruvian writer and politician Mario Vargas Llosa. But I have seen other possible answers in thoughtful commentaries on da Cunha's book, so the reader may wish to decide for himself or herself.Finally, despite its difficulty, the book is great literature. It accelerates steadily from a seemingly interminable prolog in which nothing much seems to be happening to a climactic ending so gripping and fast paced that it's hard to stop reading. The only other author I'm familiar with who employs this technique as effectively is Thomas Mann."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"Euclides da Cunha was a journalist who witnessed the aftermath of the Canudos war. The book tells the story of the creation of the Canudos community by Antonio Conselheiro, a mystic figure whose family was killed by landowners in one of the poorest quarters of Brazil, and its destruction by the Brazilian army.Da Cunha's prose is addictive. Once you start reading you won't be able to put the book down. I advise you, however, to skip the first part, a boring description of the region's geography. I know more than one person that dropped this wonderful book because of this introduction.For those of you interested in Brazilian literature I would also a suggest reading Machado de Assis (Memorias Postumas de Bras Cubas is a fine example of his work), Erico Verissimo (Incidente em Antares, Ana Terra, o Tempo e o Vento) and Clarice Lispector."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"Da Cunha&#65533;s 1902 book has been justifiably called the &#65533;Bible of Brazilian Nationality&#65533;. This is a challenging book, over 500 pages in this edition, dense and probably unsuitable to those who need the stimulation of a pop novel. Da Cunha was present at the 1896-97 military assaults on the rebellious village of &#65533;Canudos&#65533; in the arid Brazilian interior. A gifted writer with a background as a military engineer, Da Cunha brings a precise expert&#65533;s eye to the military campaigns, never failing at such details as order of battle, casualties, supply lines, and tactics. The campaigns themselves were stirring and bloody affairs: four separate military campaigns, each larger than the last that met increasingly stiff resistance from the Canudos villagers. In the end, 10,000 souls may have perished on both sides. The end, of course, is well known to all Brazilians. &#65533;Canudos did not surrender. The only case of its kind in history, it held out to the last man. Conquered inch by inch, in the literal meaning of the words, it fell on October 5, toward dusk &#65533; when the last defenders fell, dying every man of them. There were only four of them left: an old man, two other grown men, and a child, facing a furiously raging army of five thousand soldiers.&#65533;If the book were merely a military history, it would be successful. But it is far more, for Da Cunha is more than just a military observer. He is geologist, geographer, anthropologist, sociologist, and historian. This book literally defines the still-nascent nation of Brazil. The backwoods villagers of Canudos were inspired by a religious fervor cultivated by a heretical evangelist named Antonio the Counselor. Their story is part Masada and part Waco. Da Cunha places Antonio in the context of his own life and the development of Brazil&#65533;s interior. While sometimes indulging in unfortunate racial generalities, Da Cunha takes an incredible interest in the geography of the region, describing how it shapes people. How the society that emerges in such a poor and desiccated land can yield the lawlessness and anomie suitable for the development of an Antonio. Da Cunha both despises and respects the villagers, &#65533;jaguncos&#65533;, in Canudos. He hates their illiteracy, superstition and backwardness while grudgingly praising their bravery, loyalty, and cunning.Canudos, in his view, is a time warp, Brazilian society spun back to a primitive time, and for that all Brazilians share guilt. He blames urbanites and elites, the generals and craven politicians, the recently deposed monarchy and the addiction to European styles for the evolution of a Canudos. Two Brazils have developed, he writes, one is built on the European and Portuguese model and necessarily fails to address the second Brazil, the one populated by millions of rural souls in the impoverished interior, for Portugal was never faced with such a community.Da Cunha&#65533;s genius is demonstrating that Canudos is a consequence of the failure to develop a unified national identity that incorporates all Brazilians. It is a battle between old poor Brazil and progressive modern Brazil. Thus his book was the first step to defining the true Brazilian nationality, one that survives to today &#65533; a nationality that blends European, African, and native traditions. A nationality to which all Brazilians now belong. Canudos was a wrenching experience in many ways. There was immediate and widespread shock over the year of military disasters and thousands of casualties inflicted by a ragtag band of backlanders. Then there was the deeper self-analysis that accompanied the publication of this book. Like other American states, Brazil could never survive until it stopped looking to the Old World and developed its own identity, one shaped by its own people and circumstances, and one that acknowledged the existence and worth of every citizen.The enduring testament to Da Cunha is that he was among the first to recognize the need for such a national self-criticism, and his work is one of the efforts that launched it. Brazil is what it is today in part because of the clarity of Da Cunha&#65533;s vision of Brazil as set out in this monumental work. Canudos was a Brazilian failure, and this book went a long way to finding the solution. It really is as great as they say."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"&quot;Rebellion in the Backlands&quot; is one of the best books ever written in the Brazilian literature and one of the most poorly known, given the intrincacies of the Euclidian vocabulary. The centennial of the first publication of the book was commemorated in 2002 not only in Brazil but also abroad, where there are many intellectuals who are keen of everything related to the book, the so-called euclidians. &quot;Os Sertes&quot;, the Brazilian Portuguese name of the book, is an epic and was inspirational to many ancient and modern films run in Brazil about the conflict, and also to a book by the Peruvian celebrated author Mario Vargas Llosa (&quot;The War at the End of the World&quot;), who had Euclides da Cunha as idol since his childhood.Euclides da Cunha, then a war correspondent of the very famous southern Brazilian newspaper O Estado de S.Paulo, wrote the book with a view to the conflicts ocurring in Bahia, after the so-called Proclamation of Republic, in 1889, thus ending 72 years of monarchical rule, something which upset many powerful landowners tied to imperial interest to raise arms against the new republican order. The revolt, known as the War of Canudos, as a historic fact, was eventually lost and the insurrects had to put down their arms, and the battle was won by government troops, but the War of Canudos was to enter Brazilian history as one of the cruelest ever fought in Brazil, and the government had to spend much more money than at first foreseen, losing its face in the end: how come a so strong army had so much difficulty to conquer a bunch of illiterate misers?. All this to kill the dozens of thousands of insurrected who amassed themselves in the poor village of Canudos, in the northeastern region of Brazil, the poorest region of a poor country.From the side of the mutinees, the revolt had (almost unwittingly in the beginnin) a leader, Antonio Conselheiro, a mystical man who wandered for years in the hinterlands of Brazilian Northeast, followed by growing multitudes of disposessed, who saw in him a religious man to rescue Catholic fundamental religious values of medieval importance, and to whom they follow as sheeps follow their sheperd.To sum it up, the book has all the ingredients of a good historic novel, despite its characters being non-conventional. I hope you enjoy it as I did."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"This is not an easy book. Don't pick it up if you like pop novels and sci-fi. It's for the serious reader of history, military tactics, and social upheaval. Da Cunha is a brilliant observer of the 1896-97 Brazilian military's crushing of an ostensibly revolutionary movement in the dry interior. Brutal, honest, clear, incisive. An amazing and challenging book."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"In addition to the reviews previously posted, my advice to the non-intellectual reader is to first read Errol Lincoln Uys's Brazil, which is an easy to read historical Michener-type novel that will frame the events of the eye witness account of the \\"rebellion\\" of Canudos documented in d Cunda's book. After reading Rebellion in the Backlands, I recommend Mario Varges Llosa's The War at the End of the World, again a novel but featuring a fictionlized Euclides da Cunha that makes The Rebellion in the Backlands even more understandable. Both Llosa's and Cunha's books are required reading in Brazilian schools and I believe it would be a waste of time to try to gain insights into today's Brazil without giving yourself this very unique experience."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"Pillars of Wisdom...Euclides da Cunha's book \\"Rebellion in the Backlands\\" was first published in 1902 in Brazil.

This is by far one of the best accounts of basic guerrilla and psychological warfare tactics. As well, this book is often compared to Lawrence's (of Arabia fame) book \\"The Seven Pillars of Wisdom\\" which accounts his lessons from his guerrilla campaign."},{"Title":"Rebellion in the backlands","review":"Literally, this is the work of a genius. the author was the very definition of genius, a journalist, anthropologist, geologist, engineer, etc. But most important, he was an eyewitness of Canudos, the village in the backlands of Brazil that resisted four army expeditions until the very last survivor, commanded by their religious leader, Antnio Conselheiro.

A good read."},{"Title":"Prisoners on the Plains","review":"While \\"Prisoners On The Plains\\" does an excellent job of documenting what life was like for Italian, German and other captured Axis forces held in the United States P.O.W. camps, the book goes far beyond that. It describes and documents the conditions in the United States leading up to and into World War II. It also points out that the P.O.W.s performed a valuable service by providing the much needed labor to plant and harvest crops to feed our country and to assist the war effort.It's been said that the safest and best place for a German male between the ages of 14 and 60 during WWII was in an American Prisoner of War camp. This is undoubtedly true as the book points out that many of these German prisoners came back to the U.S. after the war to raise their families. They had learned first hand how democracy works because even as prisoners they were paid a small amount in script for their work. The camps were almost entirely self sufficient, with the P.O.W.s running their own dining halls, laundries, bakeries, etc. The script they earned was redeemable at their own canteens in the camps whereby they could purchase items for personal use. I never knew what a valuable service these captured enemy soldiers did for our country until I read \\"Prisoners On The Plains.\\" Without their efforts, the U.S. farmers would have been hard pressed to raise and harvest their crops. As a general rule, the farm community gave high praise to the P.O.W.s as workers. Farmers often invited the P.O.W.'s to share meals with their families, which was against Army regulations.Everyone interested in U.S. history should read this book.

Also a student learning quantum mechanics for solid state might feel the relativistic one-dimensional Kronig-Penney model in Chapter 9 quite useful. Interestingly, a relativistic version of the microscopic theory of superconductivity in the framework of the Bogolubov-de Gennes equations has been presented in Chapter 13. A nice extra feature is that the SI system of units has been used throughout the book.All in all, Relativistic Quantum Mechanics book by P. Strange works as a valuable textbook as well as reference material for graduate students and researchers.

The main character speaks of a Holden Caufieldesque way of looking at the world in a different perspective."},{"Title":"Magda Rose","review":"This novel is the first full length work published by this author. It appears to be semi autobiographical and deals with self discovery, maturation, and growing up in 50's- 60's New York City.It moves briskly, has nicely developed quirky characters, and would be of interest to both young adults and mid lifers as well.The plot brings in various ethnic and religious groups who learn about each other and appreciate both their differences and similarities, not without some struggles.Although it is not a \\"Holocaust\\" book, the subject is critical to the story, as the title character's father is a survivor.As such, it might appeal to High School educators looking for a novel to which their students could relate as well as being able to fulfill thematic needs.In summary, worth checking out !"},{"Title":"Magda Rose","review":"I like Magda Rose for two main reasons:It made me conscious of some things I'd never really thought about before.

Levey has synthesized historical and personal accounts of the period and it results in a Historical text which is very readable. He gives life to the great artists of the time and some of the 'dirt' too.

Despite its weight, this is THE travelogue on Florence I will take with me."},{"Title":"Florence-a Portrait","review":"This book gives the reader a history of Florence through its art. Naturally, the Florence in the time of the Renaissance is covered at length, but Levey doesn't stop there. He gives lots of insight into the patronage of art in succeeding periods.

We are the beneficiaries of the author's lifetime of experience and understanding in the matters of the Renaissance and its center, Florence. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Florence-a Portrait","review":"The book is wonderfully written, but reading it presents the same challenges as following a university lecture on the subject. Mr. Levey does not dumb down his subject or choose words he thinks most people will understand. You must keep up with him, and it would be helpful to keep handy a dictionary and a book on art history (or at least be near the internet).This is a fascinating and insightful work, but not one you'll want to read a couple of pages of while your spouse watches Letterman before bed. You'll want to be paying strict attention as you read. If you do so, you'll find yourself well prepared for a visit to this amazing city. Rather than questioning your tour guide, you may well be able to teach her a thing or two on the subject."},{"Title":"Florence-a Portrait","review":"Having read Michael Levey's From Giotto to Cezanne and A History of Western Art, I approached Florence - A Portrait thinking I knew what to expect. I did find the attention to detail, the keen critical evaluation and aesthetics that I expected. I did not envisage the book would turn out also to be quite the gargantuan work of scholarship and erudition that it is. Florence - A Portrait is much more than a history of art in the city state. It is almost a biography of the place, replete with historical, economic and political detail. What is missing, of course, is a picture of Florentine life from the point of view of the ordinary citizen, but we cannot criticize Michael Levey for not including what probably does not exist.I visited Florence thirty years ago and have never returned. At the time, memories of Kenneth Clark's Civilisation were very clear in my mind and I focused on renaissance Florence, almost to the derision of the rest. Even after such time I found my memories of the architecture, paintings and sculptures were still fresh, however, when I read Michael Levey's descriptions. But his descriptions do more than merely list a presence or critique a style. He offers context, critical evaluation, origins and influences when he considers these - and any - works of art. He identifies flattery or criticism, idolatry or satire where an untutored eye would see only colours and shapes.The book is presented chronologically. It walks us through the early years of the renaissance and deals with the extent of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries in minute detail. Then, as a more anonymous baroque era dawns, the account speeds up somewhat.Michael Levey also makes crucial and important points about the nature of Florentine government in this later era, an era that is so often dismissed as decadent when compared to the golden age that preceded it. The account is comprehensive, detailed and illuminating, but is written in a lively style which is never dull. It's a book that would be more interesting after a visit than before and would not work as a guide book on grounds of size and weight! But it is a truly rewarding read.It is noteworthy in its treatment of the baroque era. Most visitors to Florence are there for the renaissance, and this later work is often dismissed as over-ornate, opulence for opulence sake, over-stated, crass bad taste. Michael Levey corrects this view by evaluating this later period in the context of and as a development of its precursor. While reading his account, I was interested to learn just how much those who commissioned works simply wanted to make a grandiloquent statement about wealth and power.

His understanding of Florentine history is poor and often down right insulting (his remarks that the vibrant political life in the early communal period was like the \\"mafia\\" is a fine example). His insistence on the greatness of Sienese art and on Northern Renaissance Art are wholly inappropriate in a book on Florence. It would be like writing a book on the history of the British Empire and constantly making a point to discuss imperial Russia or Rome.

The author is bent on rendering a not so complex issue really Byzantine. The amount of money you need to retire so your lifespan does not exceed the one of your retirement portfolio is not that complicated of an issue. Let's say you want to retire on $100,000 a year. Assuming that you and your spouse will pull $30,000 a year from Social Security, and $20,000 a year from old defined benefit pension plans; you have a gap of $50,000. As a short cut, you can use the Dividend Discount Model to value stock. Using a conservative after tax investment return of 7.5% and a long term inflation rate of 2.5%, by dividing $50,000 by (7.5% - 2.5%) you need $1,000,000 in your own retirement funds (401K, IRAs) to retire. In reality, you need a bit less because the Dividend Discount Model assumes you live forever.However, the author ponders on the above number for over 250 pages. What if the Social Security system is semi-privatized as the Bush administration is talking about? If you are over 55, the current system is grandfathered. Given Bush momentum, Social Security reform as of now is not forthcoming anyway. How about if your employer goes bust, and your pension evaporates. Depending on who is your employer this may be an unlikely outcome. Otherwise, the Government picks up the tab and typically pays you at least 50 to 75 cents on the dollar. If this is a concern, use just 50% to 75% of your expected pension income in the calculation mentioned above. The author mentions other complications including the fallacy of using average returns in your calculations and instead using Monte Carlo simulation method. Now some mutual fund companies have included Monte Carlo engines within their retirement advice section of their websites. This is however not for the faint of heart from a quantitative standpoint. A nifty short cut around it, is to use different scenarios with overly conservative investment returns (within the calculation shown in above paragraph) to explore some \\"what if\\" worst cases.The author has also a very strange idea of what the middle class is. He clearly confuses the Easterners top deciles with annual income over $200,000, net worth in the millions, and very self-actualized and successful careers with what the middle class really is. Well, people like that really don't have to worry much about the numbers. For the author and this group, it is pretty easy to say retirement planning is a lot more than just about the numbers.If you want practical advice on retirement planning and investing, let me recommend a far superior book: \\"The Random Walk Guide to Investing\\" by Burton G. Malkiel."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Eisenberg's premise in \\"The Number\\" is at first blush sound. He defines \\"the number\\" simply as \\"How much money do you need to secure the rest of your life?\\" Focused squarely on the Baby Boomer generation, although the dust jacket expands the audience to include \\"...every man and woman over thirty,\\" the reader becomes acutely aware of a looming financial crux. With unsustainable spending rates and little or no preparation for retirement, many Baby Boomers find themselves at the crossroads of their retirement woefully unprepared and asking the question just how much is really enough. The concept of condensing retirement simply to \\"the number\\" is intriguing, but unpractical as a financial solution.Fortunately, \\"The Number\\" reads well and quick. Delivered in three parts (Chasing It, Figuring It, and Finding It) through 17 chapters, \\"The Number\\" tries grappling with a nearly insurmountable topic and one that is hard-tested by even suggesting a rote method of dealing with it. Indeed, it is not until the reader reaches page 156 that the author advises \\"developing a realistic lifetime income plan\\" as a potential solution! In very next chapter, however, Eisenberg dully provides the reader with the flip side of the coin. The reader is indulged with a protracted discourse into the theory that perhaps, just maybe, the oft-termed \\"number\\" is not numerical dollars, but rather \\"...meaning, fulfillment, and life's true calling?\\"The author's use of selective statistics is superb. Consider:\\"Of workers fifty-five and older, only one in four has invested assets of more than $100,000; one in three has less than $50,000.\\"\\"1 percent of the population--nearly three million people--currently has as much money as the hundred million people at the bottom of the ramp.\\"\\"...one of every 125 Americans is today a true millionaire...\\"\\"Roughly 80 percent of those eligible do indeed put some money into a 401(k) plan--typically 5 to 6 percent of their pay.\\"The statistics are eye-opening and woven seamlessly into Eisenberg's work--but why not cite them with the appropriate source to add further credibility to their substance?In addition to the total lack of citations on the statistics, the author probably should have partnered with several respected Financial Advisors to contribute or even co-author the book. I had trouble putting credence in the author's qualifications to write a work so many Boomers will probably take as financial advice verbatim. Barring his generational fit and Rolodex of peers, this is a tough sell if the reader is looking for practical, no-kidding experience from the field. On a marketing and sales standpoint, however, this book IS a phenomenon and perhaps the author primarily wanted to bring to light, in the form of this work, discourse on what he considers one of the least talked-about subjects for the Baby Boomers. If that is the case, then this book has indeed succeeded. It brings to light the many assumptions, conflicts, and unspoken conversations about the unique challenges each Boomer is faced with when developing a very personal \\"number.\\" Well marketed!"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I picked up The Number hoping for some practical tips--maybe formulas and exercises to help me plan for the future. But halfway into the book, I was so depressed I could barely muster the energy to turn the page.People with many millions more than me are worried to death that they don't have enough for retirement. And here I was thinking we were pretty well prepared to retire comfortably.Clearly, I'm completely out of touch--or else Eisenberg is.Eisenberg's world is downright unpleasant--he says people are more willing to talk about what kinds of animals they are, uh, cozying up to than they are to talk about how much is in their retirement savings. All the top-earners he writes about either support mistresses, or would be suicidal to have to give up their Paris chateaus in retirement. And, he says, there are only four types of people when it comes to retirement planning--all of them hopelessly naive or stupid.He goes on in fine Chicken Little style (he is a journalist, after all) to tell us how unprepared baby boomers are to retire, how unprepared everyone is. This is helping me how?In fairness to Eisenberg, I'll admit that I didn't read to the end. Maybe it gets a lot better in the last 50 pages. But just as I wouldn't sit and listen to someone's narcissistic complaining for hours on end, I just couldn't hold out long enough to get to whatever reward might be at the end of this book.This book appears to be selling well--and maybe that was the point. Although I'm no better off for buying it, at least Eisenberg is closer to his Number."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"My first bit of financial planning advice is to save the money you might spend on this book and invest it. you will immediately be further along.Is this book all bad? No, of course not. I gave it two stars since it does prompt you to consider your non financial goals as a key driver.The author begins by telling us about how poor all of us are about financial planning, then we meet a series of multi-millionaires who keep striving for an ever bigger number. There, you have the synopsis. Save your money and time, if you see this book in a bookstore, open it, read the last couple of pages and you will have most of the sound advice in the book."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Like other reviewers here, I found the book promising by its blurbs and cover, but was greatly disappointed with the substance contained within.First, the author needs to lose his 'cutsey' style. It adds nothing to the content and makes every topic seem inconsequential and frivolous.Second, it would be very nice and respectful of his readers were he to actually get his hands dirty and do some real research and I don't mean getting on a plane to talk to upper income financial and life planners.He would do us a service by digging into some real statistics about savings rates, projected pension fund failures, inflation, health care costs. You won't find any of that in this book.And yes, the book is heavily east-coast, upper middle class skewed. Does the author realize that a 4-entry table the bottom entry of which is \\"1-3 million\\" in savings and goes to \\">100 million\\" might be of interest to a small percentage of the reading public? Like less than 5%? (but then, I wouldn't even know that from reading this book, it is so short on hard facts). And, I'd have to marvel at the IQ of someone with $100 million in retirement funding seeking advice from Eisenberg, whose professional career (the details of which the author finds necessary to relate to us early in the book) is less than stellar. I regret my funding of this guy's retirement by my purchase. It pays to have friends in the East Coast literary establishment pimping your sloppy writing, I guess.It's a lazy man's guide to retirement planning--the \\"lazy man\\" being the author."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I had big hopes for this book. They disintegrated as it gradually became obvious that it would contain almost no worthwhile financial advice for anyone with less of a stash than Hugh Hefner.It reads like a pamphlet that the author has desperately tried to expand into enough words to justify being book length. Some of the sentences are so full of parenthetical drivel that they seem interminable. He obviously had a lot of fun padding it out.Early on in the book, in one of the more concise moments, we learn the average status of most retirement savers in America. Is that followed by practical advice for the average person? Good heavens, no - what kind of fun would that give a semi-retired Esquire editor? Instead, we get to meet a succession of CEOs who use their huge pots of gold to indulge endlessly climbing mountains, and reversing their mid-life crises. Any idiot can tell them that they have enough of a nest egg to live comfortably, and that's just what this book does. Let's all breathe a huge sigh of relief for those poor souls who are only smalltime multimillionaires. As for the rest of us - well, we don't matter very much, do we?"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This book contains nothing of use, whatsoever; it dances around what you need for your \\"Number\\", never providing any useful information or any insight.

What needed to be said could have easily have been stated in 100 pages or less. I found myself skimming his \\"journeys\\" in corporate board rooms and his endless discriptions of everyone he met. Who cares?! Generally life is about the journey but in this case the journey was monotonous and never was a destination found that was of any value. The author's apperent self absorbed wittiness came across more as an enlarged ego than an entertaining and informative read. If you would really like to consume this book, I suggest tearing out 2/3s of the pages, eating them and giving them 24-48 hours to digest. Then, in the end you will have what you started out with in the first place."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I read this book from cover to cover the same day I received it and then I went back and read sections of it again. It was an enjoyable read but if you are looking for a detailed \\"how to\\" book on finances, this is not that book.If you'd like to explore some of the issues facing those who are nearing retirement (especially the Baby Boomers) you'll find much food for thought here...and some rather scary details about how little many people are saving in light of soaring health costs, disappearing pension plans and other threats to financial security.But the book isn't all doom and gloom. Instead, it challenges the reader to explore the possibility that having an exact figure (or \\"number\\") in mind that one \\"needs\\" for retirement may be more flexible than one realizes. There is a heavy emphasis on finding meaning, exploring values and what leads to a happy postwork life.Some of the chapters were a little too general for my taste but I still couldn't put it down, as Eisenberg has a nice, chatty style, peppered with plenty of statistics and information. I would have preferred even more detail but it is still a worthy read and may help you to fine tune your own retirement plan.Think of it as a general guide, however, rather than a specific book of portfolio allocations, expected returns, etc. For that, you'll have to look elsewhere...but when you do you may find that you've changed your retirement and investment goals."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Ugh.I did something I rarely do, I picked up a book on a whim at an airport. I fell for the cover title, and I was interested to read another person's perspective on reaching the ultimate personal annuity goal - a self-perpetuating nest egg.My primary objection is that - though this is a book clearly marketed to the masses - Eisenberg's primary focus appears to be on a close circle of friends who are multi-millionares (and yet, still seem unsure whether they've accumulated enough money). Hence in terms of focus, the book is frequently off-base.A second objection is the writing style. Perhaps this can be expected from a journalist/editor, but I often found myself rolling my eyes at fluffy filler which largely served to distract from the content-at-hand. \\"... [ten commandments] etched onto an I-can't-believe-it's-not-stone Corian tablet\\", and \\"... slightly better than a snowflake's chance in the Sonoran Desert\\", for example. It's a book - no need to fill the column, Lee.My third primary objection is the wide employment of statistics without backing references. It can be excused that most of the material was repetitious for me, but figures without references should raise suspicion.On the positive side, the book was an easy read, entertaining on occasion, and may spur a few people to think harder about their investment situation. But there are far better resources out there.For practical investing, I very much recommend Burton Malkiel's \\"Random Walk Down Wall Street\\", and Benjamin Graham's \\"The Intelligent Investor\\".In summary, with my purchase, Lee is one royalty check closer to making his Number."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Lee Eisenberg's \\"The Number\\" simply does not live up to its promise as a financial planning self-help book or retirement guide. Short on advice and long on anecdotes, little useful information is imparted. Much better advice can be found in Eric Tyson's \\"Personal Finance for Dummies\\", a truly helfpful finance guide for the average person."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Finally a financial planning without a single pie chart! (The author is probably quite proud of that.) The whole point is to make you think about the kind of life you aspire to live, rather than just retiring.Throughout the book the author uses intelligent humor and metaphors to drive home the point that \\"wealth care\\" will transform not only this generation, but future ones. His modern, but conventional wisdom is combines financial planning with life planning in a very insightful and enjoyable manner.While \\"THE NUMBER\\" is referred to quite frequently through out the book, its perplexing and illusive qualities makes this read almost like a mystery. I kept thinking about when \\"THE NUMBER\\" would magically appear, as if a simplistic answer would make the issues less complicated.Those who are looking for traditional financial planning tools and quick answers are probably going to be disappointed with Eisenberg's work. For those who see the retirement as part of life's journey, this book is an inspiration that can help you define what you want and what you need to achieve it."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"At the beginning of the book I had hopes but after several chapters of not making it anywhere fast I began skimming. There was really no useful information on investing for retirement.For those just getting started, I would recommend Dave Ramsey's \\"Financial Peace Revisited.\\" It covers most of the topics covered in \\"The Number\\" but also gives you details in getting out of debt, mutual funds, buying smart etc etc. Other good books on money: \\"Rich Dad, Poor dad\\", \\"Total Money Makeover\\", \\"Richest Man in Babylon\\"... those are the first that come to mind."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"As a baby booming pre-retiree, I bought \\"The Number\\" out of obvious self-interest.... but I wound up reading this book as much for my children as I did for myself.Despite some of the comments of other readers in prior reviews, this is a powerful book, and one that must be shared with people you love long before they reach their fifties.I have been wondering about \\"the number\\" for a few years - actually, ever since I sent my last payment to the colleges of my children's choices (leaving me with a lifetime of monthly [re]mortgage payments as a consolation prize). Whatever possibly could be left for me - and my (ever) prolonging life?However, Eisenberg helps to demystify \\"the number\\" with a mixture of history, a touch of futurism, and a jolt of reality that hits you squarely in your dreams. I wish that I had read it 5 years earlier...However, I have already taken action. I called my broker from the road and told him that I expected him to read \\"The Number\\" promptly, then take me to lunch - with his credit card - as partial recompense for my advice... and be prepared to discuss the virtues of rebalancing my portfolio to potentially achieve a better number.But, as I said, this is a book that is far more than being \\"about me,\\" which brings me to the sharing part.I look at my children's futures with more wisdom than I ever applied to my own. And more parental fear. The view is unsettling - fewer guaranteed retirement plans, unsettled Social Security benefits, and the threat of wage suppression and job eliminations due to globalization. Even the (higher cost) of a medically enabled longer life span will stress the finances of a significant majority of the upcoming generation far more than the baby boomers.In addition, \\"children\\" are marrying later, meaning that they are purchasing homes later, beginning families later and will be enduring the brutal costs of colleges later - and much closer to today's accepted retirement age - than today's generation.There will be less opportunity to invest in the future when their day-to-day costs are so overwhelming so much later in their lives. This will reduce the years that compound interest can work its magic.... unless our younger generation, hopefully including my children, read \\"The Number\\" and other books that will surely follow, and begin to realize that consumptive excesses and \\"debt warpage\\" behaviors are harmful for their long term security, and begin planning for a future that will arrive faster than they realize - and last much longer than they can possibly understand.Suffice it to say that I will be buying additional copes of \\"The Number\\" and passing the message forward.This is a must read book."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"If you need detailed advice about where to put your money or how much you will get at age 65 from the Social Security, then this is not the book for you.

I enjoyed this book immensely. I see that many reviewers were somewhat disappointed with the book. Since I am from the era of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance this book was right up my alley. We all are out there (or should be out there) chasing the number, but as with Zen there is a much bigger picture you must look at then just the number. My wife and I have had several conversations because of this book. As Mr. Eisenberg says in his book you can get a number with only a few taps of a calculator, but what you want to do with the rest of you life is a much deeper consideration. We feel that we are in a much better place to move forward with the rest of our life. Bravo Mr. Eisenberg!"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This book was a waste of paper and time!There is much false talk of how Eisenberg has hit \\"the sweet spot\\" on the back cover of this book.

According to the author, the industry is set up to take advantage of boomers who are too dumb to know what to do when they retire.Yet, the book provides no useful retirement information itself. On the the last page of 200+, he finally gets around to telling you that there is no Number anyway. It's a illusion, for all you suckers who bought this book. Too late now, no returns are available.If, in the author's opinion, you're a real stooge, you can actually calculate your retirement number. Take your expected retirement income and take 4%. Live on that, he says. But it's more important to find your meaning in life. Money doesn't matter.It seems rather odd that the author calls other retirement planners frauds.

It is an excellent book but to my tastes it could have been edited into a shorter volume."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I wasn't certain about buying this book because I thought that it would slide into a 'how to' make certain you had enough money to quit your day job and live on a mountain top somewhere. Whew, I was certainly relieved when it didn't go there at all ...and then I felt quite joyful when I discovered the guy was witty and playful with the whole concept of money.I've already begun to recommend The Number to financially obsessed types in my life because I think it does a great job at introducing new aspects to the conversation. I have one client who thinks that anybody who earns a big salary must have it aced. Eisenberg certainly lays to rest that myth because he shows clearly, time and again, that it doesn't matter how much earn, it is likely you you think you don't have enough to have the life you really want for yourself. I found his descriptions of the discomfort most people have about talking about their financial worth very funny ...and sadly, all too true. As a Life Coach I frequently have access to information people won't/don't share with anyone else, and the money conversation is often one that they'll unload on me with a combination of relief and total shame.I was just starting to get tired of the obsessive exploration of The Number when Eisenberg switched to a chapter that talks about those of us who have never become obsessed about money and net worth and have other clear social and humanistic priorities in life. I'm looking forward to the responses that my financially obsessive buddies have when they read that chapter!This book is not for anyone looking for answers. But if you want your world view shaken up a little bit, it is a good starting point which is why I rated it so highly. My business is all about shaking people out of their long-habituated ways of viewing the world and themselves in it so I have a definite bias towards authors like Eisenberg who also offer a 'stir the pot' point of view. If you're searching for bigger questions, this is a good starting place."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I read this book in the hopes of gaining a helpful framework for thinking about - and perhaps even achieving - my \\"number\\" for retirement, but that is not what I found between its covers. Mostly the book concerns itself with the soul - searching and anguish that people who have 1 - 10 million dollar \\"nest eggs\\" go through in trying to decide if its enough to support them in the manner to which they have become accustomed, until such time as they pass on. Although I really FEEL for these people, my financial situation is much more in sync with the run-of-the-mill American, and for us Mr. Eisenberg has barely a mention, let alone advice. On a positive note, I did find his writing style to be very engaging. Bottom line - I would have to recommend that you avoid this book and use the time saved to read something more useful and/or fun."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"\\"At my recent meeting of our local investment club,I had the chance to share in detail about some books related to the subject of retirement, and if will I have enough.We had about 18 members of our club at the meeting.I had a chance to talk about \\"The Number\\" many of our members already knew of Lee Eisenberg so the rest was very easy.I shared about the new approach to retirement a new way to look at it.I talked about how much is enought in case of an medical emergency. Talked about the thou shalt nots.I had several great questions asked of me. I only teased the members with the answers as not to spoil the reading of the book for them.One of our members is a financial planner, he was concerned about unconventional advice, but he said that Lee Eisenberg is a man he respects.I spoke for over 20 minutes, about chapter 11 the Advice Squad Confidential. This is where Mr. Eisenbergexplains about financial experts and what you can expect from them,who they are and what they really do.This books talks about the parking ramp and where you are in life, this got the attention of several members.I had so many great questions, I for the most part refered them to the book.

He will surely move closer to his \\"number\\" with sales of this book. For those of you looking for more than reassurance that you are not alone in the search, don't waste your time and money on this book.

It is a very quick read and the author does an excellent job of making this interesting while providing useful information. I was able to get my fianc&eacute;e to read the entire book (in about two days while on vacation) and he is now leading the charge to get our finances in order.I've been recommending this book to many people because it provides an excellent framework of how to think about your retirement.

But the book is not about that. It is about the paradoxical oblivion of most of us to the importance of this question, and the frustration of the rest of us in trying to arrive at a satisfying answer. At the end, its lesson is that the question is unanswerable because it asks: \\"How much is enough?\\" And that depends on who you are, what you want, and how given you are to worry.

MalkielIt's a very accessible and to the point short version of his thick version.."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I was not overly impressed with this book. I give it a B.Eisenberg's book is focused around the amount of money required to retire, or \\"the number\\".His book repeats the facts that most Baby Boomers live for today and save/invest nothing for tomorrow. The U.S. national savings rate has now declined to 0%. Eisenberg's book sets the stage and wrestles with predicting what will happen to the majority of Baby Boomer's who will not achieve their number at the age they expect to.The most logical prediction will be that Baby Boomers will delay retirement and work longer, plus reducing their retirement lifestyle/expenses. It could be the Boomers put a positive spin on this by saying they are reverting to their 1960's hippie mentality of rejecting material possessions and living a simpler lifestyle with lower expenses.Eisenberg points out that only the top 10% of people fit the current business model of financial planning. This business model is to find 100 investors with $1M net worth each and charge them 1% per year to give the financial planning firm an income of $1M per year. Since it takes just as much effort to develop and implement financial plans for investors with $100K portfolios as for $1M portfolios, the financial planning industry abandons 90% of people. He does point out the Garrett Planning Network as a source of financial planning for little folks.Most corporations abandon their employees with regards to providing financial planning information for their 401K's. My guess is these firms are afraid of lawsuits from retirees if they do provide financial planning advice. It was refreshing to see Weyerhaeuser providing financial planning to their employees.Back when I was a young engineer and just starting to work, I forecasted how long it would take me to have enough money to retire if I saved and invested at least 15% of gross pay in the stock market. I knew the historic return of stocks was 10 to 11%, so I figured I could withdraw 10% per year at retirement. This meant I needed 10 times the income I wanted to achieve at retirement. About 5 years ago, I became aware that due to the variations in stock market returns each year, you can probably only withdraw 4% per year. If you withdraw over 4% per year, and the stock market suffers some down years early in your retirement, you will run out of money. This is a big deal, because a 4% withdrawal rate means you need to accumulate 25 times the income you want to achieve, not just 10 times at a 4% withdrawal rate. Eisenberg points out the source of the 4% Rule was another engineer turned financial planner, Bill Bengen.All-in-all, a great book for learning about Baby Boomers and their upcoming challenges in reaching \\"their number\\". Since the vast majority of Baby Boomers have not saved enough and invested enough to hit their number when they want to, this book will at least provide them with some education on financial planning. I would suggest companion books to supplement this book including The Richest Man in Babylon, Bogle on Mutual Funds, The Millionaire Next Door, The 4 Pillars of Investing, A Random Walk Down Wall Street, and the Coffeehouse Investor."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This is a really good book for women who don't like the usual fare on this topic.

To begin with, it's useless: ZERO information, ZERO new analysis of old information, ZERO advice, ZERO interesting anecdotes. Additionally, it's rambling--meandering from summaries of old data, to poorly written schmaltzy 'new age' feel-good blathering. What exactly is this guy's point? No way to tell.Seriously, this book is SO BAD that all the people who allowed their names to be associated with blurbs on the cover have, in my opinion, lost all remaining credibility.What a waste of my $16 and 4 hours.I want my money and time back."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I read a magazine summary of the book - a short summary which was non-commital. Then I read the book. The author has no expertise in this realm and the book is filled with lots of his own anecdotes and those from a small circle of people he happens to know. What is disappointing and amazing is the lack of effort to truly interview or survey people. There is no science here or data - just opinions and anecdotes. Very disappointing."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Even though it's titled the number, he actually talks very little about how to calculate it.

It reads well and challanges you to think diferently."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The number is the dollar value of our net worth. According to Eisenberg, every one of us carries around in our heads a number that should we acquire it would generate sufficient cash flow to carry us through retirement. The problem, as Eisenberg points out, is that we frequently change our retirement desires which in turn causes us to keep tweaking the number. The point of the book is to suggest that the number is less essential than coming to grips with our emotions and assess what we really want out of life. A quick read yet a powerful \\"punch in the gut\\" truth that helps to focus on what is important. Excellent self-help book. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"\\"The number\\" poses an interesting question but provides no helpful answers. A four percent draw on invested assets is as much an old wives' tale as a piece of scientific wisdom, even if it is a number. Eisenberg's number is the inverse of that draw down, or twenty-five times.... well, there's the rub, twenty-five times what? income? expenses? income less savings? projected discretionary spending? Post-mortgage payoff and college tuition expenses? The proverbial bottom line is clouded by conversations with an eclectic collection of consultants, experts, philosophers, and casual acquaintances. Eisenberg, a former Esquire editor and short-timer with Lands End, ruminates about a simple question: How much money do you need to feel secure? The problem is that security comes in multiple forms: happiness, comfort, excess consumption, ego. And the accuracy and stability of those measures and outcomes is compounded by key assumptions about how long you will live and how healthy those years will be. Constructing a one-year budget is hard enough. Constructing a thirty-year budget is nearly impossible.Eisenberg doesn't help his case by the offbeat and idiosyncratic examples and profiles he chooses. Doctors, divorcees, \`downshifters', and very little real data shed little light on the real issues. Maybe I knew too much going in. Maybe I expected too much from a few positive references from other sources. In the middle I was confused. By the end I was simply disappointed. And I have my own number, and it changes every day."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I had great expectations for this book,what a great concept, with the baby boomers approaching retirement age more people than ever are focusing on what number will they need in their retirement fund to retire with.Lee Eisenberg is a great writer, however this book justs drifts around lightly touching on several different aspects of retiring, where to live,what will be the needed cash flow for lifestlye needs, etc. At one point he goes through a made up family and how each family member will have different needs. The book is like a long hypothetical ramble that never examines any of the issues deep enough nor gives any real solutions or solid advice.It is like discussing your predicament with a friend."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This book is a blatant example of deceptive advertising. It offers little hard information, though lots of odd digressions and an often cutesy authorial tone. It should have been reduced to the size of a magazine article and entitled \\"New Developments in Baby Boomer Retirement and Financial Planning\\", but that certainly would not have gotten it onto any bestseller lists. There is so much fluff to fill out the basic points that a) many in this country are unprepared for retirement, b) the nature of and expectations for retirement are different for the baby boomer generation than its predecessor, and c) a true \\"number\\" has to be predicated on a \\"spiritual\\" evaluation of one's retirement expectations. Beyond that, don't expect too much useful advice. While the writing style was not unengaging, I was irritated while reading this as I thought of the author moving ever closer to his \\"number\\" at the expense of a lot of buyers who shelled out their money for the book. Better to read Gillete Edmunds, Larry Ferstenou, Bob Clyatt, or William Berstein for good, concrete advice."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"It isn't easy to write a book about retirement that speaks to all age groups, from college grads to Baby Boomers to retirees, but Lee Eisenberg has done it. The Number isn't as much about financial planning as it is about asking readers to reflect on what is important to them and how they should go about reaching their goals. He is looking at the issue of retirement security from a psychological/philosophical perspective. It is filled with interesting stories that will inspire twenty-somethings to get smart about money at an early age and Boomers to stop procrastinating and/or guessing at their Number while they still have time to make a difference. As an attorney/CPA with an active retirement and estate planning practice, I see many clients who have no idea how to even begin estimating how much they will need when they retire. And I think for many of them retirement looms as an intimidating unknown. It's great that a book like The Number is out there to help them figure out what steps they can take now to get on the path to a more secure future. I give this book a solid four stars and not five only because my CPA training kept me yearning for more quantitative analysis.James Lange, CPA/Attorney and author of Retire Secure!

Prior to receiving the book, I expected some guidance which would help lead me to a \\"number\\" more meaningful than something based strictly on financial analytics. While the bulk of the subject matter in this book encourages the reader to look beyond bottom line dollars and cents, I did not come away with any great new strategy. Instead, the book inspired a little soul searching and was a reminder that life is not just about the bottom line. Even when you have the bottom line firmly established, life can toss you some surprises.I'd say this book is good for someone starting to think about what retirement could (should?) mean for them, and would also make an excellent gift for someone who focuses too strongly on just financials. On the other hand, if (like me) you receive the book expecting to find some new formulas or worksheets to measure your progress so far, skip to pages 250-252.

Eisenberg doesn't show you how to chase the dollar and grab the gold ring. The only place in the book where he shows you even how to calculate your number is in the appendix, and he does that as an aside.\\"The Number\\" is a book meant to help you change your thinking about the 'number' and what it means to you; not a financial guide on how to attain it.

This is a financial book, for sure, but one with a human element often missing in this kind of work. The book is well written, very easy to read, but still delivers a firm message: Americans don't have much of a clue as to what they will need to retire.Eisenberg examines different \`investment' types in the chapters on chasing after your Number. Though most people have a vague notion of what they will need to retire comfortably they choose to put off its pursuit. Much of this apathy stems from an ambiguity about your personal Number. He illustrates how poorly investment brokers are prepared to help in this area and offers several ideas to help you determine your own needs.Once you have figured out your number he discusses plans for living in retirement - \`downshifting.' It is here that the book differs most from other \`retirement books' as he introduces \`life planning' to help you look beyond pure finances to see what things and values are most important to you.There are better books about the finance of retirement and long-term investing but this very human and values-centered book should be on everyone's shelf."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Wow there is a lot of division about this book.

I'd also read the other Amazon reviews. So, I bought the book and read it over a couple of days to give it a professional's opinion. So, in no particular order, here are my comments:1. The book is not for everyone. This is not \\"Financial Planning for Dummies.\\" The author assumes you have a Number or the hopes for a Number. If you have no wealth, aspirations for wealth, or hope of wealth, this book won't magically create it. The Number is not for the masses and is not for the uber-wealthy.2. The author is very entertaining and has many interesting stories and examples. If you think numbers are boring, you won't find The Number to be boring.3. If you have wealth planning issues, The Number won't give you some magic formula. It's more about exploring the issues and getting you thinking about your Number. The author thinks most folks underestimate their Number. My experience says that's true. The book will help you rethink your number and the whole concept of retirement or \\"the new rest of your life.\\"4. A couple of criticisms. I thought the chapter about Fidelity Investments to be weak and out of place. Kind of a filler chapter. Also, the author errs in his explanation of the different types of advisor compensation. Hourly fees are a type of fee-only compensation, but most fee-only wealth advisors are compensated based on a percentage of assets they manage. The author completely skipped this very prevelant practice.5. For other professionals who offer wealth advice, I'd recommend this book simply for ideas to help your clients talk about their Number."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"From the public schools of the 1950's and 1960's, baby boomers learned how to read, write and solve mathematical problems. Their meticulous teachers taught them science, geography, history, art and music. But forty and fifty years ago, the public school curriculum lacked instruction in financial literacy... and it shows. With over 25 million boomers broke today, the potential cost to this generation and its successors is incalculable.In this erudite and accessible book, author Lee Eisenberg reveals his own youthful limitations in financial planning and finally an awakening in middle-age. His journey, and the lessons imparted by many sage teachers, is an exceptional gift for boomers who have avoided understanding what it will take to retire, monetarily and psychologically. The good news: it's not too late. The bad: most boomers urgently need to demystify the mysteries of money.\\"The Number\\" maps an intelligent path to long-term solvency and a second chance for freedom-loving boomers to actualize their creativity - to trek again those unfettered byways they've always craved. And this well-crafted tome presents many thought-provoking excursions into the lives and careers of those who have found a satisfying and sustaining balance between monetary pursuits and personal fulfillment.This is the right book at exactly the right time as roughly 8,000 boomers are turning 60 every single day for the next nineteen years."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I kept hoping this book would get better the more I got into it but it never happened. So much of this book is taken up with the author's self-absorbed stories and perspectives. He seems to believe that it's a qualification that he left the New York City ratrace to work in the midwest although he takes a pressure filled job with a major mail order company. Please know that this author has no qualifications to be offering any sort of informed financial advice. And, he hasn't done much homework to be giving the world lifestyle advice. It's a relatively short back and hardly worth anywhere near the steep ticket price.

It's about having the freedom to make the next half of your life be even more productive, purposeful and enjoyable than the first half. And it's about recognizing that if you want that option, you're going to have to create it for yourself; it's not going to happen magically. The Number is your dear friend, \\"Quality of Life\\", sitting you down for a long-overdue intervention. Except it's not nearly as scarey as you think it's going to be, thanks to Mr. Eisenberg's always honest, often witty approach.It's definitely not a \\"how to\\" book, but I think the real value of this book is not in having a formula for figuring out your 'Number', but rather, in questioning your assumptions about how life is going to be as you age.My only problem with the book is that I would have liked to see the issue explored from additional perspectives. The interviews and examples seemed to focus on well-educated, affluent men. The rest of us want to enjoy our golden years and have peace of mind, too -- white collar guys are not the only ones up at night worrying about what's going to happen after they reach a certain age! It would have been interesting to hear, for example, from the average 50-year old employee working for a typical small business in Small Town, Nebraska with minimal benefits; or from a woman who took time off to have kids and then had to play career catch-up only to end up divorced just as she's starting to think she'd like to downshift (wonder what keeps HER up at night? A whole different side of the Number).Well -- maybe there will be a \\"The Number - Part II\\".

He helps you understand the business so that when you deal with the wall street guys and insurance guys, you will be a smarter and more informed client. It's a great wakeup call for anybody in their 30s, 40s, and 50s, who are approaching retirement and need sound guidance on what to do and how to figure out the right path. Most importantly, it's a good test for your own values, so you can figure out for yourself what is important to you and how to spend the rest of your life. So, it deals not only with money, retirement, and investing, but also with how you invest your time - or the amount of time you have left here on earth.

Period. But that is the part people don't want to hear.There really isn't anything motivational here either."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The book is short on actionable advice and long on blather.The actionable advice is 1) a rule of thumb is that if you withdraw 4% of your savings annually, you should be ok, 2) if you don't know what gives your life meaning you won't be happy/satisfied in retirement nor will you know much it will cost to happy/satisfied in retirement, and 3)the usual advice (don't trade stocks too often, divest but not to much, find a good advisor, etc.) This part of the book takes up the equivalent of about 5 pages.The other 250 pages are anecdotes awash with names of rich and powerful people and details about the author's personal life. It is heavily skewed to talking about rich people's experiences. It is heavy on references to the latest in chic, faddish consumer products, mentions lots of upscale name brands and uses words that must be be chic (I guess, because I'm not chic and I don't recognize them.)After reading the text, I read the bio. The author is a former editor for Esquire magazine. I don't read Esquire because I found it has too many ads for chic consumer products and the articles tend to be pretentious and narcissistic. And that's what this book is, a really long Esquire article.There are better books that address these issues. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Most books on retirement make my eyes glaze over. I look at the repeated advice of saving money, diversifying investments, and being frugal and usually fall back into my seat in a dead sleep.This was not true about The Number because Eisenberg addressed a wider range of \\"retirement\\" issues than simply investing. The fact that Eisenberg is an excellent and engaging writer helped him keep me interested through the entire discussion.Eisenberg starts out with a talk about The Number and how our retirement needs are the last great taboo. He then brings us through a look at how badly most people are managing their number and shares some startling statistics on debt and lack of saving. These will either make you feel smug or that you are not in it alone.The best part of the book was the last section where Eisenberg addresses the question of \\"What is this number for anyway?\\" He delivers excellent essays on different ways of living after retirment from riding a motorcycle to living in a planned retirement community. He gives an introduction to the new field of Lifetime Planning instead of simple financial planning, and forces each of us to consider what we would like to do in the \\"second half of our life.\\"In short, the number is well written and fun. The book forces us to think of uncomfortable issues, but it does it in a pleasant and engaging mannger. Great stuff!"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. I did not find it very enlighting and it was definately written for an audience who has lots of money - and thus not the worries of the \\"normal\\" middle class. The few bits of information found in the 250+ page book could have been communicated much more succinctly. I'm just sorry I spent my money helping someone else make \\"their number\\" - which seems to be the only purpose of the book!"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"A reader's perspective on this book will probably vary a lot based on their individual experience and knowledge. For some it may be eye-opening, for others it may be more like \\"tell me something I don't know\\".It is a fast read, and full of interesting factoids. The history of how people have looked (or not looked) at their retirement plans (actual drawdown and spend, as opposed to micromanaging their 401ks) was interesting.Pros:- easy to read, light humored.- Interesting stats, and good references to experts in the field- Nice thumbnail sketches of types of individuals and their exposures to risk- has some interesting frameworks. For example, think about your retirements spending as being equal to 4% of your intended nest egg. If you need more than 4% in retirement, you may need to save more to get your Number up.Cons:- may be too basic for someone who has done analysis for their actual long term planning. It should also come as no surprise that the current generation has their own accountability to save for retirement (not the government or your employeer).- can be alarmist for people...i.e. Guess what, you could be in trouble. And even worse, you can't necessarily trust people who say they are 'experts'.- middle section of the book drags a bit compared to intro, I thought.In summary, if you have thought about retirement, but haven't yet really done some detailed planning, this book can be an enabler for how to think about plans. It won't solve your problems, but it will highlight the considerations you should be making.I tend to believe that people get scared of the complexities in financial planning, when in fact, several basic principles can be applied to help an individual along a reasonably healthy path. The internet provides a lot of resources to do this, but there probably needs to be a better standard primer out there."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The Number is an intriguing title, and an intriguing book. As one of 50 million plus baby boomers you know instantly what Lee Eisenberg is talking about: the amount of money you need to walk away from the grind and yet stay happy. You keep thinking that somewhere in the book you're going to find that number, or a formulae, or some hard statistics from 10,000 boomers that now know their Number. But a funny thing happens on the way to the forum....To find out the number, you have to find out about yourself. The conclusion is in the last sentence of the book, \\"An unexamined life may or may not be worth living - but it's almost always more costly than an examined one.\\" Eisenberg gives us some great food for thought. He gives us a range of life experiences and goals, and lets us extrapolate into whatever scenario suits our needs. Then he throws in a few monkey wrenches like, \\"What if you only have 5 - 10 years to live? How much money do you need? What if you only have 24 hours to live. What did you miss?\\" So to find your Number, you really need to think about yourself, and what you think is important in your life, especially if your life might come prematurely to an end. Did you hoard it all and slave away to get the Number, only to leave it all as an unexpected inheritance? And finally, a nice number: 4%. You can extrapolate out from what your number is when you stop accumulating, and plan on 4% spending to allow for several decades of income before you no longer need to put your teeth in a bottle!

He lays out a great case for being more frugal now and learning to avoid materialism.A brisk read that will motivate you to actually plan for the rest of your life."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The Number, a completely different way to think about the Rest of Your Life, by Lee Eisenberg is an excellent book that covers a topic we all need to think about. I can't remember how I heard about it but, without thinking, felt it was probably about how mathematics influences our lives. Being a sometime mathematician, it sounded like a book I might enjoy. I found that the Sacramento Public Library had it in their catalog so I placed a request for it. (I love the way I can order any book in the whole Sacramento County library system as easily or more easily than finding it in my local library.)Well, it turns out that The Number refers to the amount of money that each of us feels we need to be \\"set\\" for life, to not have to worry about where our next meal is coming from or whether we'll be homeless come the first of the month. Of course, for most of us, for most of our lives, The Number is a theoretical figure, far beyond what we currently have in the bank. But according to Eisenberg, we think about the number if only in a \\"take this job and shove it\\" sort of way. The Number is the reason that millions play the state lotteries, hoping to hit The Number the \\"easy\\" way.This book is no lightweight commentary, though. Eisenberg talks seriously about how we compute and how we should compute this number, how it tends to increase if we should actually reach it, and what happens during our mature years when we find ourselves un- or under-employed without having reached The Number. I won't divulge all Eisenberg's secrets (except for a small fee when I'm an independent consultant). It is interesting to read about his journey of discovery about them.In spite of the title, the book is not all about numbers either. Eisenberg recognizes that life is so much more fulfilling if we can retire TO something and not just FROM something. He spills a lot of ink describing how to develop whole life plans not just health and wealth plans. In fact, given our longer, healthier aging years, that may turn out to be the more important aspect once we've dealt with The Number. As part of this analysis, Eisenberg quotes George Kinder who recommends that each of us ask ourselves three questions:1. Assume you have all the money you need for the rest of your life. What would do? How would you live? Let your imagination go.2. You've been diagnosed with a rare disease. You will live perfectly healthy until sometime between 5 and 10 years from now.

It's also honest and sees through so much of the marketing claptrap that's out there. Now my wife's reading it and is finding it just as interesting. Take a look at it."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Look- this book is about ideas, not formulas. I just made an appointment with a Fidelity advisor and I'm motivated.Fidelity is going to be my \\"mother ship\\" in 10 years and I'm driving 2 hours to meet with a field office. The author gave me the idea after his comical discussion on retirement. Also, he brings the humanity into the equation. Thank God somebody has the huevos to bring up the fine points of where we really want to be after slaving for an employer . Living in a planned community is fine for some, but would be purgatory for me and he \\"gets it\\". Thanks Lee- I'm going to pass this book on to one of my buddies."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"If you are expecting an actual financial \\"plan\\" out of this book, this is not the one for you. To the author's credit, there is plenty of those out there anyways. What you do get is a baby boomer looking at the cusp of retirement and his thoughts and research on the issue. Kindof like a memoir more than a financial book. You do get some interesting thoughts about what \\"the number\\" (amount of money you \\"need\\" or \\"want\\" to retire with) really means to people and their perceptions of. This is the most enlightening part of the book, what makes me take a step back and think about what the value of money truly is.The other huge criticism I have is the author's weird east-coast perception of what \\"middle class\\" truly is. One would think since he actually moved to Wisconsin he would get a real perspective on what middle of the road is. Most of the examples he uses apply to a very small percentage of the population - that have a lot of income at their disposal. Just once I would like to see a book only about people making median American income.So, this is worth a trip to the library, but read it along with several other, more practical, financial guides."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Well, this one left me thinking more about the meaning of life than about the Number and who's to say that's a bad thing? If you're expecting a formulaic book, this ain't it. What it is, however, is a thoroughly entertaining way to think about retirement and what will make you happy and content as you glide to that final home base in the sky. This is one of the most entertaining and humorous financial tomes that you will read and you will read it quickly because of Mr. Eisenberg's totally mesmerizing and hilarious perspective on this era and the Baby Boomer era. It reads more like a chat with a close friend over a Starbucks double frappucino. Although I will admit that some chapters got a little dreamy and esoteric, even for me, a Northern California-based hot tubbin', organic wine drinkin' chick of the 70's. No matter, you can sift through the easy going chapters and decide what is relevant for you and what is not.However, if you simply must have \\"the formula\\", Mr.Eisenberg doesn't disappoint because, lo and behold, there it is at the very end of the book on Pg 251. But, and as he cautions, you do yourself a huge disservice if you rely only on the Number and don't include the Satisfaction Factor to get you to the end of your life, comfortably, happily and with no regrets."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Over seventy million baby boomers in this country are only just beginning to realize that old systems of support, from government to private employers, are fading and that new means of discovering retirement needs and funding are needed. THE NUMBER: A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT WAY TO THINK ABOUT THE REST OF YOUR LIFE offers a new approach to the traditional retirement strategy - one which doesn't count on income from other than personal efforts. Here 'the Number' is defined as the amount of money and resources needed to live the retirement lifestyle you want: chapters discover new methods of creating, revising, and achieving this magic Number. Even better, it goes beyond simple math to discuss the underlying values and issues inherent in striving for such a number.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"I listened to the 5CD set on a recent road trip and found The Number entertaining but only informative on 2 points: the existence of super wealthy \\"family offices\\" and the section of how to arrive at the actual number found on the last CD 5 section 24 through the end. The rest was repetitive at moments but often funny. The author did make me stop and reconsider retiring early and put the entire subject into perspective. Hang with it, even if at times he seems to be on a tangent off subject. It's actually valuable info. as the cover advises to listen to this before consulting an advisor to better understand your definition of your number. I would have given 4 stars if not for the intermittent clicking of the reader's gums or dentures as well as the over emphasis on the number angst of the upper middle class to upper class."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The author does a good job explaining why people will not have enough money for retirement and what to do about it. However, he takes a while to get there and if you are impatient go to the end of the book for the formula. Do not expect a magic solution to get rich, but do expect to know what your 'number' will be to make you financially independent and assure that you will not run out of money after you retire.Two basic questions go unexplained.1. The basis for calculating the number is using a 60/40 investment mix of stocks to bonds. However he does not explain what the assumption is for the historial return for that investment mix.2. In the back of the book a component of the formula to calculate your 'number' is to include the equity in your home by dividing the number of years you expect to live after retirement into your equity and using the number as a component for the amount of money you can spend each year after you retire. No where does he explain the rationalization for using your equity as part of the calculation of the 'number' and why the equity is included in the first place. You are left to guess on your own.For me the book yielded no new news, but that is good as I used it as a sanity check for my own retirement planning and confirmed that I am on the right track.Basically the book says if you want to live on a $100K a year (todays dollars), subtract your annual pension, and SS income from $100k. What is left is amount of income you need from your 'number'. Assume you are getting $50K a year from your pension and SS. You therefore need $50K income from your 'number'. Your pension income, SS income and income from your 'number' now add up to $100k. To make your savings last a life time (25-30years)with a confidence factor of 90% or greater you should only take out 4% (another magic number well known in financial planning circles) a year, not including inflation, from your 'number', i.e. nest egg. That means your number or nest egg needs to be $1.25 million from your 401K or other savings. 4% of $1.25million is $50K. Now that is scary stuff. Now you see why so many people will not have enough money for retirement.What! You have no pension or your pension is now frozen. You will need to grow a bigger 'number' by working longer or winning the lottery or inheritance or robbing a bank or all of the above. The alternative is to learn how to retire on less income.The value of the book is showing how much money you need to have for retirement for the lifestyle you want. It is not a how-to investment book. I feel most of the reviews are missing the point of the book."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"First, the Number is not a calculator. That's the point. It's really about the question that so many of us try to figure out: \\"If I could stop working for money, what would that look like? How do I get there?\\" It's an exercise in self-knowing.It's also one of the most stylish and well written books in the field. I wouldn't put this in the category of personal finance books but more in the Bill Bryson category of knowing, sly, and witty (but also informed) stories of a social obsession. Highly recommended to get you thinking while you laugh and shake your head. You'll find yourself in this book."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This book is both entertaining and thought-provoking. It's a quick read and the author's constant insertion of wit and clever turn-of-phrase keep it light-hearted. As a retirement planning guide, it is noticeably lacking in concrete advice. It really does not tell you where to invest or how much. The book is really more philosophical than financial. The author argues that there is more to a successful retirement than amassing a large stash of money. With life-spans ever increasing, many of us will spend a quarter or more of our lives in retirement. Having enough money to fund those years is certainly important, but there is also the question of what to do with those years, besides just waiting for them to end. I've read other retirement books and been to the major retirement planning websites and met with financial planners, but the point is well taken. No one has ever asked me what I want to do with the rest of my life. I planned for college in high school, graduate school while in college and my career while in graduate school. I have detailed plans for advancing my career. I can tell you with some precision what I hope to achieve this year or in the next five or the next ten. This book made me realize that I really have no idea what to do the day after my last day of work. And while many planners will confabulate a \\"number\\" of dollars you need to retire with financial security, these numbers are very dependant upon what you want to do with your time. If your goal for retirement is spending time at your mortgage-free beach house and soaking up the sun while you relax, you won't need as much money as if your goal is to travel the world. And if your goal is to travel the world, there are various ways of doing this at various expense levels. The fundamental question isn't as much of how much money you have or need as to what you want to do with the next phase of life. The author urges you to address this question first. Once you have an idea of what you hope to do and accomplish, you have a basis for establishing a plan for achieving it (and, of course, financing it.) Approaching retirement with no plan is probably a recipe for disappointment. This book failed to give me any answers, but it did prompt me to start asking myself a different set of questions. The author could have achieved this more concisely. However, a few dozen clever puns, double entendre, and witticisms, make this book entertaining even at this length and decidely worth the small investment of time and money it takes to read it."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"Reading this book is like watching a movie where you spend the entire time waiting for the good part that must be surely must be coming but never quite materializes.

Trying to figure out how much $ one needs to retire based not just on costs of basic necessities but also taking into account the lifestyle one hopes to achieve.However, I didn't find it well-written. He rambles, he throws in all kinds of random information and interviews around, but without really making a coherent, linear argument.And, good heavens! Everyone he talks to and all his own thought processes seem to lead to one conclusion: a person needs many millions of dollars in savings to retire in any kind of comfort.And you know, maybe he's right, but I'm not sure it's very helpful to his readers. I mean, surely the people who are capable of both earning and saving $10million dollars don't need a book, and the rest of us... well, does being told, \\"your life will end terribly if you don't put aside at least $3million\\" really help us to achieve that goal?"},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"This book is simply not worth your time.

I like the idea of acquiring what some call \\"screw-you money\\", or the amount of money you need to be free from financial intimidation by various parties, most notably your employer.But this book has problems:1) It's not new. You can get much better information reading any of Suze Orman's books.2) It's not funny. The author tries to be cute with sarcastic word-plays that are painfully bad and distracting. I got the audiobook and even in his own voice, the jokes come off sounding like he's annoyed and disdainful of the issues he's talking about.3) It's not helpful. After hours of listening, he tells you that there is no easy answer for \\"The Number\\". You have to study (other people's material) and come to your own conclusion. And you should probably talk to a financial planner too. Thanks Lee.People who have never considered retirement planning may get something out of it, but if you're like most Amazonians who are always looking for a new edge, this will be well below your expectations.This is one of those books that I kept listening to because I thought it had to get better based on the positive reviews, but it was painful and I was so relieved when I finished it.I don't even know how this got published. He's an ex-NYC publishing executive, so he must have some friends in high places who pushed this through. My guess is that he's decided that he's going to spend 'retirement', working on his number as an author, but I will NEVER buy another one of his books.Take my advice and avoid this book, or at least wait until you can get it used or from a library."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"In this book, Eisenberg attempts to have readers look more closely at \\"the number,\\" i.e. that amount of money that will be necessary for a person to feel comfortable in retirement. The examined life is worth living, but this book adds little beyond some cute stories. It neither does a good job of telling readers how to do determine or reach \\"the number\\", nor does it help much with the bigger point, i.e. that retirement is more than money.

From his own experience and informal interviews with acquaintances, Eisenberg developed this entire book largely around how much people need or think that they need to retire (the Number).Be warned that the author has no experience or expertise as a financial or counseling practitioner and the book, financially speaking, is quite narrow in scope. It doesn't deal with the vast array of financial challenges and obstacles that most people face.Eisenberg worries readers with dire warnings about Social Security drying up and the undependable stock market, which can halve in value as it did in the early 2000s. I doubt most readers will find this book useful or enlightening."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"The Number was recommended to me by an attorney friend of mine (former rugby player, with impeccable judgment). The sub-title of the book is \\"A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life\\".The title refers to what \\"NUMBER\\" you need (the lump sum amount of money) to live the type of life you want to live, as you pass middle age and head off to a retired or slowed down lifestyle. So it's a financial planning book - sort of. Because it also spends lots of time talking about \\"Life Planning\\". How do you REALLY want to live the rest of your life? So it's also a self-help book - sort of.This is a quick and interesting read. The author, Lee Eisenberg is glib and can be humorous. It starts off with some personal anecdotes by the author, who was in his mid-fifties when he wrote The Number. He goes on about our expanded life expectancies, some of life's uncertainties, the pending social security and medicare problems, stuff like that. He interviews quite a number of financial planners, shows some model situations (a family named \\"Case\\") and offers some sensible ideas, which you've probably already heard if you've studied up on retirement.But Eisenberg seems most interested in \\"life planning\\", as in what are your priorities, what values are important to you, what is your Bliss, who is your Guru? He interviews some financial planners who've morphed into \\"Life Planners\\" (some of them oddballs) and attends one of their conferences. New Age psycho-babble pops up (Eisenberg capitalizes things like \\"The Rest of Your Life\\") but it's all fun and (dare I say) a bit aging yuppish.I would never have read this book if it hadn't been recommended to me, and I'm glad it was. But, if you are just looking for financial planning books, there are better ones out there, starting with one Eisenberg mentions, \\"The Only Investment Guide You'll Ever Need\\" by Andrew Tobias.

It was part a cautionary tale about the finances, although there are others pitching that (see Ben Stein at Yahoo, for example.)

The first 75% of the book offers retirement basics, including a selection of insights from financial planners. Throughout, it reads well, in a breezy magazine style, no surprise given author Lee Eisenberg's illustrious career at Esquire. But be patient: the richest meat of the book is near the end where he gets more specific about how much money you need to retire, and how to live both well and purposefully. The book's suggestions about how big a nest egg you must hatch to live well during retirement are mostly directed at those who are already pretty comfy. Eisenberg also offers insights on purposeful living, \\"a completely different way to think about the rest of your life.\\" We find that financially savvy readers can skim the fiscal advice, while those who are unfamiliar with retirement financial planning could read it more slowly (though not as the last word on the subject). While you are pondering feathering your nest for the long term, you may want to give more attention to Eisenberg's thoughts on purpose than to his thoughts on payoffs."},{"Title":"The Number: A Completely Different Way to Think About the Rest of Your Life","review":"At first glance, one might expect \\"The Number\\" to magically proclaim an absolute formula or all the information one needs in order to figure out just how much money they need to retire and be secure in the knowledge they can continue the kind of lifestyle to which they are accustomed or improve the one they have that just isn't what they've envisioned for themselves. However, such is not the case, nor do I think that was the author's intent. It's an easy read, that broaches a topic most would like to avoid and few would even consider talking about in public or with their children. I found it enlightening and also an inspiration to rethink my own plans for the future and do more now to prepare for later as well as share the information with my children to give them the head-start I didn't have. By reading \\"The Number\\" I became aware of how little we talk finances with our teen and young adult children. That in not discussing the topic of finances openly we are doing them a disservice. Also in reading \\"The Number\\" in front of my family it served as a great way to introduce the subject of money and finances on a less stressful note. By sharing excerpts with them it opened up some thought provoking of discussions as well as forming some financial plans as a family and putting them into action. In so doing, my husband and I also started re-thinking our number and making some financial decisions for our future with much less stress and agony we've ever had when the topic of finances has come up. Mr. Eisenberg has written about a timeless and important topic in such a way that even someone such as myself who dreads discussing finances, was able to sit down and really give some thought to where my life is heading and how to get where I want to be!"},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"&quot;My Lord Eternity&quot; is the second installment in Debbie Raleigh's vampire trilogy, and while much of it was 'a-bit-of-the-same' especially if you've only recently read &quot;My Lord Vampire,&quot; this second Immortal Rogues book still makes for absorbing reading because of the authour's character portrayals.To recapitulate: all the vampires have been living peacefully behind the Veil (a reality that was created by the most powerful and wisest of vampires, Nefri, with the help of a powerful Medallion), for the past 200 years. Now, certain renegade vampires have left the Veil and have ventured back into the mortal world in order to find the Medallion. These renegades want to force the vampires back into the mortal world, and they also want to wield the enormous power that would come to them if they possessed the Medallion. Obtaining the Medallion however will not be so easy. For Nefri, sensing their evil intent, had divided the Medallion into three and had given the three pieces to three different mortal maidens. She has bound these maidens to the Medallions so that the Medallions can never be forcibly taken from them. Only the women have the power to give their amulets freely to whomsoever they chose. Now that ladies are being threatened by these renegade vampires, it is up to the three champion vampires, chosen by the Great Council, to protect these ladies and the Medallions. &quot;My Lord Eternity&quot; focuses on the vampire Lucien Valin, and his struggle to keep safe the lady he's been assigned to protect, the vulnerable yet fiercely independent Jocelyn Kingly.Miss Jocelyn Kingly spends much of her time and money trying to help those less fortunate than her. A sudden hole in her pocketbook however forces Jocelyn to do the unthinkable: take in a lodger. Her lodger just happens to be Lucien Valin, an incredibly handsome but aggravating and arrogant man who keeps insisting on insinuating himself into her life. But when a mad killer, loose on the London streets starts stalking her, Jocelyn cannot deny just how thankful she is to have Lucien in her corner, even if he has slipped through the careful armour she has protected herself with. And having suffered pain and betrayal once before, Jocelyn cannot help but fear what this fascination and dependence on Lucien will cost her...Even though Lucien knows that other vampires see him s a careless and frippery sort of fellow, he never doubted his ability to protect the lady he had been assigned and the Medallion in her keeping. That is until he met Jocelyn Kingly and fell for her beauty, intelligence and integrity. Now he fears that his feelings for Jocelyn will get in the way of his mission, even as he fears what will happen when Jocelyn learns that he is a vampire. Will Jocelyn and Lucien overcome their fears and confide in each other? Will Jocelyn turn from him in disgust? Or will she understand that in spite of what and who he is, that his love for her is true and eternal?As I noted before what makes &quot;My Lord Vampire&quot; a truly compelling read is the manner in which Debbie Raleigh fleshes out the characters of Jocelyn and Lucien. Both characters have doubts about their capabilities, the authour shows us this as well as how both characters are actually strong and true in their own right. The attraction that both Lucien and Jocelyn feel for each other is fairly palpable and if it wasn't for my own particular inclination to dislike Lucien's arrogant overpowering ways (and his rather idiotic habit of referring to Jocelyn as 'my dove'), I might have found the book to be a more romantic read. However, also brilliantly done was the authour's vivid portrayal of the villainous vampire who's hunting Jocelyn. So that on the whole, I'd have to say that &quot;My Lord Eternity&quot; was a good and compelling read that should not be overlooked, esp if you're a fan of the vampire genre."},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"and I come down in the middle. It's a decent read and keeps the reader involved in the story, despite a few annoyances (like &quot;my dove&quot;). Yes, Lucien is arrogant, but that's typical of most romances; he is, nevertheless, humorous and full of joie de vivre, and those qualities made him likeable for me. Jocelyn is a strong heroine, and the villain's use of her good works as a lure and a torment is effective. Lucien is very protective of her with regards to her family as well.An interesting side note on this series is that it's fairly innocent, making it appropriate for more mature teens. I actually read these books to approve them for my daughter. No, they're not Julia Quinn or Teres Medeiros, but I have also read many that are much worse (one of which was written by Lisa Kleypas). So take it as a light read and enjoy a few hours with a nice vampire."},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I bought this book along with My Lord Vampire and My Lord Immortality because they were cheap and a quick read. Or so I thought. I found it hard to continue because it was much like the first book My Lord Vampire!Same strong-willed, independent woman with a cruel family , same arrogant , tall , handsome, aquiline nosed hero. Every guy I think is handsome doesn't have an aquiline nose. Even the villians were the same . Same dumb tricks to get the Medallion , turning into mist , cutting Lucien the same as Gideon !The authors overuse of the word \\"countenance \\" is very annoying. She could have simply said face or features a few times but countenance was used everytime. Almost as much as \\" my dove\\". I am not going to read My Lord Eternity because I am sure it's the same as the other two."},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"After the painful read that was this author's first vampire romance, I decided to give her another chance and read the second book in the trilogy. Now I'm starting to suspect that I'm a masochist.Nearly every problem the author had with her first book, she also had in this one. Bad character development, bad plot, no description, and absolutely no reason for the heroine, Jocelyn, to fall in love with Lucien, a.k.a. Tall, Tawny and Egotistical.To be absolutely fair, the author has improved slightly since her last book, or maybe she just got lucky. Lucien is a touch more interesting than the hero in the first book and Jocelyn is truly an independent woman, fighting her own battles. However, Lucien is still horribly overbearing and full of himself. It's hard to understand why Jocelyn didn't just put a stake through his heart instead of marrying him.Therein lies another problem. Jocelyn weathered scandal and rejection from cold, unfeeling parents to become the version of Mother Theresa that she is now. She goes out alone at night in the slums to help the hopeless, homeless and hapless. A woman out alone who's never had any problems until the Big Bad Evil Vampire comes along? Highly doubtful. Not to say that Jocelyn isn't a strong woman, she is, but all that strength just dries up and vanishes when Lucien comes into the picture. Suddenly she's leaning on him for everything and independence is a thing of the past. She puts up a token fight, but at one point he literally says that she \\"belongs to him\\" and she's just thrilled to accept that. Most readers today will feel like giving her a good shake to put some sense into her.Lucien is very much the kind of guy you'll find in any college bar today. Sure of himself and his irresistibility and unable to conceive of the fact that a woman might not want him. He's constantly in Jocelyn's personal space, touching and kissing her, just like a drunken frat guy. His constant references to Jocelyn as \\"my dove\\" only give credence to the inebriated college boy comparison. He kind of has the same appeal too, attractive and rakish, but no one in their right minds would want to marry him.The villain, Amadeus, is one of the biggest plot holes in the book. This is supposed to be a super-intelligent, evil vampire, but the reader learns very little about him. The \\"experiments\\" he does on humans are glossed over, only one example being presented. Much more description was called for there to make his evil believable. His intelligence is also called into question at the end. The \\"trick\\" Lucien uses to free Jocelyn is probably one of the lamest things ever attempted, and if Amadeus were really that intelligent, he wouldn't have fallen for it. He also would've seen Jocelyn's \\"trick\\" coming a mile away. There are rocks with more intelligence than Amadeus.As in the author's previous book, the world of vampires behind the veil sounds mind-numbingly boring. Amadeus can't be blamed for wanting to get out of there. Even Lucien found it dull, at one point turning the library into a harem. Which, by the way, directly contradicts many of the things the author has said about this world. According to her, everyone there lives in peace, free from passions and happy to pursue a life of scholarly study. Well, apparently that didn't apply to the three vampires who escaped, or Lucien who was quite obviously not happy there. And if there was no passion, exactly what did Lucien fill this \\"harem\\" with? Scantily clad books? Continuity is not the author's strong point.Once again, if you're looking for a good vampire romance, skip this one. It's better than some out there, but it's still pretty bad stuff."},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"Other reviewers have complained about the overuse of 'countenance' and 'my dove' and they're right. I'm reading this book right now and I'm having problems with the overuse of 'maiden'. It is so bad that I am beginning to count how many times 'maiden' appears on one page. And obviously, the plot is not strong enough to hold my attention. The author even refers to a prostitute as a maiden. If Jocelyn was ruined (which I believe is why her parents shunned her), how can she be considered a maiden? Whenever the author refers to Jocelyn, it's 'the maiden' this and 'the maiden' that. Come on already! Maybe she should get a good dictionary to discover the meaning of the word. I think a thesaurus would serve her well too. I'm only on chapter 5 and I'm thinking of throwing in the towel on this one...I don't know that I can make it through to the end. I read My Lord Vampire, the first book in this series and gave it 3 stars. I didn't notice the annoying overuse of certain words in that book. I think I'll fold up my tent on this one.I have the third book in the series 'My Lord Immortality' and from what I'm reading in the reviews, the plot is better, but one reviewer says she'll scream if she hears the word 'maiden' one more time! LOL....you can't win, no matter what you do!"},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"I'm not one for romances, but this was a bargain price at the local going-out-of-business bookstore. I figured at the price it was, even if it was a horrible, bodice ripping nightmare, I would still have something to occupy me for a couple hours. I was actually pleasantly surprised to find it a decent read.When I bought this I didn't realize it was the second novel in a series, so maybe I'm missing a few of the finer points that someone who's read the first novel would catch. However, I was reasonably pleased to see a strong female heroine that didn't just fall for the hero right off the bat. Jocelyn has an inner strength to her that was believable; I could see how a woman who was once caught up in scandal would choose to devote her life to people who were in much more dire straits. I also liked that her \\"tainted past\\" actually shows up in the novel as a plot point, instead of a footnote, although the scandal seemed awfully tame. Maybe I read too many romance novels, but I actually expected them to be caught in a compromising position pointing towards sex, instead of something amounting to a few kisses behind a bush.I do have several complaints about this book, which make it difficult for me to enjoy fully. The first is word usage, Raleigh tends to use the same words over and over. Lucien always calls Jocelyn \\"My dove.\\" I use pet names for the people I care for as well, but never the same one over and over again. I half expected her to grow feathers and fly away from being calledf a dove over and over again. My other word choice complaint is maiden, Jocelyn has a cottage in the country set aside for maidens she's rescued from the dregs of the city. These maidens are often prostitutes, or women who have been in bad relationships. I'd hardly call these women maidens.My other complaints tie in together. First, the concept of vampires in this novel is lackluster at best. These vampires are more immortals with the ability to share their immortality than real vampires. At some point Lucien explains they only have to drink blood if they succumb to the bloodlust. To me, Raleigh could have thrown out the vampire idea totally and simply made them immortal, with a similar affect. The villain Amadeus, is fairly one dimensional, and instead of fleshing him out to make him believable, we get a villain who claims it's all for knowledge, but isn't very believable. He's not much of a vampire either, and even though the back cover speaks of him being a Vicar trying to \\"help\\" Jocelyn, he makes a few token appearances, and sends his lackeys in his absence.Overall, for the price, it's not too bad of a read, but I would have liked more developed villains, and less vampires. Vampire fiction might be the hot item right now, but saying it's a vampire when it's not misleads people."},{"Title":"My Lord Eternity (Zebra Regency Romance)","review":"As the 2nd in a series it has new information and kept the first info correct.

Wordiness, especially to someone unfamiliar with many of the more complex topics in electromagnetics, is only beneficial.Later in the book Balanis includes very basic discussions on the Method of Moments, which are pretty much cut-and-paste from his antenna book.

However, the Balanis text does something the others doesnt. It covers a great deal of ground and puts the multitude of equations into a 'BOX' for easy reference. And all these equations are derived in a very straight forward fashion so a person can remember them and understand their basis. Most texts have the equations all over the place and when trying to solve problems you wonder where to look next. Not so with Balanis.

The author clearly presents all of the math that he uses and does a fantastic job of using illustrations to highlight key information. Make no mistake, the subject matter is quite difficult, but the methodology used by the author is clear and well-explained. Furthermore, Balanis rewrites equations from previous chapters and sections when he refers to them, so you do not have to break your concentration by flipping back and forth to other parts of the text. The author's use of worked-through examples is also a huge help.The only negative thing that I've heard about this book is that sometimes you can lose sight of the big picture amidst all of the math that's presented. My belief is that there are many sources of basic concepts available to students, but a thorough derivation of electromagnetic mathematics is quite rare. Furthermore, the author provides a nice summary in most chapters to remind readers what they should have learned about in that section.Many of my friends have used Jackson's book for advanced E&M;, and owning both, I can say that I prefer to learn from Balanis, but refer to Jackson once I've learned a topic since I feel his explanations are sometimes more concise.

Many reviews state it gave a helpful approach to EE.My background is EE and I found this book to be a great reference for my graduate EM classes. Although, coming from EE, I found it difficult to simply read this book and understand the concepts. He writes in a physics fashion and uses wordings that are unnecessary. To put it simply, he uses big words when he doesn't need to. He also uses a unit system uncommon in EE (at least in my experience).For my fellow EEs, I would suggest a book by Pozar, who attacks EM from an EE point of view. After learning the concepts from Pozar, reference Balanis to fully understand the topic. This is the process I used while studying EM.Another book I would suggest is \\"International series in pure and applied physics,slater and frank - electromagnetism\\".

It was very well written,informative and concise. I'm looking forward to reading more from Mr. Taylor."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Taylor does a good job pointing out and documenting things like double standards in the media, movies, etc in how blacks are portrayed in an overly positive light compared to reality. Also how if a violent crime occurs and the victim is black and the perpetrator white it often becomes a a national hysteria, whereas black on white crimes, which are staggeringly more common are buried if not out and out intentionally covered up. He points out all the typical things that these respectable quasi racists talk about, affirmative action, unfair hiring practices, academic/leftist hypocrisy, etc.Here's where I have a problem with Taylor. He, as is typical of right wingers, both racial, and non racial, big on whining about welfare and social programs. Well I live in a Scandinavian country that puts a lot of money into social programs and I've seen firsthand how they benefit a society if you have a society where the majority isn't complete scum. The biggest thing though is Taylor is completely detached from working class white people. He is Yale educated and grew up going to private schools in Japan and I believe France also. He is totally out of touch with how life is for poor, working and middle class whites. He is more or less trying to sell himself off to upper class whites and conservative Jews. There is no criticism of capitalism in this book and of course he doesn't dare say the \\"J\\" word or claim that what is going on is intentional social engineering from the highest levels of society. Its all the just misguided leftists setting government policies and caving in to system controlled black rabblerousers like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton that are the problem in his world. If your not a stiff right winger I would recomend Jim Goads Redneck Manifesto way before anything written by the Jared Taylors or Pat Buchanans of the world."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Answer: It isn't. Despite the fact that I eschew his \\"values\\" Jared Taylor is not an inarticulate writer nor is his writing boring what is clear is that he fails to lay even partial responsibility for an uncivilised United States society at the feet of European Americans where it ultimately belongs. His brand of panacea for the racialist claims to preach \\"separatism.\\" Separatism is also often confused with supremacy, many new style racialists claim. They will even argue that many \\"kindhearted\\" Whites who want to give illegal aliens in this country the opportunity to work, are themselves supremacists. They are the ones who view certain occupations as beneath them and therefore better fit for a \\"lowly Mexican.\\" In a non-hypocritical world, a separatist thinks all the jobs that need doing, in a workable nation, need to be done by members of their own tribe/race/culture etc yet Taylor never points this out!Taylor seems more concerned with pointing out where his take on Nietzsche and eugenics falls when applied to non-whites as opposed to building his dream home in the Pacific Northwest away from the supposed \\"swarthy hordes\\" who are sweeping upwards in countless numbers from Antarctica. He overlooks the fact that the Vietnam War, easily the biggest mistake ever made by the US, literally destroyed the Shriver's war on poverty domestically which was successfully moving poor people of al races away from the haze of the ensuing dead end of welfare culture.Taylor and ilk would argue that separatism is reflexively scorned by the media and the \\"intellectual\\" class. Often said detractors as well as anti-racists are supposedly confusing it with segregation and Apartheid where one cultural group shares a nation with another cultural group but the one group is labelled as second-class and treated accordingly. Taylor seems to say that separatism gives each of these groups, tribes if you will, their OWN nation to govern as they please. However, that was already attempted in the Jim Crow South and separatist white America and congress (the Rankins, Bilbos and Dies etc) saw it as a free for all opportunity to exploit and oppress. He overlooks the sociological implications if this as well.What Taylor failed to do in this book was putting the issue of race in a larger context: What, after all, are the essential qualities in a given historian on race that heighten the chances for understanding such a complex and emotional subject? Who is best qualified to decipher the historical fact from the pseudo science-and why? Whatever your answer may be, it is unequivocally true that Taylor is biased to an almost fantastical degree, very unwilling to take people as individuals and worst of all, he consistently refuses to hold Europeans responsible for their grave moral transgressions and continued ethnic cleansing. Yes, ethnic cleansing is occuring in non-white societies as we speak but this is about the \\"white race\\" and it's place in the world as well.The day that he deigns to look at the mistakes of colonization, segregation, covert war, Reaganomics, the white middle and upper classes farming out a generation to daycare enmasse , etc etc then he'll be able to argue his point with at least some validity. Does me not notice that most of the nation's white \\"educated\\" elite check out for 60 hours a week while mostly people of colour raise their children? Go to any Starbucks in wealthy area and look at the nannies if you want to augment the racial data in this book. Taylor is all too eager to historically marginalize people of colour for what he perceives as their shortcomings and atrocities and for having what he seems to perceive as de-evolutionary genetic traits yet role calls little to no failures of European Americans. It's as if they assume no responsibility in the scheme of things for ANY of their actions and are either \\"brainwashed\\" by an imagined \\"Jewish media conspiracy\\" or yearning to be more racist deep down inside yet are unfulfilled...Finally, after growing up in both one of the wealthiest and later in one of the poorest white cities in the United States, it is clear that when you are born into money and wealth your road is laid out for you. I watched dozens of wealthy white kids do drugs, deal drugs, act like animals and segue into adulthood on Trustrafarian welfare; perhaps one could call it guilt money? In turn, many white kids in the poorer rural community acted much the same way but were forced into dead end jobs, meth dealing and generational poverty without the free handouts from their parents once high school ended for them. I fail to see why Taylor overlooks this part of America or the obvious fact that class and poverty SHOULD be a reason for quotas for ALL races. Whites need to demand inclusion in diversity programmes not call for there elimination. Many whites need help from the system financially and should ask for it freely without any shame.I give this two stars only because it is important to read the odd opinions of the very radical right circa early 21st century for historical perspective. There are simply too many \\"blame based\\" arguments for me to give it higher rating despite the fact he writes very well."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Judging from the positive reviews Paved with Good Intentions has garnered, author Jared Taylor has succeeded in repackaging his racist and white supremacist views in a format more palatable to mainstream readers.

Amazon.com shopper deserve better."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"This book is one of many that emerged in the early to mid-1990&#65533;s concerning issues of political correctness, race, and immigration. I read several of these books; Dinesh D&#65533;Souza and Martin Gross are the first that come to mind. David Horowitz is another who covers these issues in some of his writings. These books are still important because even though we don&#65533;t hear about these issues as much today, they are even now stalking the American landscape. Jared Taylor&#65533;s book seems to be the best one I have read to date. &#65533;Paved with Good Intentions,&#65533; written in 1991, is Taylor&#65533;s manifesto on the corrosive and divisive issue of race relations in modern America.&#65533;Paved with Good Intentions&#65533; is not a racist tract, but is a calm, expertly documented approach to the race question. Taylor writes with neutral reasoning as he covers every aspect of the problem. Taylor&#65533;s purpose is not to denounce blacks and other minority groups, but rather to open a dialogue on an issue that threatens to destroy the country. I don&#65533;t think anyone denies that race is a big problem in America. Taylor explains that this is the result of obfuscation by guilty whites, fast buck hustlers, and misguided do-gooders who have more to gain from racial tension than peace.Some of things you will discover while reading this book:Crime: blacks commit the vast majority of crime, with most of the crimes directed towards other blacks. Far more racial crimes occur when blacks victimize whites&#65533;especially rape, which is overwhelming black against white. The media tends to play up crimes where the perpetrator is white and the victim black, while downplaying (or just plain ignoring) racial crimes committed by blacks against whites.Affirmative action is bad: economic policy favors minorities and excludes whites. Minorities get breaks in education, business, housing, hiring, and a host of other areas. Instead of raising the living standards of blacks, affirmative action has worked to instill in blacks a hatred of whites, while making little difference in the lives of many poor blacks. Schools exclude better qualified whites in preference for minority students. Many of the under qualified students end up dropping out of school when they discover they lack the necessary skills to compete. Entrance tests to schools and jobs have been altered, or dumbed down, in an effort to raise test scores. This occurs in important occupations (police, firefighting) where the best people are needed, but are not getting the jobs.Racism: there is a constant cry of racism over the most ridiculous issues. Like &#65533;Peter and the Wolf,&#65533; these constant cries desensitize the public and cost minorities credibility. Taylor does an excellent job revealing the truth about racism, namely, that it doesn&#65533;t exist in the levels that it once did. The claim of &#65533;institutional racism&#65533; is shown to be a falsehood, to say the least. Taylor shows that government agencies employ a large percentage of blacks, which are unlikely to engage in any sort of institutional racist programs. Claims that AIDS or drugs are a racist conspiracy by whites to destroy blacks are equally fallacious. According to Taylor, if whites are so bent on destroying blacks, why would they waste time using methods that cause harm to the white community? Why would they waste billions of dollars to improve minority positions in society?Jared Taylor doesn&#65533;t hate minorities. His writing shows a real concern for these issues. He seems to want a return to Martin Luther King&#65533;s idea of a colorblind society, an idea that is subverted daily by those who seek to profit from racial animosity. Until an open, honest dialogue emerges, these problems will only get worse. I think for many people really don&#65533;t understand the full picture when it comes to this issue. Books like this could open eyes when voters find out what the politicians are really up to in Washington. I recommend this book to those amongst us who have an open mind, and to those who want to start thinking for themselves."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Jared Taylor has taken sober aim at one of this country's most intractible social ills: the dissonance between justice and equality in a free society. Too often, our system is found to be badly out of focus with regard to fairness as well as fact. Mr. Taylor skillfully documents this time and again with failure after failure on the part of the &quot;equality of opportunity&quot; industry, academia, government, workplace, and media. Still, as Mr. Taylor mentions in the introduction, this is a hopeful book, replete with honest conclusions and recommendations in a cogent epilougue.This book will sadden, shock, infuriate, and validate many a reader. More still will be called to examine the myths of the so-called civil rights movement as it currently exists in America. It is often unpleasant reading, but paradoxically it is a page-turner; the truth often has this quality about it. I recommended this book to all my friends upon finishing it. Even if you are a dyed in the wool liberal (or perhaps especially if you are) you owe it to yourself to read this book.I'm saddened by the difficulty Mr. Taylor has encountered in publishing and selling this book. Perhaps America is not ready for the truth in such a straightforward way as it is presented here. This is truly a visionary work."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Jared Taylor discusses the failure of race relations in the United States, in this carefully written, scholarly work, in which he cites case after case, time after time when the government mandates and court orders have failed to gain the desired result.This is not some wild-eyed, white power, white supremacist talking. Taylor's approach is thoughtful, reasoned, and hard to reproach.He discusses racism, from both sides, and including its accusatory use as a weapon of intimidation. He discusses the failures of Affirmative Action, and double standards, and the permanent underclass, and the fact that equality before the law is no longer even a concept, and possible solutions.This is a good book. His other book, 'The Real American Dilemma,' is also worth your time.Joseph Pierre,Author of THE ROAD TO DAMASCUS: Our Journey Through Eternity"},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"This one of those very few books that I want my son to read before finishing high school. It debunks the current consensus on race relations in this country, and provides fact after fact, footnote after footnote, and source after source to back up it's assertions. No empty rhetoric here! On the contrary, it is a well-researched, well documented work. In a communication I had with the author, he stated that writing it was not the hard part, getting it published was. He mentions that many publishers, worried about public outcry, stated that the only way they could publish such a book was if the author was black.

As Thomas Jefferson said, \\"Nothing is more certain than that these people shall be free; and being free these two people cannot live under the same government.\\"As Taylor demonstrates, 150 years after slavery blacks and European Americans have proven incapable of living together. Yes I too believed that race problems were just caused by mis-understandings, but as Taylor shows the problems go much deeper to the point that we must agree to disagree and go our seperate ways.As hard as it is to accept, we must embrace the horror that integration has destroyed this country. This is not a conclusion Taylor arrives at lightly nor would I ever have reached it if not for his book.Some conservatives wine about Taylor being a bit extreme and warned me about this book. But by the end I agree with Taylor 100%.Taylor is a ver talented writer. It moves smoothly yet quickly I was suprised how fast I finished it.If you are unsure of his writing style try reading, 'The Color of Crime' which is free online at many web sites."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"The intrepid author presents a sound, fact filled, case explaining the seemingly incurable &quot;Negro Problem.&quot; The book isn't a hodgepodge of KKK or white Nazi rantings. It is a book of facts. Typical are facts regarding black college degrees. Blacks tend to get degrees in the easiest majors- sociology, social work, government management, teaching- and get very few degrees in the more difficult disciplines like mathematics and the sciences (some school years, zero blacks graduate with Mathematics degrees). However, Taylor does little to explain the black man's problems in adapting to the Information Age. Agricultural workers for most of their time in America, blacks adapted poorly to industrialization and, if not for affirmative action, would adapt poorly to the information age. Blacks have had success in sports, entertainment and government but the first two are accessible to only the very talented or very lucky of any race. Government, especially with the black political takeover of scores of big cities, is the great economic refuge of the blacks today and a major reason why the black middle class is so much bigger today than, say, in 1968 when Martin Luther King was murdered. Mr. Taylor does do a good job explaining the black dependence on government largesse. Why are blacks so Democratic? Because the government furnishes middle class employment on one end and alms for the economically incompetent on the other end. Mr. Taylor discredits affirmative action without explaining specifically why blacks instinctively know that affirmative action is vital to their economic well-being. One needs to read between the lines to comprehend that Taylor knows how dependent blacks are on affirmative action. Mr. Taylor is somewhat disingenuous when he challenges blacks to quit hiding behind affirmative action and better themselves by competing with other Americans without the bootstrap of affirmative action. Strong black intellects like Thomas Sowell and Walter Williams may not need affirmative action but most blacks quite rightly realize that their economic status would decline if they had to compete head-to-head with white and orientals. I feel sure Mr.Taylor knows this but he, like Pat Buchanan, must use this line of argument to attack affirmative action. Declaring oneself against affirmative action because it is explicitely anti-white would open the door to being condemned as a racist and nobody in public affairs can allow that label to be pinned on himself no matter how bright you are. The flaws of this book are easily outnumbered by its virtues. Buy this book. Tell your family to read it. Tell your friends to read it."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"I heard Mr. Taylor on a talk radio station some years ago and became interested in this book. This book not only is a great read which I was not able to put down, but also contains fascinating information on the taboo subject of racial differences. Read if you dare!"},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"An excellent book. The Author debunks the myth that affirmative action is beneficial to those who are given preferential treatment in order to &quot;level the playing field&quot;. He analyzes the claims of the &quot;Black Leaders&quot; and liberals that Western Culture is institutionally racist (in both the economic arena and the judicial process) against African Americans and uses statistical data to refute the claims. He clearly points out (again using facts, logic and statistical data) that the &quot;underclass&quot; status of minorities has more to do with the disintegration of the family unit (illegitimacy is reaching record highs in the black community) as opposed to the myth of a racist nature of western culture. Further, he observes that the liberal policies in society today have encouraged the breakdown of the black family unit thereby exacerbating the problem to epidemic proportions. This book is a bane to those anointed liberals who believe that they have the exclusive answers to the racial issues in this culture. They don't realize that they and their programs have done more damage to the African American male stature in American Society than the Klan could have ever hoped to do. Read this book with an open mind and you won't be disappointed. If you are a liberal, don't waste your money, this book will only confuse you with logic and facts. However, it you appreciate the wisdom of such noted Black thinkers like Thomas Sowell, Walter Williams, Clarence Thomas and Larry Elder, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"The fact that this book is written by a relatively unknown writer and published by a solid, but non-establishment publishing company means that few people have or will hear about it. That's too bad, because it is almost painfully well reported, carefully argued, and thoroughly packed with facts, not opinions. It is a shocker, a real shocker. Taylor lays bare the double-talk and obfuscation that so thickly covers the issue of race in America, but he does so without rhetoric, even though his editorial point of view is both clear and determined. The never-before-told stories of ordinary people both black and white who have suffered under our thirty year regime of political correctness and blindness in the area of race, make this book hauntingly powerful."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"We can almost all agree that--in our society--racism is an evil, just like drug abuse is an evil. But how to combat it? Taylor shows that the way we have chosen to combat it, through statist policies, is ineffective, creates pernicious unintended consequences, and leads to a creeping totalitarianism, where those who merely speak out against the policies face ostracism and punishment. This book provides one of the best contemporary illustrations of Friedrich Hayek's thesis that using the state to further \\"social justice\\" will destroy the foundations of a free society."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"A politically incorrect book from start to finish.

The fact of the matter is that black immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean earn more then whites and their children do better in school then whites. Racists do not differentiate between black Americans and Caribbean and African blacks. In addition, Asians do better economically and educationally then blacks even if they immigrant to this country knowing little or no English! Racisist notions such as banks not giving credits to blacks is not held up when asians are taken into consideration because asians get approved more then whites and no one is saying the banking system is biased in the favor Asians. Jared Taylor does a really good job tackling the ideas of affirmative action and double standards and how they are interfearing with the idea of being color-blind (which was the point of the civil rights movements) by saying that we need to judge people differently on the basis of race and that people cannot be judged against people of other races but only of people of their own race."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Other reviewers have done a great job of describing, in detail, the merits of this book. I would suggest to those reading these reviews that rarely is such a book given the opportunity of even being published. That is a straight forward, in your face, example of the power of the liberal media. Jared Taylor deserves our support and thanks for his efforts to persevere over the dark forces which would deprive us all of the knowledge contained therein. Information, along with thoughtful analysis, can overcome the prejudices of the inferior. You won't get this kind of honest analysis in most venues.

Lets face it the entire Western world is on the brink of diaster and unless we drop these ideologies of multiculturaism and de-ethnicized indvidualism we will not survive as a people and civilzation. But Mr. Taylors real mistake is his refusal to accept Dr Kevin Macdonald's books.

This has always been so, and is likely to remain so\\" (p. 9).We can no longer float along assuming the civil rights movement and the \\"Great Society\\" have set in place efficacious remedies to the virus of racism. Racism, as Wendell Berry says, is this nation's \\"hidden wound.\\" But in leaving it hidden, refusing to deal with the facts lest we be called \\"racists,\\" we allow the wound to fester.So Taylor challenges us to look at the facts, to deal with reality rather than rhetoric. His book is filled with data and documentation. At the heart of what seems to be the race dilemma is, in a striking sense, not really race: it's the breakdown of families and the loss of traditional values. \\"There is,\\" Taylor says, \\"scarcely a social problem in this country that would not be well on its way toward solution if Americans adopted a rule their ancestors lived by and took for granted: They did not have children until they had a spouse and an income\\" (p. 18). Interestingly enough, for the past 20 years, \\"young blacks who managed to stay married have had family incomes almost identical to those of young white couples\\" (p. 25).Amazingly, he insists, \\"an American has less than 1 percent chance of being poor if he manages to do just three things: finish high school, get and stay married, and stick with a job--even a minimum-wage job--for at least a year\\" (pp. 290-291). Still more: \\"Careful comparisons of blacks and whites who have graduated from equivalent colleges with equivalent degrees show that blacks earn more than the whites\\" (p. 27). Blacks with the Ph.D. easily find employment in elite universities and out-earn their white counterparts.Compounding this, says James Meredith, the first black admitted to the University of Mississippi (in 1962), is the fact that \\"government programs have turned blacks into dependent, 'second-class citizens.' He calls busing, affirmative action, and welfare 'the worst thing that has happened to the black race in thirty years'\\" (p. 307).So problems too easily subsumed under \\"racist\\" labels are consequences of more basic problems, and glib generalizations blaming \\"white racism\\" for African-American social problems simply don't withstand scrutiny. While white racism has, in fact, declined, Taylor believes black racism has escalated. He rejects the view of Detroit's black mayor, Coleman Young, who said \\"I don't consider that blacks are capable of racism\\" (p. 270). All of us, Taylor counters, too easily indulge in judging others on the basis of the color of their skin. Too often, he argues, blacks have been allowed (even encouraged) to speak and act in ways which would be termed \\"racist\\" in whites.Sister Souljah (the rap singer candidate Bill Clinton reproved), for instance, asserts there may be some good white people, but she's never met one. So books such as Huckleberry Finn are sometimes censored for using objectional terms for blacks, but other books, such as those by \\"a violently anti-white writer such as LeRoi Jones\\" are treated reverently. Popular slogans such as \\"It's a Black Thing . . . You Wouldn't Understand\\" are fine, but a similar slogan elevating whites would be condemned as racist.Universities now subsidize segregation on campus--as long as it's requested by African-Americans. All-black fraternities flourish at Harvard and Yale. Vassar and Dartmouth authorize separate black commencements. \\"The University of Pennsylvania pays for a special black yearbook, even though blacks are only 6 percent of the student body\\" (p. 252). Anti-white speakers (e.g. Khalid Muhammad) have no difficulty appearing on prestigious university campuses, though anti-black speakers have been routinely barred.Taylor thus sees a double standard in what we promote, whether it be in politics, the media or in affirmative action educational and employment mandates. In the long run, he fears, this will elicit white resentment which will devolved into a more deadly white racism than existed a century ago. To counteract such, Taylor asks, in his final chapter, \\"What Is to Be Done?\\" He basically urges the federal government to cease trying to engineer social justice. Programs such as Head Start, social services seeking to keep children in school, permissive provisions for criminals, have all failed. Taylor joins thinkers such as Irving Kristol, Mike Royko, Thomas Sowell, and Walter Williams, who restate the strategies of Booker T. Washington, urging a \\"tougher\\" approach which demands that individuals, white and black, assume responsibility for their lives and their families."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Handouts are like giving dope to a junkieor booze to a wino.

No doubt, there will be those who will claim that Mr. Taylor is a racist. But, the true racists are those who are attacking Mr. Taylor.

Shows how government and media policy endeavored to equalize black and whites on the false assumption that &quot;white racism&quot; was the all-powerful obstacle to overcome. Taylor's chapter on B/W double standards within government, the media, the universities, and society at large is truly eye-opening. All facts are meticulously documented and heavily footnoted.Once you pick this book up, it's almost impossible to put down. The only weakness is the chapter on the underclass, which isn't terribly exciting. Taylor also takes an unnecessary stab at Louisiana legislator David Duke in attempt to distance himself from sounding too extreme.

Racism and hate are a double edged swords as J. Taylor clearly shows. Although this book is simply an objective report on contemporary race relations(and not white nationalist) it is still a powerful antidote for whites who have been conditioned by schools, Christian churches, and the mass media to believe that they are responsible for poor race relations in America and that, if not for white racism all would be well.However, I feel the reader is left with the notion that if we simply pursued different policies that this multiracial stinkpot could somehow be workable. I felt the author should have gone on the attack and launched more broadsides against affirmative action, mass immigration and multiculturalism in general. All in all this is still a very good book and a good source of facts and information to argue effectively against left wing and moderate airheads."},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Every white American and informed citizens of other races should read this book. It is an eye-opening account of how many blacks cry &quot;racism&quot; in order to manipulate white society and gain concessions for themselves which they would otherwise not obtain. Recent events such as the O.J. criminal trial and the Texaco fiasco continue to prove this point. The failure of Affirmative Action and the Welfare system are also addressed--the examples given should provide the stimulus for a major overhaul and the eventual demise of these unfair and harmful practices which if left unchecked will destroy our country as we know it. Mr. Taylor also addresses the differences in I.Q. between the races and points out that blacks do not do as well as whites and orientals in our learning institutions primarily due to this reason, despite all kinds of excuses and various measures taken to remedy the situation.Mr. Taylor praises blacks who have risen above the mindset of blaming whites for their failure to succeed and have gone on to prove that dedication and hard work are the principles underlying success. Blacks must realize that handouts and special programs do nothing for their self-esteem and blaming their failures on &quot;white racism&quot; only creates more discord. White racism is by and large non-existent in present day America; it is the blacks themselves who are the racists and the the primary source of the so-called &quot;racial problems&quot; of today.The author has not only produced a book that must count as one of the most fully documented works on our society, but has also demonstrated bravery in setting these facts to paper and striving to alert others to the perils which lie ahead if we continue our present course"},{"Title":"Drug abuse and the law sourcebook (Criminal law series)","review":"Anyone who wants better race relations should read this book.

The unusually large photo section has wonderful pictures, some very personal. I highly recommend this very open and personally insightful journey through the life of the incomperable Metropolitan Opera star."},{"Title":"Marilyn Horne: The Song Continues (Great Voices 8)","review":"I'm listening to the CD that came with this book as I write my review. It contains rare live recordings of Marilyn Horne singing all over the fach from a 1963 'Traviata' (with Jan Peerce) of her early 'lirico spinto' days to the darker trouser-role of Arsace in \\"Semiramide,\\" including an excerpt (\\"Und ist kein Betrug\\") from the part that brought her to the attention of the world: Marie in \\"Wozzeck.\\"I had read the original version of her ghosted biography, \\"Marilyn Horne: My Life,\\" (1983) and I wondered if she would repeat the controversial blow-by-blow of her master class with Lotte Lehmann--yes, it's in \\"The Song Continues,\\" too, where Lehmann blasts Horne for her bad German. In Lehmann's obituary, Martin Bernheimer (\\"Los Angeles Times:\\" September 5, 1976) speaks of the German soprano's master classes: \\"She commanded the stage, even in a classroom, with uncanny force. She was not particularly flexible, however, when it came to developing and encouraging an interpretation that might have conflicted with her own.\\"I think it was inevitable that these two strong-willed singers would clash. Marilyn didn't get her nickname, 'General Horne' just from the military trouser-roles she played. Her biography refers to her as \\"one of the few singers ever who could be both charmingly unaffected and magisterial.\\" Most operatic biographies are repetitions of the theme, 'I came, I sang, I got rave reviews' but Marilyn Horne is a real human being in this book--warts, marital woes, and all. She manages to balance the 'General' with something her father once told her: \\"Whenever you think that you are getting too big for the people around you, remember all that separates you from the guy sitting next to you is a little piece of gristle in your throat.\\"She has been called \\"probably the greatest singer in the world\\" (Opera News, 1981). She is, without a doubt, one of the great 20th century mezzo-sopranos and one of 'the' Rossini interpreters of our time. She sang and recorded for over 40 years, partnering with three generations of 'Semiramides' in her illustrious career: Joan Sutherland; Montserrat Caball&eacute;; and June Anderson. Her instrument is powerful, agile, beautiful, and secure in every register. Just like a Stradivarius, she has a unique, opulent voice (one of my favorite opera authors accuses her of concealing a trombone in her chest). If you'd like to hear her sing before you purchase this biography, she has an extensive discography. Two of my own favorites are the Scimone \\"L'Italiana in Algeri\\" (Erato - 1980) and the famous 1980 Aix-en-Provence live performance of \\"Semiramide\\" with Montserrat Caball&eacute; and Samuel Ramey. The latter has all of the problems you might expect from the recording of a live performance, but my god, the singing!"},{"Title":"Marilyn Horne: The Song Continues (Great Voices 8)","review":"Mezzo-sopranos are not the leading ladies in opera, the soprano is, but American-born Marilyn Horne became as big a star as any dramatic soprano diva. Her career span the 60's, 70's and 80's, she sang in all the leading opera houses- Met, Covent Garden, La Scala, etc and was an artist who upheld the most consummate musicianship. Her voice was not as dark or deep as say the voices of such mezzos as Giuletta Simionato, Fiorenza Cossotto, Grace Bumbry and Shirley Verrett. Hers was a voice that had a brassy, dramatic ring to it though she was clearly in her element as Rossini heroines- Neocle in Semiramide, Rosina in Barber of Seville, La Cenerentola - and she sang Carmen and Adalgisa in Norma opposite Joan Sutherland. She sang trouser roles like Cherubino. Not being in the spotlight was at first a struggle for Horne, but she overcame this by her dedication and sheer vocal artistry. Her voice is beautiful and BIG, a mezzo with lyric bravura and coloratura to boot. In her candid autobiography, she is warm and frank about all details of her career and her life. Marilyn Horne is still a very loved American singer and any mezzo-soprano who wants to win fame and not remain simply a mezzo can benefit immensely from this book."},{"Title":"Marilyn Horne: The Song Continues (Great Voices 8)","review":"The Song Continues is an updated version of Horne's earlier My Life.

(She doesn't re-tell the Sills/Scala incident here.) There are some new pictures, which is wonderful. Even more wonderful, and almost worth the purchase price all on its own, is the bonus CD. There are 18 songs on the CD. While they don't come up in chronological order, they are generally arranged earlier to later; you can still get the feeling for how that miraculous instrument evolved.

It is a fantastic theory book for guitar without being dry and acedemic. It is also a very practical book for guitarists.The chapters on caged theory are very good as most guitarists have never ever thought of the fretboard in this way. ( a type of visual fretboard orientation)The previous reviewer was correct in recommending Bill Edwards book for an indepth look at caged theory however.David Meads book is another example of his gift of imparting knowledge and I'm very glad I bought it."},{"Title":"Chords & Scales for Guitarists","review":"It pains me to write anything negative about David Mead's work as I highly value and wholeheartedly recommend his other books, in particular \\"The Ten Minute Guitar Workout\\", \\"Basic Guitar Workout\\", and \\"Rhythm - A Step by Step Guide to Understanding Rhythm for Guitar\\". These are all great learning tools that would serve guitarists of almost any level well.But then there's this book. It's not bad, but it's not nearly as concise as his other works. In fact, I read it three times and still felt rather confused. Maybe I'm an idiot, but when it comes to explaining the CAGED system of organizing the fretboard, which is ultimately what this book is about, I learned more in 14 pages of Bill Edward's excellent Fretboard Logic series than in reading this book from cover to cover.Buy Mead's other books, especially if you're an intermediate or beginner. But if you want to master the fretboard, get Fretboard Logic. There is no other."},{"Title":"Chords & Scales for Guitarists","review":"David Mead has a real gift for making learning scales and chords entertaining! Having a few of his other wonderful books, when I was in need of a good scale/chord book I knew this is the one to get. For example, in the key of C he not only shows you the scale forms, but also explains why you are using a certain form. He explains the scale formulas and goes into just enough detail and humor to make it an enjoyable learing experience. But this book is more than just scales. Mead also covers chords just as extensively and takes some of the fear out of learning music theory. I'm currently working through this book with my guitar teacher and my playing has really gone to the next level thanks to David's wonderful books."},{"Title":"Chords & Scales for Guitarists","review":"I liked this book. I have played guitar for many years but have only recently tried to learn a bit more about the theory in an attempt to improve my playing. So far I have only read this book (haven't actually played the exercises yet with the CD).The book is not heavy on theory. As the author puts it &quot;I also want to put accross information in as clear, un-cluttered and jargon-free way that I can.&quot; I think he pretty much suceeds in that goal.The book uses TAB rather than standard notation, so if you can't read standard music notation you can still get something out of this book.It is more than just a book full of scales and is written in an easy to read style. I feel I have picked up a few things (and think I will pick up more once I start playing along with the CD) by reading through this book."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This is the worst worst book i have ever read in my entire life. I cant even go on tellin to how awful this is. I raed a lot of books but this is by far the worst. I was FORCED to read this for my 7th grade english class otherwise i would have stopped after the first page. Even after 3 pages i knew that it was going to be awful. It is very confusin and i found myself not knowin what was going on or what they were talkin about. Partically because i dont know a lot about history and this book suspects u know some so it doesnt make sence. Also i ALWAYS found myself daving off and not reading the words on the page. This book no where near begged me 2 pick it up, more like i had to beg myself to get my reading assisments done. If u acually liked this book then u must be into history books. Even hustoyr isnt bad to me but they mad it awful!! they gave you 2 much info on the family which i dont even care it was pathetic awful book.

In other words, most boring parts have awakening scenes to counter-act them. This book is basically about a boy, Adam, who becomes a man in the start of the American Revolution. The most stimulating part would be near the end, when the \\"volunteer soldiers\\" (including Adam) obliterate a group of redcoats.(and by the way, I'M NOT AS YOUNG AS 12!!!!!!!)"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book was very well written at a critical point.

In conclusion, this book wouldonly be a good read to like very meaningful books."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that this book was good and bad. The detail in this book made the book both good and bad. The detail was good because Howard Fast describes things really well, which makes the reader get a clear picture of how horrible war can be. The detail was bad because Howard Fast can go on forever about really, really boring things. For example, he uses about two whole pages to talk about whether Adam, the main character, actually loves his girlfriend. Also, Fast uses about one and a half pages discussing what kind of bread the people in Lexington eat, and why they eat that certain type of bread. People in middle or high school can kind of relate to Adam, the main character, because he is fifteen. He deals with relationship problems, just like we do. The beginning of this book was really boring, but it got exciting during the end. There is a lot of suspense. When you read this book you will wonder, &quot;Is Adam going to die?&quot; If you can't deal with gore, curse words or violence don't read this book. Since this book is about war, there is violence involved. For example, Fast describes people being stabbed with bayonets. There are also some curse words in this book. I gave this book four stars because while the book can be good, it can also be really boring. If you like historical fiction try reading this book because it will give you a insight on peoples' personal feelings during the American Revolution."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"it was very good to the then end with all the contraversit"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I enjoyed Howard Fast's &quot;April Morning.&quot; One reason isalthough I do not like history I beleive this book presents eventsleading up to the revolutionary war in an easier way then historybooks do. I think this is because the book creates fictionalcharacters and information along with the straight facts so it dosntlose you and you want to see what will happen next. Although this bookdoes seem boring at the beginning since it just tells about a youngboy having regular family problems and disputes, I beleive that allaudiences would enjoy this book once it starts to go into detail aboutthe war. The only problem that I see with this book is it goes into somuch detail about some of the scenes that it seems longer than itactually is.

It wasn't the literary elements that were difficult--this book is written for children--or the events--the dawning of America's revolution--but the characters. Too much emphasis was placed upon the battles of Lexington and Concord and not enough on the relationship between Adam, the narrator, and his loved ones. His mother seems lukewarm, his father, though colorful, doesn't last long, and his girlfriend isn't emphasized nearly enough to keep a romantic interested. In fact, the most interesting character in this book, Adam's brother Levi, was deemed so unimportant that he didn't even make the movie version. Fast, who writes historical novels, concentrates more on the textbook actions than the personal actions of a boy becoming a man during one of the most turbulent events in our history."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"As a nominal adult, I went back and read this book again. It was just as good as when I read it as a kid.It is amazing that Fast was a Communist during his life, because Adam's (the narrator's) father is the perfect example of how an American should be; honest, forthright, determined, and belligerent in the defense of freedom (the exact opposite of what the system that Fast defended expects from a man).Adam grows up over the morning of the first day of the American Revolution. He doesn't want to want to leave childhood, but the world isn't under his control. This book also relies on the relationship between Adam and his family, especially with his father, to define how he reacts to responsibility.Fast is an excellent writer, and his political views don't show up in this book. I would also recommend \\"Power\\" by Fast."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I thought that the book &quot;April Morning&quot;, was a pretty good book. The book really gave me a sharp picture of the battle of Lexington. Based on the words, this book would most be appropriate for 8th graders. Some of the words, for instance,&quot;hell&quot; might be inappropraite for a younger age group. Also, the concept of war. War is a very complex thing to understand. Many people lose their lives in wars, escpically in the battle of Lexington. If you like books about war, then &quot;April Morning&quot; is the book for you."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I first read this book in high school (entirely too long ago!) I enjoyed it immensely. There are those who have complained about Fast's writing being boring, tedious, or going into too much detail, but it is that level of detail that brought the book to life for me. Besides the main plot of the Battle of Lexington and a teenaged boy's coming of age, it is an excellent peek into everyday life in colonial times. I intend to buy it for my own children, but reread it myself before letting them have it."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"Can you handle reading about soldiers getting their brains smashed during war? Are you interested in finding out how a boy who lived 225 years ago dealt with the same kinds of emotions you have today? Adam lives in a quiet town and suddenly one day, his world changes completely when a rider comes to Lexington and says, &quot;The British are coming.&quot; Howard Fast uses elaborate details of the war and fictionlizes the life of one young man, his family and his community. This novel is appropriate for readers from 12 years old to adults! Will fit in well with any Revoltuionary War curriculum but also is a great read outside the classroom! It shows the human side of war from the perspective of a young man who is trying to find his own identity in the midst of life and death."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I read the book a couple of years a go and I saw the movie a couple of weeks ago, they were both bad. The main thing that I remember from the book is that the main character urinates his pants non-stop. I found that the book dragged on and included too many nonimportant details. The movie was a made for TV movie that I watched in my American History class. The acting was horrible."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"...and only because the book was well-crafted, in a writer's point of view. Howard Fast did a good job at description and dialogue, and the background things such as donkers and the breadpudding-clash showed that he -did- do his homework. If anything, this is historically accurate.But it also reads like a textbook trying to disguise itself as a novel.Part of Fast's problems were his unrealistic goals for Adam in April Morning. Adam makes a complete--and I mean, *complete*--turnaround from an immature boy to an adult. Yup, you guessed it: this transformation takes place in the span of one whole day. Not only is cramming so much into a day very difficult for the writer, it is also extremely boring for the reader, because so many epiphanies so closely spaced is just plain UNREALISTIC.Also, the way Fast goes about this is dull. The first battle, Adam runs and hides when his father is gunned down. The second? He wets his pants. And the third? Well, he fell asleep! Normally, flawed characters seem much more realistic, but when the author is trying to mark a total turnaround the story contadicts itself...smaller details, while accurate, like Adam's romance with his second-cousin then seem laughable/disgusting with such a plot.His worst mistake, though, was giving the character NO personality. Absolutely. None. Hearing Adam rant and ramble about nothing pertaining to the story further made me want to slap him.Don't get me wrong, even though I read this for school, I do like some books they have made us read. THis one is just terrible. It was dull as a textbook and, though historically accurate, it seemedvery unrealistic, in fact, stupid."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"In my opinion this book took for ever to read.

Although there were some very romantic moments the author should have expanded on what Adam was thinking about when Ruth told him \\"I love you\\".

It is the story of Adam Cooper, a 15-year old who lives there with his family. He has a philosophical talk with his grandmother. At dinner his father Moses speaks his mind. Moses tills the soil but owns 300 books to develop his intelligence. The story tells you about life in this village. British laws on commerce and trade affected people adversely. That night a rider galloped into town to tell them the British were coming. The church bell is rung as a warning. [A teenager could own a gun in those days.] The men of the village assembled on the village green at 4AM. They knew about the loss of freedom in Boston (p.87).The British soldiers arrived at first light. The Major ordered the villagers to disperse. A shot was fired, the British soldiers fired on the villagers, who ran away. The fallen were bayonetted. The survivors his in the woods then reassembled. There is news about Concord, they hear shots. They gather behind the stone walls to shoot at the British soldiers. Once the shooting started it could only end in victory or death (p.146). The British continued to retreat towards Boston while being fired upon. Nothing would ever be the same again. The dead of the village would be buried the next day after services.This story shows the historical event as seen by a young man that day. It reminds me of the TV show \\"You Are There\\" from the late 1950s (which recreated historical events for drama). Fast puts modern attitudes into the people of that era. He could be right in some of these family conflicts; human nature doesn't change. This book doesn't give the historical background of that era. The French and Indian War was fought to remove the threat from Canada. Then the British sought to squeeze every penny in taxes from the Colonials. This led to resentment and the eventual War for Independence. There are better history books about this conflict. They made a movie from this book which does not go into the personalities as much. [Hardcover edition.]"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"Somehow we never read this in high school, so I was interested in the Netgalley offering for the new Open Road digital edition. It seems to be a nice edition, apart from a few odd typos ('\\"We'd never sleep a peaceful night again - not ever again, no V\\"'); the cover art is stark and attractive.By the end of the story I was rather fond of Adam, who is engaging despite his teenaged-boy-ness. I've come across surprisingly little fiction centered on the Revolution (there's my beloved Sherwood Ring, and I need to read Johnny Tremaine again one day), and I'm glad of a story that illuminates a corner of a period of history I know less about than I'd like to. I had, for example, no idea that that was how the whole thing started. This account certainly differs from the general impression of the Minutemen, every one loaded for bear (literally) and more than willing to defend their homes with no discussion. The Committee was so very much a committee, a panel of men of all opinions who spoke much and accomplished, apparently, little; this is not the popular image of the clear-minded forefather...The brutality of the battle - battles - was startling, as was the frankness about the various reactions. There are no real heroes here, not as the history books would like us to see them; in fact, Adam notes himself that some of the greatest heroism shown that morning was by the British soldiers who walked into Colonial gunfire - and kept walking.The book is from Adam's first-person point of view, and the language is colloquial without, happily, being unreadably young or \\"farm-boy\\" - the local color is not blinding. For a short work, there is a lot of strong characterization here - I finished it feeling I knew several of the characters quite well, and had known them a long time, something far too many much longer books fail to achieve. It grew on me, and continued the effect after I finished it. I've found that I knock off a star from some books in the course of working up a review.

After he has gained control of himself, he goes out with his cousin and helps win one of the most famous battles during the American Revolution. This book was well writen, and it felt like you were right there in all of the action. I recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"\\"A boy becomes a man\\" is been the theme of countless novels. April Morning, written in 1961, reveals what a skilled writer can do with a basic idea. The novel starts innocently with Adam Cooper, a 15-year-old Lexington boy, being scolded by his stern father for laziness in doing his afternoon chores. But today is no ordinary day. As the evening progresses, Adam's dad is called to a town committee meeting--it seems the British are marching out of Boston to seize the colonists' arsenal and put them back in their places.April Morning is a short book, but it at first seems to unfold quite slowly. There is plenty of time to see Adam clash with his pompous dad, seek solace from his tart-tongued grandmother, argue with his little brother, and grab a furtive kiss with his young girlfriend. The modern reader, used to each book opening with an exploding helicopter, might be forgiven for wondering where Fast is going with all this.Then something happens that is so shocking and so unexpected, that we, like Adam, are thrown forever out of the ordinary world and into the nightmarish beginning of war. In the course of the next hours, Adam is forced to confront the realities of a war he never asked for and a world that is forever changed."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"We use this book in our eighth grade language arts class, and while I agree with other reviewers that this isn't the Great American Novel, it does a terrific job with characterization (I don't know who back there thinks that Adam wasn't &quot;described&quot; enough, but his looks are irrelevant; his personality is clear, believable, and accurate from the context of his family and town). The story, which I agree can be a bit stale, takes place over 24 hours, which is a neat gimmick. The old fashioned attitudes and perspectives can put off some readers, but reading this book for the purpose of learning about the time period, the beginning of the American Revolution, and understanding that modern people aren't so very different from their forefathers does indeed save it."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"While it is true the plot can be described as \\"slow-paced\\", it is excusable, for the book takes place over a period of 24 hours. This gives the author the chance to expand on minute details of the day, giving you the sense that you ARE there, and every detail is absorbed. Granted, this does make for a slow read, but Fast makes up for that in characterization.The main character, Adam Cooper, is a teenager--naturally rebellious and not the most respectful guy someone could meet. He and his father have a shaky relationship, and Adam's little brother, Levi, gets his share of verbal abuse as well. But come the redcoats and the battle of Lexington and Concord, Adam learns what it takes to be a man after his father is killed and he's shown quite harshly what reality is all about.One highlight I'd have to make is the smokehouse scene. This takes place directly after the battle, and Adam has fled to a smokehouse to hide from the redcoats. He's alone and scared when Levi comes looking for him. Levi and the rest of the family have found their father's dead body, and Levi is in tears. Adam--the same Adam who called his brother names in the beginning of the story--takes the boy into his arms and comforts him. Character development has always been a major thing in books for me, and this I just adore--both characters learn to accept and love each other (and I can't help but say the whole thing is very, very cute).In short, the book is slow-paced and hard to get through at some parts, but I adore it soley for the characters, which are well-developed and easy to relate to. I myself am 14, and I read this last year in 8th and simply adored it. Who says a teenager can't enjoy this book? =DAs for historical accuracy, it IS shaky, but the Lexington and Concord battle is not the main focus of the story. If I had to guess, I would say Howard Shore chose his setting as mere backup for his development of Adam in his boy-to-man journey.I adore this book, especially Adam and Levi. If you're into character-driven books, this is for you."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"Moses Cooper tried to negotiate with the British redcoats when they arrived at his town, but unfortunately, they shot him dead before he got to speak, which marked the beginning of the Battle of Lexington. All the men and boys who were with Moses ran away for their lives, even though they carried guns with them. Adam Cooper, Moses Cooper's fifteen year-old son, also ran away, but he met a group of men who were on their way to fight the British redcoats. He joined the group and shot at the redcoats all day long, turning noticeably from a boy into a man. He hid in bushes and in the smoke produced by the shooting of gunpowder while he shot at the redcoats who marched on the roads. At the end of the day, Adam Cooper went back home and showed how he had become a man by surviving through everything that had happened; the death of his father, his first time using a gun to shoot at people, seeing his friends and relatives being killed, worrying about his mom and his brother safety, etc. He had experienced enough to think and act like a grown-up. All these things happened on April 19, 1775.I can say that this is the best historical fiction that I have ever read. In April Morning, I can clearly see how Adam got through all that has happened. He met many people on that day that each taught him a valuable lesson, which was very important for him to get through all that he had gotten through. He had been a part of many terrible things on April 19, 1775. As a result, he had grown tremendously on that day. Seeing Adam overcoming many obstacles and growing mature with an amazing pace is really an extraordinary experience.The part that I liked best in this book is when Adam was shooting at the British redcoats. He was exhausted from all the running he had done and from losing his sleep the night before, so he fell asleep, right in the middle of a battle. That's not something you see everyday, it's very unusual. If there weren't any bushes or smoke covering him up, Adam would have been shot dead without knowing how he got killed. However, what touched me the most was how Adam's uncle and the Reverend reacted when they heard someone said that Adam was lying on the ground, motionless. They worried and cried and prayed for him just like his father would have done. This shows how a person can care so much for another person."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"The first two battles of the American Revolution (Lexington and Concord) are brought to life with revolutionary excitiement and breathtaking detail in \\"April Morning.\\" This will have any history buff and non-history buff excited and ready for more!

During the war, Adam had to act like a man about seeing people being killed.Also, Adam was very emotional because he saw close friends killed.The book explains about the bloody battles of Lexington.I highly recomend this book to people who like learning and reading about war."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"&quot;April Morning&quot; is a satisfactory book for several reasons. I enjoyed reading \\"April Morning\\" because it taught me quite a few things about the Revolutionary War. I loved the way Howard Fast described things such as the characters and the war itself. However I did think that some information was worthless and should of been left out of the story. For example, The author took up many pages of Adam's feelings toward Ruth \\"April Morning\\" has lots of action and surprising events that kept me in suspense. For instance, towards the middle of the book the people of the town are informed that the British are coming and then the war breaks out. It is a big surprise when Adam signs the muster book to get drafted into the war. That's when the book gets interesting and you start to think, \\" Who will survive? What will happen to the town?\\" I highly recommend this book if you enjoy reading action filled books; but, I do not recommend this book to you if you don't like to read books with cursing, gore and death. That is why I rate \\"April Morning\\" with four stars."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I really enjoyed this book! Howard Fast did a great job connecting this book to our lives as teenagers. The main character Adam is a 15-year old boy whos life is rudely interrupted with the threat of war. The novel depicts the feelings and events that occur as Adam fights with the other men against the redcoats while dealing with the death of his father. There is also a love story developing between Adam and his cousin Ruth. This made me like the book even more because it didn't just focus on the war and fighting but there also was a story of mixed feelings that many teenagers can relate to. This book was definetly better then I had expected."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"As an eighth grade U.S. history teacher I use this book to supplement the curriculum. I like it because it allows my students -- who are close to the same age as 15-year-old main character Adam Cooper -- to experience the challenges and dangers of living in colonial America as the Revolutionary War looms. The book allows students to see how colonists' views changed as British soldiers went from being a simple annoyance in the cities to a threat to life and property throughout New England. Another aspect of the novel that makes it excellent for teens is that they relate to the struggles Adam has with his father, a stern taskmaster who Adam believes doesn't love him. The tale of Adam and his father is also an allegory for the colonies and Great Britain. I thoroughly enjoyed the book the first time I read it and haven't gotten tired of it after teaching it for four years. My students enjoy it also; it takes a while for them to get &quot;hooked&quot;, but as soon as the British fire on the Lexington minutemen they can't put it down."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that this book was good and bad. The detail in this book made the book both good and bad. The detail was good because Howard Fast describes things really well, which makes the reader get a clear picture of how horrible war can be. The detail was bad because Howard Fast can go on forever about really, really boring things. For example, he uses about two whole pages to talk about whether Adam, the main character, actually loves his girlfriend. Also, Fast uses about one and a half pages discussing what kind of bread the people in Lexington eat, and why they eat that certain type of bread. People in middle or high school can kind of relate to Adam, the main character, because he is fifteen. He deals with relationship problems, just like we do. The beginning of this book was really boring, but it got exciting during the end. There is a lot of suspense. When you read this book you will wonder, &quot;Is Adam going to die?&quot; If you can't deal with gore, curse words or violence don't read this book. Since this book is about war, there is violence involved. For example, Fast describes people being stabbed with bayonets. There are also some curse words in this book. I gave this book four stars because while the book can be good, it can also be really boring. If you like historical fiction try reading this book because it will give you a insight on peoples' personal feelings during the American Revolution."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I only read this book because i had to in school, and let me tell you something I HATED IT! Ths book drags on for more than 200 pages about war. I mean if you like to hear abou teverybody dying thatn you would live this book. But there isn't even any real action that takes place. The main character, Adam, is a whimp, as is the rst of his town. My suggestion is don;t waste your time or money reading this boring book!!!!!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning, is a fantastic book about the battle at Lexington on the day of April 19, 1775. The main charater is a 15 year old boy named Adam Cooper. Adam has a mother, a father, a younger bother named Levi, and a grandmother that lives with them. Adam thinks that his father hates him, but on the night the horrible red - coats come to their town, he changes his mind about everthing.Adam always thought that war was a neat thing to be in, but he finds out that it's horrible. Adam learns that is bloody and it's terrible to hear the moaning of the wounded and the screams when people get shot. Adam leaves childhood and becomes a man when he signs the muster book to go to war. April Morning is a tragic book with many good details about the battle at Lexington. If you like books about adventure and the Revolutionary War, April Morning is the right book for you!!!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I found the Book April Morning to be a fairly well written book. It really helped me understand about the revolutionary War and really make me think about what happened in that time period. By thinking about what every word and quote meant in the novel, it made me feel sad when something tradgic happened, and excited when the characters in the story were happy. But, there is a downside to the story. I felt that the author didn't express that Adam was a teenager and what teenagers think and feel at that age. If I didn't know Adam's age, then I would have thought that he was a growm man. For example, he didn't seem like he ever had fun or enjoyed himself. Adam always seemed serious. I thought to myself,&quot;What does he do for fun?&quot; So thinking about that, it made the novel a little less interesting and easy to believe. So overall, I think the novel was pretty well written. I gave it three stars basically because of the fact that Adam's character was a little hard to believe in my opinion. But, like I said, you really thought about the facts of the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I have just finished the book &quot;april Morning&quot; by, Howard Fast.It is an excellent book.The book is about is about a young man who joins the army during the Revolutionary war. the begining was a little tedious but after that the book was great. &quot;april Morning&quot; goes into detail a lot especially when there is a battle. There are alot of charecters and it is some times hard to remember them all. there is a lot dialogue in the book. If you like historical fiction or action I recommend this book."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book is great. It accurately portrays the American Revolution with a little twist added. With all of its action, reading it a second time is defenitely worth your time."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think April Morning is an interesting book. It really lets you see what people might have been thinking during the battle of Lexington and Concord. It should be read along with the 8th grade history book in history class when we learn about the Revolutionary War. It would make the class much more interesting, and then we could compare the information in April Morning to what our history book says. However, sometimes there were too many details about the battle scenes and the language used in the book disturbed some people I know. Smile! :0) :0) :0)"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"In my class, for Reading, we had to read April Morning. At first, the book was a little boring. I did not want to read it and Howard Fast kept talking about Adam's family. Adam is the main character in the story. After the Redcoats came into the story, the story got very gory, but exciting. It kept my class wondering what will happen next. It is a good for eighth graders, but I think that if you go much younger, the kids will not enjoy the bayonets going into people's backs and so on. My favorite part of the book was when Adam wets his pants and does not want to because the Reverend is around, but the Reverend tells Adam it's okay because he has to. I gave it a three also because the author, Howard Fast, uses very descriptive words and phrases. I am glad we finished reading this book and got past that we did not like the boring beginning."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"The book, April Morning, is very interesting. It gives a good description and view of the Revolutionary War. You learn about the war through the eyes of Adam Cooper, who is only 15. The book goes through the feelings and emotions of growing up faster than you wanted, going through a war, and loosing someone close to you. this book gives a good perspective of events that lead to a war and some supplies and materials needed. I think the book, April Morning, by Howard Fast, deserves four stars. This book is good for people who like to read about war and people living through the hardship of it."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book was not one that i would coose to read but it was enjoyable.I would recomend this book to anyone interested in what was behind the Revolutionary War.If you already know the political and historical facts and figures of the war, this is perfect for you because it shows how people really lived and not just what you already know. It is more than a text book could teach you because it's about how war is for real people and not the government.It has a story about a boy who comes of age and shows how life was in the time of the revolution."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book was a valuable reading experience it was interesting and well written. The language used in this book had no bearing on the plot or the story. The characters were well evovled and interesting. I think the reader matures along with the characters of the story. This book is suitable for eighth graders."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think the book, &quot;April Morning&quot; was a good book. I thought there was alot of action and violence, which caught and held my attention. Although some parts of the story were very slow, other parts were very exciting. The author used very discriptive words to describe the characters and the events in the story. At times it felt like I was actually at a battle. I think this book is suitable for ages ten to twenty. This age group could really relate to this story. Even though the main characters are boys, I think both boys and girls can relate to this story. I also think that by reading this book you can learn about the lifestyles of people living during the Revolutionary War."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I thought that April MOrning was a great book. It was very interesting and i learned a lot about the towns people from Lexington. All the textbooks that I have ever read only talk about who one the battle and what famous people faught in it. After i read April Morning i had a new respect for the people of Lexington, they had their families taken away form them and their towns destroyed all because the British wanted gun powder. I also think that Howard Fast did a great job in relating the present to the past. I think that it schould be part of the Social Studies curriculum."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I was assigned this book for school. It was one of the better books that we have been assigned to read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I have enjoyed other books. I felt that this book was well-written and it wasn't terrible to read, but it didn't really make me want to keep reading. Adam's character was very relatable though. I think that it was because he was around my age and he went trough some of the same problems as people our age go through. Such as his relationship problems with Ruth. All in all, I feel that this book was okay, if you like historical books. I personally do not."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I read the book April Morning in my 8th grade reading class. I thought that it was a very good and interesting book. The things that Adam went through are not what all kids today go through so it was interesting to hear about his problems. How the author described each battle that Adam was in, was great, you could picture everything that was going on in that scene and you understood what Adam was thinking. When I first started the story I thought it was kind of boring but when the battles started the story became much more interesting. The story came to an end that may make the reader think what Adam would do if there was a sequel. In conclusion, I believe that the story April Morning was a very good story and it deserves four stars."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning was a good book, with maybe a bit too much detail. But it accurately depicts the Battle of Lexington and Concord. I enjoyed it, although most people might not want to read it for entertainment. I had to read it for my eighth grade language class. This book was pretty good, and it was spiced up with a little bit of romance and the struggle of going to manhood."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"in the begining of the book it started boring but got interesting to be a very good book about a boy that needed to reach manhood."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I was reluctant on reading this book at first because of its genre (historical fiction). The book started off slow, but sped up during the second chapter. I loved this book. It taught me many things and I will always remember it"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT IS THE BEST BOOK I EVER READ. I READ THIS BOOKS IN CLASS READING, AND I REALLY LIKED IT. IT GREAT. I WILL RECOMMANDED TO ANYONE, YOUNG OR OLD."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"The best war book I have ever read!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I read this book knowing that the story would go on for a space of 24 hours. Little did I know that the plot would be tiresome and the family relationships stereotypical. I found this book slow and dull and I could not bring myself to read it again. However the character Adam is fun to watch grow as a boy in the Revolution. The description of the Battle of Lexington was precise until I talked to a history whiz and realized its facts were not all true."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"First off, the detail in this story may attract some readers, but its realtion to the plot of the story is quite meaningless. As far as historical accuracy is concerned, the book falls far short of standars. The entire conflict at the North Bridge in Concord was not even covered, even though Soloman Chandler and Adam retreat to that area after the skirmish on the green. This is the pivital part of the entire engagement, and without it, the ensuing ambush would never have been possible. The description of life during the time should have been described in greater detail, so we can fully understand the atmosphere surrounding the family. I can't seem to understand why you believe the story was &quot;gory&quot;. I thought the actual hand to hand fighting should have been described in better detail so the feeling of hoplessness for the colonists could actually be appreciated."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I found that this book tought me alot about the war and the people back then, but it was extremely descriptive and detailed. I dont think that talking for 2 pages about \\"interpretation of dreams\\" had too much to do with the story, but that's just my opinion. But besides this, the story was pretty good, and very suspensful."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that this book is satifatory. At first, it was boring sense there wasn't any war going on. But as you read further, it will get more exciting. One thing that i don't like is that Howard Fast put too much detail where it wasn't needed. Also He talks about Ruth and Adam too much.Other than that, i thought that it was good"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think this book was average for many reasons. One reason is, there was way too many pages of useless detail. Like when Adam kept asking himself if he loved Ruth. Also, the book could have had a lot more action. Instead of just having the Moses die, they could have had others die aswell. The only reason is the end was very good. I liked the final conversation between Adam and Ruth. That is why I rate this book with 3 stars."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that April Morning was an &quot;ok&quot; book.I didn't really enjoy it because the book was mainly based on the Revolutionary War and history. Those two things dont really hit any of my interests. I would have much rather read a book based on horror because I enjoy suspense novels. If I were to read this book form a history lovers perspective, I would have probably enjoyed this novel. I didnt really enjoy this book becuase it wasnt very suspensful and it didnt keep me wondering about things. The only thing that I thougt about was why Adam and Ruth didnt get married, so the ending of the book was very dull. I also did not think that the characters had very good personalities and they werent very interesting and fun to follow throughout the book. If the author started to talk about one thing that was happening with a character then he would keep talking about it throughout the whole book. So I didnt think that the author had a wide amount of ideas. The last thing that I didnt like about this book was the relationship between Ruth and Adam. I thought it was very strange and dull. When they got into a heated discussion with each other, all they did was kiss. So overall I think that this book was &quot;ok&quot;, thats why I rated it a three. I would only reccommend this book to history or war lovers."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book was booring! There was nothing in the book that a teenager today could relate to. It was extremely sad! When Moses died, that was the saddest part to me. It didn't really incorperate fiction and enjoyment, it was basically all talk. What little action there was, it wasn't really descriptive. The author could have elaborated on other character's thoughts. We all heard about Adam the whole time, what about his mother or his brother or his grandmother? The book should focus on the families in the war as well."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"As I read through this novel, I noticed some good and bad qualities about its writing. This book serves as a good information resource for those interested in the American Revolution. Since this book is not a pile of facts, but rather a story, one gains a more clear understanding of the battle and the emotions involved. Also, this book uses amazing details and description to give one a full picture of the battle. However, sometimes the detail runs off topic and takes away from the plot. For example, Howard Fast talks a lot about the food eaten in Lexington. This book could be improved if it gave more detail on the war and thoughts of the characters, rather than their meals. Finally, the beginning of this novel is slow, but as you read on the book's action and suspense hold your interest until you reach the end. Therefore, this book has good as well as bead qualities."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"When I read this book, I was going into an 8th grade English Honors class, and it was a part of the Summer Reading. I must say, that I hated this book. All of the details were too much, and just made the read slower and more uninviting. Even though it took me two months to get through it, I give it two stars because it did have a good plot. Not a lot of people decide to write about such a short period of time, and especially to base it on history."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"The setting is April 19, 1775 and the main character is a young boy, stretched under the demanding thumb of his father, one of the town selectmen. When news comes that the British are coming, the boy wants to participate, only to see his father shot. The book follows the boy as he grows up in a single day, working to defeat the British.This is an excellent choice for a history or English class since the protagonist is a teenaged boy, and all the emotions of the day are wrapped throughout the story. The book is a little slow to start, and the vocabulary is higher level, but the story is definitely worth the effort. Teens can feel the frustration of the boy as he strives to be a man, then stumbles into terrorizing territory when the British begin shooting. I would recommend this for school, but for personal reading as well. Fast captured the astonishment and shock of the colonists expertly. Great reading.Received Galley from NetGalley.com"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"It is understandable as to why this book is compared to Stephen Crane's Civil War classic. Surprisingly, I enjoyed Mr. Fast's book more than \\"The Red Badge Of Courage.\\" While both portray the horrors of war and the loss of innocence, April Morning's more contemporary prose resonated better with me. Mr. Fast did a highly effective job of keeping to 1700s Massachusetts' vernacular and sensibilities while adding nice touches about the surroundings before, during and after the conflict. The author crisp writing style adds an extra dimension of seriousness to the story. Truly a wonderful, quick read."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"There are two main goals of the book. It is a means to relate the history of the first shots fired at the start of the American Revolution through historical fiction. It is also the story of a boy becoming a man. The book succeeds in both of its goals and is entertaining as well as thoughtful. Apparently it is a common book for high school curriculum; it's easy to see why. The writer does a quality job of presenting history through fiction and creating real-life characters in such a short book. While reading, you feel like you are there in the action. I have only a few minor issues with the book as it gets some of the history wrong. For example, it describes Founding Father Samuel Adams as an atheist--he was actually a believing Christian. Overall worth the read."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"As a Spartacus fan, I have, for twenty-five years, heard of April Morning, and finally got around to reading it. Overall it is an excellent book, with strengths far outweighing weaknesses. Ultimately it is of the same literary quality as Spartacus, though much shorter and geared for a younger audience. That didn't bother me, though. Personally I hope lots of young people read it.So, strengths versus weaknesses:Strengths: it brought history to vivid life, which is no small feat for a book published 50 years ago, and set 235 years ago. I can only imagine the research Fast did to be able to create such a living, moving picture. I really have a different feeling about the American Revolution after reading this book. Yes, I was taught all this history in school, but to read it here, in the beautiful way Fast presents it, made me regret that our teachers didn't scrap all the textbook crap which they fed us via psychic enema and instead just give us this worthy read.Weaknesses: 1) It was a drop slow at points. Just a bit too much background, and at times it was unnecessary and detracted from the plot. 2) I got tired of the romance. I don't feel it added strongly to the book, and I felt the author put it in to keep younger audiences hooked. 3) At times I sensed that the author was portraying characters living in the year 1775 with the psychology of characters living in the mid-20th century. Sometimes their thoughts, questions, self-questions, and conversations just didn't leave me convinced that they were context-specific.But that said, I don't feel any of these weaknesses hurt the book that much, and I still give the author credit for the feat he accomplished. He was better, by far, than all the history teachers I had put together!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I loved this book, staying up until 4AM to finish it. I'm a big fan of the idea of citizen soldiers standing up against a tyrannical government, and as a youth I loved stories about young men doing brave things. This is a coming of age story, but not your typical coming of age story that is a pleasantly ending teen novel... the protagonist of this book participates in a brutal battle, one of the most critical events in American History, at the tender age of 15. His transformation is, by necessity, almost instantaneous. As his uncle in the story says, \\"went to bed a boy and woke up a man.\\" I love the way the characters were developed and you end up with a clear and believable image of the people and the time. You will also have a better understanding of the reasons behind the revolutionary war and how it began. I take away one star because the Author misses a couple of decent chances at a history lesson for no particular reason. For Example, the leader of the Lexington Militia that morning was John Parker and he was not killed. In the novel it was Jonas Parker, who in reality was John Parker's cousin and was killed that day."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I was once told by another Revolutionary War buff, after reading a good book on that period of our history, that the best book on that war was April Morning. Naturally I had to purchase it and read this \\"best book\\" and I do admit it is a great story of one day in a very important time of our nations history.April 19, 1775 is the day that Howard Fast writes about. The day is told from afternoon to evening of the next day. You are taken from the home of fifteen-year old Adam Cooper, his younger brother, Levi, his mother, father, and grandmother, to war. The British Redcoats were coming. The committeemen, as the leaders of the citizens of that area were called, had gathered in various small villages around the Boston area to decide how they would handle the situation with these Brits. Some wanted to stay home and not interfere but the majority knew they had to defend their freedom and fight the British. This tore apart families with most of the fathers and the older sons marching off with the Committeemen groups from their area. They would meet up with other groups as they traveled.The first battle was a disaster for the Committeemen's groups. Quite a few were killed and most without a shot being fired from their guns. They had very few good guns. These men were farmers, blacksmiths, forgers, and other work that did not require guns. They would regroup with more communities and return for more fighting using different strategies. Adam's father was one of the first ones killed. This hurt Adam terribly and turned him away from thoughts of battle for a while, feeling sad at what he would have to tell his family upon his return.While April Morning covers only one day of this period, the descriptions used by Howard Fast are so impressive that you get the sensation that you were beside these soldiers and their families and felt some of that heart-breaking deep sorrow that many families endured. The emotions of those fighting, those wounded, and those of the families were terrifically told. The book is small in size but packed with history. I highly recommend it to any war buff."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 because it was a little slow paced at the beginning. Like in the first part of the story they just introduce main characters and tell you who does what. The next parts are very exciting like, when Adam and the father have to go to the common (field) for important information from a distant rider. Some parts in the book are very sad that I do not want to give away. This book you sould think about reading, Howard Fast makes it very suspensful at times.I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I do,----Jake----"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I say april morning is a good book, but boring at first. When the battle happens though, I saw the book as much more interesting. It was a cool thing that the story happened over a 24 hour period. In the first part of the story you get the basics, such as who Adam is and his brother, mom, dad,and ect. In the night something happens and Adam and his father rush to the common (fields) and get some news. The next part is where the rising action starts to build up along with, what will happen next. The only reason I give this book 4 stars is that its a bit slow paced at first. I hope you read and enjoy the novel as much as I did.-----Jake-----"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"When I first pick the book up it look very interesting. As I began to read it, I almost fell alseep because of the boring page after page with no paragraphs in between. Nothing! Zip! Finally, I was able to make it to the middle of the book. That's when it began to get more interesting. INTERESTING, for once I thought it would be boring through the whole book. I was wrong. As I got closer to the end, it began to get a little more boring, but in a way still interesting."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I somewhat liked april morning. It was a quick read,but never really kept my attention.While reading April Morning my mind would constantly wonder so i would have to start the page over. Although this happend the book was very short so i finished it quickly. I did not understand some of the terms so i was confused for some of the book. I did like the action in the book because it wasnt to gruesome but it kind of made you want to read more. It was one of those books you would only want to read if you had to for school."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"In class we read April Morning and it started out slow, but it surprised me. The book started getting good, and it was action-packed. It helped me learn alot and I had fun reading it too. Also, the ending was kind of boring and they should have had more battles. It was also kind of hard to read with all the old words and the religous words that were everywhere. For a book that I had to read in school, it ended up being one of the best."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This is an excellent book for people 13 and older. The subjects in it can get a bit much for younger readers especialy things that have to do with love and war. This is a good book and it has vivid details about the time period and things going on. This book is about the development from boy to man for Adam Cooper. It is an excellent book and is very emotional. If you like historical fiction or even just a good intense book, this is a very good choice."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book should be read by all young adults, as well as adults of any age. Along with Howard Fast's book The Hessian, these books are excellent lessons in tolerance, compassion and war."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I thought that April Morning was a satisfactory novel. Although the book contains some unnecessary details, the part where the British arrive is rather interesting. Fast did a very good job in vividly describing exactly how Adam (the main character) felt during the whole process. Even though some parts of the novel were gruesome, such as when Fast describes how a bayonet is driven into someone's back and blood is gushing all over, the issues portrayed are realistic. One part of the book that I really disliked, however, was in the very beginning because there was absolutely no suspense. Otherwise, even though this book depicts a boy living more than 200 years ago, teenagers today can easily relate to his problems, such as his relationship with Ruth, as well as the problem with his father. I can't say that this novel is the best historical fiction book I've ever read, but it wasn't the worst either."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This was a pretty good book. Even though the genre was a little bit boring, historical fiction, Howard Fast made this book seem real and did a very good job with descriptions. This whole book takes place over the course of not even two days so ofcourse it has some irrelevant events and descriptions but those just add to the overall feel of life in the 1700's. The book is about Adam Cooper, who lives in Lexington, Mass. The British are coming and Adam and other committeemen and farmers fight against them. First they just get massacred, the details are gruesom and Adam runs away. Also, I don't want to give anything away but his father gets killed. But later the farmers have a larger force and ambush the Redcoats taking out many and losing few of their own. It is kind of boring in the beginning but towards the battles it gets exciting, and you just want to know what is going to happen next. This book also has some romance. And shows Adam's progression from boyhood to manhood."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"Encapsulated in three parts focusing upon one family, this book delivers the reader to the harsh realties of the war - and all seen through the eyes of an early teenage boy.The first third focuses upon Adam Cooper's strained relationship with his overbearing and tough father, Moses, who could be described as anything but warm and fuzzy. The relationship includes references by son to mother that \\"father doesn't love me\\" and other such common statements by teens who misinterpret strong armed guidance as being disapproval.Then the whole world changes. Men gather to determine what to do as the red coats are marching from the Boston port to the outskirts of Concord - the place where rumors assert the colonials hold large amounts of powder and other armaments - weapons of mass destruction for people of that era.The men meet and create a \\"muster\\" in Lexington which lies between the port and Concord. Recruits come, which include the string bean Adam. Father, who would ordinarily whip the son for disobeying his order to remain at home while he recruited troops, steadfastly sits and accepts the son's enlistment - only to be followed by a clearly obvious disapproval by his spouse when he returns home. This argument between parents in the 18th century has repeated itself through this day - amazingly history continues to repeat itself as boys aiming to be men cut off the metaphorical umbilical cord to enter man's least attractive venture: war.Peace is sought out at first. Speak to one another like rational beings. But, the British shoot first and ask no questions later. Adam learns from the original incident. He understood, \\"It isn't the same anymore. . . [T]oday we knew that we wouldn't fight. But now we know that we must, and we're learning how.\\"And, we watch the horror of war, and Adam's sudden and immediate delivery to manhood. Still a string bean and short on years to truly be declared a man, his witnessing numerous events of the Battle of Lexington amount to a decade of lessons and he ends the book placing his head on the pillow being a completely different person than he was only a few days before. As Adam states, his childhood and his world are \\"over and done with and gone for all time.\\"Author Fast wrote often about liberty. He fought for the same while writing about historical references to great events in American liberty. In 1950, Fast was ordered to appear before the House of Un-American Activities Committee. He refused to name fellow members of American Communist Party and, in turn, he was sentenced to three months in prison. Interestingly, after being blacklisted, he wrote incredibly heart felt books of American issues of freedom such as this - a 1961 masterpiece directed mainly for children.The richly depictive 18th century dialogue of the puritanical American delivered by the high school drop out Jewish New Yorker Howard Fast is amazing. I liked the contents and events in this book more than its 19th century counterpart - \\"Red Badge of Courage.\\" Each is worthy of class room instruction and attention. I only wish this had been included in my curriculum."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning was a pretty good novel. I liked this novel because was an excellent portrayal of the Revolutionary War since it was very detailed, informative, realistic, and from the point of view of a young, truthful, teenage boy(Adam). Adam very freely expressed his opinions, emotions and everything around him in a vivid way, that the reader can get an excellent idea of what the people fighting in that war must have felt. One thing I didn't like about the story was some parts were boring, and somewhat a waste of time. For example, at dinner, Fast described what the families usually ate, how it was made, its origins, different variations, ect. In a way, this was good if you had no idea about the people at that time, but it was not due to its amount of bore. Last, I most importantly enjoyed this book because I can relate. For example, Adam is in a relationship with Ruth like most teens, and involves the death of a loved one like all people deal with, and it shows how hard people workded back then just like how hard people work now. I think that this book is for those teens who can't stand history or social studies, and for those who love historical fiction since it gives you an idea of what happened in such a good way. But, I really enjoyed this book because it had action, suspense, and yet was realistic. I rate this four stars instead of five because of the above reasons, and it was not the best book of all time, but it is definately a classic and I applaud Howard Fast for this excellent novel."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning is a good and informative book, because it is a story and not a pile of information. I was able to learn a lot about the Revolutionary War and everyday life in colonial times. Not only information about the Revolutionary War was given but also the types of food that was eaten in colonial times. Colonial dress and games that the children played were also explained with great detail. The book was easy to relate to because it was written through the eyes of a teenage and the situations are similar to what teenagers go through today. Being a girl, I would have liked to have learned more about the contributions made be women to the first battles of the Revolutionary War. Overall this book was great and a must read for historical fiction lovers:)"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"In my opinion, &quot;April Morning&quot; was a positive change from modern day war novels. The descriptions were unique and interesting in comparision to other war novels. At times the novel went a little too far describing bloody bodies and bodily functions but overall detail was the books'everything. My most favorite portion of the story was the characters love for each other. Fast showed a classic example of romanticism through hardship. The true power of love overcame a war. That was merely the best part of the book. This book was different from any other I have ever read before and I recommend it to anyone who loves a good reading experience. Even though I myself might not be too fond of this genre, the book in general was fascinating! Read it!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that Howard Fast's April Morning was very well writen and that if anyone who has the chance should read this book. The book was a rude awaking for what happen on that day and it tells us all what was going through the minds of everyone. In our history books it is just boing fact after boring fact but in this but it is kind of like a fun history lesson. The book was boring at first but once you got to know the characters it started to get interresting. I personally liked young Adam Cooper the best because when it came down to it he did what had to be done to stay alive. And anyone can respect that. April Morning was one of the only books that I have read cover to cover because i was interested with it. I think if you are stuck between reading this book or another one you should diffently read this books."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I have recently read the book April Morning in my eigth grade challenge reading class. Overall this book is a suitable way to inform students about the American Revolution but is certainly not something I would read on my own time. The excessive details, which make it a good, non-conventional way to inform students about this war, also serve to make it one of the most boring books I have ever read. It also has a very slow start during which information is given about Adam and his family which is irrelevant from a teaching point of view and just flat out boring from my personal point of view. Furthermore, although the battle scenes are well thought out and slightly less boring than the rest of the book, they are extremely gory and disgusting. For example, wounds or methods of death for fallen Redcoats or Americans are throughy described in all their horrible detail. Although some of these aspects make it a good way to learn about the American Revolution in a class such as Social Studies, I don't believe that it is a good choice for a Reading class. Our time in this class could be much better spent on more challenging and interesting books. The only reason I gave this book two stars is because it is, in my mind, a good way of educating students about the Revolutionary War from a more personal point of view. In conclusion, the book April Morning, although highly suitable for a Social Studies class, is not something which I believe should be read in Reading class or read for entertainment."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"It was a good book with some drama and a true story about history."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This book had lots of EXCITEMENT in it!"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"We had to read this book for reading class and the book was one of the most boring book that I had ever read. The author is a very good writer. Howard Fast writes very descriptively about the battle. I think that for his next book he should write a book that will capture the intrest of the teenage students. Most teenagers are not interested in learning about Historical fiction. So the reason that I gave this book a three was because it was witten well on a boring subject."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever attemped to read.

I think you have to really be interested in history to like and understand this book. To me, it's highly boring and pointless.

As I read this book I liked it less and less. I found the it to be boring and pointless. It uses language and content meant for a more adult audience, yet is written in a style a fourth grader should be able to read. Furthermore I did not think the author did a good job in writng it. He has no substantial plot or interesting dialouges. Because of the lack of creativity and talent Fast uses gore and foul language to attract his audience. A book read in school should be one that relate to the reader and is creativly styled and worded, rather than nothing more than a trashy novel."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"this book was pretty rad. Some people think that this book has fowl lanugage and stuff, but who doesnt curse. Also, the book was kind of slow in the beginning, but once the British came to town is got better.

In the beginning a young naive kid of fifteen signs up to defend his city against the British. In the end an old child of fifteen goes to bed.

It was told with startling realism and I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think I should be honest in writing this review for the book &quot;April Morning&quot;. I thought that this was the most boring book that I had ever read. While this book is boring, the writer, Howard Fast, uses many details and he is a very good writer. Howard Fast writes very descriptively about the battle, and in debth of a families point of view. I enjoyed how Howard Fast described the grandma's time of panic when she had just heard that he son was shot. I found it very detailed and descriptive, it was also, what I think of as the best part of the book. Most of the boys in my class enjoyed the book because it was about a war. But I think that at times there was a little to much information given out, for example when the soilder got shot and some of his brains came out. While disscussing this book in my reading class, we stumbled upon a very interesting and conterversal subject. That subject is, should this book be read by 8th graders because of the language usage. Many parents disapprove of this book, while few think that since most children have already said the cuss words that it is okay for them to read it. I was wondering what everyone thinks about this book being approiate. I only gave this book two stars because of the detailed description."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"First, the reason of the book, I think, was to teach young kids tabout the Revolutionary War and how it started.I think it did not do a good job keeping you into it, but if it had been a textbook it would have gotten the point across.Second, the book can just go on and on about nothing to important,like what kind of ingrediant is most used in a dessert. If you wanted to read this book on your own time,you would get more sleep done than the book. If your a teacher it would be an okay choice to use as a learning book, though the novel can get totally off topic and really just dumb."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning by Howard Fast is a decent book, but not one of the better ones I have read. I feel that to much emphasis was placed on details and expressing emotions that the story was not kept up to speed. For instsnce, when Adam saw the people of the militia being killed, the author describes the horrible feelings that rise up inside Adam masterfuly. Also, when Ruth and Adam were taking a stroll, following along, you would think it took much longer than it likely did because the author did not compress the details enough. You would not discribe a chicken as &quot;feathery, soft, cream colored, bad tempered,brainless chicken, but rather something along the lines of &quot;a mean-spirited chicken&quot; or &quot;a white chicken.&quot; Howard Fast is obviously not a feminist, as you can see from his book. All the females either stay at home or bring water to the men as the men fight. However, Fast is a master at describing the emotions felt by a young boy. If that is the sort of thing you realy enjoy, this book is a must read."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I think that April Morning is OK. It uses excellent detil, but it draws out the important parts"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I had to read this book for high school summer reading and overall I hated it. There was too much detail and switching from the main character's thoughts to the events going on around him. There were times where the character's thoughts jumped around so much that it was impossible to figure out what he was thinking. The most entertaining part of the novel was the battles. These scenes were well thought of and well written. There was short and good detail about the transpiring events and the main character's emotions as he saw them transpire around him. I do not recommend this novel to teen readers, especially for enter tainment. I only recommend this novel for those who want to see an historical event as it occurs."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I had to read this book for my english report and I truly was bored out of my mind.

I don't think I could reccomend this book to anyone, I wouldn't want them to suffer like I did."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I was forced to read this book for English, and It was not at all as good as the usual high quality books our English teacher has us read.

It had the talking and the action . I found that instead of having equal action and equal talking it was about 90 percent talking and 10 percent action. Okay 70-30 but still it should be 50-50. I thing it taught me alot about the revolutionary war and about our country. If it really came down to it I would read a violent book and just read this one for abook report or something"},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I liked kind of because of the action and the war.

If you skipped a few pages, then you would be completely off track. If you are looking for a book to tell you how life was during the struggling times of the Revolutionary War.

It is basically about this boy Adam Cooper who lives with his parents, grandmom, and his younger brother, Levi. He wants to go to war with his father and while he is there something upseting happens to him.

Neither do I think Howard Fast is (or, was) just a popular writer that shall be forgotten (or is already forgotten) in the future. If forgotten today, he shall be remember tomorrow. In April Morning he puts a wonderful light over an important historical period, and his narration is beautiful, his characters deep but yet loveable and exciting. The book should be read by anyone who wishes to read something catching, fun and thought-arousing. Its about war, but not about one distinctive war but about how alien war actually is to normal people."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"April Morning is terrible. Really, really, terrible. I had to read it for school, but that is far from the reason I hate it. I, in fact, love English class, and have enjoyed extensively every other work we have read in the class.But this is rubbish. Absolute rubbish. Fast has made a completely unbelieveable book, with no real storyline. There is no thread to tie the tale together; instead, the beads are all barely touching, with vaguely related plotlines.Frankly, after reading the useless back cover copy on my school edition, I didn't even know what the book was ABOUT until after page 100. Before that, it was a pointless, plotless bucket of dull. I actually had to plot out a certain number of pages that I HAD to read each day, and struggled with that.So, you're probably wondering why I gave it 2 stars? Well, the one thing April Morning does have going for it is a peek into Revolution-era life. The beginning of the book, if you are interested (as I am) in this, has some good tidbits. It also has many pages-long rants and rambles, that made me chuck it across the room once and almost break a window. (Tip: When chucking a book, do not throw book in direction of anything breakable.)I'm hoping the rest of English class is MUCH better than this. For a person like me who loves going to visit Revolutionary battlefields and landmarks whenever possible, and who is greatly interested in US history, I think that I could have gotten the same information, and much more, without the boring characters in a book on the Battle of Lexington and Concord."},{"Title":"April MOrning","review":"I thought that April Morning was a good book.

Even so, this remarkably religious period had a profound impact on the centuries that followed. The Roman church essentially took its current form during the medieval period. Priests and Bishops were educated and regulated. Monasteries and orders (the Augustinians, The Franciscans, the Dominicans) were formed. As political forces changed and consolidated through the period, the tension between Papal and secular authority increased. The schism between the Eastern and Western Christianity not only remained, but was further solidified. And, of course, the Crusades left a deep mark on relations between the West and the region spreading from Egypt to Constantinople.Dr. Baldwin does a nice job of walking through the narrative history, making clear connections with the religious, political and social realities of the time. This is a very readable book. And, given that it covers several hundred years of history, is quite short - just 124 pages. Although this is written from an independent viewpoint, he is respectful of all of the religious traditions mentioned in the book.This book is part of a series called The Development of Western Civilization published by Cornell University Press. The series was originally developed in the 1950's to provide an overview for incoming university freshman who lack training in history of civilizations."},{"Title":"The Egalitarians - Human and Chimpanzee: An Anthropological View of Social Organization","review":"The book Sex At Dawn, which I found to have many interesting points, though it also has what seems to me to be a poor attitude to those that disagree with them, brought my attention to this book. (I do recommend Sex At Dawn, just ignore some of the authors' comments on other researchers. It has much worth saying.) Sex At Dawn talks about how Power points out that the violence observed by Jane Goodall doesn't appear to have been common until the chimps started being provisioned. This provided the chimps with something to protect from others, as opposed to the harder to gather and more spread out food available in the wild. Sex At Dawn draws parallels, which I believe are valid, between this and the development of agriculture and it's effect on human society."},{"Title":"And You Give Me a Pain, Elaine","review":"Although there are three Marshall children, the entire household revolves around middle daughter Elaine.

She meets a boy with a wonderful sense of humor named Chris and just as she feels things are looking up, Elaine upsets the apple cart by running away. Elaine's disappearance causes even more tension in an already-strife filled household and yet it takes a tragic accident to bring the family closer together."},{"Title":"And You Give Me a Pain, Elaine","review":"I am an avid reader always have been and my family and I were down the shore, Wilwood NJ during an endless summer when all was well...My dad used to give me enough money for one or two \\"beach\\" books and I used to puruse all of the shelves to find just the right book - at the time I remember it was a Woolworth store we were shopping. I looked for my favorite authors and had read everything. I found this and took a chance, it turns out to have been one of my all time favorite books. Taking into account over 20 years have passed, I do remember the tragedy that brings them together and it's quite a shocker for a teen book that looks from the outside like fluff. It is not. It is a well written, right on the money teen angst book that I read a few times, which I rarely do. For anyone, teen or older looking for a quick read with a melancholy view, this is a great book...it's a shame I don't remember the author wriitng any other books..."},{"Title":"And You Give Me a Pain, Elaine","review":"This book is a very bitter-sweet book.

It's about getting along with hated siblings and having to &quot;deal&quot; with others!"},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"This book doesn't belong on your bookshelf it belongs on your desk beside your workstation. Mr. Packer's clarity, conciseness and comprehensiveness in his coverage of a complex topic is a tour de force that few technical writers are able to achieve these days. Written for an intelligent reader in mind, the subject matter is explained simply, directly and elegantly. No profusions of analogies, this author knows what he's talking about and he can explain it.The organization of the chapters is first-rate. You can get to the heart of the matter with a quick glance at the table of content. The indexing is excellent. I'm amazed that I can find an entry for most of the topics I'm looking up. It has become my first point of reference for configuration and tuning issues.Do yourself a favour, BUY IT! I'm already looking forward to the second edition of this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"it's about time for a new edition. Since 2002 there is Solaris 10, ASE 15.0.2, Oracle 11g, etc. I agree with all of the 5 star reviewers and there were no print quality issues with my copy. Biggest problem would be for Mr. Packer to assimilate and digest all of the information from the new RDBMS software available now. If I could I would give this book 6 stars. (By the way, many of the chapters would still be relevant for specific RDBMSs running on AIX, HP, Linux, etc.)"},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"This book is a MUST for anyone involved in Solaris performance management.Not only does Alan Packer provide incredibly useful information regarding how the Orcale, Sybase, Informix and DB2 databases work but he also gives many hints and tips on Solaris-related issues.From process management to data storage, there is something here for anyone involved in administering performance on Solaris servers.Also, the content is very much up-to-date with coverage of Solaris 2.6, 7 and 8.An excellent read, very informative and well written"},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"I bought this book thinking that i would get some good ideas in order to get a little bit more performance from our servers, however once i started reading i could not put it down until 5 hours later.It cuts all the small talk, and it breaks down every topic in an understandable format and teaches you what you really need to know.The section on how to improve DISK performance was great, i implemented many things that i learned from reading this book.Just buy it, you wont regretit.Its a small price to pay for a good piece of mind."},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"This books answers the questions that most others do not. A very technical approach, with great editing and no errors. The books covers architectural issues, Oracle tuning but scores really big in optimizing the Solaris environment (OS and hardware/disk)."},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"Don't be deceived by the title. Although this gem focuses on Sun's Solaris operating system, which is a widely used flavor of Unix, much of it is applicable to AIX, HP-UX, Linux, etc. Packer's considerable breadth and depth of knowledge and experience show on every page. He shares a discipline with his readers that enables them to configure and tune their databases and operating systems.A sampling of headers illustrates the broad, ambitious scope of the book. Topics include SMP, NUMA, Clusters, tuning the buffer cache, database optimizers, OLTP, DSS, memory management, logical and physical storage, system sizing and capacity planning, high availability, performance troubleshooing, measurement tools and analysis, database and system tuning guidance, scalability, strengths and weaknesses of the TPC benchmarks, etc. Packer successfully covers his material by focusing attention on what he has found to work and has a significant performance impact. Many of these are found in rules of thumb that are generously sprinkled throughout the book.Packer shares a layered approach to a complex subject. He builds an architectural foundation (operating system fundamentals and RDBMS internals). His database discussion is limited to Oracle, DB2, Sybase, and Informix. If one uses another product, his discussion should highlight architectural areas that should be understood by system administrators or database administrators (who all too frequently understand their domain but not the other's). The same level of product understanding is necessary to configure and tune other products for performance. Packer builds on a architectural foundation with metrics and analysis. He presents a methodology that is pragmatic and efficient.Experts might quibble over minor details; of course, it is impossible to gather a group of seasoned Oracle DBA's to discuss performance without heated arguments. I have much the same approach to performance analysis. I differ from Packer in the order that I approach performance problems; nevertheless, I do the same things.For such an ambitious book, Packer is to be applauded for scoring a series of solid bull's eyes. I highly recommend this book to anyone concerned with configuring and tuning complex applications. You will learn a methodology that will serve you for years to come."},{"Title":"Configuring and Tuning Databases on the Solaris Platform","review":"The content of the book is very good; with information not found elsewhere.The print quality is horrible.

The instructions are very good but you might need to help a child do a reverse fold for the first time. I would definitely suggest this for creative children or for a beginner at origami.The papers in the back of the book are extremely nice and designed full color and labeled in the margin for each page. Each set of instructions has two sets of paper for it so my kids don't even argue about who gets to use which paper."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"This is a nice book of general origami figures. For those who have never done it before, the book gives clear instructions and a good introduction to the basics of folding the most common and enjoyable of the figures. To you I would suggest reading ahead before you complete a fold. It will make the concept clearer for you and prevent frustrating mistakes.For those who have practiced origami for a while, there's probably nothing new in the book except the delightful papers provided at the back of the book. While not the traditional designs, these papers provide some pretty new ones motifs and some thoroughly delightful scenic designs that fold up into a shape that presents a unified image. You'll enjoy them, I think. I plan on using my copier to duplicate them for use in projects so that I can kept them nice."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"My kids (4 and 6 years old) love this book very much. We pick some to work on every day and they love to share what they made with their friends. They can follow the graphic instructions in book with a little help from me although my 4 year-old cannot read yet. They learn fast from the book and they feel proud of themselves when they teach other kids to do the origami. They love the origami paper coming with the book and they also like to make it from other color paper and decorate it in their own way. It is a place where they can really use their imaginations and be creative."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"Great book for the beginer in origami.

The diagrams maybe okay if you already know what they are suppose to look like at each step, but as a teaching aid they compare to teaching American children from a hieroglyphic test.

This book could easily drive people away from the art through frustration."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"This book is a lot harder than it looks and some of the things don't look like what they are supposed to even in the examples.... We will keep trying though as I love the paper themed for each project."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"Our book was missing 18 pages, but Amazon replaced it for free. The instructions are easy to follow, and there are several illustrations on each page so that you don't have to keep flipping through the pages for each step.They use special paper for each animal, box, etc., which is distracting when looking at the final product to really see what it looks like. You just have to do them yourself and see how they turn out.The book doesn't seem to have all the classics, but it has a good variety. The best part of the book is the first few pages. They give instructions on the basic types of folds as well as instructions on &#34;bases.&#34; For example, the first several steps you need for a lot of the birds use the &#34;bird base.&#34; This is helpful when reading other books and finding patterns on the internet. Have the book open to the &#34;base&#34; page, and you're half way to making many other patterns."},{"Title":"The Joy of Origami","review":"I had purchased this book for myself some time ago and when my grandson expressed an interest in playing around with Origami I picked him up one for Christmas.

This book brings back a few of the old patterns, but it's mostly fun, new projects.

I would recommend some practice with the basic folds at the beginning of the book before moving on to the actual projects.The included paper is gorgeous and just the right size. The only problem was that I quickly ran out of it--but a trip to the art store fixed that and now I'm folding away to my heart's content.

There is nothing worse than trying to create an origami piece with your child and get so confused by the instructions your frustration nearly causes you to rip the paper to shreds in front of your startled little child.

There were allot of \\"what the hell\\" moments reading the instructions, and those were the level 1 origami instructions. I have not gotten this frustrated in a long time and found myself speaking roughly to my children. Parents stay away from this book. It is not for beginners, its more constructed for electrical engineers."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"This is BY FAR THE WORST Eloise book. So many people wrote glowing reviews that I bought it, but really... it's awful. The main thing you need to know is that unlike the other Eloise books, this one is all in VERSE, and, although I love Kay Thompson, she's no Dr. Seuss. If you need another fix of Eloise, buy Eloise In Paris instead."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"She was my childhood favorite up to and including trips to the Plaza in NYC...this is a very good look into her life and personality combined with Xmas spirit!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"My granddaughter, who is the same age as Eloise, loves this story and anything Eloise. The book is different from the movie but just as much fun as can be!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"One of my Christmas treats to myself this year was sitting down after a holiday visit to Manhattan to spend some quality time with Eloise, the little girl who lives at the Plaza with her Nanny and her pets. I had previously read all the other Eloise books but this one, and generally like the little scamp. If ever there was a holiday made for Eloise, who loves to dress up in sparkly jingly costumes, crash parties, and get presents, it was Christmastime in mid-20th century New York.\\"Eloise at Christmastime\\" has a very simple and fairly short storyline focusing on Eloise and Nanny's preparations for celebrating Christmas at home on top of the Plaza. In that regard, it's more similar to \\"Eloise Takes a Bawth\\" than the earlier Eloise books that were more complicated. \\"Eloise at Christmastime,\\" which is not only short but is told in rhyme, might thus be a better way to introduce younger children to the \\"Eloise\\" series. Despite Eloise's unconventional lifestyle, her energetic preparations and mad dashes around the Plaza in her pre-Christmas excitement are pretty universal to all kids who can't wait for Christmas to hurry up and arrive. One nice touch is that, far from being a greedy little girl, she seems to get just as much joy out of giving presents to all of her family and friends as she does about receiving them, even though her ideas about what constitutes a good gift can be kind of weird sometimes (again, typical of childhood thinking).As with most of the Eloise books, Hilary Knight's illustrations are the star of the production and really make this relatively simple story pop off the page. The main reason why I did not give five stars is that I understand some illustrations were removed or reduced in size to make room for new ones in the re-released edition. While getting new illustrations is a nice thing, I would prefer they not be added at the cost of getting rid of the old.Also, I was a bit sorry Eloise's entire Christmas story took place within the Plaza (although I can certainly understand Nanny wanting to keep her there as she is enough of a handful without releasing her on the rest of Manhattan). Just think if Kay Thompson had let her heroine go out and explore the Christmas windows, the Radio City annual Christmas show, the Macy's Christmas parade, visiting Santa...but I will just have to picture those happenings in my imagination, unfortunately!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"One of my favorite children's books ever, and a must at Christmas!

I always chuckle at Eloise's exploits."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"It was one of my favorite books as a child and was one of my daughters favorites, as well.

It was truly a holiday treat!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"As a nanny, I had to get this book for the girls I watch, ages 4 and 2. It was a very good book but I have to say it will be more enjoyable when they are older..say six or seven..to really get the words, story. Anything that gives credit to hard working nannies gets my vote!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"This book is a wonderful way to read more about Eloise and enjoy the holidays at the same time. I grew up with Eloise, but didn't know about the three sequals until recently. I've been delighted to find them, and was thrilled with this one. The pictures are perfect and the verse is adorable and excited. A lovely book."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"Celebrate Christmas (no, not \\"holiday\\" folks, CHRISTMAS) year-round with New York's favorite poor litle rich girl, Eloise! Inside this book we not only get to re-visit the ball of energy that is Eloise, but we're treated to an always more-insightful-than-it-seems view of life and society, circa 1950, as the Plaza Hotel girds itself top to bottom for that most festive of celebratory occasions. Eloise is in high form here, and so is Nanny. The usual cast of characters is back and it's a rawthur cheerful read that has made me smile since I was knee-high to a grasshopper."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"My daughter loves this product.

I do not recommend this book."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"My daughter loves all of her Eloise books and so do I..with the exception of this one.

At my request my5 1/2 yr old daughter received three Eloise books for Christmas, this title included along with In Moscow,and in Paris. She had seen Eloise in Christmas several times on TV & we both enjoyed the character. Thebooks however are another story. They are *completely* syncopated. Hardly a story line, just Eloise blabbingand talking off the top of her head. No rhyme or reason, just blurts & outbursts of talk. I always thought Eloisewas the character that caused fun 6 year old havoc at the Plaza, but no that is the tiniest part of these stories.Again just lines & lines of incomplete thoughts without a single plot other than the girl lives at the Plaza.I found myself deleting lines and reading ones I made up my self to help make sense to my child. Picture your 5 year old high on a 1 pound bag of sugar, bouncing off the walls....that is Eloise times 1000. If you don't believe me, please go look at the book before you buy it. I have the feeling the author was blessed with accolades from something like the Emperors new cloths syndrome...it's wonderful, it's marvelous, but really there's nothing there at all."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"My 4 year old got this book from grandparents, which I observe appears to be the same generation that has written all the glowing reviews of this book. I guess it paints a picture that appeals to another generation, but I really don't get it.This is the worst book I've ever read my child. I've read her quite a lot, and I am very progressive in my choice of books.The English in the story doesn't make sense, including incomplete sentences and fragments of ideas. The story is almost stream of consciousness, but not quite. There is also a random attempt to rhyme, but often the rhyming words are several lines apart, after the child would recognize a rhyme had happened.The plot seems to consist of: Eloise ran around the hotel, opened presents, got the annual call from her an absent parent, and ends with her proclaiming her nanny her best friend:\\"Here is who my absolutely best friendin this whole wide world isNanny\\"The morals of the story seem to be:-have fun at the cost of others-you can leave your child with a nanny during Christmas as long as you phone-christmas is about presents-money is everythingDid I mention how long this book is? It's three or four times longer than any children's story has a right to be--and I enjoy reading books to my kids."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"I had the original &quot;Eloise at Christmastime&quot; and there are a few subtle changes in this printing. First of all there are 4 wonderful new pictures by Mr. Knight but they took out one of my favorites, Eloise on the couch with Nanny in front of the fire. Some of the pictures have been reduced to put another picture on the page. Lastly the floor plan of the Plaza folded out in the original printing. Those are the differences that collectors will be happy about.I am so happy that my nieces and nephew will be able to finally have a copy of &quot;Eloise at Christmastime&quot; of their very own and they will be able to pass it on to their children. Hang two-legged Christmas stockings and read this book almost every night before Christmas."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"I think that this is the strangest of all the Eloise books! I remember that the first time I read it, I'd scratch my head and go, &quot;huh?&quot; when I saw all the weird holiday ideas and gibberish words. Sometimes it makes me wonder what in the heck Kay Thompson was taking at the time! Needless to say, even though it is very good, it's not my favorite Eloise book. I've read all the Eloise books... they provide great maxims for daily living, such as &quot;getting bored is not allowed&quot; (the first book, &quot;Eloise&quot;). I repeat this to my friends a lot of the time. Anybody, whether child or grownup, can learn a lot from Eloise."},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"This book was purchased by my mother back when my sisters and I were little. I was given the copy my mother had when I had the first grandchild and my sisters were angry about that! But now they are finally going to get their own copies for their family library and all the grandchildren will be able to read the hilarious adventures of Eloise!"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"This book is the oddball of the Eloise sequels, being the only one that also is also focused at the Plaza (like the original) and uses a rhyming scheme. Everyone who has loved Eloise must have wondered about how she fares without her mother living with her Nanny, pug (Weenie), and turtle (Skipperdee) in the Plaza on Christmas. The young woman who was born to shop (and order room service) adds a whole new meaning to Christmas for the guests at the Plaza and those who work there. If you require high quality rhymes, you may not like this book. If you can lightheartedly enjoy fractured verse, hotel high jinks, and great Hilary Knight drawings, you'll love it!The story starts on Christmas Eve, as a blizzard blankets the Plaza, and the temperature drops to four below zero outside. But inside it's warm and cozy, and there's a blazing Yule log in Eloise's fireplace.The story recounts Eloise's tree trimming, gift-giving to everyone she knows, getting ready for exchanging gifts on Christmas under her Christmas tree, and prowling around the Plaza on Christmas Eve in typical Eloise fashion. She hits all the parties and helps the people celebrate from room to room as well. You can imagine the mayhem that creates!One of the most beautiful segments is Eloise dreaming about Santa Claus coming. This section will touch your heart, if you are like me.A high point for Eloise is opening her present from Nanny. You'll love reading about it.After you finish enjoying this warm Christmas story, I suggest that you take a few minutes to think (as Eloise does) about all of the people (and animals) you can show your appreciation for during the holidays. I'll bet Eloise inspires you to take a broader view of thankfulness. What better gift could you receive at Christmas?Ooooooooooooooooooooooo! I absolutely love Eloise"},{"Title":"Eloise at Christmastime","review":"This was the first Eloise book I ever read, I was 7.

There is a strong market for railway history, antiquities and nostalgia in Britain, and my own collection of literature on bygone railways is quite extensive. However when it comes to the Findhorn Railway I wonder how many of my fellow enthusiasts have so much as heard of the railway itself let alone of this book. Indeed I wonder how many even know where Findhorn is. It is an erstwhile port on the shore of its own little bay that gives on to the Moray Firth via a narrow neck of water, now I believe largely silted up.The railway is some kind of record-holder for sheer obscurity. You will not find it, for instance, in the Ian Allan Railway Atlas and Gazetteer, which details all the railways of the British mainland in the year 1923. This is because the Findhorn Railway's existence did not even get close to 1923. It was opened without much ceremony in 1860, and it ceased effectively in 1869, when the Highland Railway pulled the plug on it by refusing to work its 3-mile length any longer. I say advisedly that it \`ceased' rather than \`was closed', because I am not sure whether it was ever formally shut down. Years after a wheel last turned on its metals the tax authorities were still demanding its accounts, and sundry hopeful creditors were still chasing the money owed to them. It made a junction with the \`main' line at Kinloss (now of course closed in its turn), there was little by way of engineering works along its short course, and apparently a few signs of its short career can still be observed, particularly at Findhorn itself.The book is short, as you would expect, but it seems very precise in detailing the few \`events' of the line's brief life. Particulars of its course and rolling stock are given, and there are even a couple of pictures of its solitary locomotive. It was a \`proper' railway, not a light railway or tramway, but it is just another of the completely futile schemes that characterised the railway mania in Britain, although giving up the ghost at a realistically early date when many another puffed on hopelessly.5 stars?

Despite the statements which I have claimed about the quality of the book \\"Cheap\\", I still believe it passes my test by a mile, and it's explanations are extraordinary, namely for beginners.

It contains some very common words that everyone should be familiar with such as allusion, carpe diem, or doublespeak. But it also contains many less common words such as assonance, deus ex machina, or metonymy. Would you be totally in the dark if someone described a speech as a Jeremiad? You wouldn't be if you had read this book. Each of the over 110 entries starts with a quote that illustrates the word or defines it. This is followed by other information that might include etymology of the word, common uses, examples, or other interesting facts about it. &quot;Lexicon for Lovers of Language&quot; is a witty and well-done book.

Unlike the other ones, he is symbolically the main character here. In this work, Miller writes a cathartic explanation of his life including two failed marriages, one to Marilyn Monroe. Rather than entertaining, it comes off as rather unsettling.The main character, Quentin narrates to the audience in the show. He is viewing his past as the various people in his life appear in a sequence of events. Through his childhood, we see hints of the origins of the problems the character faces, such as a manipulative mother. This seems to be the justification he uses for failed relationships. By Holga being the last character we see, it seems that he is insinuating that he should have never left his first wife. At the same time, he clears himself of any fault in the demise of Maggie (the veiled symbol for Marilyn Monroe).In reality, there was a lot going on in the play. Perhaps it was even too busy. But even more worrisome is Miller's use of the stage to justify or rationalize his life. I love Miller's work. This play, which was intended to be disturbing, is disturbing in a way which Miller could have intended. It is one play the work could have gone without."},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"With themes such as innocence, responsibility, self-examination, betrayal, and more, this is a far reaching, hard hitting play.

It is presented in a much less formulaic, more postmodern arrangement than his other works. He tackles goodness and sin in a manner uniquely his own, examining what modern man must seek out in life.

The brilliant text of Arthur Miller is brought to life. Rarely put on, this story of man, searching for himself and for a woman he will not repeat the same mistakes with, is fascinating and sad. It's also disturbing and moving that an author should commit to paper, and thusly to posterity and for everyone to read, his own questions and failings. Because the line is terribly thin. Miller shows at the seams of every scene. It's him fighting with Marylin, it's him redeaming God know what past... It's good.

Its protagonist, Quentin, in whose mind the play is enacted, subscribes to a simple credo: \\"You tell the truth, even against yourself.\\" The play is fabricated as a trial or, more fittingly, an inquest in which the moralist, Quentin, sits in judgment upon his own conscience, his own values, his own actions.Quentin, now retired from the practice of law, examines and cross-examines all aspects of his being: his distorted emotions, marital complexities, and other intimate struggles. The result is that \\"After the Fall\\" becomes a big, demanding drama. When staged, the play typically occupies a full three and a half hours, time spent in a relentless search for answers. Has Quentin's life been lived in good faith? Can, in his remaining years, he reach beyond self-condemnation to some measure of hope? A tortured process of self-discovery finds him fighting against innate fear, his unwillingness to unearth what Miller labels \\"the seeds of his own destruction.\\" It is a fundamental, personal need to know that serves as the backbone of this otherwise a loosely structured play. Whether you are reading the dialog and stage direction on the page, or are sitting in a theater audience, you will likely be engrossed in his journey, since this is your journey too.For the personal is the universal. At the same time as we are learning of intimate events in Quentin's life, a universal drama unfolds. Miller's intent is for \\"After the Fall\\" to present a broad study of mankind's terrible predisposition to cruelty, our evasions of responsibility, and our final seizure by remorse. After wildly ranging over times past, the play returns us to the present where Quentin is considering marrying a German woman who survived the Holocaust -- an experience that permitted her to accept human blindness and failures. She is the catalyst helping him universalize his personal predicament. The climactic scene in this process finds Quentin pausing in the shadow of an imagined concentration camp tower looming over his meager self. He asks: \\"Who can be innocent again on this mountain of skulls? I tell you what I know! My brothers died here . . . but my brothers built this place; our hearts have cut these stones! And what's the cure!\\"It is in \\"After the Fall\\" that Miller strives, with a greater urgency than in any of his other theater works, to enter into a dialog with essential works of twentieth-century thought and literature. Consider \\"Gerontion\\" (1920), in which T.S. Eliot posed the key question: \\"After such knowledge, what forgiveness?\\" Notice how, at the close of \\"After the Fall,\\" Quentin seemingly confronts Eliot's entreaty: \\"Is the knowing all? And the wish to kill is never killed, but with some gift of courage one may look into its face when it appears, and with a stroke of love -- as to an idiot in the house -- forgive it; again and again . . . forever?\\"Again and again: There was something in Miller's plea that reminded me of words uttered just a few years after the opening of \\"After the Fall.\\" Before a stunned audience in Indianapolis, Indiana, on an evening in 1968 when news spread of the Rev. Martin Luther King's assassination, Robert F. Kennedy spoke. Without notes, at first haltingly but then with earned authority, Kennedy urged upon us this credo:\\"We have to make an effort to understand, to get beyond, to go beyond these rather difficult times . . . . Aeschylus once wrote: \`Even in our sleep, pain which cannot forget, falls drop by drop upon the heart, until in our own despair, against our will, comes wisdom, through the awful grace of god.' What we need . . . is not division . . . not hatred . . . not violence and lawlessness . . . but is love and wisdom and compassion toward one another: A feeling of justice.\\""},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"With themes such as innocence, responsibility, self-examination, betrayal, and more, this is a far reaching, hard hitting play.

A great play for a casual read, an amazing source of scenes, and a wonderful play for production"},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"Arthur Miller's After the Fall is a highly autobiographical account told by a man named Quentin who has suffered through a difficult family life, two marriages, and the McCarthy Trials. It is depicted artistically by freely flowing from scene to scene with no regard to time or location, but the artistry in the continuity does not make up for the dullness of the overall story. The play reads as if this man is in a therapy session describing the painfully dull events of his life. He explains his shaky family relationships along with minor events from his childhood, his nagging first wife Louise and the attractive neighbor who made him start to think disloyally, and the struggles of co-workers faced with deciding between integrity and their careers. Although these events might seem like they could be earth-shattering, especially the McCarthy bit, Miller manages to drain them of any excitement or intrigue.The bright spot in the play is Maggie, a highly self destructive but free spirited girl who becomes Quentin's second wife. Though when I first read the play, I had no idea of the connection, Maggie is Miller's interpretation of Marilyn Monroe. This is the sole reason that anyone who is not a fan of Miller's work would want to read this play; one gains insight into how immature and below him Miller considered Monroe to be.If you are interested in Arthur Miller outside of his relationship with Marilyn Monroe, you might enjoy this book. If you are interested in the human mind and the way experiences shape a person, you have a slight chance of enjoying this book. If you are looking for a story with a rising action, a climax, and a fall, you probably will hate this play."},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"Arthur Miller's return to the stage after a break of 8 years, in 1964. His famous ex had died in the meantime. Much, but not all of the play is about the Miller&Monroe; story. A lot of the rest is about McCarthy and personal attitudes towards that challenge.Main character is a depressed lawyer who talks to 'a listener' and has people from his past show up for conversations. A stream of consciousness on the stage. Premiere was staged by Elia Kazan in New York, with Jason Robards in the lead. Not a critical or public success.The dialogue scenes invoke Quentin's parents, his friends and his women. Chunks of conversation are given to the parents' marriage and their death. The Great Depression looms large. The father was bankrupted and the family nearly broke up.Then McCarthyism looms large, friends are affected and react in different ways. 'Strength comes from a clear conscience, or a dead one.'Marital conflict is the background noise in all couples, the parents, the friends, and Quentin's marriages.'Can we lay it all to mothers? Aren't there mothers who keep their dissatisfaction hidden to the grave?'If wife Maggie is meant to be a portrait of Marilyn, one must consider it a rather unkind one. The woman lives in another world. She is, frankly speaking, not quite right. Reminds me of the recent movie about Marilyn's cooperation with Lawrence Olivier, but the play is much more corrosive than the film.Quentin's is not a very kind portrait either. Quentin has lost his moral compass. He doesn't know what is right or wrong in the McCarthy stress, and meeting a woman like Maggie while his first marriage is floundering, rocks his boat badly. Maggie is impossibly attractive, endlessly naive and, with a not so benevolent perspective, rather promiscuous. The marriage dialogues are hellish, and the helpless waif can be quite nasty.Future wife number 3 takes Quentin to visit a concentration camp. 'No one they didn't kill can be innocent again.'She has spent time in forced labor herself. That gave her this feeling of guilt. And it gave her trouble at immigration to the US, where she is suspected of being a communist. Why else would the Nazis have locked up a non-Jew? (we occasional visitors to the US all know about the intelligent questions at immigration. Do you plan to commit a crime?)My summary: much better and more interesting than I expected after the negative opinions. This is emotional exhibitionism, but we are used to that from other great American playwrights. I am not able to 'like' it though. It is too nasty. Miller does not grow on you as a human being by this work. Would he have been able to invent an incredible person like Maggie?"},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"This play is way too sophisticated for my tastes. I am only half-way through it and I am only going to reach the end because I am the kind of obsessive-compulsive individual who must finish a book or a movie or an audio book once I start them. I do violate this rule once in a while, but this play is too short to resist...Anyway, I think LA Theater Works is a FANTASTIC publisher and I love most of the many plays of theirs I have listened to, but this one is above my head. I find the actors truly outstanding, but the story and the dialog are broken and confusing. Once in a while a short sequence will hit me as meaningful and compelling, but usually this is in the midst of other rather obscure dialog or monologues.I have loved all other plays by Arthur Miller I have listened to so far, so I guess I just do not like this form or disconnected high-brow semi-autobiographical story telling. I really do not want to be dismissive. I can believe that there is much more to this play than what *I* can understand, but I just don't get it."},{"Title":"After the Fall: A Play in Two Acts","review":"The Biblical title \\"After the Fall\\" provides clues to what this play is about. Miller uses sophisticated language and characters [an attorney, Quintin, and a singer, Maggie, which appear to be stand-ins for Miller and Marilyn Monroe], to present a serious drama about the primary problem of mankind, for which Christ died on the Cross to try to relieve man's pain: guilt. Guilt is dealt with on three different levels in this play: in love relationships, on the political level represented by the House UnAmerican Activities Committee (HUAC), and on the more universal level represented by the Holocaust.Guilt is a killer, which is why it's the major theme of the Bible, as well as of this play. It makes people emotional cripples. Guilt has been a problem that man has had to deal with ever since \\"after the fall\\" when Adam and Eve disobeyed God.Besides guilt, although its connected, another theme is people in relationships demanding perfect love--that only God can give--from imperfect people. In one scene, Maggie says: \\"Jesus loved Lazarus, didn't he?\\" Maggie is identifying here with Lazarus. Jesus brought him back to life after he died. That's what she wants from Quintin: for him to make her feel alive. This is the kind of love that she needs and is demanding from Quintin. She is using guilt to punish Quintin because he can't love her, on the level of Jesus's love for Lasarus. No man can. It's an unrealistic expectation, but that is the kind of love that the love-starved Maggie needs in order to survive, but she can't find it, because she is looking for a love from a man that only God can give. And the reason that Quintin, or any man, can't give that kind of love is because of guilt. Christ could give that kind of love, which he demonstrated on the Cross, when He died for mankind so men wouldn't have to have guilt, if mankind came to understand God's perfect love. Making another to feel guilty kills love between people. [It's what people mean when they say \\"Don't lay a guilt trip on me.\\" In this play, Maggie and Louise are laying tremendous guilt trips on Quintin. This kills relationships.] Maggie, as well as Quintin's herridan of a wife, Louise, are punishing Quintin because he can't love like Christ. Maggie says to Quintin that he is her God, but that's just too much responsibility for him, or any man, to live up to. When Quintin fails at that kind of love--because he isn't God, but only a man--Maggie can't deal with it and self-destructs. With her suicide attempts, she is also trying to kill Quintin with guilt. To quote Quintin: \\"Suicide kills two people.\\" When one tries to kill themselves, they usually are trying to kill someone else, too, and they're using guilt to do it.The character of Holga is much more mature than the other two women, Maggie and Louise, but even Holga is crippled by guilt, but just a different kind. Her guilt is because she survived the death camps during the Holocaust while so many others didn't. The difference between her and the other two women is that her guilt has nothing to do with Quintin and she isn't laying any guilt trips on him, which makes their relationship much more mature with a possibility for survival. The character of Holga makes it possible for Miller, in this play, to deal with the problem of guilt on a different level, which adds much depth to the drama.On the social/political level of the UnAmerican Activity Committee trials during the 1950's, the guilt arises from Quintin's friend having to decide to give HUAC names or not to give them. Quintin knows that if his friend names names that eventually his friend may not be able to deal with the guilt because Quintin knows that he couldn't. And the guilt does cause his friend to commit suicide. Quintin also has guilt concerning his Mother, who is also one of the women in this play, which is where his guilt all started. Quintin's women relationships haven't been too hot, at least not until Holga. If this play is autobiographical, it chronicles Miller's emotional journey through life."},{"Title":"Basics Of Winning Keno","review":"This book does an excellent job of explaining the various types of keno tickets.

No need to blame it on the casebook.If you are a scared pre-1L reading these reviews thinking, \\"oh crap, why did my professor have to assign the confusing Yeazell casebook,\\" don't bother. It really comes down to how good your professor is at explaining things, not the casebook. Having said this, I actually think the notes, cases, and examples are all well edited and presented clearly.Just a note, in class Professor Yeazell started on \\"The Process of Adjudication Examined\\" section, went to the end of the book, and then came back to personal/ subject matter jurisdiction section (the first section of the book) at the end of the semester.

There are cases after cases that are supposed to help you understand civil procedure, but there is little discussion of the law itself or about why the court decided the first case the way it did but did the polar opposite in a second, similar case. The questions that are provided after the cases are designed to help you analyze the law, but they are of little help when you have no foundation. Most people will probably need to consult at least one other source to understand civil procedure. If your law library provides a hornbook, make it your best friend.

My item was shipped quickly. I recommend purchasing from this vendor and plan on doing again myself."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"Note to Civ Pro professors: please don't use this book.First, Yeazell's book forces the student to guess the court's interpretation of the FRCP and and law. It does this by providing unfocused edited opinions. The opinions are so poorly edited that they become confusing. Often I found it would have been better to just leave in the entire text because the author's constant and obsessive desire to pare down the opinions using ellipses is ineffective. It just doesn't work. Yeazell might want the student to see the case from his perspective, but it's not coming through. I suggest that Yeazell just write his perspective after exposing the student to the actual, unadulterated text of the case. Yeazell is not getting his point across with the edits.Second, the structure of the casebook doesn't align with the typical 1L casebook. Specifically, the Notes and Problems sections (these are a constant thread throughout the book) rarely add clarity to the procedural topic. The Notes and Problems sections often pose hypothetical questions, which is a good idea in theory, but the questions are rarely answerable or answered. Maybe that's the point, but a 1L student doesn't need curve balls like this. If you're going to pose a question, you must give the student the tools and information to find the answer. Yeazell doesn't always do that. Further, the Notes and Problems that follow most of the cases refer to other cases that might not have been part of the assigned reading. Sometimes the Notes and Problems in one chapter allude to briefly mentioned Notes and Problems hypotheticals in another. The content is so jumbled that a 1L student will find it frustrating to understand the point.Finally, the casebook is not updated, contains too many errors (spelling, grammar, mechanical), and isn't easy to navigate. The latest edition still refers to pre-2010 Rules. The student must find an old version of the FRCP and then translate those rules to the current rules just to understand what Yeazell is talking about. The table of cases is lodged in the back of the book. Most troubling, the grammatical errors make the student question the veracity of the message. How do you know what you are reading is accurate when there are obvious grammatical errors?Overall, this was my least favored 1L casebook and I think the other reviews here and elsewhere echo that sentiment."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"If you remotely understood the humor in my header than this book is fine for you. The truth is Civil Procedure is not exactly the stuff that made us want to be lawyers, but when we finish law school, who is going to forget Asahi, or Erie!, or World-Wide Volkswagen, or hmm... Gibbs! Yeazell has all the cases you need in here. I do think Semtek in the Erie section is odd because preclusion has not been introduced. And I think it is the odd placement, if you read the book linearly rather than jumped around, that makes some of the reviewers here hate this book. But this is one of the better books. Couple this sucker with Glannon and presto you will be screaming \\"There ain't no subject matter jurisdiction under 1331--it is all a lie!\\" In no time.

Also the note sections, which usually serve to help students make sense of the case that was just read, are more often than not filed with unhelpful questions with no guidance on how to answer them or what the answer would be.I ended up buying the Hornbook by West and that easily became the text that I used (along with the Fed Rules book) to understand Civ Pro.I fell sorry for you if you have to use this book.*Note review is for the 6th edition."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"I have mixed feelings about this book.

I can say without reservation that this book will completely fail to stop even 9mm rounds. They went clear through. Predictably, it did even worse against 7.62 NATO rounds.

I never did this, but I've heard it helps when there's confusion.-Prepare a case-brief while re-reading the case, incorporating the knowledge obtained from the notes-Review 1/2 hour before classDuring class/TA sessions:-Take detailed notes! Fill in anything you might have missed/misunderstood, and anything else you deem important (especially anything the Prof. puts on the board, or writes on projectors, or asks hypos of, or gives out handouts for)-Refer to your case-brief, and be courageous in your answer when called upon (the Socratic method is for your benefit, though it may feel like torture)-Pay attention to how Prof/TA goes over the problems and answers-Ask questions about anything you might have missedAfter class/TA sessions (directly after-wait too long, and this stuff might fly out of your brain):-Add condensed and important points into outline (which you will use as your study tool for finals)-Add answers to problems into outline-Mark up rules/sections in the FRCP Yeazell supplement pertaining to important class discussions-**Important** - Attend office hours for Professor (or TA - but not as important b/c TA not testing you) and discuss ANYTHING you might be hazy on - Students rarely go to office hours. Those that do, get the top grades. Go figure.-**Optional, but important** - Form study groups to go over class material/outlines/complain about CivPro-Review material weeklyAfter this is complete, rinse and repeat.Before finals:-Finish up outline (should be almost finished before end of classes), and read over repeatedly until you're confident with materials-Take practice exams (especially essays)-If you have time, go over practice exams with Prof/TA/study groupLaw school casebooks like Yeazell's are almost never straightforward so they require all these steps so you actively learn. If most of these steps are not taken, it will probably lead to confusion, panic, just overall bitterness from a nebulous source of education.---advice from an overachieving 1L"},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"I actually liked my Civil Procedure class, but I hated doing the reading for it because it meant I'd have to use this book. The layout is thus: You read a case, and then you are presented with a series of questions that apparently you're expected to be able to answer on your own - in effect, you have to teach yourself Civil Procedure as you read. Interspersed with the meaningless (at least to the confused 1L reader) questions are little facts and tidbits related to Civil Procedure which aren't that important, but since they're the only information in the discussion section not presented in question form, you glom onto them in the hope that knowing said facts and tidbits will help to clarify Civil Procedure for you. All in all, easily one of the worst textbooks I've ever had."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"This book is basically worthless, except as a makeshift booster seat or placeholder on a bookshelf. I read this book, then I read the Glannon E and E. There is no comparison. Glannon illuminates, and Yeazell simply asks tedious questions with no answers given. My advice would be to use Glannon as your text and only use Yeazell for the cases.Also, I should mention, don't drop out just because you find this book incomprehensible. I did fine in civ pro using mainly supplements for learning the material."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"The author who wrote this book must have had only one intention- to confuse the reader. There is nothing remotely good about this book. It is edited very poorly to the point where it makes absolutely no sense. The author hides the true meaning to the cases. If you don't have a VERY good civ pro teacher, you will have no idea what you are reading. I don't understand why someone would take the time to write over 800 pages and deliver no purpose to the text. It is so bad that if I was an incoming law student, I would probably turn down a school if I found that they used this book for their civ pro course."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"First is the review and then how I managed my study time using supplements and the FRCP. This is by far the worst text book we used during my 1L year, because after each case it has a few explanations, but typically just asks TONS of short questions W/OUT ANY answers! The purpose is to get you thinking about the topics and spend weeks figuring them out yourself. I listened to my 1st semester prof and used solely this book and the rule book (used minimally first semester). This was by far the worst advice I have ever been given, because the book will waste your precious time or make you stop reading altogether. However, there is a way to make the class interesting and gain the necessary info with minimal wasted time. Also, each semester is almost like a completely different class (one is theory and one is rules).I used various supplements for this class. Before buying all of them (like I did) I would go to your law library and look them over, use them for your class and see if they are presented in a way that works for you. If not, then buy whatever you can that is most useful and use the library's books as needed. My biggest mistake was thinking by using supplements to supplement my casebook I would learn less or get screwed up. Professors tell you whether they like supplements or not, but if you use them to prepare for class, still at least go through the cases and take NOTES from what they say, you will do far better.I will explain the books I used second semester, which is less theory and rules based. Before each class topic I readAcing Civil Procedure (Acing Law School)and then outlined the rule in my own words using the Commentary sections inA Student's Guide to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure (Student Guides)to fill in and flesh out the rules. I then read throughEmanuel Law Outline: Civil Procedure Yeazell (Emanual Law Outlines)skimming and highlighting the key points in this casebook and adding the extra info to my rule outlines. This made class easy because I simply noted the key comments and wording my Prof used and modified my outline accordingly. After class I quickly organized the rule outline and moved on. This may seem like a lot of time, but it was about 3 hours a week. Beware of spending too much time on the supplements and rule outline BEFORE class. Much of the material in the supplements and casebook is not covered in class and therefore a waste of time.When many spent extra time making their outlines, mine was complete and I spent an hour or two each week working through hypos and questions fromCivil Procedure: Examples & Explanations 5th editionandGlannon Guide to Civil Procedure: Student Manual. I added any issues and fact patterns I came across, to my rules outline. Before the exam I condensed my outlined rules, worked on hypos, and used the hypos we went over in class to see how Prof would work them into the exam. Overall I did not spend much time understanding the cases in their entirety . After the first week of class you should have typed down every question asked in class, because this is what the prof will ask the rest of the year. This makes it easier to skim cases and determine what is necessary and what is a complete waste of memory and time.For first semester, this was my worst class. My 1st semester Prof was not very good and I did not practice hypos and writing out answers as in 2nd semester. What I learned was to USE SUPPLEMENTS. I used them in half my classes (best grades) and not in the other half (good but worse). I managed to use Emanuel to catch up and made a great outline, but I spent far too much time with my wording in the essays. This is whereUnderstanding Civil Procedure, E&E; and Glannon Guide (multiple choice) came in. Even without multiple choice exams, these short practice questions really help hammer out the trickier parts. The hypos help you learn to quickly write out your answer. The Understanding series is GREAT for your first semester, because it more in depth and helps you understand the overall concepts better. Also, many prefer E&E; to other books for explanation, but I found it better suited for hypos.These books collectively were not necessary , but they sure helped. If you are short on cash, the best books from most helpful to least are your required casebook, FRCP Student's guide, Emanuel (if not using Yeazall, the keyed edition to your casebook if possible, if not then case briefs should work), Acing Civ Pro (AMAZING short book with great checklists to work through the rules), Glannon Guide, and then E&E; (if used for hypos, although there is a newer ed). For first semester, the Understanding book was excellent to read before anything else (do not read too heavy), because it is highly explanatory. I have found canned briefs useful from online and the various case brief books keyed to your casebook. Acing Civ Pro was the best book, but not the most needed if short on cash. See my other reviews regarding the above books mentioned. However only the first couple paragraphs will be different.Good Luck, I will try and answer any comments!"},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"This was my favorite casebook of my 1L classes. I have no complaints about it. Things I like: Plain English writing style, use of modern cases (Internet, etc.), extensive use of hypos as questions after cases, thought-provoking and difficult questions - many of them with answers or hints. If you can do these, you'll be prepared for whatever issues appear on exams."},{"Title":"Civil procedure","review":"I think my title sums it up.

Nearly all of the reports include the order of battle and commanders for both sides, with the outcome where known reported in terms of causualities (killed, wounded, captured and missing) as well as overall victor and significance of the fight.The value of O'Kelley's book are the narrative reports of skirmishes and small encounters as well as the major battles of Cowpens and Guilford Courthouse. The narratives are concise, but usually with enough detail to get more than a flavor of the actions and personality of the leaders, particularly in the bloody clashes between Whig and Tory partisan bands, many of which gave no quarter as some clashes were more for revenge than for political or military gain. \\"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter\\" demonstrates that nowhere in the colonies was the fighting so extensive, so personal, so destructive as in the Carolinas.All of the \\"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter\\" volumes are essential for any student of the American Revolutionary war and/or for students unconventional warfare.O'Kelley is a retired Special Forces Master combat veteran and an avid participant in Revolutionary War recreations, and with those experiences provides an insight most historians miss. His research is extensive, with much of the incidents he reports about being ignored in the history books. He does an excellent job of separating myth from fact. For example, many believe the Revolutionary War ended with the surrender of Cornwallis at Yorktown. Not so. O'Kelley is now working on a fourth volume, reporting on incidents of warefare in 1782 and beyond.The only negatives are more of a nuisance rather than flaws in reporting. Volume III is riddled with typos and, as in Volumes I and II, he uses endnotes rather than footnotes, requiring the reader to constantly be thumbing back and fourth. However the end notes are extensive,often more enlightening, adding to the authenticity of O'Kelley's exceptional work."},{"Title":"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter: The Revolutionary War in the Carolinas - Volume Three 1781","review":"Patrick O'Kelley seems to have covered every Revolutionary War Battle and Skirmish for 1781 for N.C. & S.C. in this book. He has done the same for 1771-1779, 1780 & 1782 in his other books. These are a must have for the Revolutionary War enthusiast or researcher. Most of the South Carolina Battles are in this book."},{"Title":"Nothing but Blood and Slaughter: The Revolutionary War in the Carolinas - Volume Three 1781","review":"I fugured I would get the information I needed about a particular battle for some genealogy research I was doing, then donate this book to the genealogy department of my local library.

Part One - &quot;The Final Solution&quot; deals with the Nazis' plan to exterminate the Jews of Europe, including pieces of Nazi legislation, minutes from meetings, and various orders. Part Two - &quot;The Holocaust&quot; - presents a Jewish perspective of life in Germany from 1933-1939, of the ghettos in eastern Europe, and the ordeals of deportation. I have yet to find a finer book in terms of providing a succinct collection of Holocaust-related documents. It has worked well for me and my students in collaboration with reading Raul Hilberg's _The Destruction of the European Jews_."},{"Title":"A Holocaust Reader (Library of Jewish Studies)","review":"This book was expertly compiled from primary source documents concerning Jews, Nazis, and the Holocaust. The types of documents range from personal accounts to govt. papers. There is a very wide variety of types and subject matter. The reading level varies from piece to piece. This book is good for historical research, termpapers, and documentation. I highly recommend this book, but not to read straight through just for fun."},{"Title":"A Holocaust Reader (Library of Jewish Studies)","review":"A Holocaust Reader is an excellent collection of source materials. The book is divided into eight sections, more or less chronological, on the different stages of the disaster, starting with German anti-semitism in 1880, and running through the mass deportations of the Jews and Jewish resistance. Each section is preceded by a 3 or 4 page summary that helps the reader approach the documents with better understanding. The book has only two maps, a shortcoming for people like me who want a better idea of where things took place. But on the more positive side, it provides well documented source information and suggestions for further reading. I also found an appendix estimating the number of Jews killed in the final solution by country of origin to be helpful. This is an excellent book for fleshing out other Holocaust readings and by giving insight into the lives of real people during that time."},{"Title":"Daily Warm-Ups: Journal Writing","review":"As a teacher I have a DO NOW as the students walk in.

Predictably most of the photos are of events as they happened rather than posed images and therefore the photographers had no control over what was being captured on film but so many of them are full of fascinating detail.The three hundred photos have been selected from the archives of INP, ACME, UPI and P&A; and as you look through the pages it becomes apparent that many of the images are not necessary of great events, fortunately disasters don't happen daily, but of everyday happenings to people or places that readers would be familiar with. The demand for photos was huge, by the Thirties the New York Daily News was using two and half thousand a month and in the case of these tabloid papers the headlines and photos were the main selling point.The production of the book is excellent, most pages have a single photo (in 175dpi on a matt art paper) and caption, frequently reproduced in the language of the day though I do find it odd that only a few photographers are credited, the rest are just listed as Photographer Unknown. Perhaps the perfect complement to 'Picture Machine' is Marianne Fulton's 'Eyes of Time' (ISBN 0821216570) a comprehensive study of photojournalism and you might like to have a look at my Listmania 'American photojournalism, in books' for some other related titles.***FOR AN INSIDE LOOK click 'customer images' under the cover."},{"Title":"Lee and Longstreet at High Tide: Gettysburg in the Light of the Official Records","review":"Helen Longstreet, the second wife of Confederate Genneral James Longstreet, works at length to set the record straight concerning the politics that &quot;tarnished&quot; Lee's #2 man in the Army of N.

Longtreet in a effort to mask their own questionable civil war records or to enhance their own current reputations and that of Gen. Robert E. Lee. This book was Helen Longstreet's response to that attack.Keep in mind that at age 17, Helen Dortch was editoress of the Carnesville Tribune newspaper, in Carnesville, Georgia. As a newpaperwoman, she possessed all the investigative and writing skills necessary to cull facts from fiction. This is an excellent book in defense of her husband's reputation and was based on the Official Records. Unlike many others, she quoted from historical, not hysterical, facts."},{"Title":"Elizabeth/Alexandra: 2","review":"When I first started reading this book, I couldn't put it down, I was absolutely engrossed by the story, the writers wit, and wondering how much was fact, and how much was fiction. Instead of writing a compelling, factual ending, the author chose to digress into this absurd scenario that has both the royal sisters going crazy and living out their lives in a remote village. It was ridiculous and dissappointing. Even though the book was written before DNA testing its still unforgivable that the author should have gone along with the theory that the Romanov's were still alive somewhere, a theory that is put about regarding other legendary figures who died tragically young, from King Arthur to Elvis Presley and Tupac Shapur. Why, if any of the Romanov's survived, would they have lived out their lives in obscurity? Its implausible, and Mr. Lambton's constructed theory at the end of the book is lame and unconvincing."},{"Title":"Elizabeth/Alexandra: 2","review":"This is not the book for people interested in the Romanovs.Its a silly,misleadingbizzare, historical novel.So much misinformation is given,that it shouldnt even be called historical.

The true story of a family that sells everything to buy a boat and sail around the world. They only make it as far as the south pacific, but it makes for year after year of adventures. As a sailor myself (coastal, not blue water) I felt he did a great job of capturing the sharp contrast between the elation, exhilaration and sheer terror that can be found in sailing. Mr. Payson's honest, care free and \\"oh well\\" attitude is something that I wish I could capture for myself. Someone who does not mind laughing at himself.I only have one critique of the books. Mr. Payson uses nautical terms and the names of boat parts as if they are a part of everyone's daily vocabulary. I sail a simple sloop configuration and can name every component that is applicable to our boat. But his repeated use of terms unique to multi-masted, wooden masted, bow-sprinted boats kept sending me to the nautical dictionary. Since the book does not appear to be targeted at highly experienced sailors, a little more explanation would have been nice."},{"Title":"You Can't Blow Home Again","review":"With Herb Payson and his wife and stepson as they begin the vacation of a lifetime.

Anyone who dreams of a cruising life should read this book.

This was the worst written tale I have ever tried to get through.

Unbelievably inadequate."},{"Title":"A Small Percentage: A Dark Tale of Alien Invasion","review":"I'm shocked at the reviews this has gotten. Yes- the female reader was horrible, I also noticed this, but the other voices were fine, in fact the author read parts of it. The book really tries to make a point that, &quot;the innocent and the guilty are on both sides,&quot; sounds like a simple moral but it is expounded upon well. This story had me wanting to know what happens next and I was pleased with the way things were resolved. This is a good author."},{"Title":"A Small Percentage: A Dark Tale of Alien Invasion","review":"First off, if a lot of typos, a slightly less refined writing style, and a few points of bad grammar annoy you too much, then I wouldn't bother with this book.However, if you can see past those things and get into the story, then there is definitely some enjoyment to be had here.The plot basically centers around an alien invasion of the Earth. Humans are enslaved and taken over in all aspects by a technologically superior (and torturous/brutal) race of beings. A Small Percentage of the Earth's resources are all that are \\"requested\\" in order to resupply the massive, alien mothership. The humans fight back, as you know they will, and each attempt is described by the author in a way to at least keep the reader wanting to read more.It's not as predictable as most alien invasion books/movies, unless you base your opinion solely on the thought that \\"the human race survives\\" is predictable. The HOW has a twist or two.Overall, I enjoyed the book (after I got past the grammar issues) and am currently searching for others by this author."},{"Title":"A Small Percentage: A Dark Tale of Alien Invasion","review":"A friend gave me this book knowing how little I thought of Battlefield Earth (Book &amp; Movie).

Mankind will prevail despite odds and technology.A Small Percentage did show the kind side of the aliens (Jenny) and the humans (Clay)"},{"Title":"A Small Percentage: A Dark Tale of Alien Invasion","review":"I've listened to hundreds of audio books and I must say, the readers on this made this one of the all time worst. The male reader was okay. He attempted to change his voice for different characters and situations, and did a half-way decent job of acting out his lines. The woman reader almost had me in tears she was so bad. She sounded like a third-grader that had just learned to read and sound out words. Forget any acting, she just read the words, and quite poorly I might add.Why did I mention the bad readers first? Because they detracted from the story. The story in and of itself wasn't that bad. In the future, aliens take over the earth in order to get sorely needed resources for their race. Naturally, the humans aren't too happy, and with good reason. Some of the aliens are just downright cruel and mean. Others try to learn from the humans and learn about compassion. Then to make matters worse, another alien race shows up. What's a human to do? The answer is plan and figure out a way to get rid of the aliens.This book focused on the conflict between the humans and the aliens and the humans drive to take back the Earth and get rid of the aliens once and for all.Like I said, the story wasn't that bad, but it was no page turner either. I gave it two stars because every now and then something interesting happened that gave me hope the book was getting better. Then the woman reader would read her lines, and my hopes would be dashed anew. In my opinion, if you pass up on this one, you shouldn't feel as if you've missed anything. But, if you decide to be brave and read it, check it out from the library."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This is basically a rehash of the concepts given in B.H.

Strategy is much better for the money."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"Why do some generals do better than others? Bevin Alexander takes some of the great generals out of history and examines why they did so well. The author tries to point out the common traits and tactics each general shared. The selection of generals is interesting - Jackson and Sherman are picked over Lee and Grant.But Mr. Alexander is also willing to point out some of the bad choices that these good generals sometimes made. Napoleon, for example, did great in Italy but in latter battles used frontal attacks instead of mobility and misdirection. He let the size of his army get in the way of good generalship.The final chapter tries to tie it all together, listing simple ideas or rules, that all great generals followed."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"A look at the factors that led great military leaders throughout history to succeed. As Sun Tzu recommended, many used misdirection. Stonewall Jackson excelled at misdirection to tie down the Union Army in the Shanandoah Valley during the approach to Vicksburg early in the war, which even McClellan might've pursued if he had the troops guarding the valley. Scipio Africanus attacked Hannibal in Italy by crossing the Mediterranean to strike at Carthage itself. Guderian struck through the Ardennes after Germans attacked as exected through Belgium and France,achieving such success it even made Hitler nervous. MacArthur went against all the common wisdom and invdade Korea at Inchon, slashing through the overextended North Korean supply lines to cut off their frontline troops at the Pusan Perimeter.Napoleon in his early years specialized in another approach: maneuvering around to attack at the rear.Sherman followed another strategy in advancing from Atlanta, sending out several columns, each threatening more than one city, then struck unexpectedly at an undefended target.These and other strategies and how they have been used by military leaders from Genghis Khan to Mao to Rommel to Allenby are examined in this very interesting book and summarized in a helpful final chapter."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This book is omnibus reading and have great pictorial illustrations.

His overall thesis was certainly proven well, and he chose those generals who best proved his point. I particularly liked the chapters on Hannibal/Scipio, Genghis Khan, Sherman, and Rommel. This work could have been a five star book; however, his chapter on MacArthur was where the book lost me. Militarily speaking Alexander continued as he had throughout the book, but his political overview of the Communist threat was almost as ridiculous as was Toland's in 'In Mortal Combat', which dealt with Korea. Hence I do concur with one of the other individuals who reviewed this work that his objectivity is lacking in his more modern chapters. Nonetheless, save for the last chapter, this was a good overview for someone starting to learn about miliraty history and strategy, or it is a nice refresher."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"The choice of Generals to review did span much of recorded history, but huge chunks of history were missed. The first third of the book covers only 3 generals in all of recorded history up to 1800. Then the rest of the book (disporportionaly) covers the last 200 years. The review of campaigns was interesting, but some maps showed the flow of battles and others seemed to just be filler. The final two chapters on Rommel and MacArthur were done in too much detail. It became a deluge of unit identifiers and was hard to follow. All the recounts prior to these last two included not just historical review of engagement, but included analysis of what made the generals great -- not the last two recounts. I completely missed why reviewing and repreatedly reminding the reader of MacArthur's grand failure made him a great General? Finally, why were no naval and aviation generals included? Perhaps the book should have been &quot;How Some Great Generals Won Some Ground Wars&quot;."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"Bevin Alexander's book may redefine the meaning of &quot;great&quot; commander for some of its readers. A lot of readers are in the same classroom as I when it comes to military history. I grew up accepting that the generals presented to me in history class were the best because my betters said they were. Especially,when it came to the Civil War. They don't cast bronzes of incompetents, right? Maybe, maybe not, but Mr. Alexander did a convincing job explaining why some of history's spotlights are on the wrong statues. A lack of military history won't prevent anyone from reading and enjoying his book. He will set the stage for each adventure and allow the reader to be swept along by the likes of Hannibal, Lawrence of Arabia and Erwin Rommel without loosing him. These stories are real, first class, adventures and that's how Mr. Alexander's book comes across."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This is the best written compilation of short histories of many pivotal battles in world history that I have ever read. The chapters on the Civil War and Hannibal are outstanding. I appreciated the maps with each chapter, but many geographic points the author thought were important enough to put in the narrative were not put on the maps, such as Sherman's multiple column routes through the Southern states (some shaded or dotted map arrows would have added to the story)."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This book takes the reader through time and history as the author describes why certain generals won, or lost their wars. In particular, the author tries to show how certain techniques or tactics used from Ancient Rome to Genghis Khan to Napoleon are still applicable today in the modern world. Indeed, when these tactics are not used, in Korean for example, the author reveals how he feels the generals have let down their men; and their country.As a primer, this book is good. The author has a good grasp on basic tactics and very interesting facts about history. For example, when fighting armies who have elephants, the Romans had bells with them which they would shake, scarring the beasts and making them useless for the battle.As I said, overall this book, as a basic guide, is very good. It is not for those who have a solid background in this area already. For me, though, it was very interesting. I particularlly like the earlier chapters. In my view, as the booked came closer to present times, the author's emotions and personal feelings made him less objective. This took away somewhat, from his conclusions but, overall, the book was still a fun read."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"While Mr. Alexander writes in an colorful and gripping style, and the book is an enjoyable read, the few new insights he offers are often on the based on the most frivoulous ground, or simply untrue. For example: hie posit that a naval blockade was what ultimately defeated Germany in WW I is patently false. Germany had for centuries been the 'land power' of Europe - free of any need for supply from precious colonies - while Britain was Europes 'Sea Power.' Even before Bismarck unified Germany, she was quite self-sufficient in the vital raw materials that kept her war machine alive, (albeit vulnerably dependent upon weak allied states for some of these materials,) and in no way shared Britain's vulnerabilty to naval 'strangulation'. It was no accident that the overpopulated Island had long maintained the World's most Powerful Navy, or, that Kaiser Wilhelm II's rash attempt to challenge Britains dominance of the seas was a major contributing factor in Britain's entry into the War. Yet Mr. Alexander mentions 'naval stangulation' as the principle cause of Germany's defeat in WWI, in a short footnote in a chapter detailing Britains ultimately successful campaign against the Turks in Paalestine!Sherman is his choice for the Unions best General - he is derisive in his treatment of Grant - yet he fails to recognize that the strategy that sent Sherman plunging deep into the South and destroying her capacity to wage war was one formulated by both Grant and Sherman, or, that Johnston's smaller and much more easily outflanked army, was hardly comparable to Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, nor that Grant largely followed same strategy of outmaneuvering his outnumbered opponent, until he had forced Lee to retreat to the Gates of Richmond. Also, with John Bell Hood appointed as the Confederate Commander in the South and Johnston relieved - as Sherman assembled before Atlanta - Sherman faced a rash General that destroyed large parts of his Army in repeated, blundering assaults. One might mention Grant's foolhardy and costly assault at Cold Harbor, yet Grant learned from this mistake - and with Lee Penned within the Richmond/Petersburg defenses - he skillfully expanded his breastworks around Peterburg until the smaller Confederate force was forced to retreat, leading durectly to Union victory. Sherman - while a brilliant General - faced no such tactical genius as Lee, and took Atlanta with comparative ease...Such is the nature of the book: Mr. Alexander makes passing points - which are enormously debatable or simply false, (i.e., Britains naval blockade of Germany as what ultimately won WW I for the Allies,) or he simply rehashes famous military campaigns. All in all a work of mediocrity."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This is the first book I read on war strategies. It is really a fascinating read, and in a way reads like a thriller. The battlefield is like a chess game, with opponents trying to outsmart and deceive each other. The book offers the reader a fascinating journey through the minds of some of the most famous generals in history. Readers will be introduced to the strategies of Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, Genghis Khan, Napoleon Bonaparte, Thomas J. \\"Stonewall\\" Jackson, William Tecumesh Sherman, T. E. Lawrence, Sir Edmund Allenby, Mao Zedong, Heinz Guderian, Erich von Manstein, Erwin Rommel, and Douglas MacArthur.The author points out the exceptional as well as the bad choices that generals make. The reader will learn many war strategies which are fascinating to say the very least. For example, when fighting armies with elephants, the Romans shook bells, scarring the elephants and making them useless for battle.Generals can succeed in one war but utterly fail in another. MacArthur is referred to by the author as the Jekyll and Hyde. In the Pacific theatre, MacArthur gained fame as an invincible general. However, during the Korean War, he made one mistake after another, and exposed his armies to unnecessary danger. Despite his tactical disasters during the Korean War, his fame and legend led the Truman administration to approve his disastrous strategies (as a footnote, many historians note that the United States has not won a single war since World War II!).Deception is the main key to victory. Hannibal took his army through the formidable swamps of the Arnus River in Tuscany in 217 B.C. rather than face the Roman army directly. Not expecting such a move, the Romans left the route open, permitting Hannibal to emerge behind the Roman army with a clear road to Rome. This forced the Romans to abandon their strong position and rush after the Carthaginians. Hannibal ambushed the dislocated Romans at Lake Trasimene and destroyed nearly their entire army. Almost 70 thousand Romans dies that day!The Carthaginians in Spain believed Scipio Africanus would strike at their armies and left unguarded their capital and principal port, New Carthage. But Scipio had deceived his enemies. He seized New Carthage in 209 B.C., cut off the main sea connection with Carthage, caused several Spanish tribes to come over to the Romans, and abruptly threw the Carthaginians on the strategic defensive.Genghis Khan was another master of deception. He focused the attention of the Khwarezmian army by fierce attacks on cities along the Syr Darya in Turkestan in 1220. He then led a Mongol army across the supposedly impassable Kyzyl Kum to seize Bokhara, far in the enemy rear, isolating the Khwarezmian capital of Samarkand and blocking reinforcements from the south. In a single quick campaign, the Mongols captured Samarkand and destroyed the Khwarezmian Empire.By demonstrating with part of his army at Valenza on the Po River in northern Italy in 1796, Napoleon convinced the Austrian commander this was the sole French target, drawing Austrian defenders to that point. Napoleon then marched the majority of his forces downstream to Piacanza, thereby turning all possible enemy lines of defense, and forcing the Austrians to abandon all of northern Italy except the fortress of Mantua.When strong German forces attacked Holland and Belgium in 1940, British and French mobile forces rushed northward to block the advance. Erich von Manstein, knowing this would happen, sent his panzers through the supposedly impassable Ardennes to seize Sedan, which was defended only by second-rate troops. When this occurred, the German panzers had a clear path westward to the English Channel, trapping the Allied armies that had rushed into Belgium and ensuring the defeat of France.The last chapter of this book covers the lessons learned in the war campaigns of the last 2,000 years. The author points out that war remains an art rather than a science, despite the immense amount of invention, industry, and technology lavished on war since the beginning of organized society. He further adds that although the principles of war are simple and can be learned by anyone, the application of each principle requires much care, skill, and caution.I personally enjoyed the chapters on Hannibal, Scipio Africanus, and Genghis Khan the most. But let us not forget that war is a dirty business, and people die! It would be better to compete at chess games or at the Olympic Games. There are many none aggressive and none destructive ways to show one's talents for strategy. Hitler should have spent his days playing war games on his PlayStation 3 when he was not earning a decent living. I am against glamorizing war. The irony of life is that one is sent to the electric chair for killing another in cold blood in a dark alley while one is glamorized and hailed for bombing an entire city, killing thousands (the allied bombings of German and Japanese cities during World War II).One minor issue I have is that I did not like the cover of this book. I read the July 1995 Avon Books edition. The cover portrayed the generals in a cartoonish manner. For the scope and seriousness of the book the cover did not do justice to the book."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"Bevin Alexander's book is an easy read, and he does a solid job supporting his theses about why certain General's were very successful. I doubt that anyone will agree with everyone of his selections of Generals and campaigns, but this book can serve as a good starting point for discussions about strategic planning for success in warfare.I had some problems with the authors selections (of course who are the great generals throughout the ages is a matter of opinion), and some of the overall conclusions in certain campaigns. For example, Mr. Alexander states that Lincoln would not have won re-elction unless Sherman captured Atlanta before the election without fully supporting the argument. Instead, he simply states this opinion as fact. Also, the maps were a little lacking at times. I agree with a previous reviewer that more detail on the maps would have helped.Despite these shortcomings, I recommend this book for any military history bookgroup looking a book to generate discussion about military strategy, or anyone looking for a nice addition to their military history library."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"Great generals win by attacking the enemy's flank or rear, thereby distracting and dislocating the enemy from his supplies, communications, and undermining his confidence. Direct attacks merely consolidate an enemy's defenses and even if he is defeated merely forces him back on his reserves and supplies. That in a nutshell, is the argument presented by Bevin Alexander in his study of ten great generals, ranging from the ancient world to the modern day. Yet most military leaders have not followed these precepts. According to Alexander, these methods require imagination and cunnning, whereas society views deception suspiciously (Although Edward Luttwak suggests that the reason is that indirect methods require more supplies and effort). Using this analysis, Alexander not only shows us how great generals win, he also shows us that some generals thought of as great were in fact mediocre or poor. For example, Alexander claims that Sherman, not Grant won the Civil War. Grant used direct methods to attack Lee in 1864 and in one month lost 55,000 men, twice as many as Lee. With the meat of his army gone, his forces bogged down in front of Petersburg for nine months. Meanwhile, Sherman used speed and deception to win the war. In his campaign against Atlanta, he refused to launch frontal assaults on enemy entrenchments. Instead he went around their defense and continued to march on Attanta. This forced the enemy to attack him on his terms, and he inflicted great losses on them. He then cut the rail lines to the city. Atlanta was abandoned and Sherman marched across Georgia and the Carolinas, sapping the Southern will to fight. \\"The purpose of war is to diminish the possibility of resistance,\\" not necessarily to destroy the enemy's army through battle. Speed and mobility are the keys to this strategy. And the ten generals written about here used these techniques to win wars and change the course of history. Alexander would later build on the lessons he wrote about in this book and write his magnum opus, \\"How Wars are Won,\\" an even better study of military techniques."},{"Title":"How Great Generals Win","review":"This is a superbly written book by my favorite military history writer. Alexander writes in a very readable style. Additionally, the maps and charts are easy to understand and complement each chapter. Of particular note are the chapters on Hannibal and then Scipio Africanus (the Roman General who beat him) and Lee (or how General Lee should have fought the Battle of Gettysburg)."},{"Title":"The Beggar King: A Quest for the Mystic Female","review":"The Beggar King is an allegory that can be understood on several levels. On one level, The Beggar King is an adventure story about a young king who enters a forbidden room in his father's castle where he discovers a portrait of a beautiful and mysterious woman--the Grail Maiden--the one chosen to tend the Holy Grail and heal the human heart. The portrait awakens in the young king a universal longing for the Mystic Female and speaks to him of suffering and grace. So the young king dedicates his life to finding the Grail Maiden and freeing her from the powers that enslave her.On a symbolic level, the Grail Maiden is the king's anima, his life principle or Soul. The king discovers that the Grail Maiden is enslaved by Patriarchy--the dominance of the masculine archetype, yang, over the feminine archetype, yin, through the institutional powers of family, tribe, and religion. On a psychological level, this dominance is manifest in the cultural preferences we give to extroversion over introversion, thinking over feeling, and the left hemisphere over the right hemisphere.In order to free the Grail Maiden, the king must defeat three adversaries--a Black Knight, a Red Dwarf, and a three-headed dragon named Holdfast, who represents the Status Quo and the Patriarchy. He must also overcome three temptations and endure the perils of three curses--each of which test his fidelity to the Grail Maiden and, ultimately, his faith in God. In addition, each ordeal reveals a hidden psychological truth.In the end, the king marries the Grail Maiden, which restores the harmony of the two opposing archetypes--masculine and feminine, yang and yin--giving each its proper place in the Soul and in the Kingdom.So The Beggar King may be read as a tale of romance, intrigue, and spiritual devotion or as a psycological drama of the Soul's heroic ordeal. In either case, it is an easy read with lots of action and adventure."},{"Title":"Alice's Adventures Under Ground Address Book","review":"A must for all we lovers of Carrol's books, being Alices or the others."},{"Title":"The forest and the sea: A look at the economy of nature and the ecology of man","review":"The author of this wonderful book was inspired by a simple, enlightening observation: life in the rain forests is in many ways similar to life in the sea. The author sketches the basic comparison in the early chapters, and in the later paints vibrant, engaging pictures of life in several communities: in the forest and the sea of course, but also in deserts, grasslands, rivers and lakes, even in the water-collecting cup of a tropical plant. He creates a picture of a network of life -- all forms of life in all communities are interdependent, and all categories (including \\"forest\\" and \\"sea\\") that scientists and laymen use to classify biological communities are arbitrary and artificial. He describes some of the strange creatures found in the transition areas between land and sea in order to show that the boundary between the two is no more than a man-made expedient; the boundaries blur as we observe the communities that have adapted to life on both land and sea. He ends the book with a thought-provoking chapter on modern man's role in nature -- words that will be close to the conscience of any thinking person.Marston Bates obviously loved biology; reading this book I could feel the passion of a man who believed that his work was worth spending his life on, and that his life's work was worth recording carefully for other people. He must have been as passionate about writing as he was about biology: this is a well-written book. The rhythms of the prose echo those of the sea; the expertly-balanced sentences support his comparisons of seemingly disparate communities. This book is a treat for literate people, the kind of find that makes scouring the shelves of used-book stores seem like a sensible pursuit. Unfortunately, you may have to scour the shelves of several bookstores to find it, but if you can, get a copy of this jewel."},{"Title":"Silence will speak: A study of the life of Denys Finch Hatton and his relationship with Karen Blixen","review":"Very well written.

Eliot explores the inner motives and masks that people wear while keeping you smiling the whole while. Be careful though; while you may be delighted the whole while, Eliot is busy weaving a tale that truly gets right down into everyones personal hells. Truly a drama that only he could deliver. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"In a world of appearances, a new species of peace-makers has been invented. The priest of old has disappeared. The psychiatrist has replaced him. He is there to listen to secrets, to sort out situations and to propose solutions to human problems. The very few that are worth it can become the saints of today, going to foreign desolate countries and helping people out of their difficulties, fighting poverty and diseases, bringing the christian faith to pagan people, living in suffering and dire hardship. The others are helped to adapt to our society, to be successful in this society without feeling the remorse or the fear that come along with it. They just become adaptable, supple enough to fit in a deeply dishumanized society. The psychiatrist is the go-between for such people.This play is surrealistic and yet perfectly descriptive of reality. It is full of a new type of poetry, his poetry of love and hate, of a new type of drama, his drama of conflict-solving. T. S. Eliot manages to shift from the most superficial bourgeois drama to the deepest and serenest tragedy turned comedy. The path of these people is tragic in a way, but it ends in beauty or at least in harmony.Yet I think T.S. Eliot would have been better inspired if he had gotten away from this bourgeois aristocratic society that is nothing but vain cocktail parties and superfluous appearances. The great poet he is could have been a better playwright.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"I am personally not a fan of Eliot, due to the fact that I, most unfortunately, started off with &quot;The Wasteland&quot;, which is, as I am sure anyone reading this review will know, is not exactly an easy read, especially at age 12.

Eliot is best known for his modern absurdist poetry, which deftly painted landscapes and characters both grim and gorgeous. His attempts at drama seem much more of a mixed bag. While I greatly enjoyed \\"Murder in the Cathedral\\", I was not so amused with \\"The Cocktail Party\\".Eliot delves right into the action in Act I, with a small party of guests conversing in Edward Chamberlayne's London flat. Their host is distracted, and after all of the guests leave, he confesses his problem to an unidentified guest, that his wife has just left him. The unidentified guest mysteriously assures him that his wife will return the next day, as indeed she does. They each wind up meeting with a psychological consultant, who turns out to be the unidentified guest from the party. Through his circular questioning and the insights of their friends, he is able to convince the pair to find the answers for their ailments.\\"The Cocktail Party\\" has been reviewed as a tale about the search for the meaning in life. If that is the case, Eliot had few answers, although some interesting questions. This snapshot of 'modern' London life feels cold and one-dimensional on the page; the reader has no sympathy or feeling for any of the characters who are questioning the meaning of their existence. The first act is by far the strongest, with the second and third acts trailing weakly off into absurdity."},{"Title":"The Cocktail Party","review":"I am personally not a fan of Eliot, due to the fact that I, most unfortunately, started off with &quot;The Wasteland&quot;, which is, as I am sure anyone reading this review will know, is not exactly an easy read, especially at age 12.

It's the movie I HEART HUCKABEES.In both, there are ordinary people leading more or less empty lives, and the people they turn to for advice. These advisers have mystical powers or divine connections, but the whole show makes fun not only of the ordinary characters, but of the advisers and how they work as well.THE COCKTAIL PARTY is a more serious play, since Eliot believed in the Anglicanism his advisers dispense, and he even has a martyr as part of his comedy. But both shows use their unique heavenly personages very well and get a lot of laughs out of them. And of course we have to give Eliot credit for inventing this particular approach.There have been divine advisers before, of course, in plays like THE PASSING OF THE THIRD FLOOR BACK or MR.

Julia occupies the center of the storytelling. Edward is the host. Julia describes herself as a tough old woman. Edward claims his wife Lavinia is tending an old aunt in the depths of Essex.After most of the guests exit, Edward is left with the unidentified guest. It is learned that Lavinia has actually left Edward. Edward is told to resign himself to feeling ridiculous. Alex and Peter return. Peter is concerned about his friend, Celia. Alex doesn't want Edward to be alone.Celia then contacts Edward. She understands that Lavinia has left him. Edward fails to watch the dinner on the stove that Alex cooks for him and it is ruined. Julia returns. Celia remains and announces her interest in Edward to him. Julia's call interrupts the discussion. Her spectacles were left in the kitchen.The unidentified guest reappears. He tells Edward he will change his mind, but he is not free to change it. Celia and Peter come again. They say Lavinia telegraphed Julia. Lavinia arrives, knowing nothing about a telegram. Peter is going to California and Celia may be going away.Julia enters and next Alex. Everyone then leaves to accomodate the couple, Edward and Lavinia. Lavinia says she forgot all about the party. Edward tells how he invented an aunt.In another act Edward tells a doctor how he cannot live with and cannot live without his wife. He says the death of the spirit is terrifying. Lavinia arrives and claims that she merely wanted to talk about her husband, not to meet him in the doctor's office. The doctor says that they are both too ill to enter his sanatorium. He characterizes them as self-deceivers. Celia will enter the sanatorium.Act Three centers again on the drawing room of the Chamberlaynes. It is two years later. Julia and Alex appear and there is talk of tigers. Peter enters, having left Los Angeles three days earlier. He is a screeen writer. It is learned that Celia has died in a gruesome manner. Peter is disturbed because he doesn't think anything he does is important if Celia is dead. The physician notes that Celia has paid the highest price in suffering.

The first half is enjoyable enough: an unusually well-written English drawing-room comedy with serious overtones. The play begins to fall apart with the bizarre sessions of pseudo-psychotherapy in Act 2, and degenerates into overt Christian flag-waving by the final scene.Yet the play is still well worth reading. It is more accessible that Eliot's earlier plays and was a surprise hit on Broadway when it first opened. It is still occasionally revived today; one production featured Nancy Walker in the plum role of Julia, a seemingly scatterbrained older woman. (&quot;Salvation!

Stronger on Organization Theory (formally defined) than most of its competitor texts.Who'll Like It: Fans of Henry Mintzberg, Jeffrey Pfeffer, and the Harvard B. School &quot;Craft of General Management&quot; approach. Those interested in &quot;how do we get our organization to develop the capability to get something done.&quot;Who'll Hate It: Fans of the top-down, financial accounting, M &amp; A, rational strategic planning approach. Anyone who prefers to believe that the world of managing is simple or that it can / should be made simple by abstracting the people out of it.Other Observations: Miller's Chapter 1 emphasis on the priority of financial returns for stockholders seems at odds with the rest of the text. The rest of the text doesn't focus on this, but rather on leadership and development within the internal environment, and on aligning the organization with customer demands and the structural constraints of the external one. I think, too, that I'm partly attracted to Miller's text because of its underlying ethical tone. That may be a little antique, but closer attention to this aspect of management might have attenuated some of the corporate scandals of the late 1990's."},{"Title":"Strategic Management","review":"We still use this book in Knoxville, TN, but not because of popular demand. Not updated in over a decade; old examples, old theories and unrefined concepts; excessively wordy without imparting much knowledge. Need I say more?! What are the choices? In Knoxville, not many, as Alex Miller teaches in the Executive MBA program, but elsewhere -- how about Hill or Wheelen/Hunger or Prahalad?"},{"Title":"Strategic Management","review":"This book is divided into four parts, namely Strategic Analysis, Strategy Formulation, Strategy Implementation and Case Analysis. This book is like most strategic management books in terms of composition and content, but in part globalization is stressed and soft dimensions of strategic management process such as organization culture and leadership are put forward carefully to complement the hard structure of planning and successfully connected to the commitment philosophy of the strategy. Executive interviews feature in the beginnings of each chapter is very useful to get the perspective of corporate managers responsible for managing complex organizations.For an undergraduate student who is interested in strategic management theory, this book seems a well-organized preliminary source, but not enough to fully comprehend strategy concept and process approached radically different by theorists in the field. In addition to this book, you should read \\"Strategy Safari : A Guided Tour through the Wilds of Strategic Management\\" (Mintzberg et al ).Overall, I feel that this book would be a good starting point for students who intend on beginning a study on strategic management. I recommend this book with four stars."},{"Title":"Strategic Management","review":"This book give lots and lots of example of today's managment using theories. It applies every stage of management or marketing.

He has to find his boat before his bubble bath, and then his pajamas, his toothbrush and his huggy. And before his mother can get him tucked in he needs a snack and a drink, the closet door has to be closed, the bedroom door opened just right and his nightlight turned to low. Poor mother frog is getting pretty tired herself, but Froggy insists on a story. As mother begins to read, she drops off to sleep and begins to snore. Only then does Froggy close his eyes and fall soundly asleep. Jonathan London has written a gentle, funny story of bedtime delayed, full of wonderful, expressive illustrations and silly sound effects, that will delight and amuse all pre-schoolers. And as they watch Froggy's staying-up antics, many will recognize a little of themselves in the story. This is a book that is sure to become a bedtime favorite and a nice addition to all of London's Froggy stories."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"The simple illustrations are nice and the text is quite readable. But...I am not at all sure I would want the kids reading this one on their own without discussion. The little froggy is indeed a typical kid with typical kid reactions. I found that be best use for this book was to discuss with the children just what it was the frog was doing and why it was so wrong and what some of the ramifications might be for his actions. As an example, I use the tooth brushing battle as a way of explaining just what could happen to teeth that were not brushed properly. All in all this was a okay book but the parent or teacher needs to monitor and discuss each situation."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"We love Froggy books. We have them all. However, I was surprised to see Froggy \\"back-talking\\" his mother and telling her what needed to be done before he'd actually go to sleep. Since we already had the book, I chose to use this to teach my daughter that Froggy is wrong to talk back to his mother. We talked about how long it was taking Froggy and how this was respecting his mother when she told him to go to sleep. Ok book but lessons are endless."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"I bought this book for my 3 year old and I am returning it. Froggy's mother tells him it is time to go to bed and like most children, he resists and stalls. What I don't like about the book is the way the mother lets Froggy push her around. Froggy tells his mother that SHE has to close the closet, open the door a crack, and turn the night light down before HE will go to sleep. And the mother does as she is told. He then spills water on the floor and the mother cleans it up and then continues to do as Froggy demands."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"I have to disagree with the reviewers who consider this a manual for bad behavior. Yeah, I'd never let my kid get away with the stuff Froggy seems to, but that's precisely why the kids find it funny! My almost-two-year-old gets a BIG kick out of saying \\"FFRRROOOGGGYY\\" along with me, and \\"I found it!\\" is a chorus of triumph. As for teaching the child delaying tactics, well, my son has been trying to find ways to prevent nite-nite from the time he was 18 months, up to and including playing itsy-bitsy spider in the dark... tactics that preceded his introduction to the Froggy series by several months... but I think he recognizes what's going on in Froggy and laughs at it, along with me, because he knows full well it won't work. He is WELL aware that the reading of Froggy books at night precedes lights out, and because he likes the books, has no objection. The child will take his or her cue from the parents' behavior, not from a book, and frankly, if your kid tries any of these tactics more than once, it ain't the book that's the problem."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"We love books at our house. We check out about 10-20 new books every week from the library. I made the mistake of checking this one out. That was three weeks ago, and it has completely ruined our bedtime routine. My almost 3-year-old never had much trouble taking naps or going to sleep at night. But ever since we read this book, he has learned how to stall going to bed and yells quotes from the book such as \\"I'm hungry, I can't go to bed!\\" or \\"I need to brush my teeth again,\\" etc, etc. I made the mistake of caving in to a few of his demands at first, like when he asked for a drink of water before bed (he got that idea from the book, too). Now he thinks he can get whatever he wants by yelling for it, and it's frustrating since we have a one-year-old sleeping in the room next to him, who wakes up whenever he yells. I can't imagine what could possess a person to write such a book for a toddler... obviously someone who doesn't understand children. Do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this book!!!"},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"I was a little shocked to see the previous bad reviews of this book. Upon reading the concerns of parents I did come to see the observations they had made in a different light. Despite understanding how someone could conclude as they have, I personally must disagree. I don't expect this book to teach my child antics.What my daughter (nearly 2 yrs old) has learned from this book is how to say \\"FROOOGGGYYY\\" when she sees the word. At her age, she enjoys helping me \\"find\\" things, and enjoys froggy's searches for lost items. She also identifies froggy's \\"brushing\\" in a positive tone, and \\"oops\\" with concern that froggy has spilled water. This story relates to her reality. And, above all, it is the first book she has tried to \\"read\\" on her own.Nothing but positve results in my family! :)"},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"Raising respectful children is a difficult task. Many parents try hard, and pray hard, to see that their children learn good manners and a good attitude. Those are some of my parenting goals.This is our first Froggy book - it was given to my daughter as a Christmas gift. It is certainly not a book I would have bought for her. Other reviewers have written about the disrespect the Froggy shows toward his mother - and it is prevalent in this story.The other concern I have with this story is the fact that it teaches children a number of diversions to use when they don't want to go to bed. I'm pretty sure that children will learn many of these on their own, but why read them this story and teach them to:hide their toothbrush in the cookie jar?to eat after brushing their teeth for the night?to demand so much from their mother before going to sleep?No! These are certainly not things I will intentionally teach my daughter.The story does beg one other question - Where is Froggy's father in all this?If you want to speed your child on his or her way to being ill mannered and disrespectful, this is the book for you.The only plus, in my opinion, is the artwork. The book is well illustrated."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"I have ready many reviews on the Froggy books, but for me and my daughter, WE LOVE THEM!!! The main complaint I hear it that Froggy has bad manners. It's a book. It's my job to teach my daughter how to behave, not a fictional book. I do alter the book slightly. When Froggy's mom or dad calls his name they say F-R-O-O-O-O-G-G-G-Y-Y-Y and he answers W-W-H-H-A-A-A-T-T. We change that to Maam or Sir depending on who is calling him. My daughter thinks it's cute and sometimes I'll say FROGGY!!! and she says maam?!? If you have a child you can't handle, then don't buy the book but to everyone else, it's GREAT so I absolutely recommend it."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"I got this book from the library and just read it to my 3-year-old for the first time -- and I certainly won't ever read it to him again!

But before he gets in the bath tub he needs to find his toy boat. He looks every where for it and finally he finds it in the laundry bin. After the bath his mother tells him to put his p.j.s on. He said he would but first he has to find them. He finds them and puts them on. His mother tells him it's time to go to bed but he says he is hungry and wants a snack. He has a snack and he tells his mother he will go to sleep if he can have a drink. She brings him some water and he spills it and so she brings him some more.

As I was reading this, ( and discussing with them what was happening), if was so funny when one of the kids hollered out \\" Froggy needs a spanking!\\", thus the title of my review above. I don't particularly care for the back talk and stalling at bedtime,that's going on in the book, but kids do this kind of stuff sometimes. I didn't take it as a how to manual for disrespect as mentioned in other reviews I read."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"Okay, first I will give you a little history. My 4 year old son suddenly began having bedtime issues after almost two years of smooth, trouble-free bedtime routines. Now we were hearing I need a snack, I'm thirsy, please close my closet door, one more story. I thought \\"where on earth did all of these requests come from?\\" As a parent, you get used to stall tactics but this was an onslaught of ridiculous, petty and frustrating requests. My husband and I racked our brains trying to figure out how things had begun to spiral out of control. Although we did not give in, the requests kept mounting.Then along came Valentine's Day gifts from the grandparents. Included was a book called \\"Froggy Goes To Bed\\" My son opened it and said \\"Hey, we read this book at (pre)school!\\" Naturally, at naptime that was the book of choice. We sat down to read it and a few pages in it became eerily familiar. I suddenly realized where this bizarre set of requests had come from~ Froggy, the disobedient frog.Maybe if you have older children they would not be influenced by Froggy's nasty attitude this book would be \\"funny\\". However, my 4 year old is much too impressionable for books that make light of disrespect toward parents and supply ideas for how to push your parents to the point that they say (to quote Froggy's mom) \\"Oh, fiddlesticks!\\" By the end of the book Froggy's poor mom is so tired that she falls asleep while reading, and reading, and reading to Froggy.I absolutely would NOT recommend this book. I put it in our pile of books to donate and then, realizing how cruel that was, threw it away. I would not wish this on another parent.A side note:We also received \\"Froggy Goes To the Doctor\\". In a nutshell Froggy obsesses about getting a shot, is hyper in the waiting room and practically assaults the doctor during the course of his exam. He almost pokes her eye out, knocks her on the floor, bowls her over with his morning breath and so on~ all of which is treated like humor but strikes me as obnoxious and bratty.I will not be purchasing any Froggy books for anyone I like."},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"We have a collection of the infamous Froggy books and this is THE favorite!"},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"this book is very good for young chldren because it teaches them to be nice and to do wwhat your parents say and go to bed on time and not be bad i would say for the price this book is a 500 star book it is really good also this book isn't just for kids 0-3 it is for i would say up to 7 it is a good book you wouldn't waste your money buying it!"},{"Title":"Froggy Goes to Bed","review":"ON A WHOLE, I THINK THIS IS A VERY GOOD STORY.

Asimov, Clarke, Bradbury and Herbert followed, along with many more by Heinlein. But this is the one that captured my imagination. I recently bought it for my own 13-year-old and she has had the same experience. Good story telling holds up."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This was the first science fiction book I ever read, I found it in the public library when I was 12 years old, was intrigued by the title and took it home to read. I enjoyed it immensely and went on to devour Heinlein's other kid's classic, &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot; which I thought was equally wonderful.Thirty-five years later, Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing have lost none of their charm. What I found most interesting about this book, however, was how very much things have changed since this it was first published: the story begins with Kip's attempting to win first prize in a soap slogan contest (he sends in 5,000+ entries) the grand prize for which is a trip to the moon. He doesn't win the trip but he does win Oscar-the-Traveling-Spacesuit, which turns out to be the best prize after all. Back to the contest: Kip can send in the actual contest form included with each bar of soap or he can send in a &quot;reasonable facsimile.&quot; He entertains the idea of photographing the form 5,000 times before deciding that's impractical, so he settles instead for collecting the forms from the people who have bought the soap. I kept thinking, so why doesn't he just use the photocopier when it occured to me there weren't any photocopiers when this book was written. There weren't any intergrated circuits either, never mind microprocessors, which would have been necessary to achieve colonization of the moon in the first place. I also found it interesting that although when Kip graduates from high school he is reasonably well-educated in sciences and math (thanks to self-teaching -- and a diatribe from Heinlein on what he considers to be the sorry state of 1950's high school education) because he doesn't get a scholarship, he is faced with having to work while attending the local (read mediocre) state college. This book predates the arrival of college loans and grants as well.I did like the fact that the other main character in this book is a girl -- it was good of Heinlein to provide his readers such an intelligent and resourceful role model."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Space Suit--Will Travel represents Heinlein at his storytelling best. Free of the esoteric themes that would appear in his later writings, this book is pure science fiction seemingly written solely for the enjoyment of the reader. Originally published in 1958, the story stands up well even today and will surely be read and enjoyed by untold generations to come. I am sure that many a young person read this book and yearned to reach the moon in the decade before the Eagle finally landed.This is generally classified as one of Heinlein's juvenile books, but Heinlein's writing is for all ages. I am sure the book appeals to many young people because its protagonists are themselves young people: Kip is a high school senior, and Peewee is a girl of about twelve. Kip develops an overpowering urge to go to the moon, and he is lucky enough to win a real space suit in a contest. Heinlein's description of the many different features of the suit is fascinating. Resigning himself to selling the suit for college tuition money, Kip goes for one last walk; somewhat playfully calling out on the radio, he is surprised to hear an answer to his call. He is amazed when a space ship soon lands in his backyard and a decidedly alien creature comes out and collapses. A second ship lands, an entity gets out and conks Kip on the head, and the next thing Kip knows he is trapped inside a space ship on his way to the moon, suddenly in the company of a little girl. His captors are \\"Wormfaces,\\" a species of alien that has been in hiding on the moon, looking at the earth with evil intentions. Peewee introduces Kip to the \\"Mother thing,\\" a Vegan entity (and interstellar policeman) who radiates love and warmth, effectively communicates with the pair in a bird song type of speech, and inspires undying love and devotion. The book revolves around the youngsters' attempt to rescue the Mother Thing from the Wormfaces and eventually return to earth. Along the way, they endure captivity on Pluto, stare death in the face a few times, and ultimately find themselves representing Earth in an interstellar courtroom, the very future of earth shakily balanced in their own young hands.There are juvenile elements here, such as Kip's tendency to hold back-and-forth conversations with his space suit (whom he dubs \\"Oscar\\"), but Robert Heinlein does throw in several sections full of mathematical formulas, high-level theorizing, and advanced scientific concepts. I dare say that these areas of tecnospeak will turn off some young readers and may well stymie a good number of adults. Aside from the mathematics of the thing, Heinlein can make any kind of scientific notion sound feasible and believable, and that is part of his magic and effectiveness. Most of all, though, Heinlein presents vividly real characters doing exceedingly interesting, heroic things. Heinlein's couple of technical forays may be literary speedbumps, but young readers will revel in and be inspired by this book. Adults who have not yet lost all of their imagination will also relate to the main characters well and delight in a good story line which takes the reader from the earth to the moon to Pluto to another galaxy and back again."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This book is good reading for anyone. I reccommend it especially to young science fiction fans, or younger readers who want a good first taste of sci-fi. However, this book is excellent no matter who you are. I am an experienced science fiction reader, and I put this book right up there with anything else by Heinlein. Sure, it doesn't have the free love bits and controversial stuff of RAH's later works, but that's not why you started reading Heinlein in the first place anyway, is it?This book is a science fiction classic, period."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"When I was in 4th grade the librarian noticed that when our class made it's weekly visit to the library I absolutely refused to check out a fiction book. One day she took me to a section I'd never noticed before, where little spaceships with a stylized atom orbit were on the spine of each book. She pulled one down and said &quot;I think you might like this.&quot; That book was &quot;Have SpaceSuit -- Will Travel&quot; and to this day I wish I could thank her for what she did.HSWT was the first fiction I had ever seen (at the advanced age of 9) which was not of the &quot;see Spot run&quot; variety. The hero, Kip, is a normal kid a few years older than I was at the time, who has willingly learned latin and french, can do math, has read history, and desperately wants to go to space. He's not a genius, just a normal, smart kid.While walking in his back yard one night pretending to be on the moon he accidentally contacts (via radio) a spacecraft in earth orbit. The spacecraft (to his utter surprise) then lands almost on top of him. Kip meets Pee-Wee, a 9 year old girl smarter than him, the Mother-Thing, and Wormface. He gets to travel to Luna and the Magellanic Cloud and save the earth. This book has everything young people should be exposed to: action, intelligence, a non-condescending authorial voice and, MOST importantly, STRONG moral values, such as loyalty, bravery, and the importance of education.In one scene, Heinlein teaches the reader a mnemonic for memorizing some important facts about our solar system and demonstrates how to solve a problem involving the speed of light mathematically.Importantly, Heinlein was generations ahead of his time when he made the girls and women in his books as smart and brave as the males. Protagonists in all of his juveniles (including HSWT) are of various races and both genders, which makes them great for both boys and girls today.When I finished (in two days!) HSWT I went back to the library and proceeded over the next few years to read every book it had with the little spaceship &amp; atom logo. To this day, I read voraciously, and I know that if I hadn't become one of Heinlein's Children, I would not be the man I am today. If you want to give your kis a reading jones, buy this book. Trust me!(PS: Heinlein has an entire string of juveniles which are still in print. &quot;Podkayne of Mars&quot;, &quot;The Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Citizen of The Galaxy&quot;, &quot;Space Cadet&quot;, &quot;Starman Jones&quot; and &quot;Tunnel In The Sky&quot; were some that I loved best as a kid.&quot;Email me if you want more info. :"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I read this book at an early age, and it introduced me to a whole new way of thinking. Kip's rugged individualism and determination inspired me like nothing else in my life. This book also served as a springboard to other Science Fiction books and authors. Kip, a &quot;typical&quot; teen, wants to go to the Moon. Following his father's advice, he eventually wins an old space suit, which he meticulously rebuilds and eventually tests in his back yard. Then a space ship lands on him. Captured by space pirates and their alien master, Kip meets Peewee, the daughter of a famous Princeton thinker, and her Vegan companion, the &quot;Mother Thing&quot;. After adventures and defeat on the Moon, the action shifts to Pluto, where escape seems impossible, and death inevitable. The &quot;Mother Thing&quot;, however, proves to be more than a match for the alien &quot;Wormfaces&quot; who are intent on conquoring the Earth. After a stay on Vega, the story culminates with a trip to the Lesser Megallanic Clouds, where Kip and Peewee must stand trial in the name of all mankind. I recomend children of all ages read this book. It is filled with wonder and adventure that nobody should miss."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"At the beginning of Have Spacesuit Will Travel, Kip is just an ordinary boy who'd like to go into space. The story is placed in the near future when the moon has a colony and tourists. The nearest Kip thinks he can get to the moon is by winning an old spacesuit in a contest. The whole opening of the book is his cleverness and resourcefulness in figuring how to win the spacesuit and then in repairing the old spacesuit. Heinlein has a lot to say here about the importance of independence, resourcefulness and initiative. The lesson the book gives is that if you want something, go for it. Heinlein gets in some real swipes at the public school system that are as valid today as when it was written. His solution, if you feel you're not being educated in school, continue to attend school but educate yourself. Read, look up information. This doesn't mean the book is dull. All I've mentioned only begins the adventure. Having fixed up his spacesuit to the point that it's spaceworthy, Kip one night wears his spacesuit and turns on its radio, intercepts a call for help, tries to rescue a kidnapped girl who is fleeing her captors, gets kidnapped himself, gets his wish to go into space in a way he never dreamed of and suddenly the rest of the book is non-stop action. The scope of the book suddenly takes a giant leap out into the universe, a universe filled with alien races who frankly don't think much of the humans from earth. In a very moving scene, it's up to Kip to present a defense of the human race, with his life and the life of humanity hanging in the balance. It's a wonderful story and as good today as when it was written. If you have preteens who are ready to &quot;graduate&quot; from reading Harry Potter, this is the perfect book."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This is the best of Heinlein's juveniles and one of the three or four best books he ever wrote. When I first read it in seventh grade, it made me wish desperately that I was there, that it was all really happening to me, more than any book I had ever read (with the possible exception of Eleanor Cameron's &quot;The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet,&quot; for younger readers).I was surprised, on re-reading, how well this book held up. I was also surprised by the intended age level. It is actually directed toward high school kids, and contains a lot of hard science technicalities that went right over my head in seventh grade--but that didn't detract from the story one whit. On the other hand, being able to follow those technicalities added to my enjoyment this time around.I can only think of one group of people who wouldn't enjoy this book, and those are the poor unfortunates who have lost their childhood sense of wonder. That phrase is often associated with fantasy, which &quot;Have Space Suit: Will Travel&quot; is decidedly not. It is a good, taut, hard-science fiction novel that does not HAVE magic--it IS magic. If you can't sense it, you have my deepest sympathy."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Let's get this straight right off the bat. This is not one of Heinlein's most radical books, it is not brimming with abstract speculation on the human condition and how our current paths shall take us only to ruin and destruction. There is no future prediction, no hard science showcasing something new and possible. It is merely a science-fiction adventure novel.It is also one of the best science-fiction novels ever written. While it may not have all that was stated above, it does have one thing: humor, a brisk sense of fun, and a rapid pace that makes this book fly all too quickly. This is one of those rare science-fiction tales that, like a good cartoon, can be easily read by a child, but there is enough to keep adults interested also.Also, this book is probably one of the greatest of Heinlein's wish fulfillments ever. Kip might have to go through heck in this novel, but everything works out perfect in the end, and who wouldn't want a life like that? Ah, the temptations of fiction!And, as a final aside, I think the last couple of pages is one of the most classic endings of any science-fiction novels, just on sheer wit alone. Heinlein outdid himself on this one"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Space Suit Will Travel is one of Robert A. Heinleins &quot;juvenile&quot; novels he wrote for Scribners from the late 40s to late 50s. The series is juvenile only because it was marketed as such. Note that Amazon has it listed for ages 4-8! The only thing juvenile are two of the protagonists.I've also noted that one reviewer makes reference to the protagonists &quot;talking space suit&quot;. For the record, the space suit does not talk. Clifford Russell talks to it the way some men talk to their cars.Anyway the story is about about a teenager on the edge of manhood. Clifford Russell lives in a small town with his mother and his mildly eccentric father. His father has raised him to believe he can achieve anything if he works hard and systematically. Kip wants to be an engineer and go to the moon. Of course trips to the moon are common in this near future world if you have money. Kip doesn't but thru a series of circumstances obtains and refurbishes a military surplus space suit. Then one day a flying saucer answers his radio call. That's when the fun really starts....This satire is a masterpiece. I first read it as 9 year old and I've re-read it annually. When I first read it, it was fun. As I got older I began to understand more the things Kip learned. Heinlein is one of the few SF authors to make the details of spaceflight (and the suits operation) accurate. The characters are interesting and the authors comments about people dead on."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"---Or does that honor go to CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY (1957)? The weary old man who looks back from more than four decades' distance finds the story of Thorby Baslim the more interesting, but the kid who came across HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL in the first real library he'd ever entered (with that black and yellow and red Scribner's dust jacket, illustrated by Clifford Geary) demands prior consideration. I fell instantly in love with the story of Kip Russell and gutsy little Patricia Wynant (Peewee) Reisfeld, who represented to me the essence of that unassuming courage and simple decency to which any honorable adolescent boy should aspire.Other recent reviewers have summarized the novel well enough on this Web site, so I won't recapitulate. I *will*, however, remark on the fact that Robert A. Heinlein is the only writer of my experience to have tucked the proverbial \\"expositional lump\\" into a juvenile novel and successfully delighted the majority of his readers thereby, going on for ten pages -- *TEN* solid *PAGES* -- about the design, maintenance and repair of a vacuum suit, and not only kept the pace of his story but used every lick of that engineering tutorial to strengthen the suspense and enhance the reader's involvement in what happened later to the protagonist, his allies and his opponents. Hellacious writing, \\"juvenile\\" labeling be damned.(Incidentally, youngsters reading this review might like to know that Heinlein was a graduate of the US Naval Academy at Annapolis, and was trained there as an engineer. Pulmonary tuberculosis resulted in his medical discharge from the Naval Service in the '30s, but he gave up a prosperous writing career at the beginning of World War II to join fellow SF writers Isaac Asimov and L. Sprague de Camp at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, where he did much work on high-altitude pressure suits -- what we would call space suits today. As such, Heinlein made a personal professional contribution to the technology that today allows shuttle and space station astronauts to spacewalk in safety and comfort, and his technical expertise is undeniable in the pages of HAVE SPACE SUIT, WILL TRAVEL.)---"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Spacesuit - Will Travel is the first book I ever read myself. I was not interested in reading at all until I pulled this off the bookmobile in the 3rd grade. How fortunate I was to pick this masterpiece that opened my mind and imagination. RAH did it again later with Stranger in a Strange Land, a classic after which, unlike LRH, he shoo'd off the nutcases who wanted to make it into a cult."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"While this is known as one of Heinleins's \\"juvenile\\" novels, I just finished reading it again, and I'll have to say enjoyed it very much. In \\"Have Space Suit, Will Travel\\" a young man with an urge to go to the moon enters a contest where the first prize is just such a trip. He doesn't win the grand prize, but does win a space suit which he reconditions and wears around outside at times for kicks. By accident, since his suit radio is on the correct frequency, he contacts a space ship, and the resulting adventure is extremely interesting, and quite different than that of many other Heinlein juveniles.HSSWT is yet another one of the Heinlein books that I was very sorry to get to the end of. I'd become quite connected to the characters, and would have loved to see more of the emergence of the people of Earth into the larger pan-Galactic community presented in this novel, and particularly more adventures of Kip, Peewee, and the Mother-Thing.As usual, Heinlein's hero is a fresh faced, unassuming All-American boy. The villains are infuriating. Surprising family connections make a late appearance (a sometimes used Heinlein device).Heinlein had a mix of hard science (The Rolling Stones, Space Cadet, Podkayne of Marks, The Man Who Sold the Moon, etc), along with some very entertaining \\"fantasy Sci-fi\\": Glory Road, Time Enough for Love and its several descendant novels, and a few others. HSSWT is a curious hybrid of the two. Much of the book toes the hard sci-fi line, with very sensible descriptions of space suits and ballistic space flight. When the book turns to \\"fantasy sci-fi\\", it goes all out with faster than light travel and other technologies that verge on God-like.This is one that is not to be missed."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"As I read this, and I'm 33 years old,there was a awesome feeling that this book gave me with every turn of the page and that's: 'I felt like a kid again'. And that's a pretty good feeling, this book was a mental vacation from my routine adult life.NO SPOILERS: What would you do if you won a authentic space suit, and had dreamed of a life on Luna, well you wear it and take it out back for a mock field test. And of course it goes from there. The main character(Kip)as well as his sidekick(Peewee)and a furry monkey(Mother Thing)and we have a story worthy of one of Heinlein best of his 'Juvenile series', in fact the last of his 'Juveniles' books. From the beginning of this book you are transported and fixated on these characters and the situations they find themselves in, perseverance, working together, overcoming the impossible and adventure for the adult fan, as well as Heinlein's younger audience as well. In my opinion this book is not a bad place to start if your a first time reader of his work."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This book has always been my favorite. It is a little dated but still timeless. You could tell it was written for a teen to read but it still makes you think and imagine what the chacters look like. Heinlein always slips his politics in the mix.It is good for an eighteen year old to read because the main character is going through the same questions about going to school, where he wants to get to and how to achieve it. I am giving it to my teen to read.I loved the over sized book. it was much easier to read and handle."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"What are the odds of a alien space ship landing in the corn fields in the mid west at the same time a techy teenager is testing out a used space station space suit he won in a advertising soap contest? At night? Better yet, with a young girl named PeeWee (who's a genius) and an alien creature who turns out to be a \\"Space Cop\\"? With that, Heinlien takes you on a wild adventure from moon base to Pluto and somewhere in the universe to save life on this world as we know it. Heinlien, must have thought this plot up, hoping to delay his publisher while he came up with a real plot... But the publisher called his bluff. It provided the framework for great dialogs between the teenager (Kip) and PeeWee (young girl) and the best justification in fiction for the human race I've ever read. This story enthralled me, I've been a fan of Heinlien since.The story is outrageous, but I still remember the way it made feel about the future of mankind. The future for mankind is space..with worlds to explore...battles to be fought..races to learn from..to put our fingerprint on the stars! Corny? You bet! But its what we do! The great stories of history are no more/no less."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This was my first and is still my favorite Heinlein novel.It's fairly dated, but that's the inevitable fate of all sci-fi books. It's still very entertaining, so much that I've read it 4 times."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"One of the great books, \\"Have space suit, will travel\\" has a lot of heart, and excitement, while remaining insightful and meaningful. If you can't enjoy this \\"best and most beloved\\" of books, there is probably something wrong with you."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Heinlein wrote this book aiming at the younger reader and pulls it off in great style. Our hero, a high schooler, manages to get from his humble home in a small town into space and, eventually, into another galaxy. Hence it might well trigger that sense of wonder in a young person reading his or her first science fiction book."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Spacesuit, Will Travel is one of the best of Heinlein's so-called juveniles (which I've always believed were some of his best writing) and now it is available is a really excellent audio recording. The Full Cast Audio treatment takes a great story and makes it come alive. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This is a very old science fiction book that was actually quite imaginative for its time. I was impressed with the ideas of how to walk on the moon expressed by the author long before anyone ever walked up there on the moon. Fun book."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Robert A. Heinlein is justly considered one of the great writers of Science Fiction, and his young adult novels of the 1950s are considered some of his best work. HAVE SPACESUIT -- WILL TRAVEL is perhaps the most famous Heinlein juvenile (along with RED PLANET), so its a good place to start if you're interested in trying one of them.SPACESUIT is a fun book overall. This novel is essentially an action-adventure story, with a surprisingly large amount of science thrown in. As always, Heinlein's sharp, witty prose is a pleasure to read. Again, this is a novel intended for middle schoolers, but its well written enough for an adult to enjoy.The major flaw with SPACESUIT is its dated quality. Heinlein spents a lot of time explaning how the spacesuit in the story works, but relies upon technology that has long since expired. Some sections of this book read like a 1950s textbook on science. While this may be nostalgic for some readers, I found it tedious, and I suspect most modern children would share my reaction.I enjoyed SPACESUIT, but its a reminder of how dated SF can become over time. Its a shame we don't have a modern-day Robert A. Heinlein writing books like this for a 21st century audience."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Clifford 'Kip' Russell has a dream, he wants to go to the Moon and while his father thinks its a great idea but its up to Kip to find a way to get there. Fortunately for Kip a soap company is running a contest with a grand prize of....a trip to the moon. Kip manages to win, but not the grand prize, instead he got a space suit. While trying out his new prize Kip is swept up - literally - and finds himself on the way to the moon. What he had never imagined was that he would be taking the trip in the company of aliens, human thugs, and a 12 year old girl named Peewee. Even more amazing he finds himself preventing an alien invasion and defending the entire human race in an alien court.This 1958 book is one of the 'juveniles' that Heinlein wrote in the '40's and '50's. While the plot is obviously fantastic and very much aimed at the youth audience, it is an enjoyable read for any age reader. Kip and Peewee have to face the challenges of defining just what defines a 'person' and what responsibiities a person has to themself and to his fellow beings.Are there flaws in this work? Absolutely, many of the characters are there just to say or do their piece and then move on, we do not ever learn just what their motivations are. The young heroes are just a bit too perfect and the coincidences are often just too convenient. At times Heinlein's handling of the dialog is not as skilled as it will be in later works, and, as often is in Heinlein's work a little more editing would not be misplaced.Often in Heinlein's early works there are very stereotypical attitudes concerning women, they are relegated to subservient roles, i.e. Kip loves his mother but we learn very little about her, also Peewee's mother is portrayed as more of nuisance than anything else. In this novel though Heinlein is beginning to change this, Peewee is shown to be Kip's equal and the alien guardian is definitely female.This book is fun, light reading that, like the rest of Heinlein's work, slips some serious ideas in when the reader least expects it. There is also the fun of seeing just what developments Heinlein predicts correctly and which he misses. In this one the hero still computes on a sliderule, an item that most highschool students of today have never seen, much less used."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"No one was a better SF storyteller than Heinlein. I especially like his engineering description of a spacesuit, and explanation of motion equations. Good hard science based fiction there. The far out intergalactic travel stuff is fun too. There is one thing about the novel that bothers me, though: Since it refers to a lunar base and a space station, it's obviously set in the future, but Heinlein makes almost no effort to make the reader believe Kip is actually in a future society. In fact, it's rather obvious that the book is set in the year it was published--1958 (there is no way a soda fountain drink costs only 35 cents in the \\"future\\")."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"A great read for younger readers - 14 and below, I'd say - and an acceptable one for older readers who like their SF \\"light\\".It's a great adventure story, and gives the protaganists (and the readers) many opportunities to try to think and act their way out of several fixes, and it takes itself seriously enough to engross the reader.My favorite chapters are the last few. The book closes strongly, with a defense of the human condition, and its history and potential, to an alien court, with the fate of the world at stake. Even as an adult, that section of the book is still quite a read."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This is a good science fiction book, but it is dated. Quite a bit of the science pokes its head through the literature, which is nice but occasionally its age (40 +)shows when describing society such as a drug store with malts! Once you get past that, the book is fairly good for the young teenager."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"its full of detail and i thought it was one of the best books i rea"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I found that it was a well writen story dealing with the truths of life and mixing them with fantacy.

Written in 1958, this story is timeless. It carries with it the hopes for future space exploration, and advances in technology. Like many sci-fi greats, Heinlein knows how to tell a story and keep you captivated from beginning to end. His characters are real, likable and full of emotions. Kip is his main character in this story. He is a very likable young man that every one can relate to. His hopes for the future are grand, and maybe unattainable, but that does not discourage him from pursuing them non the less. Peewee is everybodies little sister, lovable, and in a hurry to grow up, but some times a pest. Their adventure in space will keep you and the edge of your seat, from beginning to end. I loved it when I was 15, and still love it at 37."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I remembered reading this book when i was at school. It strated me on the road to Si-Fi.

Great story, interesting characters, interesting aliens, they were very 'alien.' I actually had 'nightmares' about them (nothing serious, but the image of them stuck in my mind.)"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"The classic sci fi book, Have Space Suit Will Travel, by Robert Heinlein is a wonderful adventure for all ages. The main character, Kip, is a graduating senior who wishes he could go to the Moon (as is a tourist option in this book.) However, it is way too expensive. When a soap company sponsors a contest with First Prize offering just that, he proceeds to buy every bar of soap he can lay his hands on and enter the contest hundreds of times. From there, the story begins, and Kip does travel to the Moon, but not the way Kip had in mind. This would have made a wonderful movie as other Heinlein books have including Starship Troopers and The Puppet Masters. In any case, although this book is little known today, I would encourage everyone who has the slightest interest in sci fi and a sense of humor to read this. You will be thoroughly entertained, I promise."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I recently read this book for the first time. It was in a box of books a friend gave me. I figured it would make a nice break from some of my heavier reading. This was bumped up in priorities when some scholars whom I respect pointed out that it included a fairly heavy critique of the United Nations.The book was extremely good. Certainly a book I will read to my sons as they grow old enough to enjoy it. But it is worth reading for adults too, and some of the negative reviews are somewhat out of place. I am going to discuss here the question of scientific details first, and then the social and political lessons from the book.First, the book has a great deal of scientific details in it, ranging from gravity/mass issues (on the Moon and Pluto) to specific details regarding the difficulties of staying alive in space with a space suit. I suppose some readers may see this as filler but instead it adds a certain realism to the story. Nonetheless I found a few places where I was shaking my head and saying \\"that's nice in a book but would get you killed if you tried it for real\\" (like transferring oxygen between tanks on the moon--- I kept waiting for disaster to strike).Secondly on the social, political, and moral side. I think this book is solid in this area too and provides a great amount of food for thought. While I agree that the book does promote nationalism, it doesn't do so at the expense of a sense that we are all humans. Indeed, the only area where this is particularly noticeable was in the trial of humanity. Here Heinlein was clearly drawing parallels to the United Nations Security Council, and disparaging internationalism itself to some extent as something which serves those nations who already dominate the planet. I took the reference to Mein Kampf as simply the idea that a lot of important works were written in prison and that this was no exception. Genocide in the book is portrayed in a very complex way which leaves the reader at the end sharing the ambivalence of the characters despite the extreme circumstances that would lead to obvious reasons to condone it.The book is remarkably deep and worth reading even for adults.Mixed in with all this weight is a great deal of humor and action. I found myself laughing out loud many times and had guessed the bit about Kip's dad well before the end of the book.I would highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This was the first Science Fiction novel I ever read. It not only infected me with a life long craving for Science Fiction but lit the ember that became my love for reading and literature that has added so much to my life."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I have tremendously mixed feelings about Robert Heinlein's later work, which was marred by an increasing interest in right-wing politics, a sometimes strident sexism, and a drop in quality of his prose that may have been a result of ongoing health problems. But I have no mixed feelings about the work from Heinlein's early period. For much of the fifties Heinlein wrote a string of novels intended for an older juvenile audience. These are far and away my favorite of all of Heinlein's books. Furthermore, on the basis of these books Heinlein is my favorite of the so-called Big Three. Arthur C. Clarke had a more far-reaching scientific vision and Asimov in his Foundation books more ambition, but Heinlein possessed something that neither Clarke nor Asimov possessed: an engaging prose style. Heinlein mastered a light, fun, breezy prose that made these books a complete delight. I much prefer books like CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY to the ponderous STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND or HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL to TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE.The joy of HAVE SPACESUIT, WILL TRAVEL does not derive from the plot, which is rather slight -- narratively, the events of the novel could have been easily accomodated in a short story -- but in the interplay between the characters, Kip's n The Mother Thing. Heinlein has been intensely criticized both by female SF writers and fans as well as by sympathetic males for his treatment of women. He is quick to place them in standasrd traditional role models, and that is true of this book to a degree. Some of his discussions of what fathers and mothers are like smacks of fifties family comedies. Still, Pee Wee is female and really doesn't conform to any traditional female models. She is feisty, courageous, incredibly intelligent, and very much a person of action. Pee Wee is also a very odd love interest for Kip. OK, it is kind of skanky but this is hardly unusual in Heinlein. Unusual sexual arrangements is a constant running through Heinlein's novels. Incest, for instance, runs through several of his later novels (like GLORY ROAD and TIME ENOUGH FOR LOVE). Nothing sexual takes place between Kip and Pee Wee, but their relationship is less brother-sister than boyfriend-future girlfriend. The age difference isn't that great, only around six years, but when the younger is around twelve, it is a very big age difference indeed. Still, if you can get past the age-inappropriateness, you have to like the interplay between Kip and Pee Wee. The fact that sex is not part of the equation shows that the relationship is based on mutual respect and platonic affection.The book, by the way, indirectly led to the writing of another great SF novel. Heinlein makes several references to Jerome K. Jerome's great Victorian classic (published in 1889, the year in which Adolph Hitler, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and Martin Heidegger were all born) THREE MEN IN A BOAT, subtitled TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG! Connie Willis, in the preface to her wonderful book TO SAY NOTHING OF THE DOG, credits this book with her learning of Jerome's book for the first time. These are three books that everyone should read when they get the opportunity."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I loved this book as a kid and an adult.

It is set in the near future when the Federation has a base on the Moon and Luna City is growing rapidly. Commercial travel to the Moon has just become available.In this novel, Clifford Russell is a bright and industrious young man. He is a senior at Centerville High. Kip works parttime at Charton's Pharmacy as a soda jerk.Samuel C. Russell is Kip's father. Sam is a very eccentric writer, mathematician and former spy.Patricia Wynant Reisfield is a very intelligent eleven year old girl. Peewee is the daughter of an influential professor at the Institute for Advanced Study.The Mother Thing is an alien. She is a local cop for the Three Galaxies confederation.In this story, Kip wants to go to the Moon. He asks his father for advice and is told to investigate the possibilities. He figures that the chances are not good, but his best bet is to become an engineer. Then Skyway Soap has a contest with the first prize being an all expenses paid trip to the Moon.At first, Kip is discouraged since he never wins any type of contest. He has even given up matching pennies. But his father tells him that the best prepared person is most likely to win. So he starts sending in slogans on Skyway soap wrappers.After mailing 5782 entries, Kip and his parents sit watching their antiquated television set, waiting for the announcement of the final winner. After a short interruption of service, the winning slogan is revealed. Kip has won!Yet somebody else is declared the winner. Kip learns that he is one of eleven who submitted the same slogan. The grand winner had an earlier postmark than his own entry. Instead of a trip to the Moon, Kip has won an spacesuit that had been used to build the second spacestation.Despite his disappointment, Kip becomes intrigued by the spacesuit and soon starts putting it into working order. The soap company has offered to buy back the suit for $500, so he will probably send it back to the manufacturer to get college tuition money. Still, he has restored the suit as best he can and wears it one more time before shipping it back.While out in the back pasture, someone interrupts his radio tests and asks for landing instructions. He answers the call and is soon almost squashed by a flying saucer landing where he had been. Some creature jumps out of the ship and somebody else in a spacesuit follows. Then another flying saucer lands and the creature is shot.Kip lumbers over and discovers that the creature is a BEM. Later he learns that she is the Mother Thing. Then something hits him between his shoulder blades and he blacks out.Upon awakening, he meets Peewee and learns about her family. He also hears about her kidnapping on the Moon and finds out a little about the Mother Thing. Then they are temporarily paralyzed and Peewee tries to tell him about HIM, but cannot finish her warning.He is taken out of the room by two men and taken to the control room. There he is interrogated by Wormface, a very ugly and fearful alien. Wormface has a very intimidating look and Kip finds himself unable to protest or hold back any information.This tale takes Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing back to the Moon. Kip learns more about the situation from Peewee and her friend. Then they are taken to the Wormface base on Pluto.This story is very different from the other books in this series. The aliens are much more advanced technologically than in the other works. Even the Wormfaces are more advanced than humans, but the Mother Thing represents an extremely advanced society.This is the last volume in the original series. The next book written by this author for this series was rejected by the publisher. However,Starship Troopersand other books for young adults were subsequently published elsewhere (see my listmania).Highly recommended for Heinlein fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of space adventures, alien cultures and persevering young folk.-Arthur W.

And it was as fun a read as I remember."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"\\"Have Spacesuit, . . .\\" is one of Heinlein's best Juveniles for young readers. I was in college when I first read it and I wished it were a bit stronger in the science-fiction department and had a bit less in the 'adventure' department. (Be sure to buckle your seat belt, the story takes some wickedly sharp turns!) However, quibbles aside, it is a terrific book for youngsters in early high school. (Do American kids still take Latin?) Forty plus years after first reading it, I still enjoy re-reading it."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Much like a polar bear, it's a great ice breaker to lead someone into the field of science fiction. This was the first Sci-Fi book I can remember reading by heinlein, and led me into the amazing field known as scientific fiction. The overall body of this book is incredible, with many facts broken down into understandable ideals even a first time reader could comprehend. also a great way to begin understanding true science fiction with many general facts thrown in."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I read the book HAVE SPACE SUIT-WILL TRAVEL by Robert A. Heinlein. The book is about a boy named Kip who is in his college years. Kip wins a contest that he is so excited about. He loves outer space and all of that stuff, but this time he got a real souvenir-a real working space suit!Later on in the book, more amazing things happen that are out of this world! One exciting thing after another happens to Kip!I liked this book and recommend it to people who like books with action and a lot of stuff going on."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"What a great book, you gotta read this one. If you don't you'll have to read something else by Heinlein, anything at all in fact. I was sickened by one of the reviews here calling Heinlein's adult books &quot;pornographic.&quot; Double Star, The Door into Summer, Starship Troopers, The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, perfect examples of his adult books which are distinctively not pornographic. I am yet to read one which is. Oh yeah, almost forgot, Stranger in a Strange Land is considered to be one of the most important novels of this century and to be a literary landmark. I found it hard to believe that someone with enough incompetence to call Robert A. Heinlein a pornographic author, could have the good sense to call this a good book. Well, nobody can be all bad I guess."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"In 1958 using a take-off on a current TV Western as the title, Mr. Heinlein wrote a very popular juvenile novel: \\"Have Space Suit Will Travel\\". The counties preoccupation with the \\"space race\\" and obsession with the Russian Sputnik could only have contribute to the success of this title.Heinlein use's his considerable writing and scientific talents to craft an unbelievable tale that, nonetheless, inspired many a young space cadet, well, yes, like myself. In light of today's knowledge [2010] the story does not hold up very well and is only of academic interest to serious followers of SF history and the writings of Heinlein.Kip Russell wins a used spacesuit in a contest sponsored by a soap company. He refits the suit as best he can to the condition he believes would be necessary to use in space or on the moon. While on a nocturnal walk in the suit his radio is mistake as a beacon by \\"space pirates\\". Kip is hustled away to the moon where he meets Peewee and The Mother Thing both hostages of Wormface. Things pick up and next stop the stars.

A great yarn, with inspiration, adventure and a smattering of politics and complex ideas buried under rockets and ray guns, this is easily onf of Heinleins finest Juvies."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have spacesuit will travel feels like a soccer game which starts excitingly, with a nice tempo, and both teams giving their all. Somewhere after the 10th minute, not only the would-be Peles and Maradonas lose the magic touch, but heavy rain also starts pouring down, and the spectacle becomes dull, almost irritating, until 5 minutes before time or so, when the rain stops, the players wake up again and end up the match in style.So, in a few words: I really liked the first person narration of the star boy, and I do understand how it may have inspired future astronauts, one among the many Heinlein novels to have done so back then. As a matter of fact, I believe that even today, wannabe astronauts are influenced and inspired by Heinlein novels, no matter how hard Scalzi tries to dethrone the master.Heinlein's juvenile or not, I disliked the wizard kid. Furthermore, the tedious and unnecessary Luna and Pluto trips did not really make me fall in love with the novel. Things got a bit more interesting in Vega and yes, the grand finale in the Magellanic clouds deserved a biz.All in all, Heinlein's indelible mark on modern SF is in other works. 2 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"OK, to be honest, I only picked this because David Pringle listed it at I believe #27 in his list of top 100 SF books up until 84. All I wonder after putting this short juvenile read down is, why? While the best parts for kids in JR high is motivating kids to figure out what they're going to do with their life and the usefulness/importance of math, but I also think it promotes nationalism, justifies genocide, and suffers from circumstances that are more magically lucky than scientific. The science is dated - I mean if an alien race really wanted to eat humans, we could solve a lot of problems by feeding residents of our overcrowded prisons and terrorists to them. Or consider cloning. Right, i know this is a kid's book, but hear (or read) me out. The main character Kip gets imprisoned by a scientifically more advanced race than humans, and tries to stay positive, listing Mein Kampf as an achievement done in prison. Well, this reminded me of M. Moorcock's Starship Stormtroopers article, and the rest of the story unfolds as quite a scary story for me to think is OK. Eventually, mankind is judged anddachau is listed among our evils...but I can't list any more examples of genocidal writing without spoilers. So take it as a warning. If you read the book, you might enjoy it. I thought it was a little on the boring, tedious, and goofy side. But I'm a cynical old B too. I recently picked up a copy of Spinrad's Iron Dream at a used bookstore, which parodies these types of novels."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Due to how much I absolutely loved Stranger In A Strange Land, I picked up this little novel.Unfortunately, it's a kid's book. Not that this novel was not interesting because it was, just that it was no where near as good as Stranger In A Strange Land.The story is about a boy who wins a real spacesuit. He unwillingly must save mankind. It started off pretty slow and childish I thought, but then you really get into it. It becomes and adventure novel with Kip (the boy) getting whisked into space and having all types of adventures. I can't say I didn't like this one."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Apart from the kitchy title, this book represents a modest effort from Heinlein. The acknowledged master of juvenile science fiction isn't really at his best here, but longtime fans will certainly enjoy this sample of his work. After winning a used space suit in a contest, young Kip Russel is not long in finding a use for it, as bizarre coincidences and intergalactic invaders conspire to take him on a wild adventure to the Moon, Pluto, and beyond. Kip has just graduated from high school (a favorite age for the hero of a juvenile) and is trying to figure out how to pay for college, when he is captured in his own backyard by extraterrestrials. He meets a fellow prisoner, Peewee, who is a very typical Heinlein grrl: boyishly skinny, terribly spoiled, and absurdly intelligent. Despite her genius IQ, however, it always seems to come down to Kip's courage, determination, and perhaps most of all, his suit, to save the day. Heinlein takes great pains to describe the suit in loving detail, explaining the repairs needed to make it serviceable, how the various controls work and why they're needed, what manner of improvements Kip made to the design and why and how he paid for them, what sort of items were supposed to be kept in it and how he obtained them, or what he used in their place, etc... Of course this novel was written well before the development of modern space gear, and there's no doubt that some of Heinlein's suggestions were considered by the scientists who designed the real article; but for today's young readers, a space suit is probably a lot less interesting in and of itself than Heinlein makes it out to be. This book seems long for a juvenile, too, although things move fairly quickly except for a few slow patches: Kip's wearying moon trek, his very tedious imprisonment, and the whole last third of the book, after the real action is already over. More tellingly, the story is packed with melodramatic unpleasantness, as Kip and Peewee seem to be constantly near death or worse. Perhaps Heinlein thought that younger readers wouldn't see just how far over the top he was going with this book, but for a more realistic look at the dangers and discomforts of space travel, read his survival epic Tunnel in the Sky, or the superb colonial novel, Farmer in the Sky. Like so many of Heinlein's gems from mid-century, this book works better for readers who were kids in 1950 than for those who are kids today."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I've read lots of Heinlein and generally like all of his Golden Age books (I loathe his later writings). This one however, I did not like. It reads like a juvenile novel (which it is) but it just gets bogged down with details. He goes on and on to describe jury rigging the spacesuit, for example. In another format this might work, but with the type book this is,the story is more important. the details just seemed like filler."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"The worst book by Heinlein by far (I have read at least 10!).

Many of the science fiction works of yesteryear are outdated leftovers, left behind because technology has far surpassed the writer's wildest dreams. Not so for Heinlein, whose vision is powerful enough to make this book still enjoyable (despite the ever present slide-rules). It's one of those \\"perfect timing situations\\" in which the main character wins a spacesuit as a second place prize, refills its airtanks, and then when he realizes he has no use for a spacesuit at all, is kidnapped by aliens -- of course! Although it may seem like light-hearted pulp fare, it has an underlying seriousness that makes the novel exceptional. It may also be a sad testament to our own space programs that Heinlein's work, after all these years, is not yet outdated."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I first came across Have Space Suit, Will Travel as a hardback in the Brandon Florida library when I was 8 years old, back in the early 70s. I have read the book literally thousands of time since then, and I have read it a good ten times since downloading it onto the Kindle app for my Android phone. It is the quintessential science fiction novel in my experience, the perfect book to introduce the genre to my 8 year old self.The action is on a huge scale, yet it is intensely personal to the narrator Kip. His sense of the danger and the awe and wonder are so well conveyed that I could feel it myself even as a child.This is without a doubt Heinlein's greatest juvenile and still captures the sense of wonder and hope of the 1950s science fiction. I lament that this sense of wonder died in later decades and I wish every day that we could recapture it."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Here is the penultimate Heinlein \\"juvenile\\", written right before the militaristic Starship Troopers caused so much controversy. This is a gentler, more expansive, and, I would say, better book. First thing to say, minus any spoilers, is boy, did this guy with a spacesuit travel. The title is a play on the popular TV series from the 50s \\"Have Gun Will Travel.\\" In this novel, Heinlein goes to great length to describe the spacesuit our 18-year-old hero has won by dedicating himself to submitting thousands of entries to a soap-slogan contest. The analyses I've encountered indicate that technologically speaking the spacesuit specifications have held up pretty well. Our man goes to the moon. At first. Later to many places in space, showing a reach I don't recall in any other Heinlein I've read, more reminiscent of the vastness of space as described by A. E. Van Vogt, or Asimov in the Foundation trilogy.One interesting aspect of this novel is the degree to which it is planted squarely in the late 1950s, when it was written. Here Heinlein makes no attempt at social speculation; the book deploys all the tropes of the 50s with only the added features that humans have rockets and have gone to the moon. So our hero Kip wins his spacesuit by submitting thousands of entries of slogans to a soap company that sponsors a TV show. He's a soda jerk plagued by a real-life jerk who constantly calls him a space cadet, in scenes reminiscent of \\"Back to the Future\\". (It's not first prize, which is a trip to the moon.) Here, before Heinlein decided in Starship Troopers to make his uncompromising statement in favor of military commitment and vitality, with a society organized to support that before anything else, we see a much more balanced universe, with brutal villains and gentle heroes, embodied by the \\"Mother thing\\", a female specimen of a versatile, empathetic cat-like species that saves Kip and PeeWee, the younger tomboy female protagonist, from a brutal race of aliens. Here we see sweet young adult/pubescent proto-courtship, as PeeWee matches or surpasses Kip for intelligence and bravery, with lots of competitive banter and (very) occasional flirtation. Ultimately Kip and PeeWee must present the case before a super-galactic court that the human species should not (at least yet) be wiped out as a potential threat to the civilized inhabitants of the known universe. Challenging work if you can get it.The book is one more instance of how Heinlein can be as square as square can be (including a reference to Kip's high school winning a square dance championship), but also inspiringly all-American and ultimately transcendent as a statement that promotes improvisational bravery, independence, and decency. Pretty damn wonderful book."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I had read this book when I was in Junior High, and always wanted to read it again as I had enjoyed it so much, and was curious to find out what I had missed due to my age at the time. I took advantage of the opportunity to download the book to my iPad and to read it while I was flying on vacation. I found it to be as riviting and exciting as it was when I was MUCH younger, and found that while there were some nuances I had missed the first time around, I had managed to commit to memory the most important parts of the book.

There were just some things I couldnt get past in this one.I have read a lot of RAH, and I know the era they come from and I grant indulgence when he makes a goof on some technical point, that he couldnt have known about due to the era he was writing in...But the \\"frigid winds of Pluto\\" a sentence or three after he just went on about there being NO ATMOSPHERE should not have escaped even a 1950's engineer writing a YA book. He may have slipped it by me if he spread it out some, but there were within seconds of each other. I seriously dont know how he himself or his editor didnt catch / correct it. I managed to notice it, at 3am doing my hour on the treadmill, so it cant have been too subtle....Also, it got a bit preachy there at the trial. Yeah, we get it, people are bad. I think it was covered in FAREWELL TO THE MASTER, a decade or two earlier by Harry Bates (You may know it better by its film name, The Day The Earth Stood Still)Still the story telling was great, and in my opinion a mediocre RAH story is still as good or better than a lot of what gets cranked out in the name of deadlines these days - Sorry LKH - you know its true - get the princess off her back and doing something and I will come back... Well... She can still be on her back sometimes, just not 3 straight scenes in a row...The characters were fun, if not well rounded - RAH is fond of the good hearted, brainy 50's all american boy lead - and why not?

This book gave her pause when I brought it to the check out desk, but since I had already read over 50 books since staying with my aunt, she relented and let me have it.

I am happy to have it on the Heinlein shelf in my library -- I just wish I could get my grandchildren to read Heinlein instead of playing video games!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This is one of my favorite SF novels from what are termed Heinlein's \\"juvenile\\" series of books: written in the late 1940's and 50's; as well as being the last book in that series. The works he was soon to write, such asStarship Troopers(1959) are much more mature in their subject matter and themes.In this book, the male protagonist \\"Kip\\" is about 18 years old: ambitious, intelligent and well-educated in advanced scientific and mathematical subjects, which he achieves on his own in spite of what is clearly a very - for the time - leading edge, but totally unrealistic and inadequate educational system in his hometown: a diversion from the main plot, and primarily a platform for the Author's own strong views on this topic.Kip's parents are your seemingly stereotypical 1950's eccentric scientist father and homebody mother, though Heinlein reveals couple of minor surprises on this score near the end of the book. It will be interesting for you to compare and contrast the representation of Kip's mother here in light of the other major mature female character in the story: the \\"Mother Thing\\".An unusual twist (at least in Heinlein's \\"juvenile\\" novels, though often seen in his later books) is the addition of major female characters in the form of Peewee, a genius-level and very precocious preteen; and the already-mentioned \\"Mother-Thing\\", who is just the sort of alien you'd want to run-to when you are stranded far from your home planet and need a dose of mother's love; but, she is a whole lot less harmless and helpless than she seems!The plot centers around Kip's determination to get to the moon, which he does, and then some. His initial effort - to win a contest to visit the moon - lands him a consolation prize in the form of a second hand spacesuit, which he restores to space-worthy condition, then names Oscar and with whom he has conversations throughout the book. (A fact that Kip acknowledges is a bit weird, and probably be great material for a psychoanalyst to chew on!)Of course, things don't end there - and with a few well placed though unlikely coincidences, Kip, Oscar, Peewee and the Mother-Thing meet, then work together to destroy the bad guys, face down the galactic overlords, save the human race, and still get home in time for dinner. --- Not bad for a few days work!As with most of Heinlein's other books from this period, you really get drawn into the story and characters: after the intro where Kip acquires and restores \\"Oscar\\", things really get rolling, and the action is nonstop. The interplay between Kip, Peewee and the Mother thing are what really help the story hold together and make it succeed.As with all of his books, Heinlein pays great attention to scientific details and accuracy. Kip engages in several long discourses on scientific and engineering topics throughout the story. For example, one long discussion is on how long it will take a spacecraft to reach the Moon - or Pluto - at certain rates of acceleration. Similar monologues involve descriptions of the science and engineering behind \\"Oscar\\" and other devices and technologies we encounter in the story. The amount of detail in these descriptions is a bit smothering; but, given Heinlein's track record on this score in his other \\"juvenile\\" books, as well as this novel's intended audience of spacehappy teenage boys in the late 1950's, it is certainly no surprise.All in all, a fun and well told story from \\"the Dean of Science Fiction Writers\\": 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Good book I liked the description and drama it built a good picture in my mind. I would rate this book 5 stars n matter what."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Clifford \\"Kip\\" Russell wanted nothing more than to go to the moon. Winning a used space suit in Skyway Soap's slogan contest only encouraged his dream. With a head for mathematics and engineering, Kip repaired and enhanced his space suit, nicknamed \\"Oscar\\". While taking Oscar for a field test, Kip talks to himself over the radio that he had installed in the helmet. He is shocked when another voice answers!Soon, Kip finds himself guiding a space ship to a tumultuous landing almost directly on top of him. Immediately after, another similar vessel lands beside it. From the first ship, a strange alien creature emerges followed by a small space-suited human. The alien quickly tumbles to the ground. When Kip runs to its aid, he is struck from behind and knocked unconscious.Later, he awakens aboard one of the vessels on its way to the moon. He finds himself imprisoned with a 10-year-old girl named Patricia aka Peewee. She is a prodigy, but emotionally immature and sometimes frustrating. Her best friend is a rag doll named Madame Pompadour. Kip learns that they've been captured by a beastly alien criminal who, during an interrogation, Kip comes to call Wormface. The criminal and his human henchmen have also kidnapped a benevolent alien that Peewee had come to know as the Mother Thing. This was the creature that Kip had tried to help before being assaulted.In a series of adventures that spans the galaxy--from Earth to the Lesser Magellanic Cloud and back--Kip, Peewee and the Mother Thing explore the surface of the moon and narrowly escape Wormface's secret base on Pluto, nearly at the cost of Kip's life. On Delta Vega, Mother Thing's home planet, Kip is nursed back to health just in time for a trip to Lanador, a planet located in the Lesser Magellanic Cloud. There, Wormface and others of his race will be put on trial, but there is something else that Mother Thing cannot reveal.On Lanador, Kip and Peewee meet two other human \\"prisoners\\", a cave-man and a Roman soldier named Iunio. The following day, all four are brought to a vast courtroom of the \\"Three Galaxies\\". The Wormface aliens are tried for their crimes...and then the human race itself comes under the microscope with Kip, Pewee, and Iunio as representatives for Earth. The decision: allow the human race to progress or destroy them immediately?Have Spacesuit--Will Travel is counted among \\"the Heinlein juveniles\\", one of a number of books that Heinlein wrote between 1939 and 1958. Heinlein had been rather successful in expressing advanced and enlightened ideas not often found in adolescent stories of the time. I enjoyed Have Spacesuit--Will Travel immensely. It contained a wonderful mix of fast-paced storytelling, fun characters and scientific facts. The science fiction is just that, of course, but the human characters of the story engage in detailed exercises of astronomical calculations and practical engineering that, in modern novels, might be stultifying, but I enjoyed a dose of old-fashioned SF."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I read the book as a child and always remembered the story.

The plot is deceptively simple. Clifford 'Kip' Russel is an average (but fairly bright) teenager who wins a second hand space suit in a contest. Through the influences of his father, and his own desire to visit the moon he educates himself and brings his dump-ready space suit up to operational readiness. Of course he becomes enmeshed in an interstellar plot filled with exotic life forms and intergalactic politics.Like so many of Heinlein's novels this one draws you in with its adventure and accessible characters. As always, the plot is built upon a foundation of solid science and technology. It is a wonderful way to press knowledge on young people in a palatable format. I know it worked on me as a youngster.One of the things I love about this book is its datedness. While it is nominally science fiction it provides a fascinating view of the life and culture of the 1950's. As is so often the case with science fiction they make drastically unrealistic leaps with their visions of the future, while society and its moral and political structures remain fixed as they were when the novel was written.Despite its having been aimed for a pubescent audience, I find myself digging this one out to read at least once a year. I would highly recommend it to you as well."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Kip and Peewee were kidnapped by hostile extra-terrestrial invaders, only to find that after defeating them with the help of \\"the mother thing,\\" a being from the Vega system, they have to defend the earth in a trial. The trial concerned nuclear weapons (this being that period of Heinlein's life when he tried to \\"save the world\\"). Intermixed in the story is a look at how a 1950's person saw the near (50 to 100 years or so) future, as well as the universe. A hyperspace hypothesis that included time travel was mentioned but glossed over, and the main character misunderstood the theory of relativity, probably on purpose. Most interesting was the growth and maturation of Kip, an 18 year old who nearly slept through most of his schooling, then all of a sudden took seriously math and science, and how to deal with life in general, because his father insisted. He used the new-found knowledge to survive in the universe.

It's a great adventure story, and has a lot of good lessons for today's teens, who seem to think they can have the world for nothing. Lessons like &quot;you are the result of your decisions&quot; and &quot;your education is up to you&quot; and so forth. It also holds a lot of hope for humanity as we grow up and join the other beings in the Universe."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Spacesuit Will Travel ranks with Citizen of the Galaxy and Double Star as one of Heinlein's best novels. It is well written, a good adventure story, and full of marvelous ideas and characters. It's highly recommended. Don't let the title put you off."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This, along with Tunnel in the Sky, gets my vote as the best of the juvenile (YA) books that Heinlein wrote. As usual, calling this a juvenile does it something of a disservice, as the book is fully readable by anyone from ten to ninety year-olds.Kip Russell is not your typical teenager - he's not only quite intelligent, he's resourceful, honest with himself, goal-directed, and not only has dreams but realizes that it takes work to make those dreams a reality. One of those dreams is being able to take a trip to the moon, and as the family finances (clearly visible in the basket his father keeps for income) obviously won't provide enough for such a trip, he decides to enter a contest where the first prize is such a trip. But he doesn't just send in one entry and hope that Lady Luck will smile on him - he works at it, eventually sending in several thousand entries, each with a different slogan for the soap company sponsoring the contest. Does he win? No, but he does get one of the second prizes, a real, honest-to-god space suit. When it arrives, Kip sees that it is not in current \`space-worthy' shape, a disappointment - but he methodically sets about correcting the deficiencies in the suit, till he finally has something worthy of the name.Up to this point, this is something that could happen in the everyday world - but now Heinlein throws in a whopper of a \`coincidence' (a coincidence that couldn't have happened unless Kip was prepared, Heinlein's point) - while testing his suit, calling out on the built in radio, Kip gets a reply, not from some passing airliner, but a real, live UFO, piloted by, of all things, a twelve year old girl, Peewee, and with a truly alien passenger, the Mother-Thing. From here, things develop rapidly, leading to the Moon, Pluto, the Greater Magellanic Cloud, and \`Wormface' villains, with many an adventure and \`miraculous' escapes, and with the fate of not just Kip, Peewee, and the Mother-Thing hanging in the balance, but the very existence of Earth.Heinlein's craftsmanship shines throughout this book. His characters are well developed - the depiction of Peewee as an obnoxious-but-lovable prodigy is superb, the Mother-Thing will live long in your memory, Kip is very easy to identify with, and it is very instructive to see how he changes during the course of the book. The situations Heinlein places them in all develop logically, and the scientific details he throws in are very accurate. Here we find the description of the design, capabilities, and deficiencies of the space suit - remarkable close to today's suits (though not really surprising, as Heinlein was involved with some of the engineering research into high-altitude pressure suits during WWII), written in such a manner as to remain totally engrossing - one of Heinlein's great talents, as few could write about such things without boring the reader to death. Calculating the travel time to Pluto at a constant boost is not only accurate, but helps highlight another part of Heinlein's message on the value of education and confidence in one's own abilities, as Kip performs this calculation in his head, without recourse to his slide-rule (yes, that's dated, but is immaterial to the point raised). The prose style is typical Heinlein, easy, Mid-West folksy, and there is quite a bit of ironical humor suffusing this book. Of course the title is a take off on the TV show Have Gun - Will Travel, which young readers today will have never heard of, but it was a pretty good show in its day, and many of the personal qualities of the Paladin of that show are highlighted within this work.Heinlein never seemed to have very \`villainous' villains, and the Wormfaces and their human accomplices here are no exception, but the reason for this may just be (in Heinlein's view) that those who would commit crimes against others are people (or aliens) that have regard only for themselves, are out to satisfy their own desires without regard to other's rights or for any larger purpose. Heinlein's outlook on such people is that they are necessarily weak because they have no inner compass, no internalization of the benefits of the society they live in, no guiding light beyond themselves. Heinlein hammers this point home in his depiction of the human accomplices here, showing them to be remarkably stupid in an area that really counts - what makes life worth living.As usual in a Heinlein novel, he presents some items that will make you think. Kip's family organization is not typical, his father's ideas on how to raise a child are quite different from the norm, and his opinions about the adequacy of the public school system will resonate with (or disturb) any parent reading this. Kip's father's approach to income taxes and the IRS should also raise some questions about the proper role of government and just what actions private citizen can or should take when dealing with such entities. Whether mankind as a species \`deserves' to survive, given our violent and bloody history, whether our trait of stubborn determination in the face of overwhelming odds is a good or bad thing, whether the seemingly ever-increasing rate of technological development will help us or eventually overwhelm us if not balanced by a concomitant development of ethical standards that are actually adhered to by all come in for a telling examination.A grand, rollicking read, fun for everyone, with a lot of heavy-duty philosophy lying just under the hood--- Reviewed by Patrick Shepherd (hyperpat)"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Like a lot of the other people who wrote reviews, I picked this one up as a kid. It was one of the first SF books I ever read, and certainly the first Heinlein. It's astonishing how well it holds up. It's the best of Heinlein's juveniles -- a very fast-paced, witty, even somewhat satirical coming of age epic. The universe of the book seems both vast and lived-in; the science is hard and believable; the villains are genuinely scary, and our teenage heroes, Kip and Pee Wee, are Heinlein's most likeable and realistically-drawn.

It is no longer considered a book just for kids, it is considered a great book for all ages. It was selected by David Pringle (a very distinguished SF Editor) as one of the 100 best Science Fiction novels.

It was my first SF book and I've been hooked ever since. For the young person (or any age, I supose) it grandly illustrates the values of determination and preparedness. As one of the characters stated, &quot;luck&quot; is something that happens to people who prepare for it. Because Kip had a spacesuit, he was able to go to the moon, Pluto, and even another galaxy. I've seriously thought of getting my own space suit, to be ready for a similar opportunity!Though written for the young reader, I enjoy this book as much at 40 as I did at 8.

His desire to go to the moon leads him to enter an advertising contest in hopes he will win his way(this after his dad says 'ok, sure, you can go to the moon son' and then Kip discovers it's just up to him to figure out how).The storyline has been covered in several other reviews here, so I'll not cover that. Instead, what I gleaned from this book was that this is something excellent for jr high/high school students to read (well, anyone really, but it would be most benificial to this age group), and I'll make sure my kids do so when they're at that age(along with a stack of Heinlein's other 'juvies') as it really makes mathmatics and science sound like fun. I was even inspired to pull out my husbands ancient sliderule and figure out how to use it(ok, that part will take some more work). This also demonstrates the virtues of courage, self-reliance, honor and perserverance.The story is quite entertaining, and quaint in it's 50's style setting. A fun book which should be in any sci-fi fans collection, and an excellent gift for any young person you may know."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Kip Russell lives in average small town America with slightly eccentric father and loving mother, when he wins a space suit in a competition. He rehabilitates same and is suddenly kidnapped and finds himself in an alien spaceship headed to the moon. He teams up with a supergenius little girl and a friendly alien to defeat the aliens and save the world.While this is a simple adventure story on its face, it has deeper levels. First of all, there are discussions of science which are interesting and educational--look at where Kip figures to himself that they are really going to Pluto, and how he schemes to fill the cell he is in with water so he can float out the top.There are also social messages woven in. Kip learns to appreciate his parents a bit more--to him, they are just \\"his parents\\", but through hints dropped several times in the book, we come to appreciate his father far more than for just, rather oddly, bundling up a box of small change and shipping it off to the IRS every April 15. Even if we were not explicitly told about Mr. and Mrs. Russell towards the end (and, frankly, I wish we weren't, it is too unsubtle), we would come to appreciate them for the way they steered Kip to maximize his potential. However, they were less successful in making Kip a social individual, and that is what starts to change during the novel.At the start of the novel, Kip displays really good relations with adults, but limited, and not so good, relations with his peer group. Kip starts out a bit of a loner--he has friends, but none seem really important to him (certainly no one helps him in Oscar's renovation). At the end, he's more assertive and, having identified himself with humanity in the climactic scene, may have found himself quite a bit more. I suspect there's a lesson for Heinlein's juvenile readers there, many of whose spiritual home was in the stacks of the library. Nothing wrong with that, but . . . Heinlein manages this better than he does in Glory Road, where Scar comes home, wins the lottery, kicks sand on the bully, etc., etc.A good read, but then go back and read it again."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I think I must have been around 9 or 10 when I read &quot;Have Space Suit Will Travel&quot;. I found it in the school's library and was immediately taken with the book. I must have read it and re-read it a dozen times by the time I moved on to Junior High. Heinlein took a common theme in boy's literature- the young boy who goes off to sea- and moved it into the twenty-first century in this tale of a boy who finds himself suddenly swept off Earth and involved in a struggle far away in space.I recently gave a copy to my nine year old nephew who is similarly entranced with the book; not bad for a sci-fi epic written over fifty years ago. Any book that can drag a twenty-first century schoolboy away from the high-tech amusements of today certainly qualifies as a classic."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Space Suit Will Travel is one of the best sci-fi I have read. The environmental descriptions are well done and the character interaction is believable even in the midst of a scene on Pluto (if you can believe that!) Mr. Heinlein makes the scenes come alive with descriptive narration and it is easy to suspend reality when reading this story. The story takes the reader on a journey from a young man's back yard to the moon then to Pluto and beyond. Of course, the message in the work is very strong. Definately a good read!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I first discovered this book as an 8 year old in the public library in Benton Harbor, Michigan. The title reminded me of &quot;Have Gun, Will Travel&quot; and the line drawing on the cover intrigued me. I read it once, checked it out again, and re-read it countless times throughout the years. As a child, I paid no attention to the author; then as a teenager, I found out that the author of &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot; and &quot;Glory Road&quot; was also th eauthor of my beloved childhood friend. I defy you not to get the heebie-jeebies from the Wormfaces, or be haunted by Heinlein's description of a forced march on Pluto, or be moved when Kip has to defend the entire human race against destruction...

I now know why it has stayed with me all these year! It is good! I have, over the years read quite a number of Heinlein's works and I must admit that this is probably my favorite of the bunch. I realize that it is considered a juvenile book and it is certainly an appropriate read for the younger reader, but, as I just found out, it is quite a nice read for the older reader also. As I remember, looking back, this book rather inspired me in many ways, and doing better in school was by no means the least. Some of Heinlein's later work was rather difficult for me to digest, i.e. I simply did not like them. I rather wish he had stuck to simply telling well told tales as he did with this one.

They were all written with respect for real science, in a style that appealed to adult readers as much as teens, with reasonably advanced vocabulary and character development.Have Space Suit Will Travel is one of the least dated, scientifically (no Martians in this one), and a bit more humorous.The story concerns a boy named Kip who dreams of flying to the moon.

The characters are fine, but the plot simply doesn't hold up very well, even for a book aimed at younger readers. Published in 1958 in the August - October issues of \\"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\\"; it is the last of Heinlein's juveniles to be written and published. In 1998, it was remembered by fans when it tied for 48th on the Locus All-Time Poll for Science Fiction novels from before 1990Clifford Russell (known as Kip) is a teenager who is finishing high-school and though he has passed the College Boards, his big dream is to go to the moon. His father has also made it clear that he needs to make his own way in the world, and so whether he goes to college or to the moon, he will have to find the means. The first part of the story covers his desperate attempt to win the Skyway Soap contest with its prize of a trip to the moon. Through hard work, the help of family and friends, and the whole town where he lives, Kip manages to put together nearly 5,800 entries to the contest.Unfortunately Kip doesn't win the grand prize, but he is one of the people who is awarded the runner-up prize of a space suit. While it was a real space suit, it has been stripped down, so Kip decides to work hard at fixing the suit up, and this becomes the focus of the energies. As fall approaches and he has finished the suit, he realizes that he will need to sell the suit in order to attend college, so he decides to take one last walk in his fully functional space suit.The story in this initial section is pretty straight forward. Heinlein develops Kip's character well, and there is a reasonable scientific basis for his repair of the space suit. At this point though, the story moves into more of a space adventure story. A rather implausible scenario results in Kip being kidnapped and aboard a space ship heading for the moon with a genius child, Patricia Reisfeld (known as Peewee) as a fellow prisoner as well as the Mother Thing (an alien), all of which are prisoners of Wormface (another alien) who is part of a race which seems intent on taking over the Earth.While the jump into the space adventure part of the story is rather drastic, and completely changes the setting from one which was fairly plausible to one with two previously unknown aliens species and space ships using previously unknown drives, far beyond the technology of Earth, the transition does take place early enough in the story that the reader is willing to forgive the abrupt change. This part of the story ends up taking our characters to Pluto and puts them in a dire situation from which it appears impossible for them to escape.At this point, Heinlein is forced to help the characters out of their dilemma, and then once again changes the reality of the story he was telling, to something else entirely. Now we find ourselves in a universe with space ships and drives which are capable of near instantaneous travel anywhere, and we move from an alien invasion story to one of morality. First we have the Wormface race put on trial, and then humanity itself. It is not clear why Heinlein decided to add these things in such a weak way so late in the story. One can only guess that it would not have been long enough without this section, but that doesn't change the fact that it weakens the overall story to a great extent.If you know Heinlein, then you know that his characters are interesting and that his writing is very engaging for the reader. Both of those things are certainly true for this novel as they are for most of his work. However, this really is one of his weaker efforts, and I would strongly suggest that you do not select this novel as an introduction to Heinlein."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"This is the first book I've ever read by Heinlein, and I suspect that this will not be the last. Any book/author that encourages youngsters to learn more about science and the applications of math, enhances the imagination about the far reaches of space and what it holds, and makes it fun and entertaining will, of course, be highly recommended by me.This is the story of Kip Russell who's biggest desire is to make it to the moon. This story not only takes us to the moon but also to the edge of our solar system and beyond.There were two things that I really liked about this story. The first was the desire by Kip's father that Kip obtain a REAL education, not just the simplistic and spoon-fed \\"education\\" of our public high schools. I was also very impressed that this book shows the applications of math in science, though now-a-days a computer or a good calculator would be used instead of a slide-ruler.There were some things that bothered me about this book, though. First, the dialog was a little bit surreal and watered down. The two \\"geniuses\\" seemed to be spending WAY too much time explaining to each other what was going on. The other was the trial of the human species at the end of the book. Actually, it was a trial of two different home worlds and it struck me that while there was very little difference between the two races, they received two very different sentences. Those who stood up to support the human race did nothing to support the \\"worm faces,\\" and the result of the trial didn't amount to very much anyways.However, I would highly recommend this book to anybody who enjoys science fiction and I'm looking forward to picking up more works by this author."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Have Spacesuit will travel is the type of sci-fi action adventure that keeps you captivated throughout the entire book.

He then is abducted by aliens and meets his new best friend. Peewee. A young, intelligent and emotionally girl. Together they escape enemy ships, travel to different galaxies and save the earth ,and all who populate it, from total destruction.

But for what it is worth, this novel is in my personal top-10. 5-stars, easily.Kindle Edition Review:This is easy, the Kindle Edition is without flaw.Nice cover! The text conversion is perfect. I did not see a typo introduced by the conversion. Bravo Mr./Ms. Editor!Even the price I paid, 7-bucks, felt fair. That is a full 3-bucks less than a physical edition. So while I could nit-pick and say a lower price would be even better, I am forced to admit the price-point was an 'instant buy' for me.Publishers listen-up: if you want the 5-stars, this Kindle Edition could be your benchmark. 1) Invest some time in the text conversion and other presentation elements. 2) Give fair value for the dollar. 3) Win!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Although considered one of his juveniles, Heinlein cleverly concealed a lot of more adult themes in these books (such as the no-nonsense marital advice in The Star Beast)--often dispensing valuable advice about the importance of good old fashioned values, especially hard work, discipline, integrity, loyalty, friendship, personal responsibility (especially civic responsibility), getting a good education, and other important qualities that young people needed to learn about.This book is no different, and when the main character wins an old space suit in a contest and puts in a lot of time and effort to repair and recondition it, his industriousness \\"pays off\\" when he serendipitously gets involved in an improbable but fascinating drama of intergalactic proportions (he ends up visiting one of the Magellanic Clouds). Some of the most interesting parts of the book are the comparisons between the various alien races in regard to their observing proper morality and values themselves, although the security council meeting at the end of the book makes it clear that right or wrong, humanity will be exterminated if they pose a threat to the rest of the galaxy.In that sense, the book anticipates the movie, \\"The Day the Earth Stood Still,\\" and it's preachy but dire message, by ten years. But Heinlein, always more than a little ahead of his time, had an uncanny gift for sensing the winds of change. Most of the science in the book was far enough in the future so that very little of it seems dated, and like many of Heinlein's books it has stood the test of time and is still worth reading today."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Although dated (and what isn't dated today), this is another great book by Heinlein. I remember finding this book in the school library when I was a kid and never forgot reading it from cover to cover. Now I am sharing it with my kids. Great adventure!"},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I have read of this being referred to as \\"Juvenile\\" novel and how wrong those folks are. Its a fun romp, with ample explanation and surprisingly complicated math for our young hero to consider. In the end the novel reaches a climax that will determine Human survival and painted against the backdrop of the judgment against another species its pretty hard edged stuff.I really really liked this. Perhaps all the more so since it was far mor than I expected.If you liked Citizen of the Galaxy or The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress then pick this up as soon as you can and you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I've recently rediscovered Heinlein, and started reading Have Space Suit Will Travel again. Having finished the book, I now remember clearly why I loved this author so much years ago, and Have Space Suite Will Travel is one of Heinlein's best. This book is pure science fiction and it is seemingly written for the pure enjoyment of the reader.Have Space Suit Will Travel was originally published in 1958, and it reads as fresh today as I'm sure it did then. This is one story that is sure to be enjoyed by generations to come. Although this is generally regarded as one of Heinlein's juvenile books, Heinlein's writing is really for all ages. Younger readers enjoy it because its protagonists are themselves young people: Kip is a high school senior and Peewee is a girl of about twelve.What's the story about? When Kip develops an overpowering urge to go to the moon, he is lucky enough to win a real space suit in a contest. The space suit is fascinating to Kip but he ends up deciding to sell the suit for college tuition money. If the story ended there, it wouldn't be much of a story.What happens next though is that Kip decides to go for one last walk and when he makes a call on the spacesuit radio he is surprised to hear an answer to his call. He is amazed when a space ship soon lands in his backyard and a decidedly alien creature comes out and collapses. A second ship lands, an entity gets out and conks Kip on the head, and the next thing Kip knows he is trapped inside a space ship on his way to the moon. He wakes up in the company of a younger girl - Pewee. And this is where things get really fun.Kip's captors are \\"wormfaces,\\" a species of alien that has been in hiding on the moon and are intent on having Earth for their own. Peewee introduces Kip to another captive on the ship called the \\"Mother Thing.\\" The Mother Thing is an and interstellar cop who radiates love and warmth, and inspires undying love and devotion. Kip and Pewee work to rescue the Mother Thing from the Wormfaces and eventually return to earth. As they do so, they endure captivity on Pluto, escape death multiple times, and eventually find themselves representing Earth in an interstellar courtroom where the future of Earth is in their hands.A great book for young and old."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"Okay, some of it's dated -- though drug stores that serve malts are making a big comeback!

When there is a description of how the person said it, that description is included.I first read the novel decades ago when I was either in late elementary school or middle school. I still enjoy this novel today. The audio performance is just as much fun as reading the book.Overall it is well done. However for the chapter breaks, they use the old type of spooky sci-fi music. This is not needed for this book and I personally feel it slightly detracts from the overall performance.

Now I'm 41, and when I re-read it, the novel still leaves me with a sense of awe and deep pleasure akin to the special feeling I get from The Wind in the Willows or The Hobbit. The storyline flings the heroes further and further away from home, and the stakes rise steadily, making for a riveting read. This technique - the expanding sphere of influence of the action - means that the book must keep one-upping itself to deliver. Which it does, admirably.The novel has some unforgettable prose: at one point the hero says of the villain/monster, 'I had a dirty hunch I knew Wormface's home address.\\" Capturing perfectly the book's Boy Scout sense of morality and adventure, he asks his companion, who is tying a knot on their vital oxygen tank, \\"Is it a square knot?\\" Peewee answers, \\"It was a granny, but it's a square knot now.\\" This coming of age novel has some thoughtful insights into young Kip's budding sense of ethics, like when he is given a chance to speak in defense of the mailicious race that planned to destroy humanity and he decides not to: he reasons that there are limits to mercy and that, \\"when you see a black widow, you step on it.\\"This book will forever be in my pantheon of cult classics, because it helped me fall head over heels in love with reading, and I have never lost that feeling."},{"Title":"Have Space Suit, Will Travel","review":"I read this book as a youth.

What goes so wrong in our families,in our relationships?\\" And--in keeping with the spirit of this film and the novella by Jim Harrison--\\"What is the healing role of wild nature and its animals?\\" Ultimately, as Chachere suggests,this story of the Ludlow family affirms life, wonderfully and with great dignity and redemption, and we are invited to participate fully as we follow the film and its soundtrack step by step.

I tried employment agencies and the internet but hadn't been receiving any positive responses to my submissions. ***I admit I was beginning to take it personal.*** I didn't know if I wasn't getting the response I had hoped for because the market is so competitive, because I had been out of the job market for so long (I took about 3 years off to be a stay at home mom), or because maybe I wasn't marketable anymore.So, I figured I better revamp the old resume and try again. I would start with online submissions before I took it to the agencies. I couldn't afford to get it professionally redone so I bought the \\"Knock em Dead\\" book along with the \\"Knock em Dead Resume\\" book in the hopes that I could get some fresh ideas.In the span of one week, I redid my resume based on the formats given in the book and emailed it to a few corporations to see if I got any bites. I did. I landed an interview with a huge company the following week. In fact they were so impressed with my resume and presentation that I received a very lucrative offer last week. (The whole process took about 3 weeks total!) I simply followed the steps as Mr. Yate laid them out and I am starting this coming Monday.His advice was dead on! I knew I had an edge on the competition based on my interviewers response to me. I actually had one interviewer stop me in the middle of our meeting to compliment me on one of the best presentations he has ever had the pleasure to participate in. HA!!! HE THANKED ME!!!! This had to be the Twilight Zone!!!I can't think of any other way that I can express my gratitude to Mr. Yate for writing this book other than this endorsement...BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU ARE SERIOUS ABOUT GETTING THE JOB YOU WANT!Mr. Yate, I couldn't have done it without you and some serious prayer!"},{"Title":"Knock 'Em Dead 2003","review":"This is by far the best strategy book I have ever seen for job hunting. The questions offered to help you interview the company, and the excellent responses he recommends for those tough interview questions most everyone will receive, especially those used on men, will turn around your interviews to get your prospective employer to possibly even chase you with offers you thought unimaginable.No, this is not your dandy dating book for flirting through the interview, no siree. This book shows you how to negotiate the deal, prepare yourself for ivestigating the career paths of those who have gone before, the culture and environment you'll be working in, and how to tread new inroads to bring about a more meaningful paradigm of personal excellence and the perks to help you make this all come true.I made outlines of three chapters, reading them between each interview and practicing what I learned at every interview, even engaging some where I had slight chance of getting the job but squeezed every element I could bring to bear to make the interview an experience to learn from and try these techniques as best I could so I'd be better prepared when the better opportunities came along.This book and the other Knock 'Em Dead books offer the skills that should be passed down from generation to generation so that no young person should ever have to go through life with the trial and error that stifles their career growth and constipates their financial viability.

It is a method that is a surefire way to have your countless resumes you sent out to be thrown right into the trash and land you a job you can have at best, a cordial hatred of doing.I really disliked the author's overall tone in that if you were looking for a job, or god forbid, didn't have one, then you were a miserable expletive that only deserved a job if you pulled yourself up by your own bootstraps. At one point in this book, the author suggests that if you went to the library to get information in searching for a job, then you didn't even deserve to drive your car to the library, and that you should consider walking.I think that this book is a degrading waste of time to read, and has a much better use as fuel for a fire in a fireplace. Once you've used it this way, you'll never have to look at this book ever again."},{"Title":"Listening to the Music of the Spirit: The Art of Discernment","review":"Since Vatican II Catholics, guided more by the Spirit than law, have had special need for discernment. Fortunately, as Lonsdale points out, they have also moved from devotional piety to the Scripture and personal prayer that provide tools for discernment. Lonsdale sketches the global, social, cultural, ecclesial, historical and religious contexts of personal and group discernment, and analyzes sensitively and thoroughly its many and various elements and techniques, its intellectual and affective dimensions, the roles of consolation, desolation, and desires, and the obstacles to any form of discernment. He is deeply rooted in and draws heavily upon the spirituality of Ignatius Loyola, and writes with wisdom, clarity, and literary grace. One useful addition to the text, however, would be a treatment of an element of discernment found in Ignatius's Spiritual Journal and in the First Deliberation of Ignatius and his followers that persuaded them to form a religious order: the options should be considered separately (even on alternate days), and in group discernment the group should seek in unison first the reasons for one choice then later the reasons for the other. This technique maximizes individual openness to the force of each argument and objection, and minimizes conflict. Two insights in his last chapter are especially good: that Jesuit spirituality may be rooted in the individuality of the desert spirituality explained by John Cassian, and that Ignatian discernment unites the intellectual, institutional Catholic tradition with the affective, personal Protestant tradition.

In every biographical sketch of Graves his autobiography is given equal mention as his poetry and his best-known works like &quot;I, Claudius&quot; and I now understand the reason: his life's story is just as entertaining and informative as any of his fiction. Thus, to read this volume of stories as autobiography is to explore the life of Robert Graves. Thematically, the stories are divided into three sections - English Stories, Roman Stories, Majorcan Stories - each serves a different function. The &quot;English Stories&quot; comprise memories from Graves' youth spent at boarding school, witty scenes from social engagements such as one might come across in the works of Evelyn Waugh, and even a supernatual dream-tale told by an inmate at an insane asylum. The stories are also poignant, for they remind us of what Graves witnessed in the Great War, a memorial of his son who was killed in the Second, and ultimately they are scenes from a world and a life which Robert Graves left behind when he said &quot;goodbye&quot; to England in 1929. The &quot;Roman Stories&quot; are a treat to those who have read his two &quot;Claudius&quot; novels or his other historical fiction; they are ancient cultures for modern sensibilities. And the &quot;Majorcan Stories&quot; are leisurely tales to be spun after dinner on a warm Mediterranean evening - they are the stories of Graves' new life, stories of bicycle thieves, doomed Majorcan nobles, an errant Broadway producer and, improbably, the story of how Ava Gardner saved a furniture factory. The reader cannot help but get the sense that Robert Graves if speaking directly to us, telling us his own story without judgment or reservation. And perhaps most importantly, we are being entertained."},{"Title":"Collected Short Stories","review":"\\"The Shout,\\" in this collection, may be the finest short story I have ever read.

Its construction is poor at best. My son is less than six months old and already the plastic screw and nut construction won't hold the binding together. The book pops apart every time I open it, it is a real mess. If this is what it is like at less than six months, I wonder how the publisher expects it to hold up as a lifetime keepsake. What bothers me the most about it though, is that I have been reluctant to pick it up and write in it because I don't have the time to line up the pages and put it back together again once I open it. It is a darn shame. I can't return it, since I've written in it already. I did call the publisher and they offered to replace the book, but really, that isn't what I need, I need better screws that don't strip under pressure.

It does not assume you will have a christening or what race you are. (It does have a page called \\"religious ceremonies\\"...I guess I will just white that out or something...)The illustrations and page titles are FUN but not precious and ducky-cutesy. I have heard of problems with the plastic screw bindings but this is easily solved by a trip to the crafts store to get metal scrapbook binding screws to replace them.If you ABSOLUTELY CAN'T find this anywhere, the very best second choice is \\"OH BABY!

Turner's thesis that the availability of land that could be acquired by anyone willing to work it explains how America developed is a landmark idea in explaining the United States. There is much to be said in favor of his ideas. From the moment that colonies were established by the European powers on the East Coast until the frontier was declared closed in the late nineteenth century, hardy people migrated westward. There was a natural progression of the early hunters and trappers followed by people who planted some crops but still relied primarily on what they could kill or capture to those who constructed farms. The first two groups were transient, and the last group was permanent. It was they who established the communities with schools, churches, and commerce.This book starts with an explanation of Turner's classic paper, which is followed by the text that he delivered. While some of what he says in the paper is still controversial, it remains one of the most significant examinations of the forces that drove the development of the United States. It is a paper that is must reading for anyone studying the history of the United States before the frontier vanished at the start of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"The Significance of the Frontier in American History (Milestones of Thought)","review":"I ordered the one with ISBN 978-0-141-04257-2 not knowing it was a flimsy edition with only four of the 13 chapters in the real book!

Penguin Classics has re-issued these essays as part of its Great Ideas series.Frederick Jackson Turner is featured in just about every U.S. History textbook for his essay The Significance of the Frontier in American History, written in 1893. I am embarrassed note that I had never read this classic essay until I read this collection, although I was familiar with its basic thesis. In this essay Turner notes that the 1890 census dtermined that as of 1890 there was no longer a definable \\"frontier.\\" He asserts that this is the beginning of something new for the United States as it has always been defined by its (usually) westward boundary.Turner notes that the Western settlers came from all parts of the eastern seaboard but created a new culture, and in some ways the definitive American culture, when these diverse groups of settlers brought their old ways of doing and thinking and mingled them with one another to make something new. These settlers are known for their rugged individualism, a more egalitarian mindset (the frontier states were the first ones to lift property requirements to vote and, later, to let women vote) and a demand for government intervention in curtailing the power of corporations (at the time of the essay the Granger movement was quite active). Turner is quite clear that the presence of \\"free\\" land waiting for settlement was a major reason for the \\"self-made\\" man of the frontier and openly wondered about opportunities for economic advancement in a future with no frontier.The second essay is The Problem of the West, written in 1896. It describes the dissonance between the original states on the east coast and the states that came were settled later. In many ways, this continues on to this day - just take a look at one of the political red state/blue state maps. He points to the Old Northwest territory states as being the linchpin that tie the Union together. States like Illinois, Michigan and Indiana are a little bit Western and also have strong ties to the east coast.The Significance of the Mississippi Valley in American History, written in 1909 and 1910, discusses how the Mississippi River system, including the Ohio and Missouri Rivers, were the key to the exploration and settlement of a great chunk of the country. Not only did the settlers follow the rivers, but those rivers were their lifeline to the larger world of trade.The last essay is the weakest, in my opinion. It was written in 1910 and is entitled Social Forces in American History. In many ways, it is the bookend for the title essay. Turner describes changes that he has seen in American society since the closing of the frontier, including the growth of corporations and those that get fabulously wealthy from industry and the beginnings of activist government."},{"Title":"Social Work Practice: A Radical Perspective","review":"Even though written in 1982, Galper's book remains a clear, useable guide for those interested in infusing their daily social work practice with socialist political content."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"I think Cliff Linedecker has an annoying habit of writing a promising book and then not filling it in with details. I have a feeling Phil Carlo's book will be better detailed, since it is about 600 pages. While this does have some good points, Linedecker seems to have done his rush to print style, such as his earlier work about John Wayne Gacy. However, I enjoyed this as a quick and easy distraction from the hard days at school; I think any serious student of true crime will agree when I say this isn't the definitive Ramirez story ( You will enjoy the Satanism in America chapter as well as the later one about the lawyers and the press; those are both very rewarding)."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"Not what I would call a well written book.Not even what I would call a factual book.That being said, I'd suggest that if Richard Ramirez fascinates you, and you wish to learn more about him and the crimes that he committed pick up a copy of Philip Carlo's book &quot;The Night Stalker: the life and crimes of Richard Ramirez&quot;. Carol's book is a much better documented account of Ramirez, due in part, because Carlo actually interviewed Ramirez numerous times.If you really don't care that the information is correct or you just want a macabe story to read, then by all means, get this book. Otherwise, buy Carlo's book, you'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"This is the WORST book I have ever read in my life. Riddled with discrepancies, the author felt the egotistical heroism to change the name of some of the victims (which are readily available to anyone who wants to research them anyway) all this book does is irritate and confuse those who are already familiar with the Night Stalker case. Even some of the names he DIDN'T try to cover up, he got wrong. The suspect's sister, as one example. The author is obviously biased and will make underhanded cheap shots at Mr.Ramirez at any open opportunity. It's childish and disgusting and makes for a terrible read, completely un-educational, the false facts poison the entire story. Mr.Linedecker couldn't even get the number of siblings Richie had/has correct, he consistantly goes back to change the \\"facts\\" he had already mentioned and gotten incorrect (such as how a victim had been killed, going from shooting an incorrect number of times, to stabbing). Falsified information, he repeats himself endlessly, skips details altogether, and just plain makes things up. I have zero respect for this author, this was an uninteresting read through and through. Before I had even begun, I was curious how someone could fully cover a subject like this with so few pages, and the answer is--you can't. I felt as if I was reading the rough draft of an awful story that a 5th grader had written, I hope the author didn't get paid for this piece of trash. Take this one out of the 'true crime' section and file this one under FICTION, in the bargain bin.If you want the real deal, please, I cannot beg you enough, read Night Stalker by Philip Carlo. He's a brilliant author who spent over 100 hours talking with Richard Ramirez himself. I trust that he got all the information he possibly could, as close to truth as humanly possible. He's creative with his words, expresses environments in such a way you can nearly feel it, and most importantly he isn't biased. He brings us enlightenment on every area of the subjects life, this book provides a wonderful insight into the killers mind, and puts you right there in the action.Leave Linedecker's garbage in the trash, where it belongs."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"After reading Philip Carlo's book I wanted to know everything I could about Richard Ramirez.

I had to put this book down and couldnt even finish it."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"I first heard about this case when I was younger. Richard Ramirez was the boogeyman incarnate. Absolutely terrifying. Finding this book as an adult, it was every bit as terrifying as when I was a young teen learning about a serial killer who terrorized Los Angeles via an NBC movie of the week. The book chronicles the events during Ramirez' reign of terror in California and the fiasco of a trial that followed. Fans of true crime narratives will enjoy this book, for the historic relevance and the terrifying story -remember this is all real, folks. Ramirez is a real-life Michael Myers, Jason Voorhees and Freddy Kruger rolled into one, more than just for his body count. The terror comes from his complete disregard for motivation into his killings, his lack of motivation toward racial, socio-economic or gender grudges -he killed, raped and tortured indiscriminately, driven only by his love for Satan. Not a groundbreaking piece of literature, but then again, it's not meant to be. \\"Night Stalker\\" is a page turner, best read with the lights on and doors locked.

I highly recommend this book but only if you're into true crime."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"\\"I'm your night prowler, break down your doorI'm your night prowler, crawling 'cross your floorI'm your night prowler, make a mess of you, yes i willNight prowler, and i am telling this to youThere ain't nothing you can do\\"AC-DC's \\"Night Prowler\\" (1979)From to 17 March to 8 August 1985, fourteen people were murdered and mutilated, with others surviving horrific ordeals. This was a serial killer, who in the case of couples, killed the man first, and if the woman was lucky, her too, as many left alive suffered even more. What initially puzzled the LA police was that the victims cut across race lines. Even though the first victims were Oriental or East Asian, the addition of dead Anglos put paid that theory. But what set the killings apart from the usual convenience store shootings was their sheer savagery, as one of the victims had her eyes plucked out. Another victim bravely spoke to him after her ordeal so she could remember his face should he be caught.Clifford Linedecker's account of Richard Ramirez, the Night Stalker, is a well-detailed account that takes the reader from the first victim, to his being sentenced to death by a California jury, and even a to-date postscript, showing that he is still on death row.The book delves into more than just the killings themselves. Linedecker explains the race and population demographics in LA as a background. LA is such a racially diverse place, that various race groups formed their own enclave in the metropolis, such as the Japanese and Chinese in Cerritos, the Thais and Salvadorans in Hollywood Hills, and Mexicans in east. It's also such an economic powerhouse that it could be an independent country if it chose.Night Stalker also details the working of the press and how things haven't changed since the days of Al Capone and Bonnie and Clyde, that of making killers into heroes. In this case, it was the Los Angeles Herald Examiner that gave Ramirez his well-known monicker, The Night Stalker. And the methodology used by detectives in tracking down serial killers-Wayne Williams and the Atlanta Child Murders is used as the example-is included.If anything, Ramirez turned LA residential areas into fortresses. Demand for guns, security systems, fences, and guard dogs skyrocketed, Neighbourhood Watches sprouted like duckweed, and any unfamiliar person in the neighbourhood were reported. In fact, one husband gave his wife a cyanide pill should the Night Stalker break in, figuring that death was better than what he would do to her. But what also amazed me was the relative laxness in home security. Ramirez entered via unlocked doors. Why not just put a sign on the door saying \\"Hey, Night Stalker, kill and torture me\\"?Another chapter delves into the clues and how they weave into past history and the prevalent pop culture. Ramirez's AC-DC cap fuelled the fire of heavy metal being the devil's music, and all amid the teen suicides that took place because parents blamed albums by Ozzy Osbourne and Judas Priest. In fact, \\"Night Prowler\\" from AC-DC's Highway To Hell album was made the Night Stalker's anthem. Another is the pentagram drawn on one of the victims. There follows a brief discussion on the devil-worshipping and the Knights Templar. At least Linedecker gets accurate Anton LaVey's sect that they don't sacrifice animals or people.The final section deals with the trial, which took three and a half years of legal juggling on the side of the defense. Ramirez wasn't the most genteel of defendants, his outrageous behaviour resulting in his removal from the courtroom.A well-documented account of one of the U.S.'s most notorious serial killers."},{"Title":"Night Stalker (True Crime (St. Martin's Paperbacks))","review":"A hispantic man in the Los Anglos area goes around killing people.

Essentially a collection of interviews that he has done over the years with The Comics Journal, this book covers the man's entire career, from his early fanzine work right on up to DK2.In typical TCJ fashion, the interviews are quite in-depth and span a wide range of topics. Miller has always been a big proponent of fighting against censorship and sounds off on the self-imposed censoring that the comic companies do on a regular basis.Fans of his seminal works, Ronin, The Dark Knight Returns and Sin City, will be delighted to see him talk at length about each of these titles. He also goes into detail about his stint on Daredevil and his motivation for doing a Dark Knight sequel. He also touches upon everything in between -- including Martha Washington, Hard Boiled and 300. Also, Miller talks a bit about his feelings on 9/11 (he moved back to NYC when it happened) and how it informs his work.In short, this is a fascinating book on a true artist and a genius in the comics field. In addition to the interviews there is a great collection of art from all of his major works and also rare, unpublished stuff as well. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Comics Journal Library: Frank Miller","review":"Frank Miller was an influential comic book author in the 80's when his Daredevil and Batman treatments challenged the limits of their self-censoring publishers.

The message today is as timely as it was then -- or, for that matter as it was during Civil War America. Professor Nichols book is a good overview of Indian policy during the Civil War-- an often overlooked part of the Lincoln story.The book begins with an overview of the system of Indian administration as it had developed by 1860. It was dominated by the political spoils system and by corruption resulting from the power accorded to the Indian agents. As a master of the art of pragmatic politics, Lincoln used the system -- as he needed to do--to hold the Union together-resulting in tragedy for too many of our country's Indian wards.The book discusses the Five Civilized Tribes of Oklahoma (then Indian territory) and their relationship to both the Union and the Confederacy. The story picks up focus, though, in the discussion of the Minnesota Sioux rebellion, the summary trials and capital sentences of over 300 Sioux Indians, and Lincoln's remission of the death sentence in all but 39 cases. Nichols tells this story well, perhaps giving Lincoln's actions less credit and less courage than they may deserve.The book discusses Lincoln's attempts in 1862 to reform Indian policy, which were defeated by War exegencies and by Congressional inaction.He discusses a famous meeting held between Lincoln and the Indian chiefs in 1863 in the White House, again perhaps undervaluing Lincoln's intentions and the difficulties he faced.He discusses the policy resulting from the Sioux war of concentrating the Indians under the control of the military with unsuccessful and inhumane results in Arizona and New Mexico. The book also includes an account of the too little known Sand Hill Massacre in Colorado in 1864.The treatment of the American Indians does not constitute one of our nation's or of President Lincoln's prouder accomplishments. Professor Nichols is correct that this story deserves to be known as part of our history. The book ties Lincoln's treatment of the Indians to prevailing ideologies at the time involving a disprespect of cultural differences, to westward expansion, industrialization, the political patronage system, and, first and foresmost, the Civil War. Even Nichols appears to acknowledge that given the War, there was little that might have been done differently at the time in the way of systematic reform.As is unfortunately the case with most histories of Indian affairs, it is easier, as Nichols does, to find a great deal of deserved fault than it is to develop answers, as he does not. This book is still worth reading as a good history of Indian affairs during the Civil War era."},{"Title":"Lincoln and the Indians: CIVIL WAR POLICY AND POLITICS","review":"It is time to learn what really happened in our nation's history.

Even with this text, I had to change my strategy and reference the \\"Indian Office\\" as the factor. The material covers the full spectrum nevertheless. I did not expect the text to be a double feature in repeating the same story in the second half, but, with a more detailed chronology so, having already covered the history, I felt the time crunch albeit, the complete review is appreciated.

Perhaps it was due to the fact that I started in the belief that Henry III did not merit an entire volume to himself. Then I realized that this Weathercock King lived an extremely long life and all that happened during his reign was momentous indeed. For instance, learning how the Countess of Flanders played a part in ensuring future Vatican Cardinals always wear red is something I didn't think I would chance upon during this read. Or all the little bios Costain supplies for people long since lost to the annals of time. Great stuff, I simply couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Magnificent century (A History of the Plantagenets)","review":"I first read these books 20 years ago, and the opportunity to purchase them in a new edition is the thrill of the year for me.

He leaves a great foundation for a student to build a knowledge of history on."},{"Title":"The Magnificent century (A History of the Plantagenets)","review":"Thomas B. Costain is one of the most readable of historians because he firstly draws on an awareness, gained in his years as a novelist, of the necessity on the part of a writer to above all reach out to his reader. An even greater praise might be this: Costain is also one of the most intelligent historians I've ever had the good fortune to read.This is Costain's second volume in his well-rounded four-book history of England during the rule of its most storied dynasty, the Plantagenets. Here, in just under four-hundred pages, Costain concentrates on the events of the thirteenth-century reign of Henry III, who came to the throne in 1216, and who passed away forty-six years later in the autumn of 1272. Beginning his story during the regency of the great and good William Marshal, \\"right hand man\\" of four monarchs, and ending it shortly after Prince Edward's crushing of the baronial revolt led by Simon de Montfort, Costain makes the interesting case that the thirteenth-century was perhaps the grandest and most glorious if not in the whole of English history, then undeniably that in the era of the Plantagenets.This was the first volume I've read so far in the quartet, but it won't be the last."},{"Title":"The Magnificent century (A History of the Plantagenets)","review":"Remember that Costain was a novelist, not a historian. What Costain did with these books was to write a series of novels that were based on history but are bad history. Costain writes with purple prose that prejudges his subjects. You cannot do that with history. He constantly says how \\"bad\\" King John was. Was he? He had his failings but for a self-styled \\"historian\\" to call him \\"bad\\" or \\"evil\\" at every turn is ridiculous. After all, some base their opinions of King Richard III on Shakespeare's play - which was written to set Richard in a bad light and Edward VII, the first of the Tudors (of which his patron, Elizabeth I, was one) in a good light. History has since shown that Richard III was a fine monarch nor was the deformed hunchback depicted by Shakespeare. Again, bad history, great play. In Costain's books nothing is footnoted, conversations are fabricated, and history is disregarded. For example, he says that King John signed the Magna Carta (which he misspells) and that there was one. Wrong! There were 41 copies and each was sealed by the King, not signed. A small error? No! If he gets that wrong, what about the rest? Again, good novel, bad history so read these as novels but do NOT take them as history."},{"Title":"The Magnificent century (A History of the Plantagenets)","review":"The age Game of Thrones was based upon is best exposed through Costain's Pageant of England.

I liked the style of writing most of all. The way the author wrote the story is the same way I write. I also liked how it made me think. It kind of confused me sometimes. The last of the story is written from Mutt's point of view. Mutt then begins to rewrite his future in a whole different way. This book really puts readers right in the story."},{"Title":"Me, Myself and I","review":"I remember reading this when I was a kid. I always thought it was a pretty neat book. Time travel is always a cool thing to read about, and this one is pretty good too. One of the best things I remember is writing a letter to the author. She wrote me a full-length letter back! For an 11-year-old kid, that's quite a thrill. I recommend this book for any children's book library."},{"Title":"Burning City","review":"I read this book a while ago, checked it out from the library and read it in a couple days. I loved it.The description and even the other reviewer mention the flaws of the setting and how the plot seems unrealistic but in my mind these aren't flaws at all. When I read this book it had a bit of a nonsensical feel to me. Like it wasn't supposed to be completely realistic, it was supposed to be about the people rather than the plot. And the people are great. Heller is one of the best written characters I have read and for a young adult novel I think the characters are much more important than anything else because teens are looking for people to relate to.As was said in one of the novel descriptions I think this book and it's characters are best for \\"thoughtful\\" teens. The story itself is quite interesting and does grab your attention, but the characters and their inner relationships and emotions are what makes the story, so if you're only interested in a story about a young bicyclist that's not what you're going to get. But if you want to read a story filled with characters who are complex and interesting and still so understandable, this is definitely a book you will love."},{"Title":"Burning City","review":"i was given an advanced copy of this book and i didn't want to read it. i hate 'sports' books. i never even picked this up until after it was already in the library and cataloged and on the shelf. man was i an idiot:)this book is great! wait, it's better than great:) the characters are amazing (and really, they make this book). every distinct, vivid, realistic, snarky, wonderful person in this story rocked.heller meets people over and over in manhatten rather conviniently, and the story line is a little on the, shall we say, unrealistic side. however, these flaws are totally easy to overlook when the dialog happens. (besides, when was the last time i saw a movie with a realistic story line???)absolutely unique."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I very much enjoyed reading MOURNING SHIFT by Kathleen Taylor. Once again, Tory Bauer, overweight, over 40, and over likely to discover dead bodies, is in fine form. Right away she discovers the dead body of an elderly man in the bathroom of the cafe where she waitresses. Turns out he was the husband of cafe cook/owner Aphrodite. Shortly after discovering the body, Aphrodite's step-daughter and her son arrive in town, making it a regular family reunion. Unfortunately, there's a bomber on the loose, and one of the main characters is killed. Tory investigates and soon puts all the clues together for a surprise ending.While the author did provide readers with all the necessary clues to figure out whodunit, I never put it all together. (A book is successful for me if the author can provide all the clues and still keep me guessing.) I also enjoyed the Woo-Woo Factor (the term used by mystery buffs to describe supernatural incidences in books). All the usual characters were back being their normal, quirky selves, providing additional laughs. A nice, light summer read perfect to take with you on vacation."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Kathleen Taylor is in fine form with her latest mystery, Mourning Shift. Tory Bauer, widowed, overweight, over forty waitress at the only eating establishment in town, the Delphi Cafe is crankier than usual. It's Halloween, her least favorite holiday, she's dressed as a munchkin from The Wizard of Oz and she's just discovered the dead body of a patron in the cafe bathroom. To make matters worse, he's the long estranged husband of Aphrodite Ferguson, the cafe's owner (no one in town knew she'd ever been married), his daughter and grandson have just arrived at the cafe to meet him and Tory has to give them the bad news. But the day isn't over yet. Within hours, one of the locals is murdered, blown to bits by a car bomb and the two deaths may be connected. When always inquisitive Tory starts looking for answers, secrets start popping up all over town. This is a terrific, fast paced, funny mystery full of great quirky characters. The writing is sharp and witty with dialogue so irreverent and down to earth, you'll find yourself laughing out loud. And though all the clues are there, the mystery has enough twists and turns to keep you off balance and guessing to the surprise ending of the story. So take a trip to South Dakota and join the fun at the Delphi Cafe. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"If you are already among the Kathleen Taylor fans, you'll find MOURNING SHIFT even better than her other books. If you're not and you read this one, it'll make you want to go back and read the others. All of her marvelous characters are here. Add the excitement of a Halloween arrival of an attractive stripper and it's one big bang.....with a little woo woo thrown in.Ms. Taylor captures perfectly the imperfect, which is just about everyone in Delphi, South Dakota. Her plots have always been well done and her endings have always left readers with dilemmas. MOURNING SHIFT, however, goes beyond the other books. The plot is thrilling and the ending is superb.Kathleen Taylor continues to write some of the most exciting, thoughtful, and downright funny books one could ever want to read.MOURNING SHIFT is a 10 on a scale of 1 to 5."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"This is the second book in this series that I've read and revisiting these colorful characters is like sinking into a big comfy chair. I like the way Ms. Taylor tells a story...it seems effortless (as it should). A very good mystery with plenty of twists and turns and a very satisfying conclusion. I don't understand why this author isn't getting more attention. She's gone to the top of my list."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I always enjoy reaquainting myself with Delphi's characters...Kathleen Taylor has truly captured the essence of small town life. Her storylines are always twisting in unexpected directions, leading me to re-read sections looking for the clues I missed the first time! I have recommended this book to all my friends and family."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Who knew? Who knew that South Dakota harbored such wise, life-smart folks who roll with life's punches while we roll with laughter. Tory Bauer again flies the flag boldly for the less than perfect, more than ample sexy ladies out there. She manages to do this while waiting tables at a cafe because there is no &quot;over-weight middle-aged career track&quot; in Delphi. She'd like to keep her life nice and simple but with dead bodies in the restroom and secrets being revealed left and right things get pretty complicated.Tory grows a lot in this Taylor outing. She learns some tough lessons, has a little woo-woo help solving the death of someone close to her and finds that not having sex &quot;can be every bit as complicating as getting some&quot;. Go Tory."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Kathleen Taylor has created another wonderful book! You find yourself being absorbed into the life of small town Delphi and caring about the main people in the story. Each book is like coming home to visit family. I hope she continues writing this series for a long, long time. I look forward to setting time aside to sit and read her books in one sitting since they are hard to put down once picked up. The only thing I would ask from the author is that Neil and Tori be allowed to be together. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"In Delphi, SD, nobody's perfect. Nobody (except the librarian) is wealthy. And nobody's drop-dead gorgeous, but you'll love them all. This, the 4th installment in the Tory Bauer mystery series, is a winner."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Reading MOURNING SHIFT by Kathleen Taylor took me back home to small town midwestern life. I smiled. I cried. I laughed. And when I finished, I went searching for Ms. Taylor's other books about Tory Bauer, that fascinating 40 year old, slightly overweight waitress who solves murders. Set in Delphi, SD (which must, I believe, lie somewhere between &quot;Fargo&quot; and &quot;Lake Wobegon&quot;), MOURNING SHIFT is a delightful read for anyone who enjoys people. If Janet Evanovitch is the city mouse, then Ms. Taylor is the country mouse supreme!"},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"What a great series.

This book is sure to please."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I've read all the Tory Bauer mysteries now. So enjoyable. I can't wait to finish them so I can find out who did it, then I'm sad because the story is over."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"Taylor's sleuth, Toby Bauer, is an overweight widowed waitress in a small cafe in a small town in north-east South Dakota. In this one the murder victim is her boss Aphrodite, whose long-lost husband has just turned up and promptly died.This is light entertainment and not Great Writing. You have to tolerate cliches,corny sentimentality, and holding up of action for the first person narrator to reminisce and philosophise. The humor is home-spun.In earlier ones in the series there were some terribly poorly constructed plots and clunky writing but Taylor seems to have learned on the job and this is a tightly plotted mystery that builds up suspense and keeps the pages turning.Incidentally, Lutheran Sunday schools can't have being doing a very good job if Toby Bauer thinks Moses preached the Sermon on the Mount."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"After this book, I became a Tory Bauer fan and will look for the other books in this series.

I am a conservative myself, and found nothing offensive. Certainly nothing nearly as offensive as the trashy, foul language found on almost every page of a Janet E. book. I read the reviews on amazon quite frequently but have never submitted one myself. I felt I had to defend this book."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"The book somehow managed to keep a mild suspention till the end--that means I didn't toss the book away into my recyle bin while I was reading it. This was my second book of Tory Bauer. Although the novelty setting in a small town in South Dakota was wearing thin this time around, the characters in the book were still charming in the same old South Dakota way. My complaint to the author or publisher is that although Ms. Taylor created a fairly good story-line in this book, the killer's motive was neither clear or pausible. I got an impression that the author wanted to finish the story as soon as she told who the killer was. I would expect that a mystery needs to provide a good plot--that means not just unlikely killer but also providing persuesive motive of the murder. Alas, this book failed to give the latter. I felt like the writer just tried to prolong the stroy like a chewing gum, stretching it as much as possilbe. I hope she keeps this mind next time she write her new mystery. If she fails, that means she has to write an obituary of Tory. It's a challenge, but I hope she will survive."},{"Title":"Mourning Shift: A Tory Bauer Mystery","review":"I just love when I spend my money to get insulted. Ms. Taylor's books are written from a morally-bankrupt liberal perspective from which she throws darts at her &quot;enemies&quot; by belittling and insulting their views. If you are a Christian, Republican, or Conservative, forget spending your money. If you are curious, just check out one of her soap-box novels from the library for free.I have grown increasingly tired of liberals who feel no qualms about insulting a portion of their readers. It is a shame that they are not as reluctant to take their money. I miss the days when novels were pure entertainment, a la Dorothy Sayers, instead of dogma.After ordering a Janet Evanovich novel, Amazon.com recommended Kathleen Taylor. The two authors rest on opposite ends of the entertainment spectrum. Janet Evanovich's novels are fast-paced and colorful, with rich, fun-loving characters. Ms. Taylor's novels are filled with characters no one would want to know personally, especially Tory Bauer: what a monumental bore. Tory is like staring at a white wall. While reading, one finds oneself in a state of disbelief that a couple of male characters actually long for her. One asks: Why? as one stiffles a yawn. Del, another character devoid of dignity, borders on mental instability. All characters have no behavioral boundries or sense of right and wrong. In short, they are losers.As is the case with most liberals where symbolism triumphs over substance, Tory decries, even threatens, anyone who would harm a helpless animal, yet declares herself &quot;pro-choice,&quot; meaning she has no problem with destroying helpless humans. She is a contradictory, two-dimensional, extremely unlikeable character. Tory's entire moral code encompasses gun-control, soaking the rich to support the poor (i.e., redistribution of wealth: socialism), animal rights and everything else that is currently in fashion and the liberal mantra. This makes for a weak and flimsy character, entirely superficial and without substance.As for the insults to Christians, Republicans, Conservatives. . . this Christian, Republican, Right-of-Attila-the-Hun Conservative has had it. I will no longer pay for books that hurtle insults at me or my views. No longer will convictionless, politically-correct authors pick my pockets as they disparage and belittle my convictions. Let them make their money elsewhere. I am returning this book, unfinished, to Amazon.com for a refund."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"There are some better L'amour westerns, but this is a good easy and fun read - and introduces Tell Sackett as a bit of a side character to the action.In fact this was part of the problem, this novel is short, but boy are there are lot of characters in it to take note of. Gaylord Riley is the young man at the middle of it all. He has taken up with a gang of bank robbers- but there are n'er do wells with hearts of gold and set him with the cash to start a ranch. He goes where he knows he can ranch, but where he also knows that the gang can hide out with him if they ever need his help later.Unfortunately there are things afoot in town and he falls for Marie whose father has the only white-faced cattle in town - added to that there is a man in town used to getting his own way and he wants Marie Shuttock no matter what her uncle thinks of him.The local Sheriff has a fair idea who Riley is but judges a man on his actions - as does the local newspaper man.Too many characters, too little time. There is a nice piece at the end which ties it all up nicely for the future. It is a good little read for something simple to knock off in an hour or so. Great reading for that purpose!"},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"Hey folks, here's another classic L'Amour. It's great. Keeps you wanting to turn the pages. We have a strong character here with good morals, and that's what I like to see in a Western. Why give us some sleeze ball as a hero? This is fiction, right? Dark Canyon compares very favorably with the best writing of Elmer Kelton, Kirby Jonas and Elmore Leonard!--James Drury"},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"Dark Canyon is one of Louis L'Amour's best. The story of a reformed outlaw going straight is well-written and full of action. You'll want to read it in one sitting."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"Like the majority of Louis L'Amour fans, my favorites are his old standby westerns, and this is one. This is a classic L'Amour style western with good strong characters and very little bad language, a good message and minimum violence. Anyone who likes realism but not in the extreme, this book is for you. If you like it, also read Kirby Jonas's Legend of the Tumbleweed. They call Jonas the New Louis L'Amour, and these compliment each other really well."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"Just finished reading this one for the 3rd time in a decade. I place this book along side the best Louis L'Amour wrote. That includes HONDO, SHALAKO, and among others, HIGH LONESOME.This one can be read in just a few hours, at one sitting. But that doesn't detract one iota from the excellence of this western.This 1963 western has the canyonlands of Southeastern Utah as it locale. Situated in the Robbers Roost area of the Colorado River. A very rough and isolated area reaching 3,000 feet, in some places. An area I'm sure Mr. L'Amour from experience knew only too well.I seldom like dealing with plots, because I don't want someone spoiling the beginning, middle, or ending for me. The plot is very plausible, however, for in the west many men who started against the law, eventually rode for the law, becoming good citizens. One of the interesting facts of this book which I had forgotten, is the appearance of Tell Sackett. And I recall from another L'Amour book, Emily Sackett stating the Sacketts were always to ride with the law, never against it. So, if Tell Sackett sides 'Lord' Riley, the main character, you know, as Louis would say, Riley is one to ride the river with.If you have never read much Louis L'Amour this one is an excellent one to launch your reading. If you are a seasoned reader you will still find several hours enjoyment with this classic western. It reaffirms just how much a master with the western Louis at times could be.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"This book was fun to read.

All of the Lamour books are top notch and this is no exception. Great read"},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"I have not previously been acquainted with westerns in general and Louis L'Amour in particular. While I had read one of his novels previously, I had been told that it didn't run in the same vein as most of his stories (it definitely did not fit within the typical western genre). So with some time over Thanksgiving vacation, and in much need of an easy, entertaining read, I picked up Louis L'Amour's Dark Canyon. And it served its purpose relatively well. It definitely started out with intrigue; the characters, plot, and setting were set up well. I really like how L'Amour gives some good description of the events and set up. He also places each character carefully, leading up into what you can only assume will be an interesting showdown. All of that was handled very well, but L'Amour first loses his grip when he clumsily introduces the romantic interest, and then continues to fumble the playing out of his excellent set up. While I will accept the romance as a given in his novels, I felt that he gave no credibility to the romantic relationship. And then the interesting events he had masterfully set up tended to trail off, fizzle, and wrap up in a generally dissatisfying finale. I think the romantic interest was included for the sake of storytelling, but he was never able to make it fit as he did the other formulaic characters and setting. And then the disappointing ending, perhaps, was a result of attempting to make the story more realistic. Admirable, certainly, but if you are using cliches up until that point (and using them well, I might add), there is no reason to destroy a clever and entertaining finale all in the name of \\"realism.\\" All in all, however, even with the lackluster second half of the story, I can't deny that L'Amour does have a knack for storytelling, and he definitely belongs within the area of western literature. So, if you are looking for what I was looking for, an easy, entertaining read, then Dark Canyon fits the bill. Otherwise, ride into the sunset and search for something else."},{"Title":"Dark Canyon","review":"I have not previously been acquainted with westerns in general and Louis L'Amour in particular.

If you are looking for action, there are tragedies and dramatic events but the focus is not action oriented but the insightful psychological views into the characters' pain and lonliness instead. The title is most fitting.The timbre of the book reminds me of the Old Man and the Sea (Hemingway), Crime and Punishment (Doestoevsky) and is somewhat similar to To Kill a Mockingbird (Harper Lee).The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is definitely a classic that is eternally useful as it depicts human nature, pain and dysfunction just as accurately today as in the 1940's.I also recommend a new book Torn From the Inside Out."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is very depressing. I kept reading it because I was sure it had to get better. Life is to short and the world is to full of great reads to spend time with this one.

In fact, one could get so down , one could miss the message."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The kindle version of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is full of typos and errors.

The narration seemed to hold the reader at a distance. When I put it down, there was no compulsion to get back to it, other than a stubbornness to finish. And yet, it wasn't a bad story. It certainly has some strong themes -- mostly the search for yourself -- and it is a nice period piece, though typically depressing pretty much throughout.

It keeps you wondering about just what is really going to happen. It addresses loneliness in a deep and meaningful way. One of the main characters is Mr. Singer. The book keeps you wondering about him, making him to appear to be complicated. However, when the book is finished, we understand that he was not complicated at all, it was just an allusion as to the way people saw him. He was a deaf mute who appeared to be very wise and caring, and he probably was to a degree but not to the point that others regarded him. There were people who would come to his room and pour their hearts out to him. They felt he understood and he was their confidante. It was true that since he didn't speak, there was no fear of him verbally telling anyone their thoughts. However, we learn that he really didn't comprehend what they were saying. He had a way of looking at them along with expressions that made them feel he understood, but he really didn't. At his funeral, many people truly felt a sense of loss. They really did love him and feel that he was a part of their lives. People who were all alone or who felt all alone were the ones drawn to him. They were lonely people, hurting people. It shows us how much people need people. It also shows that if a lonely person finds just one person who will listen to them and just be there for them, it makes all the difference in the world to that person. Mr. Singer never gave advise or responded except through his presence and kind expressions on his face. He was oblivious to the real problems, but he gave the appearance of hearing and understanding. It is a well-written book, and it is hard to believe that it was written by a 23 year old."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a beautiful book and captures the way in which humans create relationships in a way that few other books do at all, let alone well.

I read this as a college English assignment, and found it much more enjoyable than I expected. The course was American Gothic, and though Gothic conjures up images of dark, dank, spooky and frightening, this story is one more of stifling futility. It presents a good historical perspective on the thoughts and ideas of the 30's (the rise of Socialism). Yet, it really does have a contemporary feel to it. This is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book envelopes you with a richly woven character development driven story.

I guess I'll say that I just finished reading it for a second time and there is only one other book I've read more than once and will read again. McCullers is an amazing writer. This novel is written so beautifully. It will start slow but in a chapter or two you'll find yourself pulled into a world that you can't leave. I recently gave this book to a cousin of mine as a gift and she had a similar reaction. I actually had to read this for an english class at my school and might never have picked it up otherwise. The characters' lives cross in such interesting ways and all of them deal with Singer, who is still a mystery I am trying to figure out. This book will pull you on an emotion rollercoaster and then leave you thinking about it for years after it ends, like a good movie does. I rarely cry in movies and almost never over a book but this one brought me to tears more than a few times. Just read it and maybe you'll understand."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The book, \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a dark, yet very intelligent book about outcasts in the deep south during the 30s. The book has three parts that each focus on a part of the five main character's lives.Part one introduces Singer, the very main character of the novel. Singer is a deaf mute who is depressed when his very best friend, Antonapoulous is sent to the nut house. Biff is a local restaurant owner of the New York Caf&eacute;. Biff has to deal with his wife, Alice and their unhappy marriage. Mick Kelly is a big tomboy in this part of the novel, who has a passion for music. She has to deal with raising her two younger siblings. Blount is a loud man who is faced with a drinking problem. Dr. Copeland is a black doctor and struggles with a communicating with his children.Part Two starts the plot of the book. After each character is set up with his own disappointments and problems, Singer becomes the main character of the novel who listens to each of the other main characters and individually helps them with their own problems. Singer is still struggling with the loss of his friend and occasionally visits him in the hospital. During this part in the novel, Mick starts growing up, developing herself as a woman instead of a tomboy, and uses sex to get rid of her problems. Biff's wife dies, and he has to deal with all the good memories he now remembers of her after it's too late. Blount continues his drinking, but can't relate very well to Singer because he keeps accusing Singer of lying about being a deaf mute. Dr. Copeland regains strength with his family and daughter, Portia, but later on finds out he is dying himself.At the end of the novel, a tragedy occurs, leaving the main characters to fend for themselves, remember the past, and move on with their lives.I would recommend this novel to anyone.

I can understand how other high school students may have found this novel boring. However, it is not necessarily meant to be read by the average high school student. It is meant to be enjoyed by those who read in search of a deeper understanding.

I'm a bit slower than most I suppose since I've just now gotten around to reading it. I think I'm better off though since I doubt I would have appreciated it as much if I were younger and less, dare I say, worldly. I won't rehash the plot since there are dozens of reviews that have done that already. I will say that this is a book that needs to be read. I recommend gathering around other Southern writers and read it as a stew with Harper Lee, Flannery O'Conner and Erskine Caldwell. McCullers has subtly developed characters and lulls you into a fog of desperation. I agree with Ms. Powell who said &quot;read it as an adult.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"One would expect a woman of 23 years not to have had enough experience to already know the pains and joys of life so well. Carson Mccullers allows you to feel her characters joy, bordem, anger and sorrow so deeply, that you almost forget they are not real people. The meat of this story is not the plot, but the storm of human emotions pouring out of her characters. We as readers identify with the knowledge that life is hard, and hope and laughter are what help us to continue living."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book in 1967.

I could relate to the area, but after finally reading the book recently I have really come to appreciate it more for the outstanding book that it is."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Here's my own take. Every great book speaks to everybody. What makes \\"The Heart.. so very special, so very complex,is just that. These characters are us. We are these characters. Every one of them. Read the book and consider, that every single character symbolically died in this classic novel. This is a deeply profound book. Nobody gets through life without some kind of struggle. A nobel physicist told Naomi Judd to not go around the pain, but go through it. I am neither deaf nor mute, and yet I am exactly like John Singer. You are exactly like John Singer. We are Mick with a crisis. But life unfolds the most beautiful and brilliant multi-faceted spectrum. When we face those \\"death\\" struggles every day that seem like a tragedy in the moment, by passing through them, something of life issues forth. Courage issues in new found strength. For example, many a marine has strengths they never knew existed. Sacrifice issues in something else. At first, it seems that John Singer was almost angelic-like in his sharing and giving to everybody else, as the face of God guiding everybody else through their crises, but failed to resolve his own conflicts. On closer inspection, I realized that he may have represented a Godly Christ-like figure, who through the symbolic act of sacrifice, of even facing ultimate rejection and betrayal as part of the death experience, the sacrificial lamb brings life to others, brings the most unlikely of people together as with father and daughter, breaks down barriers as in the symbolic hand-shake at his own burial site, and brings in eternal hope and love as when she makes the promise. This wasn't a tragedy per se. This was a festive celebration of new-found life, as the biblical seed that grows into a monumental tree. Whatever, you're interpretation of any great book, let go your creative juices, run with it, listen to the music speak to you, read this beautiful classic novel as it were your own spectral jewel, or Mozart on phonograph. I will never forget this novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I loved this book for its brutality, though that wasn't the only criterion. The prose is stylistically beautiful, and McCullers makes good use of shifting tones and dialects: Though the book is seen in third person, the passages spotlighting each character assume the diction of that character. The characters are believable and well-crafted, and there are ideas harbingerial of future crises. Jake Blount's Communist sympathies are vocal only a decade short of the \\"Red Scare\\" and McCarthy's obscene witchhunts; and in Doctor Copeland's war on racial oppression are hints of the militance and demonstrations of the Civil Rights movement only two decades past. It's not a matter of prescience, but a matter of a writer making good use of contemporary events.The brutality I alluded to is not entirely violent, nor sexual as the blurb suggests. The dust jacket referred to this as an \\"Innocence Lost\\" parable, with the minor event of Mick Kelly's unmaidening apparently labeled the pivotal event. The climax is in fact the death of John Singer, the genial deaf-mute. Singer becomes an advocate and friend to a menagerie of damaged and impotent small-towners. Singer is the more successful of two confidants, the other also-ran being Bif Brannon, the proprietor of the New York Cafe. Brannon sticks up for the \\"freaks\\" and rejects who wash up on the streets of the town, part of which commiseration may be accounted for by the fact that he is himself an oddball, a romantic who collects old newspapers and dreams of having children even as his wife suffers with cancer. Or his sympathy could stem from aa simple sense of ennui. Though this is less likely, there is given evidence for both contentions.Of the two, Singer is the more inviting, while Brannon is the more stable. Naturally Brannon is a bit suspicious of Singer's always open arms.But Singer's attachment to his friend Spiros Antanapolous is the prevailing relationship. It is clear that Singer sees in both his new friends and in Spiros not only lonesome bedfellows, but a collection of people to coddle and sympathize with. Singer exorcises demons and allieves his own dejection with kindliness. When Spiro's kills himself, Singer realizes that all the relationships he's built can be just as easily broken as was Spiros. His suicide is not entirely due to his sadness at losing his friend, but at the sadness he predicts at the unavoidable loss of his new friends. As the novel is building to its crescendo, the characters are seen crumbling under the heft of strict and unfriendly southern ethics and society. The dream Singer has is support of this: Spiros naked at the top of the stairs represents Singer's ideal mate, a frail and vulnerable person put there for him to take care of. Singer is naked to his new friends, and they are naked to the captious town and family who fail to understand either their own unhappiness or that of those four. When Singer meets the mutes in the pool hall and can't relate to them, clams up and becomes uncommunicative, it is because he has exhausted all his understanding and intellect and energy on other people's behalf.The unflinching portrayal of human hurt is worthy of twice as much paper and ink, especially with McCuller's handling."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I picked this book up knowing next to nothing of Carson McCullers but having a soft spot for stories set in the south in the early 1900s. Although interesting and well written, I found the first few chapters were not particularly leading me anywhere, as I expect most stories to do. My mistake. After Mr. Singer was fully introduced, I found it increasingly difficult not to read on in quest of what all of these typical yet unusual town folk had in common. Once I let go of looking for the typical &quot;plot&quot; and listened to what the charecters were saying and suffering and where they were coming from, the story was very absorbing. The sadness, desparation and yearning of Mick, Mr. Singer, Biff and Dr. Copeland, each in their own way, is compelling. I find it truely amazing that a young woman of 23 could write and create these charecters so insightfully. Sometimes when you read a book, it may not stay in your mind as much then as it does later on, when you think back and ponder the charecters and events. This is one of those books. It will have a permanent residence in my bookcase, and I look forward to reading other books by this author."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It took me a long time to read this. It wasn't a book where one thing leads to the next in a single plot that you follow from page to page. The plot is more like a spiral that circles through five main characters in various states of poverty in a small Southern town. The owner of an all night diner, slave to nickles and daily routine. The black doctor, powerless to inspire his neighbors to follow his ideas about birth control or politics. The teenage girl whose family runs a boarding house, dirt poor, ignorant, and an unnoticed musical prodigy. The deaf/mute jeweler who has no one to speak sign language with. The labor agitator, frustrated to violence by the circumstances of those he sees around him. The book goes around and around through the lives of these, people, following them for one year. For all of them, in this year, bad goes to worse. There is uniform decay, devastation, disappointment... it is a bleak bleak landscape that only gets more grim as the book goes on.It's written brilliantly. There are lines in the description of the people specifically, of the milieu in general, of the zeitgeist, that are just exquisite perfection. Descriptions I will remember and take away with me, into other books, into my understanding of the South during the depression. Her handling of the point of view shifts, around the town, and how the different characters' worldviews are reflected in the quality and nature of the narrative... it's nothing short of genius. I can't even think of a crack to make about this book, because it was so completely shatteringly good.Nothing I ever want to read again. I could get the same sensation of hopelessness, ignorance, waste, and want by... wait... WHY would I want to relive that sensation? Why don't I just go put my head against the sidewalk and flatten it with a sledge hammer?It's a book that I should have read, and I'm glad I did, and I'm glad it was written, but now I want to eat strawberry ice cream, and read P.G. Wodehouse, and kiss my kids."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"...it was all part and parcel of the American South, on the eve of the Second World War, along with polio, typhoid, pellagra, poverty and legal racial segregation.Carson McCullers captured this period brilliantly, in one of the masterpieces of American literature. There are a number of very strongly drawn, complex characters. Two are Biff (Bartholomew) Brannon, and his wife, Alice, who own the caf&eacute; which also serves as the community center and place of refuge. Alice, in a fit of anger, accuses her husband of being partial to the \\"freaks\\" of life. Later, Biff acknowledges the truth of the charge, at least to himself, as he gives discounts in the diner to the \\"misfits.\\" All of McCullers' characters are \\"misfits,\\" either unable or unwilling to adapt to the norms of society. There is Jake Blout, an itinerant, alcoholic labor organizer, from Gaston S.C., who will not leave the South, for more favorable political climes. One scene has him shouting from his window at the unhearing, uncomprehending \\"masses.\\" Lucile, Alice's sister, has a child she calls \\"Baby\\", and \\"dolls her up,\\" at the age of four, for a career that the mother missed. Dr. Copeland is the Black medical doctor for \\"his people.\\" He reads Spinoza in the evenings, and even has named one of his children \\"Karl Marx.\\" He too has his shouting moments, frustrated with \\"his people's\\" dependence on alcohol and promiscuity instead of changing, and casting off their dependence. Mick Kelly is a coming-of-age young girl/woman, 13 (and four months!), in a large poor Irish family that runs a boarding house. They are always living at the edge of financial catastrophe, from which she is seeking escape through music. John Singer is a Jewish deaf-mute who has come to live in the boarding house. He is devoted to another deaf-mute, his only friend, a fat Greek named Spirios Antonapoulos. All the other characters seek out Singer, a convenient \\"blank slate\\" upon whom they can project their problems and loneliness.McCullers never explicitly states the date. The first hint is \\"the war in the Orient,\\" and moves on to conclude with Hitler making a \\"fuss\\" about Danzig. It is the South, at the end of The Great Depression, with the dirt, diseased streets of poor blacks and whites near the mills. The workers were \\"lintheads,\\" and a radio or a bicycle was purchased on the installment plan. One would stoop to pick up a penny. It was also an era when the mentally insane did not wander the streets, but were placed in asylums.Numerous eternal themes, both \\"political,\\" and of the human condition are well depicted. Dr. Copeland gives one speech to the unhearing that is directly derived from Marx's labor theory of value. There is more than the edge of sadness in Mick Kelly's father who cannot economically provide for his family, and therefore feels useless, and is often treated that way. There is a \\"first love\\" scene between Mick, and, Harry, which includes some skinny dipping at the local water hole. One of my favorite images is of Mick, searching the neighborhood, in order to find a radio that plays classical music in the evening; she sits under the shrubs, and listens to Beethoven's 3rd Symphony. Economic constraints are omnipresent. There is Dr. Copeland's utter disappointment in his children and the fact that none of them decided to help him \\"carry the torch.\\" Part of the strength of the novel is McCullers' prescience: she depicted anti-Semitism before the crushing reality of the concentration camps; she also depicted the wrangling, and internecine fights of those who wanted to change the existing system, in part by describing a bitter argument between Copeland and Jake Blout. Copeland argued for a \\"march on Washington\\" 23 years before it actually happened.McCullers' own life was ill-stared, with an unhappy marriage, multiple health problems, and alcoholism. Graham Greene is often quoted as preferring McCullers to Faulkner, since \\"she writes more clearly,\\" and I might add, just a bit more insightfully, and even honestly. \\"Change\\" was more readily on her \\"plate\\" than Faulkner's, who was more content to brilliantly depict the \\"as is.\\"Can one woman make a difference? Yes, McCullers did, but also Oprah Winfrey, who has done much to elevate the reading habits of so many. Currently this book has 372 other reviews. If Ms. Winfrey had not highlighted it, only 10 people or so may have heard the proverbial tree falling in the forest, and reviewed it. I first read this book 30 years ago; on the re-read, it remains 6-stars, an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am astounded that at the age of twenty-three McCullers could provide such an honest and complex portrayal of the human soul. Particularly impressive is the realness of her African American characters. Never before have I seen a white author depict blacks in such an honest and unbiased way. McCullers never doesn't pass judgment on any of her characters; rather, she depicts them as they truly are. We meet people who are at once both strong and weak, beautiful and ugly, kind and cruel. So McCullers has that going for her.Her choice of words and the flow of her sentences together exude neither beauty or extraordinary power; even so, they do their job and warrant no complaints. Few words are wasted. Her style readable and sort-of plain, though it still manages to maintain a certain subtle distinctness of its own. Once in a while it seems there might be present in a certain passage a lovely poem-like rhythm. Here let's say she's not bad but there are many her better.Unlike many reviewers, the book sucked me right in from the beginning. The characters were interesting and realistic. I was anxious to read on so that I might find out more about them and to see what was going to happen to them. As I read through the first seven chapters of Part 2 I was blown away by the way the author drew the characters together through their irrational behaviors and their unobtainable ideals. And yes, how fascinating that they each connect to Singer. How they see in him the perfect image of their dream. And that in fact the Deaf-Mute does not at all understand these people, their quests, or dreams.So... alright!...Part 2, Chapter 8...yeah!...I'm ready! Dude I can't wait to see what's going to happen! Oh man, my mind is about to get blown...this is gonna be awesome!...this is gonna be nuts!Dude...the next eight chapters were a huge dissapointment. Characters that once excited and intrigued me suddenly turn stale; they become dull, pathetic and unimportant. Under these conditions, I cease to care about these people.And...nothing happens. Our heroes resign themselves to an ordinary existence. Tragic. Their dreams are not likely ever to be obtained. Just gonna keep on keep'n on. A dreary, boring way to spend the final 200 pages. It didn't ruin the book for me; I just would have preferred some sort of scandal, crime, intrigue, crisis. Hell, anything but nothing.By the way, I recommended this edition of the book--The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Modern Library)--essentially because its hardcover and the same price. It's the exact same book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"\\"Seek and ye shall find,\\" Jesus is quoted as saying in the Bible. All of us, no matter what our religious affiliation--or lack thereof--are seeking out a dream, a little piece of happiness. Sometimes this process is conscious and sometimes a subconscious imperative drives us forward towards that piece of happiness.The five main characters of \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\" are all seeking their dreams in an unnamed mill town in the South in the late 1930s. For teenaged Mick Kelly, the dream is a career in classical music that her impoverished family can't afford to provide. For the relentless black Doctor Copeland, the dream is freedom and equality for his people. For restaurateur Biff Brannon the dream is having children. For vertically-challenged drifter Jake Blount the dream is a Marxist revolution to level the playing field for all people. And last, but most important, the dream for deaf-mute John Singer is to be reunited with his long time partner Anatopolous, who was committed to an institution.Singer becomes the prime focus for the other four. One by one they inadvertently seek him out and spill their wishes and desires to him, although he often doesn't understand them. To Mick he is a secret friend who understands her. To Copeland he is a wise man who understands the struggles of the black minority. To Blount he is a comrade in arms for the revolution. And to Biff he is a kindred spirit, a fellow observer of humanity.Yet for as much as he represents to them, they mean relatively little to Singer. His thoughts are consumed by his love--platonic, we assume--for Anatopolous, the one he thinks understands him. But much as Singer is a false idol to the other four, Anatopolous is a false idol for him, a lazy, selfish, slovenly person incapable of appreciating Singer's love. In the end these troubled souls are left to pick up the pieces after the false idols shatter, as they inevitably do. This leads each of them to make a decision and to enter a new phase of life.What makes this book so wonderful to read is the profound understanding of humanity shown here. All of us at one time or another have felt the pent-up ambition Mick feels at wanting something that remains just out of reach. We've felt the righteous anger to right a terrible injustice like Doctor Copeland. We've felt the isolation of being the outsider like Blount. We've all felt the confusion after a loss like Biff. And those of us fortunate enough--or perhaps unfortunate enough--have felt the heartache of an unrequited love like Singer.These people all seem real because their hopes and desires are those hopes and desires we all have. Their dreams aren't altogether different than those each of us seek, whether we're aware of it or not. We know their longing and desperation to find someone who understands them, even if that someone is a deaf-mute who can only nod along.Because of that, the book touches something deep in our consciousness, something primal within all of us--the need to seek out for something greater. The most astounding thing about \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\" is that the author was only twenty-three years old when she published this. At a time when most of us are just getting out into the \\"real world\\" and discovering ourselves, McCullers already had it figured out.This is truly a literary achievement that you should seek out at your local bookseller or library at once, those who haven't already done so based on Oprah's recommendation.That is all."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I picked \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" up before Oprah Winfrey mentioned the book and put it in her club. Interestingly enough, the book was referenced to me by someone who is quite different from Oprah: The late controversial poet and novelist Charles Bukowski, \\"The laureate of the low lifes,\\" as Time referred to him disgustedly. For the last five years I have been utterly obsessed with this man and his writings. It was Bukowski who had turned me on to other fantastic writers like John Fante, Celine, Ezra Pound, and Sherwood Anderson. He also name drops Carson McCullers in many of his poems and in some of his published interviews (As a big fan of Henry Miller, I found out that McCullers was also a favorite of this author of \\"Tropic of Cancer\\" and the Sexus/Plexus/Nexus trilogy). So I picked up as many of her books as I could find, and I started off by reading \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.\\"And what a fantastic book it is.I could identify with so many of the characters in this book (published in 1940) that I was like, \\"where has this book been my whole life?\\" Unbelievable! Yes, it is sad in some few parts but it is never \\"sappy\\" sad. For me, the saddest part was when Bubber accidently shoots another small child - and whereas before this incident Bubber was a chipper, talkative boy who liked dressing up in costumes (although he was often made fun of for it) and singing, he breaks down after the accident and becomes totally withdrawn, and stops playing with other kids.It is remarkable to think that Carson McCullers had the keen political and social insight to write this book at the age of 23. This book was years ahead of its time in its social and political commentaries. Besides the aforementioned gun accident (which subtly painted an ugly picture of a culture obsessed with guns), this book addresses class struggle, racism, bigotry, political apathy, materialism, drug abuse, the inequalities of the criminal justice system, and other important issues.Most of this book found me smiling and nodding my head up and down. This is so true in reading about Blount and Dr. Copeland. Blount is a white, blue collar worker who is frustrated with the capitalist system in America, but he is laughed at by other poor whites and greeted with apathetic indifference when he suggests that they should band together and strike for better conditions. Copeland is a black doctor who also tries to get black people in this depression-era town to strike, but he is greeted with the same responses as Blount. In fact, the poor whites and the poor blacks in this town would rather remain separate from one another drowning to the bottom of their liquor bottles than to try to make their lives better.Political apathy? My, how little has changed from 1940 to 2005.When I first read this book I had to force myself to put it down, and every year I find myself re-reading the entire book or parts of it.All I can say is that this is a fantastic novel, one of my top five books of all time. I don't know how or why this book could merit less than five stars. Read it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Light reading, whimsical - no! Realistic, introspective, entertaining, a wonderful enlightment into the soul - yes! Don't pick up the book if you don't want to think. Otherwise, experience, enjoy and appreciate the brilliance of the characters, the story and the author."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Published during the second World War, this novel takes an in-depth look into the lives of unique characters who throughout American history have come to epitomize the label of \\"different\\", \\"outcast\\", \\"weird\\", \\"freak\\" or \\"misfit\\". There is a character in the book that everyone can identify with and come to understand their world from a more insightful perspective. McCullers makes a brilliant showcase of life not as it should be or how we hope it will some day become, but as it is, without artifice or evasion. She allows us to look at ourselves without pity or self-loathing and without rationalization or retribution. We can see ourselves simply as human. If the definition of a literary classic is a title that stands the test of time, this novel certainly deserves that distinction."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is one book where the reader cannot but help to become emotionally involved in the lives of the characters that, at the time of its writing, the twenty-three year old Carson McCullers detailed with such enigmatic and poignant care. It is a very emotionally draining expeience as Carson takes the reader on a journey of the depths of the human soul. She examines social prejudices through the eyes of a mute deaf named Singer, a young dreamer named Mick Kelly, a loud mouth drunken Marxist named Jake Blount, a tavern operator with a sullen heart named Biff Brannon, and a African-American Doctor known as Dr. Copeland who is both an activist and learned man. This is an extremely active story with subplots that interweave with poetic grace and styling. the setting is a small southern town in the post-depression era. The young McCullers wrote this without overexaming the social problems of the time. She lays the groundwork and lets the reader form his or her own opinions about the social situations affecting each of the main characters. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a fascinating novel, depicting the hardships of life of a small southern town without purging itself on social stylings and prose. A must read for fans of classic American prose."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is a lonely Hunter is a very different sort of book. I've read quite a few books, and never one quite like it. One person I know compared it to the Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath because of the dark story line. The story is based upon the lives of 5 main characters, the majority of the story telling spent on the mute John Singer and the teenager Mick Kelly. Themes of alienation, isolation, intolerance, loneliness, and the fulfillment of dreams dominate the novel. The opposite of a superficial book, this story is about how people feel at their core and their dreams and aspirations. The writing is good, but just not very happy. The focus is more on how lonely each character feels and for what reasons. After reading it, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter forced me to think deeply. And I believe the title sums up what Carson McCullers was trying to say in her first novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I thought this book was truly distressing, yet eye-opening as well. It showed how difficult the lives of outcasts can be. All characters that struggled in this book were outcasts in their own right. All of this rejection makes me realize just how fortunate I am to live with all the advantages of being a physically-abled, white male. To not have to struggle with the basic means of communication like the people in the novel did has never been granted as such a relief than when I finished reading this book. I never have felt so guilty about feeling lonely because I learned in this book what true loneliness is: rejection by the people you are trying to help. I was also shown what true depression is: the death of a dream due to circumstances that you cannot control. Carson McCullers showed the hardships of life by the underpriveliged in a way that cannot be ignored. Though the book lacked action, it made up for it in emotion. However, at times I felt the book stalled where action could have been used. Yes, I am a college student and though at times I did find it boring, I think Carson McCullers truly wrote a compelling novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I first read \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" in the ninth grade, and revisited it recently after it appeared on \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" list. I even prevailed upon my own book club to read it, to mixed reviews.I find this book is one you think about long after you've finished reading it. No, it is not by any means a plot-driven book, although I take exception to those who say there is no plot. There is one -- each character has a conflict, and in his/her own way, resolves the conflict. The tragedy of the misfit in a callous society is mirrored in each of the characters' lives. Each is searching for a connection, and the times they live in and the town they live in prevent most of them from making that connection. I don't think this is as unusual as some readers seem to think. There are many people in our society today who don't fit in, and their loneliness is profound and isolating.Read the book for it's exquisite prose -- prose that is still very understandable, by the way -- for it's extraordinary character development, and for those who study the craft of writing, McCuller's ability to weave 5 characters' points of view effectively in one novel is breathtaking.But, as I said, if you've never been lonely, and you aren't introspective in the least, don't bother reading it. You won't get anything out of it and you'll head over to the next potboiler bestseller in a hurry."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It's a stunning book that I really thank Oprah for reminding us to revisit. Such books only come along every once in a great while. Carson McCullers captures a beauty in sadness that leaches your soul and won't let go, but at the same time injects in you a spiritual growth. Few authors can capture that. \\"East of Eden\\" was a similar book now considered a classic. But what of today's authors? \\"Middlesex\\"? \\"Lovely Bones?\\" Both good but not quite on that same level. \\"My Fractured Life\\" is probably the closest argument, and even that you have to question because it is so contemporary. Truly \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a book to be read - definitely for first timers and equally recommended for those revisiting. I don't deter you from reading today's authors. \\"My Fractured Life\\", \\"Secret Life of Bees\\", \\"Father Joe\\", \\"Middlesex\\"...there are so many wonderful writers today.

Each main character is given focus for a chapter while the other characters fade into the background, then the next chapter will focus on another character in which the focal character of the previous chapter becomes a background character, etc. Sherwood Anderson used a similar style of &quot;sketch&quot; writing in his &quot;Winesburg, Ohio,&quot; and the two novels share a theme of psychological and social isolation, but McCullers's novel is sharper, more vivid, detailed, and immediate, and evokes a keener sense of empathy in its characters.There is a popular cafe in town owned by a solicitous middle-aged man named Biff Brannon. The cafe is frequented by a deaf-mute man named John Singer whose unsettling presence piques everyone's curiosity. Singer befriends two ideologically aligned men, an alcoholic drifter named Jake Blount and a black doctor named Benedict Copeland. Blount and Copeland both happen to be radical Marxists; Blount denounces capitalism and the exploitation of workers, while Copeland exhorts his people to become self-sufficient and dignified. When Blount and Copeland finally meet and speak face to face, they agree on the problem but cannot agree on the solution.And then there's the young teenage girl Mick Kelly, a tomboy who has little interest in acting ladylike and emulating her older sisters, and whose family runs a boarding house in which Singer rents a room. She is at the age when her life is in several states of transition -- physical maturation, artistic revelation (via Beethoven's Third Symphony, no less), sexual awakening, and the initial responsibilities of adulthood. It is remarkable how her character is so innocent yet at the same time so complex and worldly -- like a female Tom Sawyer, she blazes her own trail through society and is ready for anything.These people hover around Singer like satellites and use him as a sounding board for their problems while he listens attentively and offers symphathy. Why they are drawn to Singer is no mystery -- it is said that a good conversationalist is one who listens well rather than talks. Singer has his own problem -- loneliness for the absence of his institutionalized friend, another deaf-mute, the only kind of person who can relate to him.The novel illustrates that underneath the idyllic calm of traditional Southern gentility bubbles a cauldron of racial tension and imminent violence, symbolically fueled by the heat and humidity and swampy gloom. Towards the end of the novel there is an incident involving a riot at the fair where Blount works; in the way the local newspaper covers the story, McCullers offers a subtle ironic statement about how the country (the South in particular) is concerned more with the threat of Communism than with racial discord. And she was only 23 when she wrote this? Amazing."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a novel that will stay with you forever. Carson McCullers (only 23 when she wrote this!) writes profoundly with usage of every human sense. I agree that it is a masterpiece.The story takes place in Georgia during the Depression. There is thick racial tension but music is solace and passion is ablaze. The world is a delicate place but the characters are cetainly not caucious within it. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is a perfect representation of the spiritual isolation that is the shadow of mankind. McCuller's 'gives voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated...' and 'gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal search for beauty.' Everyone becomes someone through this story. It is beautiful, timeless, influential. One grows stronger by reading it and it can be enjoyed by people from all walks of life. A modern day comparison might be Geraldi's 'Lucky Monkeys In The Sky' because the isolation and search for beauty are very dominant in both novels."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book came to me in a odd way. It was mentioned in the movie \\"A love song for Bobby Long\\". Never thought it was a real book. But googling for the title (just out of curiosity) I found it. Got very curious after having read a couple of reviews and bought it. It cost me a sleepless night. I couldn't put it down and read it in one breath. It has such an impact that it leaves one breathless. What an astounding story it is. It boggles my mind how such a young woman in 1940 (she was 23 at the time the book was published) could come up with such a novel.My question is also: what has changed in the meantime, as to the social circumstances of the poor? Nothing whatsoever. It's frustrating that I cannot come up with anything original to add in this review, as far too many 5 star reviewers have already done that. It comes down to a repitition of words like:astounding, remarkable, extraordinary, impressive, beautiful and bittersweet: ALL TRUE.People who are looking for a plot, are looking for easy reading and have a totally dream-like idea of how life can be.Wake up people and experience truth. Take up the book again after a couple of years, and see if it will make sense by then.If you read this book, you will be totally shaken by this story of beauty and darkness.Carson Mccullers is a genius to have written this story at such a young age."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a while. It is very sad; you can't decide which character is the worst off. Mick, the gangly tomboy who is tryign to find some beauty in a harsh world, while also trying to deal with the problems of her family and the trials of growing up. Dr. Copeland, the educated black doctor, bitter against the injustices shown his people. Biff Brannon, the hardened restaurant owner, who shows signs of being a homosexual in a time when being a homosexual was not acceptable. Jake Blount, the radical drifter, who talks and talks but no one listens. And Mr. Singer, the deaf mute with a longing for his best friend, the only person who understands him. All of these characters are fully drawn, and each one of them makes you care deeply for him/her, even though they are very hard to like. You read on, wanting to know what happens to these people, and whether anyone finds happiness at all. While the ending is not all that happy, the point is made. Everyone is searching for something, whether it be beauty, like Mick, or understanding, like Mr. Singer. And as the title says, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. My only regret is that I waited so long to read this book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"...and that's saying a lot, cuz she's written tons of good stuff. This novel, her first, was published in 1940. It explores the premise that, when push comes to shove, each of us is truly alone, isolated in our own world of loneliness.The novel focuses on the effect of deaf-mute John Singer on those around him in the Georgia mill town where the story takes place. His loneliness is compounded with his equally mute companion goes insane and he realizes he truly has no one left with whom he can communicate.A tragedy, beautifully and compassionately written in the Southern gothic tradition."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This wistful tale of alienation, oppression, and self-inflicted persecution, is a marvelous read. McCullers (only in her early-20s when she wrote this) poetically weaves the sights, sounds, and even the smells of the era to recreate the zeitgeist of the Jim Crow South. Kudos to Ms. Winfrey for reminding us about this wonderful story.For a modern-day twist on these familiar themes, there's another young writer you should check out: Greg Ippolito. His debut novel, &quot;Zero Station,&quot; is absolutely terrific, and an excerpt is available for FREE. He's still a relative unknown (a friend turned me onto his work)...but this is a must-read. You can check him out and read the excerpt at: www.ZERO-STATION.net. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I have just read this novel for our book group and found it one of the most achingly sad and beautiful books I have been privileged to read. McCullers youth when she wrote this novel makes her insights all the more extraordinary. That she was writing well before the civil rights movement impacted on the consciousness of Anglo Americans makes the Heart is a Lonely Hunter an amazing achievement. One hopes it also made and continues to make a contribution to challenging racism, attitudes to people with disabilities and the existence of grim poverty in the daily lives of people living in so called civilised societies.I grew to understand all of her characters and her development of both the characters and her narrative was strong, kind and honest. Her central character, Singer, and his love for his friend, was depicted with great tenderness. The gritty sadness and strength of the other characters left me feeling touched by their lives as if they were my neighbors.It is on the reading list for some final year high school students one state in my country - a moving and engaging read from page one."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is depressing and sad - yet the characters are rich and finely drawn.

It is such a simple story in some ways, but so beautiful and wise. It illustrates so many truths about human nature, the ways we look for companionship and validation from others. It is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It's been a while since I read a book that I wanted to slow down the pace and savor each word. Carson McCullers' \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" has definitely achieved it for me. Her art form is well organized with three parts and a total of fifteen short chapters. Each chapter she dives into one character's heart and soul beautifully, Singer, Biff, Mick, Dr. Copeland and Jake transcend in front of my eyes. The storyline flows from one character to the next like refreshing soft crisp spring shower. I am amazed for an age of 23; Carson was able to develop in depth of a small early 1960's southern mill town's social issues with truth and intellectual poise. Her language fills with imagery. I love the humor of this sentence when she describes a small boy when he walks into town. \\"A little youngun passing along the street stopped and opened his fly to make water.\\"I become so close to each of the characters that I wished so hard that something good would happen to at least one of them. I was heart broken at the same time rooted for their life decisions based on ignorance and pure innocence. Carson's story is suitable for all ages to read. We can all take away her message of based on poverty and limited education - how should we look forward to the next day?Check out my other book reviews[..]"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Based on the good reviews and the subject matter I was expecting this to be a great read but in the end I can only give this book a lukewarm review. The age of the author is apparent to me when I read this book. The characters are not well rounded and the dialouge is lacking. The story takes awhile to move along and none of the characters ever seem to truely develop. I did like several of the characters and the writing style was nice enough. 3/5"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a beautifully written novel about dreams and being alone. Ordinary, flawed yet likeable people seek to transcend the poor, rough life that they live and to make their dreams reality. They are drawn to a deaf-mute, John Singer, who somehow everyone sees as being the only one who understands them. He himself is more isolated than any of them, because he is deaf and has no way to talk to anyone.\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" weaves a spellbinding tragedy, woven from the lives of several people. It was a page-turner, despite not having a fast-moving plot, because of the emotional power of the tale.I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because of the ending. It was a wonderful book, but the ending is so depressing, without a glimmer of hope for any character. Still, a moving story that will have a profound impact on the reader."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm so excited to see this book in Oprah's Book Club because its always been one of my favorites. Now so many others will get to experience the lives of these rich and earthy characters and oh and ah at the way McCullers puts ordinary words together that roll off the pages in a very extraordinary way to make this an unforgettable story.

You can find all the descriptions of the story line elsewhere. I'll simply leave it that you should absolutely include this book on ANY reading list."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Four lonely characters center their lives around a deaf mute, Mr. Singer, who functions amidst them like a tabula rasa onto which they project whatever they need. None of these other characters has an ability to connect in a deep and meaningful way with their peers. In seeking Singer out, they project their needs onto him, and assume he understands them in ways no one else does, while he remains virtually unknown. Meanwhile, he is deeply connected to another deaf mute, who was committed to an asylum. Singer's devotion to his friend, who in many ways is as obnoxious an individual as Ignatious T. Reilly (Confederacy of Dunces)is completely baffling.There is a horrid sense of life passing by these characters and of them being cheated by life.It was too fatalistic and depressing for my taste, without nearly as much craft as Richard Yates (Revolutionary Road)."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This story is set in the 1930's .The main character is John Singer a deaf - mute and the people around him for which he is a sounding board even though he cannot hear them.This book to me was depressing it does not have a happy ending or for that matter a happy beginning or middle. There is no action it is a character study. I understand that Miss. McCullers published this book when she was just 23 years old and for that reason I do see somewhat what all the hype is on this book because it is well written hence the 3 stars. But for me I did not enjoy this book, it depressed me and confused me. I felt the climax *no spoilers* was extremely anti-climatic. So much in this book was not explained and left me wondering and not in a good way about the reasons people did things. Over all a well written book but not one I would recommend or read again."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel is compelling, but it is not great--an achievement in its own right perhaps.Readers of southern fiction will find familiar themes here: grim isolation, grinding poverty, quirky and freakish misfits, shocking violence, racism, small town provincialism, and gothic, lush beauty within the dirt, grime, and ugliness of the Jim Crow South.It is a novel that has moments of greatness--Mick's loss of innocence is particularly memorable--and the reader can really feel the anguish and futility in the lives of the main characters that few stories can match. In the end, however, the novel is little more than a story of anguish and futility, which left this reader cold.Indeed, the novel is cold (that's not necessarily a bad thing given all the sentimental rubbish out there) but its message is especially frosty and decidedly unsentimental: love, happiness, and rich, deep, and abiding human relationships are an impossibility, and when such feelings and thoughts occur, it is fleeting and illusionary. Humans, it seems, will ultimately fail at anything and everything they attempt.Like Mick, Singer, Jake, Dr. Copeland, Portia, Willie, Biff, and everyone else in this novel... the best we can hope for is to just survive this life with our dignity intact.This book deserves to be read, but only once. Its grim, existential tale doesn't need telling twice."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a great story for people of all ages. As a teenager, I felt at one with the antagonist of the story. As an adult I see her transition more clearly than before. It is also a reminder of the power of the emotions of adolescence and those first real learning experiences, something I hope I will never forget."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is one of my favorites!This is the first McCullers' book that I have read and it has become one of my favourites. It felt like a timeless story that could have been written only yesterday instead of in the 1930's. It also could have been written by a much older, experienced person instead of a young girl of 23 years. It is a gentle, sad story that might have been typical of small town life. It was very refreshing to feel submerged in the slow pace and emotion of life in a long gone era. The story touched me in an unexpected way, and I know I will long remember the characters and their individual stories.The story is about a deaf mute named John Singer, who after his best friend(also a deaf mute) Antonapoulos is sent to an asylum becomes lonely, four other characters also become lonely due to some result of isolation; Dr. Copeland is seperated by his family and his race because of his high education and viewpoint; Jake Blount is angry because the radical social viewpoints he has, won't be understood by anyone else in the town; Mick Kelly cannot communicate with her family because of they do not share her interests and ambitions; Biff Brannon becomes alone when his wife dies and ponders and struggles to resolve inner conflicts in life. The book isn't too long and the pace isn't too slow. The dialogue, pace, and tone is astonishing. It is a great book that I highly reccomend Another title that I suggest reading isOne Hundred Years of Solitude."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is an extraordinary work in the way it is the only novel written that truly catches the deaf experience and feelings. That Carson McCullers was herself disabled may be the reason for such insightful empathy in John Singer, the deaf mute whom a host of characters use to ease their own feelings of emptiness and lonliness. That 'Mr Singer' has feelings and human problems they are oblivious to.This is a masterful novel. I had 'got into' McCullers work by reading her 'Ballad of the Sad Cafe' short story collection and have yet to be anything other than stunned by her wonderful writing. This is a five star novel with bags to spare."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"As far as an enjoyable reading experience, I preferred Dawn Powell's Dance Night, which is about a similar time and place. But there is no doubting the power of this book. It follows several intertwined characters -- a cafe owner, a young puberty-aged girl, a drunken socialist agitator, a scholarly black doctor... And a kind, mute young man, almost Christ-like in the way he is perceived by others and who is at the very core of the tale. Each of these people are defined by a special vision that is at the core of their lives -- they are driven: for knowledge, for art, for mankind, for freedom and respect, for love of another. To some degree, I found the story contrived despite its gritty, unforgiving realism -- almost like a mathematical formula. But after a while I stopped thinking about that contrivance and was gripped by the story itself. It is clearly a product of the Depression and the threat of War and the social and racial injustices of the 1930's, so it helped me to experience that time. The protagonists in this story are all so driven by, and truthful to, their inner visions, it made me think: What is my vision? And am I truthful to it? As flawed or limited as each the central characters are, each became admirable as the story progressed -- each supremely driven by love and caring in their own way."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It's no fast-paced thriller, nor is it a gripping page-turner, it is however, an incredibly deep look into the heart and soul of man. Not until you finish the very last page and reflect on what you have read, can you truly begin to understand the simple truth behind the title, \`The heart is a lonely hunter.'The heart of man is lonely, always seeking, always needing something... elusive. We all share the need to feel connected, to be part of a whole. To know truth, and be at peace. We are so many disjointed voices that few of us are ever really heard.Set in the deep South, Carson tells of a deaf mute named John Singer and a group of frustrated individuals that gravitate towards his serene and kindly nature--a young girl, desperate to follow her dreams; a drunkard, willing to impart his wisdom on the uninformed; a black doctor, eager to lift his people to equality; and a caf&eacute; owner, stuck in the routines of life.Each seek Singer's company and tell of their woes with a deep believe that he, and only he, truly understands their ply. In him, each sees a kindred spirit. But what, exactly, does Singer see in them?"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I can't say I found this book to be an enjoyable read. Its a depression era tale that begins with a feeling of gloom and never takes an upturn. No doubt the description of the difficult time rings true. My parents experienced the depression era first hand and had tales of their own. Considering the date this book was written, I'm sure Carson McCullers based some of these events on her personal experiences.Mick's viewpoint is a coming of age story. Her relationships, experiences and her obsession with music are described with the depression era influence as a backdrop. In the end we are left with her realization that without a job she will never be able to afford to continue with her music studies. With the job after school, she has needed funds but no energy to work on music studies.Sadly, the person everyone seeks out to confide in is Mr. Singer, a deaf-mute. Towns people confide in and admire him and communicate on a one-on-one basis only. As a group, each one is ill at ease. They each know he cannot repeat private conversations to anyone else. Ultimately, he feels hopeless and isolated. Deep depression when his best friend dies drives him to suicideDr. Copeland is respected, although misunderstood, by members of the black community (including his own family). His political leanings toward the teachings of Karl Marx, combined with his lack of religious beliefs, causes feelings of isolation.The book is well written. Unfortunately the entire story is sad. It begins with a feeling of sadness and ends with a feeling of hopelessness. While I don't always expect happy endings, I prefer a story that gives hope that maybe there will be better times ahead."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"McCullers knew what she was doing when she wrote this book about an adolescent girl, Mick, confiding in a deaf-mute, John Singer, about life. I would recommend this book as a good book for any 10th or 11th grade English project!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"If William Faulkner and the modernists are believed to be literary Cubists, then I think it's fair to say that Carson McCullers is a bit of a literary Surrealist. Apparently French publishers LGF (Le Livre de Poche) had similar thoughts when they put a painting inspired by the surrealist painter Magritte on the cover of the French translation of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.Much like surrealist art, Hunter juxtaposes opposites, delves into the freakish, and poses unnatural combinations. McCullers' writes about a die-hard Marxist trying to convince a community of Southern Christian African-Americans to rise and take action against oppression and follow the ways of the atheist Karl Marx, and he does this during a Christmas party. Seem a bit surreal?If not then what about an alcoholic drifter who comments on the hypocrisies of the Daughter's of the American Revolution? If that doesn't seem surrealistic enough for you then how about a deaf man being the one person a group of misfits seek to talk to, or the only person said deaf man feels he can communicate with is an overweight, insane, Greek immigrant?McCullers uses Hunter to show that in the sluggish, reluctant to change South there are those who \\"know,\\" those who see something askew. McCullers shows how \\"those in the know\\" struggle to deal with a reality they can neither understand nor change.The Heart is a Lonely Hunter gives an extraordinary point of view to seemingly ordinary lives, and deals with issues such as loneliness, racism, and self-discovery. McCullers is an often overlooked writer who lived a life more interesting than most fiction written by her peers, and certainly on par with such famous \\"hard lived\\" authors as Hemmingway. Hunter is her first and most beautiful work of art. A masterpiece worthy of a place upon your shelf and in your heart."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I must say that I listened to the audio version. I'm sorry that I don't have it in front of me to give the reader's name as she did a wonderful job. I think the reader can add or detract a lot from a spoken word book and this woman was so good, with all the characters, male, female, white, black, young old, educated or not. I truly felt that I was listening to the characters themselves. After having read a number of negative reviews I'm think that maybe listening to it rather than reading is in print is the way to go....don't know.I was drawn into the story from the beginning and it didn't let go of me till the end of the last disk. I actually felt sad when I saw that I was nearing the end. I kept thinking of what a wonderful writer McCullers was as I listened. It was only until after it was finished and I found myself strangely depressed that I had second thoughts about the book. I was glad to come to Amazon and discover that others shared my less than enthusiastic opinion, based on one fact---it was depressing!I don't need what has become known as a Hollywood Happy Ending, with everything tied up in a Big Bow to give me a sense of satisfaction about a book. I have loved many dark works and don't have a problem with reading about tragedy. And I like a lot of Southern Gothic novels. But I think that, in order to get a sense of satisfaction from a work of art that there must be some sort of resolution to it. Just describing, in great detail, the woes and misfortunes of a group of people, with no point to ite, might be better called a documentary, except, of course that this is fiction. I was taught, way back in grade school, to look for character development in a novel, asking how the characters change due to the circumstances in which they find themselves. Maybe that was too simplistic? It does give a certain sense of purpose to reading and writing it. (Dr. Copeland was very big on \\"purpose.\\")Spoiler alert: I may say things that will spoil it for someone who hasn't read it.What is good is the actual writing. The descriptions are just right, not too self-consciously \\"writerly.\\" The characters are all well-drawn and I found them totally believable (although, as I said above, having a great reader really helped there). I liked the plot structure---showing a small group of individuals in a town separately and gradually having them interact with one another. The writer obviously had a lot of compassion for each character, which comes across; each one, although imperfect, is shown with a certain amount of gentleness and even affection, in a totally non-gooey way.I loved the language, especially that of the less educated Blacks, like Portia. Portia is probably the most lovable character in the book. She's the only one who deals with her problems, doesn't just sit around and moon about them as do the others. She tries in the only ways she knows how to bring the family together and she initiates the only change in the novel---bringing her father to live with the others in the family compound.The center of the book is Mick Kelly, who must be the alter-ego for the writer. We are privvy to more of her thoughts and feelings than of any of the others and so we do root for her. The problem is that her early spunk and enthusiasm for life just dwindles out at the end. She has a lively, warm encounter with the boy next door and they spend an idyllic day in the woods, which culminates in her first sexual encounter. But then she quickly turns off--completely shuts this and the boy out of her mind. Why? Soon after, she quits school which she loved and takes a job in a dime store. The plan was to save money to buy a radio and then a piano and pursue her love of music. But at the end, we see her just frittering away her money with trinkets and treats, she's lost her spirit and there's no hope given for anything better for her.The other \\"center\\" is the mysterious Mr. Singer. I loved Mr. Singer, as did everyone else in the story. He's a deaf mute with the seeming superior spiritual virtures of a Buddha or a Christ. Drunks sober up in his presence, hysterics calm down, all the troubled people of the book run to Mr. Singer for calm and spiritual balm on their souls. The problem I had with this character is that he is portrayed in a such an exalted way that there is no sense of his final act. His incredible love for the childish, selfish Antonopolous who only cares for food just didn't make sense to me, nor gibe with what was supposed to be his great wisdom. Well maybe we, the readers were fooled into projecting too much goodness into Mr. Singer, just as the townspeople did. But I think that was a flaw in the book.Besides this we are exposed to a long list of terrible events---a very young boy accidentally shoots his little girl friend and ruins her life. a Black man undergoes a horrific trauma in prison, the restaurant owner has fallen out of love with his wife and she dies, another relative has a hopeless attachment to her abusive spouse, Mick's sister gets sick and has to quit her job, which puts further stress on the already strapped finances of the family, the town drunk and would-be-revolutionary keeps on drinking and eventually leaves town, Mick's father just can't earn a decent living....etc. etc. etc. People bump into each other, have encounters of a sort but don't really connect in a meaningful way. The fat selfish mute gets sick and dies and Singer shoots himself. No one is changed, no one grows or learns anything from these troubles. There is a distinct lack of \\"triumph of the human spirit over adversity.\\" The only attempt at wrapping things up is the observation that the restaurant owner makes, that people made a lot of effort...or something. It was a very pale attempt at resolution after living through so much pain.I read here that the novelist wrote this when she was 23 so I'm wondering if she might have written a better, fuller, work if she had done this when she was more mature. Who knows?"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is so weird. Basically nothing happens, and what does happen is surreal or absurd, yet I couldn't stop reading. Actually, I kept telling myself that I would stop, since I wasn't all that interested, but I never did. It may not have been interesting (plot-wise) but it was captivating.The main character is a deaf mute of all things, and it still manages to be painfully relatable. The writing is beautiful--I think it's a Southern writer thing--and crisp. Of course, the title is also brilliant. Longer and perhaps lacking the crystalline concentration of emotion of the novella Ballad of a Sad Cafe. Still, brilliant, beautiful, tragic, grotesque, Southern."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers' \\"Ballad of the Sad Cafe\\" and \\"Member of the Wedding\\" are among my favorite stories ever, and I also like Flannery O'Connor's \\"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\\" which I think qualifies me to declare myself a bona fide fan of Southern Gothic. (I also admired \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" which has elements of the genre.) However, I just couldn't love \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter.\\" It seems to me to occupy an uncomfortable middle ground between the grotesque, stylized story telling of \\"Ballad of the Sad Cafe\\" and the heartbreaking, naturalistic interactions between the characters of \\"Member of the Wedding.\\" There are only traces of the distinctive humor that appears in the later stories. To me, it feels like McCullers is just warming up.Still, it is fascinating to see her introduction of the themes that played a role in her later works: the lover's disregard for the true nature of the beloved, the would-be reformer's lack of understanding of the true nature of society, the child's self-absorption and vulnerability. I do recommend the book, but primarily to those who have already read her other books, or will go on to do so."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book, originally, because it was one of James Dean's favorites. A gift he gave to William Bast in New York before he left for Hollywood to shoot \\"East of Eden.\\" There was something substantially lonely about all the characters in the book that Dean must have connected with, himself an enigmatic, and very lonely figure. Albeit, one surrounded by people.Upon reading the novel myself, I found it interesting how each of the four main characters created exactly what they needed, emotionally, in the deaf mute character of Singer. To me, he seemed the loneliest of them all...always without. No way of communicating, only listening. No way of expression. This is what I think Dean connected with...no way of expressing the loneliness. Bast's biography, \\"Surviving James Dean,\\" gives an excellent depiction of a James Dean closed off from the rest of world...a Dean stuck in a deaf mute's world, with no way to express his tumultuous feelings.Carson McCullers does a great job of portraying some bohemian American ideals far before their time: racism, capitalism, arguments in communism. A true American novelist, there is something distincly \\"American\\" about the young woman from Columbus, Georgia, something that depicts excellently the prudent struggles of Americans that are vastly different than any other civilization."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"To me, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is a classic novel. It certainly is a masterpiece. The setting of the story is down south in Georgia. The era is during the Great Depression. This was also an era of racial tension especially in the south, but as is often the case in the novel, music proved to be a strong source of solace and passions are stirred to add vigor to the romantic side of things. Even though they lived in a delicate world of their times, the characters live their lives oblivious of the constraints around. The strength of spiritual isolation is strong and mirrors the reality of mankind. The novel portrays the purpose of man in his God-given role on earth. This is a novel that will be enjoyed by generations to come. the deep message this book carries echoes in other books like Disciples of Fortune,The Idiot. Overall, this is an accomplished piece of writing with good characterization, a smooth prose, dialogue and plot."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"McCullers has an insight into person psychology that allows her to create great characters that everyone can relate to. This is my third time reading this book. It is a great piece of work, and beautifully written. It is a superb memoir, and the author's style is impressive. The characters are as rich as any who have ever been imagined, and the story is just breathtaking. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel is just plain well-written. It not only provides ample character sketches, but also supplies the reader with a good plot. The novel is centered around a deaf man named Mr. Singer, whom four lost souls look to as their own version of a saviour. Mr. Singer's mystery is yours to solve. The other four characters have beautiful struggles to save themselves from their innermost thoughts and desires. McCullers truly and honestly expresses human emotion in a moving way that is never sappy or gratuitous. The book does get a bit boring and longwinded at points, but you will soon pass them and be rewarded with a plot twist or more gorgeous prose. A good book to add to your list."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book many years ago and found it to be way better than the movie. It centers around a deaf man named Mr. Singer. It is a fascinating human interest story which helps us understand that even though a person is deaf, they are still a person with the same hopes and aspirations as anyone else."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is an easy to read, sad and thought provoking novel that stayed with me a long time after finishing. The story involves the lives of four characters as they revolve around the life of a deaf mute in a small southern town in the 1930's. The story of the five main characters is so void of ego and superficiality that it allows their voices to resonate after you've finished with such haunting power it is miraculus to behold. Carson McCullers, who was increadibly only 23 when she wrote the book, writes with such fresh clean talent and crafts the arc of the characters with such sublety that it didn't hit me until the very end of the book where the elusive paths of the characters were leading to. The inside cover of the book calls McCullers a creative genius and after reading it I would have to be inclined to agree. The book reminds us that innocence at any age may be fleeting, so hold on to it as long as you can."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I spent an entire semester of English class reading and analyzing this book. What I learned was that this book starts dry with disengaging characters, while the plot proceeds at a painstakingly slow pace for very little to happen. Sure, there are plenty of worse authors and worse books out there, but The Heart is a Lonely Hunter makes a strong case for the worst book I've ever read. I can only describe it as an insipid waste of time. This book will not entertain you, and it will not make you smarter in any way. I truly hate this book with a passion.This book might be good for English majors or snobs who want to appear well-read. It's one of those books that people assume is of high literary value when in fact it borders on garbage. Pointing this out is unpopular and goes against the status-quo. At first I planned to buy a few dozen used copies and burn them to ensure people won't have to endure this awful book. But then I decided I'd rather have people read it to find out for themselves just how bad it is. They might like the first chapter, and tolerate the second, but by the third chapter they will know they are holding a complete waste of paper. The story ends with the book sold back to some poor customer on Amazon. Just look at how popular used copies are. People are desperate to get rid of this nonsense."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It took me two months and forty-eight hours of nonstop raining to finish this \\"classic\\" set in the Deep South during the 1930s. Key characters in the novel are all struggling with embracing and understanding what makes them different from the status quo. These characters also spend a fair amount of time pondering the human condition during a time when race relations in America appear to mirror ethnic relations in Hitler's Germany. The novel is quite dense and for me probably one of the slowest reads I've encountered in a while. I'm sure the story was quite powerful when it was originally published in 1940 but I wasn't able to connect to the story much at all; I simply wanted to finish it because it was a recommended read.While I didn't get into the story much I'm sure there is much material here for academic and historical analysis but it wasn't much of a pleasure read for me - and definitely not a summer read. I checked this out from library and even with the late fees that I've racked up it was still cheaper than purchasing it. Read it if you have to for a classroom exercise but I can't recommend that you run out a purchase it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book BEATIFULL, FUNNY and DRAMATIC all at the same time.

John Singer makes for hardly a compelling protagonist and McCullers' characterization is lacking at best. We never really get to know the real John Singer as we encounter a bevy of vapidly shallow supporting characters clinging to his very being.I kept waiting for the book to build plot development and come through with some profound theme or happening...but to no avail. Many other classics of this genre far outweigh this effort -- including, but not limited to, Black Boy, Invisible Man, & To Kill a Mockingbird just to name a few."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This was the most awfully boring book I've ever read!

Unfortunately, as Mark Twain once said, \\"A classic is a book everybody praises but nobody reads.\\" In this case, I am glad to see Oprah recommend it and thus restore its popularity. The characters are rough and sometimes ugly, but beneath all this the heroine manages to find beauty and happiness.Great story for young women readers."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I have no idea why this book is considered a classic.

Not memorable."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I found the storyline too meandering with not enough substance. It was not a gripping page turner.

It was definitely one of the more tedious choices from Oprah's list."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"First of all this book is something that shouldn't even be forced onto someone to read.

The author's picture on the front cover seems to express her own feelings...Yawn."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Consider yourself warned. This book is not about hunting, despite the title. A couple of people do get shot, but they weren't really hunted. The book instead is about a collection of misfits in the South with such names as \\"Spareribs,\\" \\"Bubber,\\" and even a deaf mute strangely named \\"Singer.\\" These people do their best to live their lives, and they seem to find some comfort in setting up one guy as a sort of god-like figure (there is an uber-god who seem to be the only content person in the novel). What happens when your god dies? I guess you keep on going. The lives of these misfits sheds light on personal and inter-personal conflicts. If the soul is the seat of passion and turmoil, of beauty and ugliness, of honor and cowardice, then the South is the soul of America, as far as I can tell from this book. Anyway, like I said in the beginning, this book is not about hunting, but maybe you'll find it worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I have had the misfortune of picking 3 highly recommended 'classic' books in the past month that all melted together and subdued my voracious reading bug.The first was Chocolat, followed by The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and capped off with Snow Falling on Cedars. It took me approximately 2 1/2 times longer to get through these books than other books and after completing all three, I can only slightly differentiate Chocolat away from the rest of them.In terms of The Heart is a Lonely Hunter - I can see why this is an Oprah Book Club book. Her Book Club started out good - nothing too complicated, nothing to fluffy - but then, in my opinion, her choices became too factual and less about enjoyment. I cannot get through a Toni Morrison book to save my life and even if I could, I wouldn't understand it. I feel similarly about this book - I can get through it and I understand it, but I'm hanging by a very thin thread.Some Oprah Book books really struck me - Icy Sparks, anything by Wally Lamb, for example - but if they don't totally strike me, they seem to go the opposite.I've read a few book since reading this one and can't honestly remember what it's about. I piqued my memory before writing this down though and I remember some disgust with the deaf mute in the hospital and that was the extent of my emotional connection to this book.I don't think it's a must read and I don't think it's once of those books that, once you labor through, you want to reread. I would skip this one."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"college grads find this book boring just as well. It was just so slow moving, so uninteresting, so dull and depressing.

I would give it NO stars if I could."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I don't understand how people found this book excellent and interesting. But then again some people might not understand how I found this book totally boring, uninteresting and depressing. This book is far from a Classic and deserves NO STARS."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I was disturbed to read so many negative reviews of Carson McCullers' The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter. This book is one of the finest works of literature in the American canon. Oprah's bookclub has lately been doing the admirable work of resurrecting old classics - McCullers WAS, in fact, quite the sensation among her contemporaries. I feel that Heart' is the book around which all of McCuller's other pieces orbit. I'll agree with a few other reviewers in saying that this is not an action book, it is not &quot;funny train station&quot; literature, and the impetus is psychological, and often quite intangible.As a master's degree student in writing at Sarah Lawrence College, I love this book. As a high school student, I adored it. People picking up something for fluffy entertainment value should probably not read this book. People looking to experience a different kind of life, to read a beautifully written social commentary, to experience psychological empathy pertaining to the human condition...those people should read this book.It's great writing. Don't bash it because it's not your type of reading material.To drive my point into the ground, people who enjoy authors in the vein of Flannery O'Connor, Katherine Anne Porter, Tennessee Williams, Anne Tyler, Annie Proulx, Katherine Dunn, William Faulkner, Harper Lee, possibly Jeanette Winterson...these readers, and readers looking for great literature, should sample Carson McCullers."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Thank you, Oprah! I read this book as a college freshman in 1976 and still remember its startlingly honest, quietly devestating portrait of five women from a small Southern town and how, despite their individual loneliness, they fail to connect. Written when McCullers was only 23, it was the emotional and intellectual touchstone for all her other works. Still a pleasure to read and new generations of women will be mezmerized. My other two favorite recent books: \\"I Sleep At Red Lights: A True Story of Life After Triplets,\\" by Bruce Stockler, an amazingly funny and fresh memoir about marriage, manhoood, love, career, parenting and juggling. And \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran: A Memoir in Books,\\" by Azar Nafisi, an immensely moving portrait of the power of words and books in a closed society (and how we take books for granted)."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson Mc Cullers has exposed to us through this novel, the loneliness we all experience, no matter how full our lives may seem.The story involves the lives of some wonderful characters. Set in the Deep south in the 1930's, John Singer and Antonapoulos, both deaf mutes, and seemingly life partners, are separated when Antonapoulos is sent to an asylum. Singer takes a room in a boarding house owned by the Kelly family and meets Mick Kelly. A tomboyish 13 year old girl with a passion for music and culture. Being the youngest of the girls in the family, much of the responsibility is put upon her to not only watch, but basicly raise her 2 younger siblings. With the help of Portia, a simple black woman employed by the Kelly's. Who's father Dr.Copeland, stuggles with the oppression of his people. Always battling within himself and his children. A man well educated and sucessful being a black doctor, yet all of his children a dissapointment to him. Their lack of interest to not only better themselves, but also their lack in his cause. Jake Blount, a drunken, outspoken man teams up with Singer in a relationship left empty for both he and Singer. Both being very well read people, he and Singer can't seem to connect as Singer and Antonapoulos did. Biff Brannon, a local restaurant owner, unhappy in his own marriage that has run dry, has only a few fond memories to reflect on when his wife passes away. And a new life which he looks forward to is never quenched. As Singer goes on with his life quietly, each of these characters are drawn to him, each for their own reasons. Searching for something that none will find.Mc Cullers writing style is very enjoyable. Each chapter almost entirly dedicated to each character, giving you a great sense of who this character truly is and what they are feeling. Also each chapter seems to be a little story by it's self with in this story line. This book is a fast read, easy to understand, and very clarified. Carson's use of southern black dialec is truly an asset in giving you a great feel for the south. I do recommend this book, it's a wonderful insight to a feeling deep within each and every one of us."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am a high school senior that had to read this book as a final project. It has become my favorite book. Everyone has or will have a point in life when they are either misunderstood or when they just feel lonely. This book help me to realize that I was lonely, and it caused me to do something about it. Everyone has something that they care not to share and that was what this book was about,people with problems, like normal Americans.I believe that every high school student should read this book and then compare and contrast it to their lives. This could stop all the violence in our schools. I will be entering college next year with a new feel on life. I was Mick and Singer, and I believe that Mick overcame her loneliness, but Singer realized that people are selfish(by the way they came to him with their problems but never asked about his.)and that he will never have a chance to pour out his enter most feelings to anyone and that is why he committed suicide. I really enjoyed what is now my favorite book. Read this book and know who you really are."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel is a profound and powerful work of undoubted literary quality. It's characters are sharply drawn and believable, and the portrait of life in the town that they inhabit realistic and strong. It's amazing to consider that the author was only 23 when this book was first published. It's an amazing achievement.And I detested it.It's stupifyingly depressing. The characters, almost without exception, lead sad, desparate lives with little chance for happiness. It takes place in a time and a location that not only am I not familiar with, I can't identify with in the least. Perhaps it helps if one is from the South, or is from a rural environment, or grew up in the earlier part of the last century, or is (maybe) a woman. I don't know; I'm a late-20th Century urban Yankee, and I couldn't related to it at all.Many people complain that not all movies nor novels should have happy endings. Life isn't that way, they say; why should fiction? Perhaps I am a philistine, but I feel that that is *exactly* why I want my fiction to end (more or less) happily. Life *is* difficult and a struggle, and I do not need to bring more depression, lonliness, sadness, and struggle into it by seeking it out in fiction. Read the editorial reviews above: the book is about &quot;the damned, the voiceless, the rejected.&quot; It &quot;takes us on shattering voyages into the depths of the spiritual isolation that underlies the human condition.&quot;That may be your cup of tea, but it is most certainly not mine. I found this book astonishingly depressing. I will never read it again. Which in no way detracts from my very real appreciation of its literary qualities and the superb writing.How can one balance out those two conflicting feelings? I gave it three stars, because that's the best I can do. Judge for yourself if you want to go on the &quot;shattering voyage,&quot; and make your purchasing choice accordingly."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Oprah put The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter on her book club list and it's been selling well as a Golden Oldie, but don't be put off by Oprah's middlebrow fans, Carson McCullers was a genius.At age twenty-two McCullers arrives in New York City with a manuscript so insightful into human pathos, you would think she knew Freud and Aristotle on a first name basis. The book made a sensation from the beginning. Certainly Richard Wright thought that it was the first book by a Southern white person that had any insight and feelings for the plight of Negroes. Indeed, her characterizations of black poor people crashed barriers with ease. Her characterizations of Mick Kelly's family and other white citizens of a mythological Faulknarian hamlet are no less well drawn.Lonely doesn't have a plot. The reader shares the thoughts and overhears the conversations of five characters, Mick, McCuller's teen alter-ego, Doctor Copeland the only black doctor for a thousand miles raging with hatred for white men and his own race, Mr. Brannon, a caf' owner with a suddenly dead wife and a semi-unhealthy obsession about young Mick, Jake Blount a Marxist revolutionary, roustabout, and Singer the deaf mute.It is Singer that brings these diverse characters together for he is their father confessor, but that's a laugh for the reader; Singer can't hear them. They go on and on about their lives, their dreams and disappointments, but Singer merely nods his head agreeably. The mute becomes a kind of town guru, a Buddha. He has a following of folks that think he has mystical powers or great intellect. In reality, Singer is a nice man, but he loves only one person, and that man is in a mental hospital.This book is very influential. Southern American writers have some kind of catharsis in youth that's a leg up for a fiction writer. After all, life is surreal enough if you examine a life, any life."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"All of us have a variety of characters that we meet and encounter throughout our lives. Some of them odd, some of them funny, some of them dull, and I venture to say we have bumped into, on more than one occasion, those whom we might deem as a \\"social outcast.\\" Never before had I read a novel that attempted to put into words what it might be like to be one of these lonely outcasts. Of course the characters in \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\\" are not viewed in a way we would think of most outcasts. They are viewed in the story with a sense of realism and awe that most novels can not generate. These characters and their lives and thoughts will become more and more real as the novel unfolds.The novel is told in brilliant, almost poetic third person. Although I bet if down the road if someone were to ask you about this book, you would swear it was told in first person by each of the characters. The novel is essentially about a year in time of five very different, very vivid characters. The characters are all searching for something they can never seem to find. All of them are as different as night and day, but have so many things in common.The story switches from one character to another with each passing section. We gain tremendous insight to their personal lives, oddities, and behavior in a writing style like no other. If I had to choose who the main character would be, it would have to be Mr. Singer. Mr. Singer is a mute. He can understand words that are spoken to him by the movements of others lips. The story opens beautifully, describing his friendship with another mute friend, Antropulous. The story describes the poignant feelings Mr. Singer has toward his friend. Soon into the story, Mr. Singer's friend is put a mental institution by his own brother. This turn of events wounds and scars the heart of Mr. Singer. Not soon after, Mr. Singer begins going to a caf&eacute;, which is owned by another one of the stories characters, Biff. Biff is very strange, and has become even stranger since the death of his wife. He has one redeeming quality, in that he takes good care of the customers who some into his caf&eacute;. One of these customers is Jake. Jake is another outcast. He is an alcoholic, with a mean streak in him. He rants and raves about how unequal the country is. Another character we encounter in the caf&eacute; is Mick. Mick might be the most fascinating character in the story. She is kind of a tomboy, who loves music, and exploring the streets at night. The final main character is Mr. Compton, a black doctor, who has hatred in his heart for white men.McCullers does a superb job of bringing these characters all together. Mr. Singer finds a new place to stay after his best friend goes to the nut house. That new place is Mick's house. One by one, the main characters meet Mr. Singer and become magnetically drawn to them. They tell him of their frustration, their worries, and how they feel about life. Mr. Singer just smiles and listens because he can't speak. Occasionally, he will write down something on a piece of paper if he has something important to say.Mr. Singer can't figure out why these people are drawn to him. The fascinating thing is that all the main characters know each other, yet none of them like anyone by Mr. Singer, who seems to be the thread holding all their lives together. Mick loves him more than her own father, Mr. Compton feels he is the only white man with any worth, Biff just finds him interesting, and Jake considers him the only one who understands. All along, Mr. Singer has loneliness in his own heart for his friend that has been sent away. Every so often he gets a chance to visit him, but it is not the same. These visits are some of the most breathtaking passages in the novel.There is not time or room to explain all that happens in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. I have just given some of the basics. There is so much more that happens, and so much more that I could say.I don't know if I have ever enjoyed reading a novel as much as this one. The language was so alive, so fresh, so beautiful, and so heart wrenching. This book might have the most interesting characters I have ever read about. I can't get it out of my head. It is hard to put into words the reasons that make this book a masterpiece. One is that it evokes powerful emotions with you. McCullers is an absolute master at pointing out little observances, oddities, and other things in life that we might just forget about, or not take the time to notice. The book is filled with these precious little gems scattered throughout the masterful plot and style.The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is also very entertaining. Yet it goes past the mediocrity of mindless entertainment, and takes us on a deep, emotional, and unsentimental journey through the lives of people that you will come to know so well. You will feel that if you met these characters in real life, you would know everything about them. McCullers puts in the time, and the reader is heavily rewarded. Even if the characters might not be extremely likable, but we care so much to find out what will happen next in their lives.I loved this book. The story and mood has continued to linger on in my mind, compared to other books that fade so quickly. This story is more felt than read. I love it even more the way McCullers ends this book. The ending takes a turn no one could have expected, and makes the novel even more deep and thoughtful that it would have been otherwise. Why can't every book be this good? Why can't every book shake my soul to the core with such power as this one did? These questions, like many others posed by this masterpiece, are left unanswered.Grade: A"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I've read all of Carson McCuller's novels, and this one is easily her best. I liked &quot;The Member of the Wedding.&quot; &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; was O.K. I didn't like &quot;The Ballad of the Sad Cafe,&quot; and furthermore, I have no idea why critics love it as much as they do. &quot;A Clock Without Hands&quot; is completely forgettable and not worth your time. But this is McCullers' great work. It's truly a great, unique and universal story, a timeless story about isolation, one which makes you care about what happens to the characters, one in which the characters and the events depicted are true to life. These are people you could meet, three-dimensional characters you can like, love, admire, some of whom you might also want to avoid. It's a tragic story, and reading it one experiences real emotions, particularly feelings of alienation from the rest of humanity -- a feeling which all the major characters experience in one form or another. Enjoy it and don't ruin it for anyone by revealing the sudden surprise near the end."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I stumbled upon The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter a couple of years ago and purchased it for a dollar. I think it was on one or more of the &quot;greatest 100&quot; lists that folks publish on various boards, so I scooped it right up. I did enjoy the writing and the complexities of the story, even if it is occasionally bleak and sad. One aspect I loved is that it did hone in on a tiny microcosm within a single town, showing universality in a finite manner.The main &quot;lonely&quot; characters look to the deaf-mute John Singer as possessing incredible listening and audience skills, and they all literally go to him, turn to him, for obviously merely tacit advice, to pour out their hearts, while revealing their troubles and dreams. It is as if they project the answers they are searching for onto his dignified and quiet persona. Little do they know that he is as lonely and mixed up as they are, after losing his companion to insanity. Singer's stream of consciousness is noteworthy.The book moves back and forth among each character's story, but it is linear and easily followed. The budding teenager Mick stole the show, and I found Doctor Copeland to be the most interesting character, yet the questions left surrounding the human condition involving racism, family, communism, alcoholism, aspirations, relationships, etc., run the gamut of human existence, and they are sensitively portrayed by an amazing (at the time) 23 year old writer.This novel is a stellar example of a work standing the test of time.RoeRecommended.Roe"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I don't see a need to summarize the novel as the previous 110 reveiwers have done so, but I will share my thoughts. SOme readers complained that the characters are left in limbo at the end, that that is not a satisfactory conclusion. But aren't we always in limbo? Their relationship with John Singer was not real. It was their imaginary vision of who they thought he was, except perhaps Dr. Copeland, who saw Singer as decent human being. Each of the main characters, in the course of their friendship with Singer, was dealt a hard blow of reality, yet they grow from it. They have their dreams, and they have other things too. Their dreams are shattered but they go on from there. John Singer has nothing, no dreams. He has only one friend, one person who he cares for. And when that person dies, he has nothing left to live for, and calmy smokes a cigarette, drinks a cup of sold coffee, rinses out the ashtray and the glass, and puts a bullet through his heart. What the others, griefstrucken by their deaths, was that he was like them, and every other person, only more so. They worshipped him, but in doing so, they denied him their friendship."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best novels I've read in a while. I loved the way Carson McCullers develops the characters in this book. Loneliness and racial injustice are two timeless themes in this novel that McCullers presents so well. McCullers was a white woman writing about how black people were mistreated and felt oppressed in 1940. She was an author truly ahead of her time in that way.All the characters are so memorable in this book. Biff Brannon is a compassionate cafe owner. He helps anyone in need by giving them either food, money or a job. Brannon becomes a widower when his wife dies suddenly of a tumor. Mick Kelly is a lonely but intelligent 12 year old girl from a poor family with a passion for music. Doctor Copeland is a black physician. He becomes a crusader for racial justice when his son goes to jail. McCullers explains the basic principles of Karl Marx's economic theory in the novel by putting in a lecture by Copeland in the novel to show how society is divided between the rich and poor people. I knew nothing about Karl Marx's ideas, so I thought this part of the novel was very interesting. Another memorable character is John Singer. He is a man who does not have the ability to speak. However, he becomes the person all the characters eventually confide all their problems to. Singer communicates with his long time room mate and only deaf friend by using sign language. The relationship and love between these two deaf friends is one of the best things about this novel.The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is one of the best books Oprah has ever chosen for her book club. The themes of loneliness and racial injustice are timeless and universal. The characters are very memorable too. I loved reading this book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This 1940 novel by Carson McCullers is set in a small southern town. It's about five different people and their relationships to each other. There is surface structure inasmuch as the chapters move back and forth, focusing on one character and then another and moving the action forward. But there's an appealing off-center feeling to it all, as this study in what it means to be a human being reflects the human condition without having to tie it all up in a neat little package.Driving the story is John Singer, a deaf mute. When his friend Sprios, a fellow deaf mute, goes insane, John Singer attracts other alienated people, who pour their hearts out to him, believing that he understands everything. There's Jake, who drinks hard, requires constant stimulation of his senses to feel alive, and views the world though a communist philosophy. There's Dr. Copeland, a black physician, who so wants to improve the condition of his race, that he has driven his wife and children away because they never fit the picture of the way he wanted them to be. There's Mick, the adolescent girl, introspective and intuitive, who dreams of a future filled with music and travel. And then there is Biff, the owner of the Caf&eacute;, who collects old newspapers and tries to make sense out of what is going on around him. Everyone feels that the deaf-mute has some sort of magical presence. But yet, he too, proves to be very human.The town itself is important to the story, and Ms. McCullers' makes use of the rhythms of the seasons and of music to bring the reader right there. The coming-of-age of the adolescent made me sad and the realities of racism caused me to cringe in horror. The alienation is deeply frustrating. This is exemplified by one very moving scene where two men debate how to handle injustices. Both men want the same things, but yet they talk past each other, each demanding that the other must follow a certain prescribed ideology.Each character is restricted by limitations. Each one has desires. And each one has his or her desires crushed. How each one reacts and how this interaction affects everyone else is the essence of the story. The author's skill pulls it all together masterfully. It's a disturbing book as it tugs at that chord of isolation that exists in all of us. And yet, it is a wonderful read. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Besides this book, I have read \\"A Member of the Wedding\\" by Carson McCullers. It is very striking to me that when I read each of these books, my mental images of the characters and settings were in black and white. Well, really, I saw it all play out in shades of gray. The people and places in this book are dark, often dirty, lowly, depressed, depressing and teetering on the verge of hopelessness.The title aptly states the novel's theme; the overriding feeling of the book is stark loneliness. The characters cannot connect with one another - even when they are trying very hard to do so. They don't have authentic relationships even when they think that they have found a soul mate. Each of them wants to share his or her inner-most truths, and without exception they are impotent in their attempts. They each have things that they want to do, talents that they want to express. In each case, they can't or don't overcome their personal burdens to reach their goals or to achieve any sort of success. In the end, they are each alone with little hope for a more fullfilling life.The book is very well written. Each chapter is written as a stream of consciousness of one of 4 main characters who each move the story forward a (very tiny) bit. This book is all about characters. It is definitely NOT about plot. McCullers remains stylistically consistent throughout, which seems to be quite an accomplishment in this very ambitious first novel.For me, reading this book is a literary accomplishment. I can check off another classic from my list of books to read. However, it was not a book that I found enjoyable. I would suggest that ambitious readers should tackle it. Its style, mood and characters are very effectively created and sustained. On the other hand, if you prefer plot, uplifting or hopeful themes, happy endings or characters that grow or overcome their limitations, you may not want to spend your reading efforts on this book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is huge. I approached it with skepticism. Half way through the book, I wasn't wowed. Then while I was telling somebody else about it, it dawned on me how deep the characters and the story had grown. It's a coming of age story for a whole town and one young girl. Every character is so natural through the story that a rich diversity of music, politics, philosophy, and religion is subtly and radically revealed.Mick Kelly's experiences at her \\"prom\\" and the swimming hole, her relationships with her siblings, and obsession with music provide a parallel for the life of each other person. A deaf-mute as a focus to share a secret with each character was inspired. We're all individuals in the same boat. The abrupt last sentence of Part 2 is brilliant.It's a simple story to enjoy with plenty to discover and digest throughout."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter by Carson McCullers. Highly recommended.Only 23 when she wrote The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, Carson McCullers captures the restless energy of adolescence and the loneliness and isolation of those who choose not to fit into their world-Mick Kelly, an artistic teenager whose titles and graffiti reveal a darker side to her personality; Jake Blount, an itinerant socialist; Benedict Mady Copeland, a consumptive black physician; and Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Caf&eacute;. Linking this disparate group of outsiders is the ironically named John Singer, a man who cannot talk (or sing). They are drawn to him, as lonely people are to someone they believe will listen and understand. They never step out of themselves to discover that Singer listens, but he doesn't understand, nor do they realise that he, too, is lonely and isolated-or why.Just as these four impose their concept of Singer upon him, he has his own idol-his companion of 10 years, Spiros Antonapoulos. While Singer's lonely friends project upon him the character of a wise, knowing, understanding man, Singer in turn imposes a similar personality on Antonapoulos. His life revolves around his rare visits to the asylum to which Antonapoulos is eventually taken. As the reader's awareness of Antonapoulos as a childish, greedy, and lazy man grows, so grows Singer's faith in him as gentle and wise. As a fellow mute, Antonapoulos is all Singer has, so he both idealises and idolises him-in the same way that Mick, Blount, Copeland, and, to a lesser extent, Brannon idealise and idolise Singer.Rarely do any of the four interact, except when Blount and Dr. Copeland engage in a circular argument about how best to help their peoples-victims of capitalism in Blount's case, blacks in Dr. Copeland's. These two groups have much in common, but just as Blount and Dr. Copeland remain in bitter conflict, so do their peoples-a conflict which is alluded to throughout and which culminates in a brawl at the carnival grounds where Jake works. Dr. Copeland and Jake never find common ground, nor do the poor white laborers and oppressed blacks they wish to enlighten. Dr. Copeland's self-sacrificing but hopeless dedication and Jake's self-destructive brutality could be seen as representing their time and place, the 1930s South.Sexual ambiguity pervades the novel. It is never clear whether Singer and Antonapoulos are lovers, although it seems like that that is what lies behind Singer's uncritical devotion. Even when Antonapoulos's selfish, greedy, irrational behaviour drives away a third mute, Singer is merely disappointed at the loss of a potential friend-as long as he has Antonapoulos, he is content. After Antonapoulos leaves, \\". . . in the spring a change came over Singer . . . his body was very restless . . . unable to work off a new feeling of energy.\\"This sexual energy is shared by Mick, who is always restless. This isolates her even more from the rest of her family: her father, a disabled carpenter trying half-heartedly to make a living; her mother, for whom Mick acts as a substitute parent for her younger brothers Bubber (George) and Ralph; her older brother Bill, once close to her and now distant; and her older sisters Hazel and Etta, who have been forced from adolescence into adulthood through work and their own conventional interest in celebrity. (One could speculate about the nature of the \\"diseased ovary\\" Etta develops.)Mick lives in an \\"inside room,\\" where she finds peace in music and in her perceptions of her friendship with Singer. Later, after her sexual initiation, she finds herself slyly manipulated into taking a job by her apparently solicitous family; at this point, she notices that, while the \\"inside room\\" is still important, she has less time and energy for it. McCullers exposition of Mick's transition from inventive childhood to dulling adulthood is subtle and is one of the best aspects of the novel.Of the four, Brannon is the most enigmatic. After his wife dies, he redecorates in what seems a distinctly unmasculine way (in contrast to his heavy, black beard, the subject of many comments). Even more interesting, he begins to wear his late wife's perfume. While he observes, defends, and supports Jake, his sexual feelings are focused on Mick, to whom he seems distant and cold (in her naivet&eacute;, Mick attributes his attitude to the fact that she and Bubber shoplifted gum from the caf&eacute;). Not surprisingly, after Mick is sexually initiated, obtains a job, and begins to dress and behave more like a girl on the cusp of womanhood, Brannon loses interest and consequently warms up to her. She is now no more of a challenge to his impotence than his late wife was.McCullers weaves a dense cloth of themes. First, there is the inward and selfish nature of loneliness. No one ever truly reaches out; in fact, Mick's Jewish neighbor Harry, appalled by fascism and Hitler, and Brannon are the only characters who are interested in the greater world. The conditions of the working poor and the black experience are eloquently portrayed without much narrative or focus on details. By the end, everything and nothing has changed. Mick is determined to escape fate through music, unlikely as it seems; a weakened Dr. Copeland becomes unable to carry on his \\"strong, true purpose.\\" Blount leaves town to find someone who will finally accept the basket of ideas that haunts his nightmares; Brannon, \\"suspended between bitter irony and faith,\\" faces the dawn exactly as he has for years.McCullers' portrayal of these disparate characters are true to life and reveal a remarkable insight into people, no matter their age, gender, race, or background-an insight that is lacking in her self-absorbed characters. The heart is a lonely hunter, so it will find what it wishes to-love-in the most unlikely of places. It would take many re-readings to mine the richness here.Diane L. Schirf, 31 May 2004."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"One of the most amazing things about The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is that Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote this. The writing in this novel is incredible. I think the reader should be prepared for the fact that this story is melancholy and can be depressing at times, but at the same time is brilliant in its character depth and social understanding. I wish I would have read this novel in highschool as there is clearly a lot of symbolism and statement that would lead to great discussions. The center of this novel is John Singer a deaf-mute who is feeling abandoned after his life-long friend Antonapoulos is sent away to a distant hospital. The novel introduces us to 4 lives: a young girl named Mick who grows up in poverty; Dr. Copeland, an African-American doctor; Jake Blount a wandering alcoholic and Biff Brannon a cafe owner. We learn the loneliness and pain of each of these characters and watch as each one is drawn to the mute, John Singer. McCullers details her novel with many truths about the human spirit, as well as some political and social statements of her own. It is said that much of the novel is autobiographical as McCullers was raised in a small southern town, primarily by her African-American maid. I would suggest that the reading of this novel is coupled with a little research about McCullers and some background info on the novel for full appreciation. Upon completion I am glad that I read this and can appreciate it for all that it offers and is trying to say."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"After hearing everyone's glowing reviews, and being so excited to start reading this book- after reading Part 1 of this book, I was ready to give up. However, I'm glad I picked it up again a few days later &amp; finished it. Still, the book was not quite what I envisioned, and it does not make my list of favorite books. But I realize I'm not much of a &quot;classic novels&quot; reader, so that probably had a lot to do with how I felt about this book.I enjoyed the premise of this town full of misfits; a drunk, a bar-keep, a teenage girl who's an outsider, a deaf mute and a repressed black doctor- all of which who made excellent characters. And once the stories of these people really got going, in part 2, I was enjoying the reading. It's just that part one really sets the stage for each of these characters, so it's not very exciting reading. And also, it took me a while to get into Carson's writing style, which is a bit unique- for instance, there were times when her sentence structure was kind of backwards. I'm not sure if this is because that's how they spoke in the 40's, or if it's McCullers's dialect. I will say that this book did have some very poetic thoughts and prose. There were several profound things, and it made the reading all the more worthwhile.I do recommend this book for reading- just with the warning that part 1 is slow going, but if you make it that far, you'll be rewarded in part 2 &amp; 3. I don't want to give anything away about this story, so I'll leave it there."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book over one year ago- and I still cannot get the characters out of my head. McCullers succeeds in depicting people whose basic loneliness is something that the modern day reader can relate to on every level. The main character is a deaf mute, and this reflects the plight that all of us feel at one time or other- when our truest emotions cannot be felt or understood by those most dear to us. Her writing is simple, but profound. I am absolutely hooked on Carson McCullers, and have gone on to read every one of her works. This is American literature at its best!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I was a freshman in college when I first discovered this book -- a paperback with a beautiful cover -- and was at once caught up in its marvelously realized world of all too human characters. Like McCullers' other masterpiece, The Member of the Wedding, this is a heartbreaking book, reflecting great sadness in its tender portrait of the ordinary people of an ordinary town, and the sweet, generous aspirations of a lone girl who wants so badly to embrace life and to make a difference. McCullers left us only a few books, but what an influence she had on my life and so many many others. She was the image of young genius, yet so incredibly wise. Her short story &quot;A Tree, A Rock, A Cloud,&quot; is unforgettable. Hers is an authentic Southern Gothic voice, yet always beautifully restrained, and unfailingly compassionate."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a brilliant novel set in a Georgia milltown during the Great Depression.Four people,struggling with their own identities, confide in a deaf mute. Dr. Copeland is a black physician suffering from TB who is estranged from his own family by his passionate devotion to protecting the rights of his race; Jake Blount, an alcoholic and border-line psychotic, who is tormented by his radical ideas of the rights of the working class, Biff Brannon a restaurant owner who is trying to come to terms with his own feelings following the death of his wife; and Mick Kelly, a sensitive teenage girl and daughter of the family who own the boarding house where the mute lives, .The four feel a special kinship to the mute, Mr. Singer, because of the sensitivity that each one must sense in him. Singer listens to their stories and asks them questions yet he gives little advice. Singer himself is a depressed by the decline, both physically and mentally, and institutionalization of his constant companion, another deaf mute, whose fate ultimately has a profound affect on Singer and his four confidants.The book deals subtly with several different social issues-racial strife in the South, a teenage girl coming to terms with her emerging sexuality, labor unrest, and the effect of the Great Depression on the middle class."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"One critisism of this book states that it might not be ideal high school reading. I am a junior in high school. This book is a discription of loneliness and disappointment, which I believe young people understand but do not wish to accept. It is a staggering blow to idealism. Nevertheless, it is very well written and I cannot fault its honesty."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a book which I felt was unjustly slammed by many of the high school reviewers on this web site, so I tried as much as possible to justify a 5 star rating but could not. Again, this is a book which I might not be inclined to recommend for high school reading since its description of dreams lost and disillusionment is something which may not relate well to younger readers. The prose is sometimes weak and the ending is a basic shrug towards life with the lesson of &quot;life goes on&quot;. In this regard, McCullers disappoints and makes no effort to reward the reader's concern for her characters."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Over the past many years I have read this little book several times. To me &quot;Heart&quot; is a national treasure and it racks my soul to see people giving it a bad review. Taken simply, as it was written, this story profiles a point in time in the rural South just as America was resurrecting from the ashes of the Great Depression and about to plunge into World War II. If you recall this was a very difficult era but to me this book is a thought provoking slice of time representative of the era it evokes. You cannot argue that &quot;heart&quot; is not poignantly written with a great simplicity of words and spare elegance of style.I grew up in the South in the mid-forties and this is exactly how things were: rural, secular and introspective. We did not have the exposure to mass media that we do today. We all toiled, laughed and suffered on a smaller plane of reality.Grow up and then read the book again when no one is forcing you to read it. You will then appreciate fine writing."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Not many writers are able to at his/her early twenties to have such a exquisite view of the world and complex subjects as Carson McCullers displays in her beautiful \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\". Maybe the fact that she was a sort of precocious genius she wrote the book helped her to sharp her senses to create a world apart inhabited by ordinary people, just trying to live their ordinary lives.Her condition of being young also influenced her in the novel. As most young people, she didn't have many life experiences yet; therefore much of her inspiration comes from her own life and the people she knew. Her father was a jeweler, like Mick's father. She also studied piano -- and this is one of Mick's dreams. Moreover, Mick's coming of age has a lot in common with Carson's. She started working on this book when she was at the university and her idea was to make a novel about five isolated people, in which the narrative's structure would be inspired by a fugue (a musical composition featuring several repeating themes).In the first part, she introduces the characters, the settings and the main thematic, which deals with of \\"man's revolt against his own inner isolation and his urge to express himself as fully as possible\\". Her main man in this case is the deaf-mute John Singer. The second part is the failure of each character, due to his options (and lack of them) and free will. The third part shows the faith of each character, and what they made of their lives after they met Singer.Unquestionably the main theme is the isolation and the alienation of the human being. Each character -- even the supporting ones -- tries to break out their condition. The isolation is the result of the combination of personal and environmental factors. In this process, Singer -- who has the most difficult to communicate -- plays a key role to help each of the four main characters to find their own voice. He represents the hope throughout the whole narrative.Carson has a hand to deal with the lost dream. Everyone in this novel cannot fulfill his/her dreams. The girl Mick, for instance, is too smart for her family, for her town; therefore she has to suffocate her talents and become an ordinary person. But, in her mind, she can keep the flame of her dream of becoming a musician alive.Carson deals beautiful with language and character development. From the beginning one can notice that this is a writers who dominates her tool -- and not the other way round. Every character has his/her own motivations and these people change throughout the narrative. Because of it, \\"The heart is a lonely hunter\\" is a complex slice of life. More than a book, this novel X-rays ordinary lives and expose them, bringing us a little bit of hope to diminish our own sadness."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Not sure what the other reviewers read, But, I found THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER to be an exquisitly written novel. It is classy, brilliantly written and holds your attention.

She sets up the lover/beloved relationship. It is this relationship between lover and beloved that motivates all the characters in &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter.&quot; Each Character feels another character &quot;gets&quot; him. That they understand. Mick treats the mute, Singer, as her own personal God. Biff secretly loves Mick. All of these relationships can not adequately be understood without reading &quot;Ballad of the Sad Cafe.&quot; It might be that Carson McCullers didn't fully understand her view of love when she wrote this novel. She was, after all, only 23. But when you combine &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; with &quot;Ballad&quot; it creates an undeniably accurate portriat of what love really is. McCuller's tell us that love does not always fit within the framework of society. Love does not always come in traditional forms. Her view of love may be pessimistic. She may feel that love always ends in sorrow but, at least I feel, she gets to the essence of what love is.When you walk away from &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; what will most strike you are the characters. Most likely you will see yourself or people in your life portrayed in the novel. That is the novel's strength. The characters may be freaks but they are huantingly similar to yourself.Most criticism you will see levied agaisnt McCullers is that she ends with such a horrible view of the world. But, trust me, if you look hard enough you will find a more optimistic ending. It may take some digging but McCullers does end the &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, not happily but with some optimism. I would tell you how it is optimistic but then I would give away the ending."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Four principal characters pursue their dreams consumed with frustration that they can't achieve them. Mick Kelly is a 12-year-old musician who can't play anything but a radio. Biff Brannon is an impotent romantic. Jake Blount is a revolutionary who can't lead. Mady Copeland is a civil rights leader who can't convince his own people to follow him.All four of them find some comfort in sharing their dreams with John Singer, a deaf-mute, who befriends all of them between summer 1938 and summer 1939. They only imagine that Mr. Singer understands them, of course; although he's a good enough lip reader to pick up some of what they tell him, on the whole all he does is nod and smile. The depressing thought is that maybe that's as good as it gets - for any of us. Anyway, with his death (though not as a direct result), the dreams of his friends all collapse.People have complained that \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" fails to offer any solutions to the problems it portrays, but sometimes a book doesn't need to offer an answer. This work reminded me somewhat of \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" in that respect. The characters are beautifully detailed, their problems range from comical to desperate, but there are ultimately no solutions. Both books excel making their world very real, and the problems of the protagonists become your problems too.There are no answers here, as there are none in \\"Grapes of Wrath,\\" but sometimes it's enough just to outline the problem clearly. And one can take some comfort in the fact that our world is much improved over the one McCullers depicts, so there is hope.On a side note, the modern reader is constantly surprised how little concern for safety they had in the 1930s. Giving the baby a hard candy to quiet him down - or giving him a \\"good shake.\\" Letting a 7-year-old play with a rifle. Or letting a 12-year-old watch an infant unsupervised. Another surprise is that the injustice of Jim Crow figures so prominently in a pre-World War II book; I had assumed the Civil Rights movement dated from after the war."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"There is much to be said about this book and all of it good. The characters within the pages are memorable and demonstrate the old saying that \\"everyone is their own world\\". In the heart of the tale is focus on the solitude that exists in some lives. Additional points to ponder are racial justice through the eyes of a black physician that must wage his own fight after having his son jailed and misunderstanding as the various characters talk to a man that is unable to speak in John Singer. They assume that he is deeply concern without ever really giving thought to the truth of his quite sessions of listening to them going on and on about their injustices. Overall, the characters are seeking to air their discontent with the world while attempting to grasp the reality that has been dealt them. A very good book and one that I would highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Jesse Wright, amateur reviewerI can totally understand why this is an 'Oprah Pick'. It is a magnificent piece of work, masterfully written (though it was originally published in the '40's). I applaud this pick as a hard to put down wonderfully written book.It is a wonderful memoir and very memorable in the prolific pages. I rank it up there with \\"Nightmares Echo\\", \\"Running With Scissors\\" and \\"A Child Called It\\" for it's integrity to the story.Thank you Oprah!!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"In the 307 pages of this story there is not a single ray of hope or happiness, not one morsel of humor, but only the most extreme isolation and despair. So, why read it? Because it's a superb example of technical mastery of the writer's craft, and a penetrating study of the human condition a la Dostoevsky.Labelling The Heart is a Lonely Hunter \\"a Southern novel\\" may be accurate by virtue of its setting, but it is certainly not adequate. The story could have been set almost anywhere, with minor textual changes, and it would have been just as applicable and powerful. Furthermore, the story has historical merit, delving into youthful perceptions of pre-WWII geo-politics, domestic politics, and exploring a few sexual subjects that were taboo in the author's day.Don't read this story to find direct answers for the human condition. This is not a book of \\"what to do,\\" but rather of \\"what not to do.\\" Also, this is not an appropriate story for younger readers or those presently on a regimen of prescription antidepressants.Guardedly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"McCullers' \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" was such an amazing reading experience.

McCuller just did such an incredible job with character development. It's as if she knew all these people personally. I definitely recommend this to anyone that is into heavy thinking."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel -- astonishing in its power, being Carson McCuller's first -- has justly come to be considered to be a classic of modern American literature. McCullers' creative prowess is breathtaking -- she has brought to life the 1930s American South, in a non-judgemental, gently-written yet cinematically focused style of prose that has few equals. Her characters spring to life with all of their beauty and warts intact, all of their despair and hope, all of their love and hate, all of their joy and pain and anger. The prejudice that existed (and, unfortunately, still exists in many places and hearts) -- against blacks, the poor, the uneducated, the politically radical -- is laid out before the reader in such a way as to allow us to make up our own minds about it.Each of the characters in this wonderful novel seems to inhabit their own private pocket of loneliness. There are those who dare to hope and dream -- chief among them the unforgettable Mick Kelly -- and they keep a tight rein on these hopes. McCullers brings this point home well on p. 199: '...by habit they shortened their thoughts so that they would not wander out into the darkness beyond tomorrow.'The story evolves into a languidly expanding, yet unstoppable diaspora of desperate, lonely people -- all of whom seem to have at least part of their hopes for life focused on Singer, the mute who is at the center of this work. The musical metaphors McCullers employs in Mick's life are brilliant in themselves -- but there are many brilliant things about this work, it is filled with them.McCullers is a great example of a talented artist whose life was much too short -- but she has left us with an astounding body of work of the highest quality."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I was most amazed by how much such a young writer (22 or 23 when she wrote this book) knew about human nature and life in general.McCullers' writing draws the reader into the intimate lives of her characters. She takes us in to their most personal thoughts and meditations, while still leaving the reader to make up his or her mind if a character &quot;is&quot; or &quot;is not.&quot; Are they or aren't they? Will they or won't they? The reader must keep turning the pages to find out.A fascinating read.It's a long time since I've read such an intriguing story. When I finished &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,&quot; I immediately went to the computer to see what other books McCullers wrote. I wanted more."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is about friendship and loyalty. One needs to approah it cautiously lest all we see in it are the hopelessly confused lives of all characters. And yet, within this confusion, and despite it, Singer, the deaf-mute clock repairer seems happy. His secret attracts everybody -- from the young girl gorwing up with dreams of becoming a composer (never to be realized), to the old black doctor -- they all are enchanted by his neatness and serenity, by his ability to ignore the depressing, hopeless reality all around and live, it seems, in an enchanted world of his own. Almost unconsciously, they seek his company, as if to learn from a master. And all the while, Singer's secret is as profound as it is simple -- he has a good friend, the other deaf-mute in the town. The two initially live together, but then Singer's friend is sent to a mental asylum. Singer's initial panic and agony are soon replaced by patience and purposefulness -- every once in a while he visits his friend and takes gifts to him. For both of them, each other is all they have -- in a world of speech where noone can understand them, in a world so drab and rusty it seems time itself has stopped, Singer has a friend. And this makes him open-hearted and loving to everyone else. In world where people have so little goodness to spare for each other, where people often hurt their loved ones, Singer is almost like a saintly figure, his kindness making the lives of everyone else just that much more bearable. And when his friend dies, Singer finds that his life has become meaningless. His suicide shocks everyone and leaves them hurt, and disillusioned. MuCullers manages to convey extremely well the hopelessness of the small town. High ideals and higher purposes -- whether socialism or black civil rights -- seem doomed. People are unable to communicate with each other, and each suffers alone in a horribly confused and constrained little world of their own. The only thing that makes sense is not some higher goal but the closeness of another human being. The only thing that makes life bearable, makes it worth living, is friendship and love. When that is gone, the rest scatters like so much dust in the wind."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm only in 8th grade, and I love this book.

The cast of characters in &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; will stay with me forever."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I don't wish to be harsh in my criticism of this fine novel. It is a sweet, rather warm and intimite book where we focus mostly on the internal dialogue of numerous characters brooding. This in itself tells us we are on an exploration of human emotion, as well as the thoughts, dreams, fantasies and excuses people tell themselves while contemplating their lives. It is an honest story told with a passion so earnest you almost can't help but smile at the cute little girl who wrote such a pretty little story . . .The writing is quite good in spots, adequete elsewhere and sometimes frequently awkward and uncertain. One gleans that the author lacked confidence in her writing at times and overwhelms this lingering doubt with the repeated anxieties of everyone trying to bust out over the course of the novel. This makes the book sometimes droning and dull, filled with gentle critque followed by panicked apologies.Nevertheless it is a worthwhile read, a clear and blue-skied window into the heart of someone who can turn pain into sympathy right before your eyes."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The beauty of Carson McCullers' first novel is it honestly depicts the deep south of her time. It shows both the romantic aspects and the ugliness (racism, in particular), while telling the stories of a group of memorable characters, centered around a gentle deaf-mute at a boardinghouse. McCullers finds a middle-ground, giving us the flavor of this small southern town, both sweet and sour. This book is one of my favorites of all time."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I encountered this book in the 9th grade while reading it with my teacher as a class asssignment. And even now, as I prepare myself for college, I often find my mind wander back to the story of this impelling novel. The lives of the characters created in this book entwine so gracefully that one can't help but love it. Granted some who read it may find it somewhat overdramatic and analytical, but if they would only take a step back and look at the whole picture, I'm sure that they'd find that there is a reason behind all of her &quot;maddness.&quot; So for those who dislike the book, take a look at how the woman explains herself- &quot;Love, and especially love of a person who is incapable of returning, or receiving it, is at the heart of my selection of grotesque figures to write about--people whose physical incapacity is a symbol of their spiritual incapacity to love or to receive love--their sprirtual isolation.&quot;-Carson McCullers"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"When I first read this book, I was still in my teens and had seen the movie starring Alan Arkin and Sondra Locke. It was a very moving story then, but I reacted to the emotions of the young girl primarily. When I read the book again at forty-something, I was able to see how every character viewed the mute as their sounding board, as someone who understood them when no one else did. He didn't understand any of them, and thought of his Greek friend in the way that the others thought of him. When he lost his friend, he couldn't face life alone. I loved this book and began reading Carson McCuller's books then. Still one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel deals with everyday situations, things that are not out of this world. The average reader reads for pleasure, but this novel is one that instead of pleasure inspires realism to the maximum extent. We can perceive the problems of adolescence in Mick Kelly, a young girl which is given responsibilities not her age, like taking care of her younger brothers. Also, she wants to fit in to a group and doesn't seem to accomplish that, because she is always dreaming and phantasizing about the things she would do, but obviously can't. Jake Blount wants to make people understand the importance of fighting for their rights in the society they are living, but people do not pay attention to him because they rather assimilate the situation and live with it. Dr. Copeland always had a communication problem with his family, for he wanted to make them understand and achieve what he called their &quot;true purpose&quot;. But that true purpose was the purpose he chose for his children. This attitude led his children to back off him and blocked communication. John Singer was traumatized since the time he tried to talk and people would stare at him oddly. This made him feel different and started to have deaf-mute friends, which only for their disability, were totally different from him. Summing up, this novel deals with alienation in its various forms: disability, lack of communication, different outlooks on life, adolescence and the changes it comprises. Whoever wants to take a journey into man's deepest thoughts should read this book as soon as possible."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers showed unusual maturity when she wrote The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter at age 23. McCullers drives home the deep necessity within all human beings to be understood by another human being. She illustrates poignantly, the lengths people go to, within their own minds, to find this deep understanding from another.McCullers deals extensively with passion, suggesting we live in a society that systematically wrings peoples' passions out of their lives.Unfortunately, the excellent thematic depth is couched inside a writing sytle that regularly becomes tedious. The book has much discussable material for a book group and would be appropriate for a group willing to patiently wade through the repetitive nature of the book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a strange book. It is classic Southern Gothic, and it is with a heavy heart that you read on, page after page.The story takes place around the beginnings of World War II in a small Georgia town. The main characters are the deaf mute Mr. Singer, and the four people who all befriends him, because in him they have found a person who will listen to them.There is the young girl Mick, who has so much music in her head and who dreams of writing a symphony and move to a place where it snows. There is the caf&eacute;-owner Biff, whose wife recently died and left him alone with the caf&eacute; and his thoughts and newspapers. And there is the leftwing activist Jake Blount and the black doctor mr. Benedict. All four of them visits Mr. Singer, and tells him about their thoughts and dreams. Whatever Mr. Singer thinks about them, we are never told. Mr. Singer only dreams of his sick friend, who was taken away from him and put in a home.There is no real plot in this story, and it moves slowly along. It is even boring at some points, but on every page you can feel the loneliness and some of the despair the characters feel, and that makes this story hard to forget."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Beautiful story, very fast and emotional. I feel it will stay with me forever. Makes me happy just to have read it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Deeply moving story, unsettling and yet heroic as well. Recommended for anyone who loves a great book that will stay with you for years."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"&quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; didn't move me in any way, but I can acknowledge the allure it seems to exercise on many people. Carson McCullers' prose is a bit airless for me. There is a certain beauty to be had in simple, precise language, but sometimes authors abuse that quality until their writing becomes characterless, which is how I feel about McCullers. I wasn't struck by any of her images or turns of phrase. I felt the nature of the story deserved a more poetic writing style than McCullers uses.That said, the book does have a certain impact based on the story alone. While reading it, I was only moderately involved, but the book lingered in my mind for a long time afterward, and even now I get a very distinct feeling when I think about it, which is not true of everything I read.Definitely worth reading, but not one of my personal favorites."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"If your taste is in espionage novels, this one's not for you. I suppose McCuller's intention was not to excite (by providing thrills or chills), but to provide a meaningful context for characters who find meaningless and absurdity in life. It's a psychological novel. If you find the narrative depressing, I suggest rather than hide behind such feelings by avoiding the unknown (as the characters in the novel seem to do), you should objectify your subjectivity and read up on some existential philosophy--the inspiration for this kind of literature."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"McCullers has an insight into person psychology that allows her to create great characters that everyone can relate to. This is my third time reading this book. It is a great piece of work, and beautifully written. It is a superb memoir, and the author's style is impressive. The characters are as rich as any who have ever been imagined, and the story is just breathtaking. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"At first I didn't know what to think when I finished this book. It was such a page turner and the end was like a train wreck for all of the characters. I almost felt like it was without hope. When I thought about it further, though, I reconsidered. The characters in the story don't emerge unscathed or exalted from tragic or mundane circumstances, but neither to most of us in the real world. It would have been great if Mick had been able to become a composer like she wanted, but don't most people who dream of greatness ultimately end up somewhere in between. That doesn't make life or people less valuable. The interesting characters were not at all what they appeared to be on the surface. Reading about them made the book worth reading."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I first remember reading this book in high school and ever since then, it has become one of my favorite books. Perhaps it Was because I was in high school -- a most vulnerable and lonely time for some teenagers -- that this book moved me.Carson McCullers writes about the lonely lives in a small southern town. Whether through an awkward girl, a drunk, a sexually confused man, or a deaf mute, Ms. McCullers manages to convey the loneliness and beauty of these characters. I have never read a book that spoke so distinctly about those feelings we always feel, but can never put into words. This, along with the Catcher in the Rye by JD Salinger, Tell Me that You Love Me, Junie Moon by Majorie Kellog, and McCullers' Member of the Wedding, is one of those rare books that speaks to the human condition, that puts into words all those strange feelings you could never quite articulate. A truly beautiful, sensitive, and poetic book. Read it!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a book about a deaf mute who moves to a boarding house in the south and changes the lives of people around him. Ms. McCullers was a communist during the time she wrote this book and you can really see the influence of her ideology throughout the book.The story is very sad, with a sad ending, but dont let that stop you from reading this great book. All the characters come alive and I feel the reader can relate to each ones lives. The saddest part is that no one could hear the deaf mute (Mr. Singer) in his lonliness, and in essence I feel he was being unwittingly used by the town people.If you have seen the movie, dont let that stop you, the book is ENTIRELY different from the movie, at least what I saw of it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"One would expect a woman of 23 years not to have had enough experience to already know the pains and joys of life so well. Carson Mccullers allows you to feel her characters joy, bordem, anger and sorrow so deeply, that you almost forget they are not real people. The meat of this story is not the plot, but the storm of human emotions pouring out of her characters. We as readers identify with the knowledge that life is hard, and hope and laughter are what help us to continue living."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is certainly worth reading, but it is limited in that it covers a particular place and time (the U.S. South in the years just before WW II) and presents stereotypical and unrealistic characters and situations. There is no sense of hope and no recognition that the South and political and social situations will change.The story centers around a set of characters. Two, Singer and Antonapoulos, are deaf mutes but opposite in character. Antonapoulos is self centered and greedy, while Singer is attentive to the needs of others. Why Singer has such a strong feeling for his friend is hard to see. Dr. Copeland, a \\"Negro\\" medical doctor and his family make up another stereotype. The doctor is well educated and speaks in perfect English, but his family members are all poorly educated and use poor English. It is hard to believe that such a situation would occur. Moreover Dr. Copeland is an advocate for the advancement of his race, another stereotype. Mick Kelly and her family make up another group of characters. Mick is 12 at the start of the book but is wise beyond her years. She acts, however, in strange ways. Biff Brannon is the owner of a cafe and also has some strange behaviors. For one he becomes attracted to Mick in an unhealthy way after the death of his wife, but in the end nothing comes of it. Finally, there is Jack Blount, a radical communist who is constantly drunk.A series of negative events occur in the book and then it comes to an inconclusive end. It is worth reading as a period piece and for the characterization, but it is not a lasting piece of literature."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book for a book club. No doubt Carson McCullers was a talented writer as this book certainly stirred plenty of discussion. I found it no pleasure to read. Very depressing. All of the characters were with out any hope. The book ended with no light at the end of the tunnel. No redeeming faith. This book reminded me of Ecclesiastes. Everything under the sun is meaningless. Everything is vanity. Only God can bring meaning to a life. None of these characters ever find that hope. It's no wonder that later in life Carson McCullers attempted suicide."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The book is nothing like the movie, which for once was much better than the book. The movie was outstanding."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The book was downloaded quickly and was an enjoyable read. Great amazon experience! Will definitely down load more books onto my kindle."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"McCullers writing is both Southern Gothic and Existential. In the Southern Gothic tradition of Faulkner, her characters are both larger than life and grotesque. Many of them exist on the seamier side of the tracks. She shows us the dark side of the South. There is the loner, alcoholic that ends up as a carnie. There is the restaurant owner who is bitter and lonely. We also meet the old black doctor that while dedicating his life helping less fortunate in his oppressed community is so filled with bitterness and hatefulness that he can't bring himself to reconcile with his son. The son is an activist that feels his father has sold out to the white man. We also meet Mitch a young girl oppressed by her parent's poverty trying to find her way in the world. This book is an unbelievably rich reading experience -- one that should not be missed. I Recommend this book with all my heart. Other titles I enjoyed: As I Lay Dying by Faulkner, The Losers' Club by Richard Perez"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It seems that most of the negative reviews listed here are from young readers. It's unfortunate that this book is assigned to students too young to appreciate and understand it. This book was required summer reading prior to my entry into Jr. High School and I really didn't think much of it at the time. Many years later, with some life experience under my belt, I reread this novel and found so many things that were not evident to me as a 12 yr old forced to read it for school. So - to all of you young readers (and teachers) - it's too bad you're forced to read stuff before you're old enough to appreciate it - try to keep an open mind and don't be turned off to some the classic of literature."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'll admit that this book was interesting, but I didn't know where the author was going with it. I had to read this book for English so I could write a speech about it on whether or not it's a classic. I don't know what I will write since I really don't know what it's themes are. I could not relate to the characters very much. I don't know anyone like these people! What I saw were a bunch of losers who had their problems, but they didn't didn't try to help themselves! Mr. Singer was the most promising character in the book, but he killed himself! I was very disappointed! I guess this book made me realize that I have little problems in comparison to them. Don't read this book unless you are an expert on finding themes!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book because my friend told me that reading it completely changed her life. Of course, she says that about every book she likes, but even so, I was curious. For starters, the book is NOT easy to understand. And it IS boring at times. The narrative skips from person to person, which can be confusing, but is actually good since it gives you the chance to see the same events from five different points of view. The characters are John Singer, a deaf mute, Mick, a teenage girl, Biff Brannon, a restaurant owner, Dr. Copeland, a black doctor, and Jake Blount, a drunken radical. The story takes place in a little southern town in the 1930's. These characters are not all friends. In a lesser novel they would be. But in this book, they hardly know each other. But they share two important things in common--they all are lonely outcasts, and they all confide in John Singer. However, even though they all spend so much time with John Singer, they no absolutely nothing about his personal life. And even though John Singer spends so much time listening to them, sometimes he doesn't understand what they're talking about.... It's also true to life in that the characters all have so much in common, yet they never really connect."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm a college freshman, and this past summer I decided I was going to read as many 'classics' as I could possibly handle. Instead, I decided to read everything by McCullers that I could get my hands on, and was really disappointed by this book. The Member of the Wedding seemed so much more complete and real to me than Hunter did. I just really wanted this book to be some grand eye-opening experience and it didn't turn out that way. I think McCullers tried to go into detail with too many characters and found this book to focus around John Singer, the deaf-mute, a lot more than Mick Kelly, the supposed heroine of the novel. Also, I read Hunter right after the Ballad of the Sad Cafe, and all these similar female leads started to run together for me. To the readers that found Hunter similar to To Kill A Mockingbird, I see your point stylistically, but that book was much more deep and emotional than Hunter. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with this novel, although the title is perhaps my favorite ever..."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I find this book boring. I've had it for a month and can't bring myself to pick it up any more."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"While the book is well written I have had a whale of a time getting through it. It has taken me three weeks to get past the second part. I get the premise of what she is writing about, I just find it to be terribly and overwhelmingly depressing. Tell me it gets better."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I had to read this entire book, 357 pages in all, in one weekend for a college class just recently. After reading for close to 14 hours straight I had finished and was sorely dissapointed with the impression I had recieved from the novel.First off, if you enjoy compelling or believable characters then this isn't for you. THe black doctor is typecasted to the point that he names his son Karl Marx. His sadness appears contrived and the relationships with his family are stupidly played out. And his speech on Christmas Day about Marx just doesn't work. The other characters are pretty pathetic as well. More pages are wasted telling us about how the main character Mick feels than us actually being shown that she is changing and growing. The deaf-mute, Singer, is plain boring.And nothing happens. A girl is shot, Mick loses her virginity, another character loses his legs. But even as McCullers introduces action, she resolves it and pushes it out of the way of the rest of the story, her incessant and boring as hell character study.The story ends by re-examining each of the characters a final time, and has found that they are all still lonely, and all still pathetic. And instead of a healthy conclusion, she ends on Biff, the most stagnant and unrealistic character in the entire novel, whose femininity might be unmatched by any other character.Don't waste your time reading this overwrought novel. Beyond all the issues with it being boring, the writing is just plain sentimental, trite, and nice. It's obvious that a 23 year old women developed each and every one of these characters."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The American south amazingly resembles Wales in producing an astonishingly great number of writers from an unpopulated source. Urban readers flock to read the works provided by these often small town writers. Carson McCullers is one more great southern small town writer. This is where: To Kill a Mockingbird meets Faulkner; The Secret Life of Bees meets Fitzgerald.In the small Georgia setting in pre-war times, McCullers has blacks converse with whites which include Jews. One black character is named Karl Marx, a white character espouses Marxism, and the tony town politely or cordially embraces each. Everyone works with one another in accommodating others on their bills, providing services when required and being good neighbors even when times are hard. But, amid the seemingly \\"socialistic-like\\" existence of everyday life in the small town belies an uncontrollable hatred or anger which can ignite with the slightest spark.This book starts out calmly. Then an injustice is shown as the best friend of Mr. Singer - a deaf mute who everyone adores - is evicted to a sanitarium because his cousin cannot be bothered with his eccentricities. The book returns to the town's mellow character, and another injustice occurs. Before the end, numerous murders, racial injustice by prison guards, a public beating by the sheriff of a black doctor, and a suicide ruin the wonder of the seemingly sane existence of the town.The dialogue is wonderful. Amazingly so. And, to have been written by a 23-year old, it is almost unbelievable. For the dialogue alone, this book is worth reading"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Sixtyfive years after its publication, Carson McCullers' first novel clearly deserves the label of classic literature. The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is primarily a novel of voice and characterization, and Ms. McCullers demonstrates virtuosity and originality in both. The ensemble of characters is amazingly diverse, with no hint of stereotyping. The evocation of southern life in the thirties is convincing and surprisingly insightful.Unfortunately, the book fails to achieve its goal of portraying the tragic gulf that separates people who need each other. It fails because Ms. McCullers' characters don't speak to themselves. They act, react, feel, and struggle. But we are left with the impression that the town is inhabited by idiots savant who (with the exception of a listless restaurant owner whose observations pile up like a stack of old newspapers) are incapable of reflecting on their own thoughts and feelings. It is obvious that people who won't try to know themselves cannot expect to be recognized by others. Thus the characters' various failures are not tragic, but merely pathetic."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"An old black man going senile and dying who was born twenty years too early, a suicidal and savior-like deaf mute, a violent drunk carnie Fascist, a caf&eacute; owner who could be a pedophile and is turning into a transvestite after the death of his wife, and a little girl with too much stress destined to be a drunk. Actually, that sounds quite interesting. When told by Carson McCullers, it is not. I do understand it is a great work. Yes, it is famous and well written and reveals a lot about the human condition. I know all that. I just don't like it. I could relate to the characters, but not enough to care or really get involved. I can see where this could be one of those books I hate, but in discussion I get to like it more, just because of what is talked about. But that's not going to be enough to ever make me want to pick up this book again. Over three hundred pages and I was bored almost the whole time. I did like it when people started getting shot because I thought, \\"Finally, something's going to happen.\\" Then nothing did except more talking about how painful life was and how justice needs to be served now and how it's not going to and what common thread links us all, we can't figure it out, boo hoo, life is miserable. Oh, and that stunning second to last paragraph where the entire theme of the novel is bluntly stated by one of the characters. It was one of the only points that was actually interesting to read. But, come on! Carson, if you wanted subtlety, you just blew it, and if you didn't want subtlety, then why the hell did you ramble on for three hundred and seven pages?!

That purpose being to sit on your shelf and make it appear as though you are some kind of eruditic masochist.If, like me, you were forced to read this book as some sophomore hazing ritual, you will no doubt remember that this book contains very little in the way of plot and character development. The characters don't so much grow as fester.I would not recommend this book to anybody, even those that I hate.

After about 150 pages, I realized that the point of the novel was just observation, and thinking. McCullers had a few good points, some interesting ideas, but they never went anywhere. It was well written, but I had to force myself to finish it, just so it would not have been a waste of money. Not a bad read if you are just looking for something, but it you want an absorbing page-turner, this is not the book for you."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The return for the time invested in reading this book was a big nothing - I regret picking it up.

The characters in this novel will haunt you. Her prose is spare and lyrical. Describing the desperate lives of the townspeople during the coldest winter in memory: \\"The people dreamed and fought and slept as much as ever.

I did feel it elaborated too much, but for the most part it was an engaging moving read."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter and The Mortgaged Heart.I am reviewing these two books together not only because I read them sequentially, but because the two works, in spite of their being her first and last published works, compliment each other so very tightly. Although I had read a couple of her books soon after my college years, I'm so glad that the reading of these two came after decades of life's searching and adapting as well as reading far and wide: I don't think I was ready until now to discover and grasp McCullers' uncanny insight and empathy.The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is - on the surface - about five misfits of society: a deaf mute, a twelve year old girl, an old, broken doctor who is black, a dipsomaniac labor organizer, and finally, an introverted restaurant and bar owner - characters that live, think and feel, trying to make the best of their respective situations in a southern town in the late years of the Great Depression, striving to find an identity from their islands of loneliness.The Mortgaged Heart is an anthology of early and late stories, essays and poetry collected by her sister and published after the author's death at age fifty in 1967 after a long illness. When I finished Lonely Hunter and my jaw was still dragging on the ground, so to speak, in amazement, I wanted to try her earliest stories to see where and when she matured into a talent with such age-old wisdom. She was a Mozart right from her teenage start! This volume contains a twenty-seven page outline called The Mute she prepared for the Lonely Hunter. Step by step she set down characters and sub-characters of her novel to come. And she was what - barely twenty years old!The character Mick, a twelve year old girl, independent and full of life, is enthralled with music at a time when having a radio was a rarity, loving it all, but especially classical, one night she listens hidden in bushes a couple of streets over outside an open living room window to the third symphony of Beethoven and is so excited she can't sleep that night. \\"Wonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be. The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.\\"The mute, Mr. Singer, caring, dignified, always pleasant but always silent becomes through no effort of his own, the center for the other four main characters, each individually, almost without being aware of the others. His warm smile gives them the ear - albeit unhearing - that they each so sorely need for their passionate frustrations, or in Mick's case, just a place to hang and listen to the radio, which had ironically been a gift to the mute.That McCullers had a savvy mind and felt deeply about social issues is evident from reading her. But one might miss the depth of her feelings if just focused on the story line. Dr. Copland, sick and nearly used up, talks to Jake Blount the argumentative labor organizer who is drinking and listening to him and who in turn answers the doctor about class struggle and the stranglehold of money and power, each barely hearing the other until finally they recognize, so slowly, that they are agreeing. What ideas swim about them calling in the philosophies of Buddha, Christ, Karl Marx, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. - expressions for a mass march on Washington by blacks - decades before the world has heard of MLK or before such a march actually happened.But as the title implies, this book is about more than economic systems and social justice; it radiates about each individual's struggle to relate and understand humanity.As I have thought about Lonely Hunter and Mortgaged Heart my eyes have returned again and again to the picture of Carson McCullers on the dustcover of the latter: a dainty person with a round innocent face barely older than a child; someone we can readily imagine being tucked in bed every night with dolls and kittens. Is it some sort of chauvinism that makes me wonder how such a private southern-bell child could arrange words and thoughts with such wallop that more than once, in a single sentence, over years and across generations, I have been reduced to tears?Many of the stories (other than The Mute, already discussed) could well have been chapters in Lonely Hunter; a few others are about the restlessness of the gathering storm in Europe, plus some tantalizing essays on writers and writing. Nearly two years before the United States entered the war as a result of Pearl Harbor, Carson talks about the profound sadness of a young man and his girlfriend as they pack his books - books now of a generation gone by: Hemingway, Cummings, Joyce - into boxes placed against the wall of the bare room - sad, but having prevailed from the agony of reconciling their Peace protests - their seeing the coming mayhem as clearly as Winston Churchill - the agony being their final choice: War - or Fascism? In the end, the only choice - war - packing their books away to enlist and suffer what must be done.If any book ever deserved winning the Pulitzer Prize it should have been The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, this, one of the great works of American literature. It received widespread enthusiastic acclaim. The fact that the Pulitzer Committee chose to withhold any award for fiction in 1941 suggests to me a hung jury, and although I can find no information specifically relating to their \\"no award\\" decision, I surmise that some on the committee may have felt she was too young or that the previous year's award to John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath was enough pandering to progressive views.The Grapes of Wrath better documents the hardships of the Great Depression, but Carson McCullers tells more than a historical event, more than a voice of a generation, more than the heart throb of a region or agonizing young country, but the soul in that young woman's body which I can easily believe had seen eons of reincarnation and which speaks to me like no other author, articulates with precision, penetration and passion as well as something more - the insight of a prognosticator."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is a well written detail oriented look at the south as pertains to a deaf mute and his mentally disabled mute friend. It is a book that will choke you up, and keep you hooked. I like to read a book and finish it feeling changed in some way, and this book changes you. There are deep rants concenring communism, or the basic ideals of communism, which in theory are beautiful. Human nature robs communistic ideals of their beauty. The charachters in this book are very strong and interesting, and the way they are all drawn to the mute Mr. Singer, shows that we all want to be listened to. This is a great book that I feel every single person should read, and at the same time, I want to hide it and keep it all for myself."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"\`The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter', published in 1940 when Carson McCullers was just twenty-three, is set in a small Georgia town and tells the story of five isolated and spiritually-frustrated characters. There's Mick Kelly (based on McCullers herself), a young girl who is always writing music in her head and dreaming of travel to foreign lands. Dr. Benedict Copeland is an African-American doctor who struggles to make others of his race see the truth about their plight as he sees it. Jake Blount is a potentially violent drifter who rants about socialism and fruitlessly tries to inspire the working class to rise up and demand more from their employers. Biff Brannon is the sexually-ambiguous caf&eacute; owner who spends hours on end thinking through his muddled thoughts. And finally, there's John Singer, a deaf-mute who the other four befriend because, as an intelligent and kind man who cannot talk himself, he is a good listener.The story revolves around Singer who, more than just serving as a symbol of their mutual incomprehension through his handicap, acts as an almost God-like figure to the other four. He is to each whatever they want him to be. They all go to him to tell him of their problems as a Christian goes to church to pray. Meanwhile, all he really cares about is his friend, also a deaf-mute, who sits miles away in a hospital bed. His whole existence revolves around periodic pilgrimages to see this friend. The other four pout when he's gone, as one might when God doesn't answer a prayer. I found myself wishing they could seek solace amongst themselves, especially Copeland and Blount who shared similar views. But even when they do intersect, they are unable to fully connect. It is only Singer who can bring them solace.The characters are drawn in a mostly unsympathetic light, except for Singer and Mick who, because of what they are, could almost not be portrayed any other way but sympathetically. Brannon is just too odd; there were times I wondered if he were a pedophile. Blount is too angry to care about. I rooted for Copeland a little bit, but once he and Blount failed to reach a d&eacute;tente, I was left feeling that they weren't interested in compromising their views and thus were really just selfish people, unwilling to live in a world that didn't fit their specific ideas.McCullers's writing is a cross between the Russian realists of the 19th century and Flannery O'Connor. Like the Russians, she writes to reflect real life. Like O'Connor, she writes about the edges of society. There isn't a traditional plot: the narrative just follows their struggles with isolation and need for self-expression. McCullers has said she based the format of the book on a fugue, which explores various themes through repetition and development. Thus in place of a plot is the examination of these themes to their fullest extent, at which point the book can resolve. The themes she examines are noble themes, some timely (racism, communism), others universal (the need for self-fulfillment, the feeling of isolation from society), which makes this a worthwhile book. Others have written reviews asking why such a \`boring' book without a standard plot or happy ending would be considered a classic. It's the universal themes of the book and the beautiful prose that make it a classic. Life doesn't always end up the way we want it to, nor do the books we read."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Book came quicker than I thought. Was in the exact condition that it was advertised."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"There is a lot I could say about \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\", but I'll put it simply: everyone should read this book, which is probably one of the greatest American novels ever written. This is a profoundly beautiful and tragic work that will stay in your thoughts long after you finish reading it. Of course, like any classic you need to approach this work with an open mind and a certain amount of life experience to really appreciate this work, but I think there is something here for everyone to enjoy and be affected by.So what is this book about? The plot is very simple: a group of sad, lonely, disillusioned people share their hopes and disappointments with a compassionate deaf-mute. On a deeper level though, this book is about the struggles we all face as we go through life and try to reach our goals. It's also a profoundly insightful look at loneliness and friendship. Be warned though, McCullers' treatment of these themes is extremely bleak and it's hard to find any sort of hope or optimism as the novel draws to a close. Sometimes you're not going to be able to get what you really want, no matter how badly you want it. Sometimes the people you care about deeply are not going to feel the same way about you. Sometimes this is what life is really like, and McCullers doesn't pull any punches with her readers or delude them into believing otherwise. Ironically, this book will show you that life doesn't often turn out the way you read about in books. Despite such a grim out-look, this is poetic realism at its finest.I can't recommend this book enough, and if you didn't read it when Oprah told you to (and her taste in literature is actually not bad), then read it now!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I first read this book as a teenager and have read it again several times over the years. There is something so deeply revealing about the human condition in the book that it is as meaningful to me in my sixties and it was in my teens - I think that something is perhaps a window into the angst of the human condition. I have read all of Carson McCuller's works, including the ones out of print."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"In rebuttal to Douglas Moran's review on this website, I have to admit I am listening to \\"Lonely Hunter\\" on audio cd. I chose it because it's quite a famous book & was pretty sensational in its day (I believe the early 40's). What makes it compelling to me is Cherry Jones's reading. I am Not Southern, therefore am both amused and admiring of her wonderful rendition of all the parts. The dialogue of the poor, blacks and whites, could get tiresome (as it does in \\"Tom Sawyer), but hearing Jones read the part of Portia, for example, makes you love this character. Same goes for even the crazy Jake. You can just see him!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I lived in the town in Alabama where this book was filmed as a movie back in the late 60's and from that standpoint alone I thought the story was really good after seeing the movie.

I suppose I enjoyed it, but there is a limit to how far one can enjoy a depressing book. In the beginning, you have hope for the characters; but by the end, Carson shows how futile human existence is. Mr.singer is clearly supposed to represent Jesus, and his Greek friend some version of a Buddha. I thought it was intriging how Singer, while the vessal for redemtion and emotional relief for others, never finds his own personal haven. Even Mick, the &quot;heroine&quot; of the story leaves us with a depressed and unfufilling end of things left undone. The story is well written, and well worth the read, but is so bleak that I will probably not read it again. However, it is worthwhile to read at least once. The style is spectacular! -high school sophomore"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"What an eloquent, excellent, beautiful book. I can't say enough good things about it. When you start really getting into this book, which could take a while for some, you simply are engulfed by it, completely submerged into it's slow and subtle, sad spell.

Beautiful."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter, Carson McCuller's first published novel, is a success in the eyes of the critics and in my own. She creates a world in which the reader will become engrossed and anxious to learn more about the well-developed characters, from the heroine Mick Kelly, to the God-like John Singer, to the rugged Jake Blount, to the sad Antonapolous.

He'd have been one of those 40 million people along with the authoress, the wannabe composer, the deaf mute, the doctor etc.Who is kidding who here trying to present this old communist book as anything other than what it is?"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Having read my first Carson McCullers novel, \\"The Heart is A Lonely Hunter\\"(being, incidentally, her first as well), I cannot believe I did not manage to read her books earlier, only now, on the wave of my interest with American South. I have just discovered amazing prose in a perfectly structured novel with great characters and about things of importance. It is also hard to believe that she produced this kind of book at the age of twenty-three, because it is a work of a mature writer, insightful and deep. Unsurprisingly, the novel was a great success and gave fame to McCullers, who continued writing despite her desperately difficult life (alcoholism, bisexuality, suicidal husband, divorce, remarrying her husband who finally managed to commit suicide, numerous strokes, rheumatoid fever, breast cancer and, finally, death at fifty) and successfully become one of the most significant writers of the South.\\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" is all about characters and setting in time and space. The action takes place in a small town in Georgia, before the United States joined World War II. The central figure is John Singer, deaf and mute, who after his Greek friend's confinement to the mental hospital rents a room in the boarding house run by the Kelly family. John has a unique quality: he attracts lonely people who need to open their hearts and express their ideas. There are four such people revolving around him. Mick Kelly, the daughter of the landlords, is a teenager, who struggles with her desperate need to create music. She feels the notes, sees them and has no idea how to pour her visions of symphonies and concertos on paper, having no education, no musical instrument and no perspectives - her big family is poor, she needs to take care of the younger children and to start earning money to help her parents... Her hopes and dreams seem to be in vain, although I like to think she ended up like McCullers, managing to find the outlet for her creativity. Doctor Benedict Mady Copeland, a black physician, whose hopes for his own children's education and success in life had been shattered, and dreams of achieving the complete freedom for African-Americans remained unfulfilled despite his preaching, is sick with tuberculosis, but still goes about helping his patients, until his illness, overwhelming feeling of hopelessness and disappointment kill him. Jake Blount, a raging alcoholic, migrant worker who longs for the revolution of the working class, tries to convince people to follow the teachings of Marx, and at some point enters in a great discussion with Dr. Copeland, which shows the disparity between white working class and black community and the rift where both should be united for their success. Both Jake and Dr. Copeland get very passionate about their ideals, they can enter into ecstatic states nearing madness, just thinking and talking about their plans and visions. Finally, Biff Brannon, the owner of the New York Caf&eacute;, who is doing well in his material life and is a good, compassionate man, but feels unexpectedly lost after his wife's death and develops a gentle, secret love for Mick.Each of the four characters is drawn to Singer, they like to talk to him and feel as if they are very close; despite his deafness they sense in him the friendly soul. Singer, in fact, seems to personify the God figure, nobody knows much about him, but all feel good to confide in him without any doubt or mistrust. The town inhabitants concoct the improbable stories about Singer, who becomes a legendary figure. The most interesting point is that nobody notices or is willing to explore his troubled soul - he is very unhappy after the loss of his Greek friend and his friendship is full of sacrifices and suffering.Each of the characters, individualized, but at the same time representing different social groups, wrestles with the acceptance of their fate or with the disagreement with the world they live in. Their personal fights may look small and insignificant, like small dramas without heroism, but each of these characters is devoured by the internal fire, impossible to extinguish. McCullers' great writing talent makes each sentence of her novel burst with monumental strength, lyricism, sadness, mystery and magic of everyday human problems, and shows the perspective of life in the first half of the twentieth century in a small town in the South of the United States.This novel is mainly about characters and social situation, with excellent background. Although there are several excellent dramatic events (Bubber's gun accident, where Baby is wounded, or Mick's discovery of sex with Harry, or Jake's involvement in a fight at the fairground) the plot is virtually non-existent, the whole novel is a fragment of reality, a cut-out of the life of the town. The language is simple and clear, yet precise and perfectly grasping all the nuances of the characters, places and situations. A great, though demanding, novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"There were a couple major things I noticed while reading this book. One was of a dialectical sense. The four main visitors of Mr. Singer are all lonely and feel lost. They feel they have no one to talk to. They turn to Mr. Singer, who they feel understands, even though he is deaf and mute. He gives them hope and courage, so that they believe that their life's dream or mission or purpose is capable of being fulfilled. But Mr. Singer is lost and lonely, too. He has almost no idea what they are talking about, even when he understands what they are saying. He is lost because his best friend is in an asylum, and he cannot really talk with anyone but him. He is just as human as anyone else, and yet everyone looks up to him with a kind of awe. He is what people want him to be, though he is not what anyone thinks him to be. He is not God, but he has this Godlike aura about him. He is symbolic of the hopes and dreams that people build upon, and of their loss.A very moving and REAL story of people who believe in something so strongly that they devote their whole minds to it.Their whole minds."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter began as a short under a different title and eventually was completed as this masterpiece of a novel that has earned it's place in the best of American Literature.McCuller's story takes you into the south in another time but what she wrote about then still rings true in the heart of the human soul. Her's is a story of human wants, desires, needs, loss and the true human condition. There are single sentences alone in this book that will take your breath away as McCullers simply puts into words what we can never seem to find the words to express what we feel, what we want. I loved this book and seriously believe everyone should consider reading The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. After discovering McCuller's work through this book I have continued to read other books such as Clock Without Hands and others. She has become among my favorite authors of all time."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I like to discover gifted authors who challenge me with their work to see interesting characters and things I might not encounter in my day-to-day life. As a city person, I enjoyed learning about her setting and people. This is not a happy story, but what's great about Carson McCullers is how she portrays those who are considered low or worthless and makes us feel compassion and understanding for them. I think there's a lot of Mick in all of us , and a need to escape from our own social isolation, into a world of inner spiritual fulfillment, whether it's some hobby or interest or something else. Another great novel about social isolation and finding escape and relief in depravity is the now-forgotten but intriguing &quot;Bedeviled&quot; by Thomas Cullinan, or the odd and shocking but incredibly gripping debut &quot;A Young Girl's Crimes&quot; by another rather very young author David Rehak.

And everyone in the town feels that they can come to him with their troubles and thoughts. Their dreams and hopes. And each one sees Singer as a copy of him or herself.No one sees Singer for who he really is.There is only one person who Singer needs. Only one person who sees Singer for who he is. Only one person who understands Singer. Antonapoulos.But Antonapoulos isn't well and is sent to live in an asylum.As each one of the characters come to Singer and sees their reflection in him, each one is a little less lonely. Each heart is a little less burdened.But for Singer, who has no one to understand HIM, he becomes more lonely and more isolated. And finally, when Antonapoulos dies, Singer realizes that there isn't anyone else in the world who can understand him. Who can listen to him. Who can love him.I thought this book was incredibly sad. All the people were so concerned about having another person listen to them and love them. And I kept thinking - what about spirituality? What about God?It seemed to be the missing link in every character. There was no promise. No future. No hope. Just the doldrums of living everyday without anyone knowing you. Without anyone understanding you. Witout anyone loving you.It was beautifully written, it remains a true American classic. But it made me very sad for all the characters in the book who couldn't seem to see beyond the here and now."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This novel is mostly based on four characters and their relationship with John Singer. Singer is a deaf mute who lives in a small Georgia town in the late 30s. The book generally focuses on these characters' flaws and desires. These characters are very lonely, and they seek out Singer because they believe that he's a safe character to tell their deepest, darkest, secrets to. However, Singer, as he listens to these people, feels inside himself a deep loneliness. He feels that he has nowhere to turn, so he silently just sits and politely reads the lips of his acquantances.My favorite character in this novel was Mick Kelly. She is a young girl of 14 who had many dreams and aspirations. Her mind constantly struggled with the concept of how to make her dreams a reality. Her pure desire moved me tremendously.I was disappointed with the book as a whole. While, I enjoyed many aspects of the book, like the character development, I was disappointed with how most of the characters were pretty much left in limbo in the end. I felt that there was no conclusion of problems or revelations. It left me feeling incomplete."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers' book tends to get mired in somewhat repetitive descriptions of desolation and solitude at times. She imbues each of the main characters with a sometimes overwhelming sadness, both from the perspective of their subjective thoughts and the impression made on the reader. That being said, this book was beautiful. In creating these sympathetic, marginalized characters, McCullers displays such a sensitivity for the pain that many people are made to suffer. There is no room for writing rife with gaiety or humor when one can depict with startling clarity the utter anguish endured by people who are attuned to grandiose concepts such as art and social justice. McCullers was fully aware of this. So when people denigrate this book for being &quot;too depressing&quot;, I feel as though they've missed a powerful truth McCullers was trying to convey: that unbearable sadness is often times inextricably linked to great beauty."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am a freshman in HS, and MY dad read this book to me there years ago, I loved it at the time and i just recently read it again and got even more out of it.

How anyone with a brain and a heart could possibly find it boring is beyond me."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"If I could give this book TEN stars, I would. I love this book! It held me spellbound -- the characters had life -- flesh and blood, hands reaching out and picking at my sleeve to get attention, proud eyes looking at self-deprecating failures, wise eyes looking into mine. I heard the whispered secret thoughts of a grimy young girl whose ambitions go far beyond the shanties and dirt roads in her town, and who grew up right before my eyes. Who can't remember being 12 -- that magical age when everything new in life starts rushing toward you and you suddenly realize that YOU start calling the shots.I smiled at the way the two hearing-impaired friends shared their mornings, and wept over their loss -- made especially sad by the different reactions each man had. I held on to my temper as Blount ranted and raved and I wanted SO badly to tell Biff: &quot;Alice IS right -- throw him out!!!&quot;Dry, Southern clay sifted into my hair and onto my face and was all over my city shoes as I walked in between the tilting shacks called &quot;home&quot;, smelling the musty odors, sweat and rancid beer coming out of open windows in the opppressive heat. My mouth watered as Portia cooked yet another meal for her beloved yet oh so different father, and I wanted so badly to tell him: &quot;Can't you just love her for the way she is???&quot;.Then my feet burned on the hot hot sidewalks as I followed Mick and Bubber, the red wagon wheels creaking from a combination of dust in the wheel-bearings and just plain old age. I held on tightly as Mick balanced on the rooftop, and I sang with her.For the all-too brief time that it took to read this incredible book (Carson did it again!!!), I was wrapped up in the sweet syrupy closeness of a small-time Southern Town, when life went by slowly and people had time to think - maybe too much time to think. I was part of that community, their joys were mine -- their losses were mourned.My only criticism? I think that the way in which this book meanders so nicely is suddenly pushed out of the way by accelerating action toward the conclusion. But who am I to complain? Isn't that the way life sometimes goes???Like &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, this book is one that I will pick up and read MANY MANY more times. Why? Because when you meet and make friends like that -- you MUST go back and visit them occasionally!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"A truly amazing book, an outstanding achievment. At times it was dificult to read, dipping as it does into feelings of profound sadness, grief, and loneliness. In some ways I can understand why we don't read it in high school-not many books, if any, illustrate the absurd, self-defeating egotism of human beings. There's so much going in this book it can dizzy you. Is the deaf-mute a Christ figure, full of compassion? Or is he essentially a simpleton, beloved because, like the family dog, he can't talk back. Singer the mute seems to be the hub the other stories revolve around, but Mick is also a central figure. (Representing the author perhaps?) Her brief liason with her Jewish neighbor is absolutely heart rending. They had so much to tell each other, such capacity to heal one another but instead he flees, from his own need, before Mick can sing &quot;Will you still love me tommorrow?&quot; And then there is the severe, dignified black doctor who wants to teach his people, lead them to a sophisticatation and nobility equaling, even surpasing, that of whites, only to be viciously beaten by cops outside of the courthouse when he tries to inquire about his jailed son. A beating which convinces those who he attempts to educate that shuffling and smiling is their destiny. &quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; is about the inadequacy of human communication. So many people, with such intense wants and needs who can only unburden themselves on a deaf-mute. A deaf-mute who likely is indifferent to their suffering. Is the human experience so lonely?"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is about friendship and loyalty. One needs to approah it cautiously lest all we see in it are the hopelessly confused lives of all characters. And yet, within this confusion, and despite it, Singer, the deaf-mute clock repairer seems happy. His secret attracts everybody -- from the young girl gorwing up with dreams of becoming a composer (never to be realized), to the old black doctor -- they all are enchanted by his neatness and serenity, by his ability to ignore the depressing, hopeless reality all around and live, it seems, in an enchanted world of his own. Almost unconsciously, they seek his company, as if to learn from a master. And all the while, Singer's secret is as profound as it is simple -- he has a good friend, the other deaf-mute in the town. The two initially live together, but then Singer's friend is sent to a mental asylum. Singer's initial panic and agony are soon replaced by patience and purposefulness -- every once in a while he visits his friend and takes gifts to him. For both of them, each other is all they have -- in a world of speech where noone can understand them, in a world so drab and rusty it seems time itself has stopped, Singer has a friend. And this makes him open-hearted and loving to everyone else. In world where people have so little goodness to spare for each other, where people often hurt their loved ones, Singer is almost like a saintly figure, his kindness making the lives of everyone else just that much more bearable. And when his friend dies, Singer finds that his life has become meaningless. His suicide shocks everyone and leaves them hurt, and disillusioned. MuCullers manages to convey extremely well the hopelessness of the small town. High ideals and higher purposes -- whether socialism or black civil rights -- seem doomed. People are unable to communicate with each other, and each suffers alone in a horribly confused and constrained little world of their own. The only thing that makes sense is not some higher goal but the closeness of another human being. The only thing that makes life bearable, makes it worth living, is friendship and love. When that is gone, the rest scatters like so much dust in the wind."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am a little more than half way through and think this book is amazing so far. I was disapointed in some of the reviews I saw.This book is very thought provoking. They way it is writen is just amazing. It makes you think about all the unjust things out in the world. It was written in 1940, and back then this book must have caused a lot of controvery because of all the issues that were addressed in it such as racism, the way the government is run/communism, lonelyness, and what it is like to be deaf in a world that doesn't seem to tolerant of differences. The book is writen in a way that doesn't just let you know how the characters are feeling but it lets you feel too. I totally recomend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Mick Kelly, a young tomboy of a girl who has a fire in her belly for classical music and tends her brother Bubber, is a dynamic enough character to make this book a must read. Add to her presence characters like John Singer, a mute resident of the Kellys' boarding house, Bill Brannon, proprietor of the New York Cafe, Doctor Benedict, who is black in a small southern town early in the 20th Century, Mady Copeland, drinking Jake Blount who has visions, and you have a mix worth of solid reading. The book has some of the deeply introspective magic of Sherwood Anderson's WINESBURG, OHIO, but is an original on its own. It is an amazing accomplishment for a 23-year old to write what is her master work. By reading this book you will know the characters as well as family members, and the book will make you smile, and will leave a lump in your throat. This book is to novels what CASABLANCA is to movies -- not a wasted word -- a classic!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The American author McCullers was known to be a burden to her friends, and a brilliant but difficult artist to her publisher. Her fame soared in the late Thirties and Forties. Sexually abiguous herself, she married a homosexual man who later committed suicide; her writing reflects her fascination with sexuality and is psychologically far ahead of its time. Plagued by ill health most of her life, she died at the age of fifty in 1967 of a stroke.&quot;The Heart is a Lonely Hunter&quot; examines the theme of abandonment and the isolation of the artist. The protagonist, Mick (a girl) is carelessly raised by improvident parents and left to grow up unappreciated and unnourished. She forms a friendship with John Singer, a deaf-mute, symbolic of isolation and misunderstanding. The deaf man takes in a troubled companion, a clerk in a grocery who is mentally ill but seems to offer the man the love and companionship his affliction has denied him. The two live in a sort of fool's paradise which, as will happen, all comes undone.The sketching of the characters of small Southern town life is spare and unerring. It is interesting to compare McCullers' work to that of Thomas Wolfe (&quot;Of Time and the River&quot;, &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot;). This Southern great wrote a decade or so earlier than McCullers and his style was florid and very much rooted in the 19th Century. McCullers version of a semi-biographical tale is distinguished by 20th Century economy and precision. The sharpness of this writing is some of the best in American literature, and Oprah Winfrey has done a fine service to the reading public by popularizing this classic anew."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"A book that has been around since 1940 zooms to bestseller status in a heartbeat when recommended by Oprah. Usually I am skeptical about Oprah's picks, but in this case I have to agree with her. It is about time this book receive recognition for its portrayal of triumph against all odds.I would especially recommend this book for young women readers, although as a male, I also enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is an ideal book for teachers to educate their students on the influential effect of characterization and an author's ability to create tension and evoke sympathy in the reader. Carson McCullers' compelling mastery of characterization and manipulation of the reader's feelings create a world filled with loneliness and disappointment.One instance where McCullers manipulates the reader's feelings occurs when different characters in the book visit Singer in his room. Four different characters, Dr. Copeland, Biff, Mick, and Jake discuss their problems with Singer in his room on a regular basis. The trouble is that they are not discussing, but merely telling Singer their problems. They use Singer as a sound board and he just nods serenely. They enjoy this time because they are allowed to speak their mind with no inhibitions and feel as though Singer genuinely agrees with them. In reality, they are deceiving themselves by projecting their imagination of how they want him to respond onto him. Unbeknownst to the reader, McCullers creates enough ambiguity in the reader's knowledge of each character that he begins to pass judgment on the characters according to how he wants them to be. This example provides educators an opportunity to demonstrate the author's ability to influence the reader's emotions by portraying certain events in such a way that they conflict with the reader's desires.McCullers continues to use the reader's wants to force them to feel the characters' loneliness through John Singer's lack of response to his visitors. The audience wants Singer to respond to the people. The characters are crying out for help and Singer continues to sit and never replies. McCullers refuses to give the reader that satisfaction or else the reader's imagination could not fill in the holes of ambiguity. If Singer were to talk to the people and help them out with their problems, then the tension would relax and everything would work out in the end. The space and distance between the characters that interact on a daily basis create the loneliness both they and the reader feel. This helps students realize that authors intentionally illustrate characters and events in a very specific way in order to elicit certain emotions and expectations in the reader.The reader's expectations are further heightened as McCuller provides situations in which the conflict could finally be resolved. One night, Singer meets three other mutes and begins to converse with him. This event provokes a sense of excitement in the reader because Singer may finally find someone in which he can relate. His loneliness may be resolved at last. But in the end something is amiss and Singer wants nothing to do with them. And so, the reader gets pulled in and then crushed. Likewise, both Jake Blout and Dr. Copeland live in this small town, love Communism and Marxism, and spend their lives fighting for it. They eventually run into each other and only need to share their thoughts to each other, but they miss the opportunity. They skip over the only person that could relate to their situation and continue to live their lives in sorrow and alone. Because all these experiences promote a sense of hopelessness and loss, students can easily see that authors carefully place situations throughout a book that tie back to a specific objective and feeling.In addition to unresolved expectations, McCullers successfully uses characterization to elicit sympathy in the reader. For instance, the reader especially bonds with Mick because she is the closest to Singer and like a child. She is the musically talented struggling girl that the readers yearns to see succeed. The beautiful diction by which Mick speaks and the faith felt in her causes the reader to love her. Yet she is tainted. She smokes against the reader's will. She has one shot at a musical scholarship but loses it. There is one shot in the book for a true loving relationship to occur between Mick and Harry and it ends with a fumbling, inarticulate sexual intercourse. The great potential in Mick fails and the reader is left feeling lost and hopeless. Having the opportunity to seriously relate to characters lets the reader emotionally invest in the novel and form a deeper connection with the book, thus making it a better read and profound teaching tool.Another instance of McCullers' effective use of characterization is seen in Dr. Copeland. Dr. Copeland is the epitome of a crushing figure. He is described as a wrinkled old black man that only wants to help save his people. He has this passion for Marxism and names his children after communist philosophers. Yet his children do not understand him and he cannot seem to get through to anyone he reaches out to. The reader experiences his extreme frustration as he witnesses his family being broken apart and is powerless to stop it. He is constantly attending to the sick while coughing and spitting into a handkerchief. The appeal to the reader's emotions leaves him feeling helpless as he watches Dr. Copeland get sicker and sicker and become a martyr for his people. As teachers and students read The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter, they will notice they have developed a new sense of sympathy toward the characters and will regard the book on a more personal level.Additionally, this novel exudes tension and loss that the reader can feel through McCullers' character Bubber. Bubber, later known as George, symbolizes the reader's relationship and experience with the novel. In the beginning, Bubber is an ignorant and innocent toddler that is merely starting his life in the community. Although he has been introduced to the harsh society, he later learns the true loneliness and cruelty of the world. When Bubber accidentally shoots Baby in the head, his whole world changes. He is loses his innocence and is no longer called Bubber, but his real name George. He has responsibilities and his family treats him as an adult. Comparatively, the reader begins the novel assuming it will be another happy ending story. Experiencing the events through the eyes of various characters exposes the reader to a realistic and depressing life. Therefore, The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter is unarguably an optimal instrument teachers can draw on to demonstrate the power characterization has on influencing the audience's feelings.McCullers' extraordinary use of characterization and control of the reader's expectations allow her to create a society full of conflict and tension. She uses each character and his or her experiences to evoke a specific emotion in the reader. These skills collaborate together to form an effective novel that is a perfect tool for teachers to instruct their students in the great power of characterization while students can simultaneously enjoy an enthralling and thought-provoking book. It is greatly recommended for its usefulness in educating students in the power of both one author and one book's ability to instill a new sense of the need for acceptance, love, maturity, and understanding."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter is by far her best. The book has a very depressing side to it, many people enjoy reading books that are cushy and have melodramtic endings where the 'goody' defies belief and destroys the 'baddy', but this is great 'real life', easy to relate to stuff.The way in which each character is portrayed is special, you really feel as if you know them. McCullers methods are unlike many others and among the best in the world.The book explores the spiritual side of the more or less 'rejected' beings, which is an instant put off for many. But what world do we live in? Not a perfect one. This book grapples the harshness of social decline, and never ceases to the lure of perfect people or a perfect place. The book is above all a great piece of literature by a 23 year old, which is quite an achievement.If you want a seriously good piece of literature unlike the happy ending mainstream we read all the time, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is a moving story that is written in a spare and elegant voice. Carson McCullers explores abandonment, loneliness and loss in great depth. I read this book years ago in high school. As a teenager who didn't fit in and who felt no one understood her, I felt that The Heart is a Lonely Hunter spoke to my own heart. The fact that a 22-year-old had written such a luminous novel offered me hope that there was a way out of my own isolation. Not only did the story stick with me, the book shaped my life. It impelled me to spend my adult life as a writer."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I have such a connection to Carson McCullers and her work and it is difficult for me to pick a favorite, but this one just resonates. I loved \\"Reflections in a Golden Eye\\" and \\"Clock Without Hands\\". McCullers knows about outsiders because she was one, and used that experience to inform her writing. Similar to \\"Member of the Wedding\\", this novel has a tomboyish young lady who can't quite articulate her dissatisfaction with life and relationships. Each character is stricken with an irrepressible desperation and isolation. Anyone can relate to this novel. Only wish there were more undiscovered McCullers novels in a trunk somewhere..."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Written when the author was only 23 (paralyzed at 30, dead at 50) and an American masterpiece.

Really, it is a very good book. And dat's all I got ta say 'bout dat."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers gradually develops a place where a deaf mute learns to adjust to a life without his life-long friend. The author cleverly allows her characters to reveal their own concerns, always turning a deaf ear to the listener, the one who really needs to tell his very own story so desperately. But he cannot, he must assume the burden of silence in the wake of those who spew noxious verbiage. He must endure others' happiness in deference to his own. These characters are vivid and colorful providing an entertaining background while the main problem builds. And finally, we are shocked in such a way so as to shake our inner core to what hides in each of us. What a book!There are many aspects of The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter that give it a status of a memorable book. It brings us back to a simpler time when writers told a story. I became impatient at first when I started to read the volume. It wasn't until halfway into the work that I realized that there was something much deeper going on in the plot and something very creepy loomed over John Singer."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It is amazing to think that Carson McCullers was only twenty-three when she wrote \\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\", a novel that is full of experience and wisdom beyond the author's years. McCullers was a gifted writer, comfortable in various skins, who offered her readers vivid portraits of strange characters and who raised some intriguing questions along the way.\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" focuses on four characters who are all drawn to confess their deepest, darkest thoughts and feelings to the town mute, Mr. John Singer. There is Mick Kelly, a tomboy of a girl on the verge of womanhood, who dreams of more than her small town can offer her and who is dying to find a way to express the music she keeps within herself. There is the hopeless drifter, Jake Blount, a drunk and unseemly man who bristles at the unfair treatment of the workers and the poor. There is Dr. Copeland, an educated black man who wanted the best for his children but was doomed to watch them settle down to living stereotypes and cliches. And there is Biff Brannon, proprietor of the New York Cafe, a man who watches and knows all that goes on but doesn't truly fit anywhere. All four befriend the mute Singer thinking he understands what it is they're searching for, and even though they would count him as their friend, Singer's life and his motivations remain a complete enigma to them all.\\"The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter\\" is a bittersweet and poignant examination of humanity and morality in the South. McCuller's characters are vividly drawn and her prose is captivating, brutally honest but tender at the same time. Not much happens in terms of plot, being rather an intimate examination of these unique intersecting lives. It is a book that is difficult to put down, a truly heartbreaking tale that deserves to be considered a masterpiece of American literature."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Despite good qualities, the novel is not without flaws. The most obvious one is that, despite McCullers' open-minded and liberal sensibilities regarding race, hers is still a viewpoint immured in its time, less of a blacks are equals tone than a pity the poor blacks tone. This is made especially clear with Dr. Copeland, who is portrayed, in some ways, as an intellectual superman of his race, part of the old \`Talented Tenth', who is frustrated at how many blacks, especially his children, accept their roles as subservient shufflers and falsely smiling yes-men. Yet, even he is not immune to McCullers' backhanded putdowns, as, early on, this doctor, is shown reading the works of the philosopher Spinoza, yet not really able to fully understand it- as if a man who can understand human biology would really struggle with such. The fact that McCullers portrays the majority of her black characters this way shows a passive racism. Now, this would not be a major flaw in the book were one of the main foci NOT race relations, but it is, and this dates the book in ways A Tree Grows In Brooklyn does not suffer from. Many critics, in fact, have lauded McCullers for her pre-Civil Rights Era racial sensitivity, and foreshadowing of the evils of McCarthyism and anti-Civil Rights demagogues, but when one gets beyond Dr. Copeland himself, the eternal exception to her rule, one sees that McCullers' view of blacks is sadly mired in its day- a sort of old style racial noblesse oblige. Another flaw is excess description, at times. Because her writing is not that poetic, such excess does not serve as a \`breather' from the narrative, and often does not serve the narrative in any substantive way, merely acting as filler. Here's an example: \`This was her, Mick Kelly, walking in the daytime and by herself at night. In the hot sun and in the dark with all the plans and feelings.' Is the second sentence really necessary to qualify the first? Compare that with this passage, from the last few pages of the book, and the difference is stark: \`Then suddenly he felt a quickening in him. His heart turned and he leaned his back against the counter for support. For in a swift radiance of illumination he saw a glimpse of human struggle and of valor. Of the endless fluid passage of humanity through endless time. And of those who labor and of those who- one word- love. His soul expanded. But for a moment only.'Yet, despite the fact that the book does not follow many conventional narrative tropes, it does follow a standard tripartite structure, and uses a standard third person omniscient voice. McCullers, herself, said that the book's structure was that of a fugue- where voices act antiphonally: \`This book is planned according to a definite and balanced design. The form is contrapuntal throughout. Like a voice in a fugue each one of the main characters is an entirety in himself--but his personality takes on a new richness when contrasted and woven in with the other characters in the book.' In part one the characters, settings, and major themes are laid out. In part two each character's inner lives and failings are revealed, and the climax- Singer's suicide- occurs at the end of this section. And in part three the likely fates of the characters are limned.This fatality is one of the ways this book most differs, negatively, from A Tree Grows In Brooklyn. That novel, laced with as much oppression and despair, ends on an up note (not the reason it's better) that is hopeful. Francie Nolan has a chance, a good chance, to surmount her past, even though, in many ways, her success was far less likely and less predictable than Mick's, who seems doomed. Both books are slices of life, portraits of bygone Americas in different places and times, but Betty Smith's Brooklyn seems far more vivid and real than Carson McCullers' South because it is more tightly drawn, less dated- thus more realistic, and more poetically mnemonically rendered. The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter also is a bit too long and too unfocused, losing its narrative thrust by going off tangent to things not vital to the main characters' tales, and were some of its excesses trimmed, it could pack more punch in just seventy-five to eighty percent of its length (356 pages). Still, this is, in a sense, nitpicking, and shows how far American literature has fallen because compared to what is routinely published nowadays this novel, despite its flaws, is a near-great book, every bit deserving of its niche in the canon."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I loved this story and it haunted me for a long time.

I would like to give this book 3 1/2 stars, but that is not an option- basically it is a nice read, however there are several things which did not sit well with me.From reading the other reviews here you already see the plot. As for the characters, I was able to see a little of myself in almost all of them (except Jake- I couldn't stand him). Dr. Copeland, whose superiority and high expectations of character and behavior in others relegate and doom him to a life of disappointment; Mick and especially Bubber, the bright and thoughtful children (a bit too bright- see below); Biff Brannon, the owner of the diner; and of course, John the mute- maybe I'm nuts, but in my mind's eye I envision John Singer exactly as I do John Galt from Atlas Shrugged! Maybe it's the name, perhaps the fact that neither is a man of many words, maybe the physical description of green-grey eyes, a tall, thin build, and always keeping his hands in his pockets, or possibly the patience and willingness to suffer in silence for a long period of time without showing it... I wish I was as strong as those two.Isn't that the best part of literature though? Finding heroes who set new standards of behavior to attempt to model oneself after?Anyway, the book is not without its problems. There are many small errors, which, though not monumental, are flagrant in their number and leave a bad taste. For example, a scene will be described as taking place in October- while later in the scene we find a reference to &quot;the September sunshine&quot;. The author also can never seem to remember whether John Singer is drinking coffee or beer- in one scene she switches 2 or 3 times... annoying things like that.What I found to be the weakest point, though, was the fact that the children are given adult attributes. Granted, children are capable of much more complex feelings than they are often given credit for... and we can all sympathize with kids to some extent, having all been there. But I was shocked when I went back to find that Bubber was only 7 years old. Seven? She should have made him ten or eleven...Like I said, a nice read for when you're in a pensive mood. #17 novel of the century? I don't know about that one... Remember, it's easy to make people cry.

But why does it get four stars, you ask? The book followed the lives of some very different people and that was interesting: a 12 year old girl, a restaurant owner, a big drunk guy, a black doctor, and two mute guys. Each chapter was about one of these people so if you got tired of reading about one, the next chapter was about someone different. There were lots of interesting parts it the book once you get past the boring, depressing description. People die, a child is shot in the head, a man gets his feet cut off. None of this stuff is good, but it makes the better more interesting to read. The book is set in 1930s Georgia and the book addresses racism and segregagtion too. Even though its long, its worth it.

We had to read this for our english class and our teacher kept saying how great this book was but i didnt like it at all. I thought it was the worst book i ever read. It doesnt deserve any stars"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is a wonderful story of overcoming hardships of life no matter if they are large or small. It is a story of a man named John Singer who is a deaf mute and after living with his Greek companion for over 10 years his friend goes insane leaving him alone in a lonely world. He rents a room with the Kelly family in their boarding house and begins to explore the silent world around him as no one else sees it. He listens to others problems without hearing and is still able to write down his thoughts and ideas. This is a heartwarming story that goes into so many worlds that are yet to be looked at by so many people. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to be intrigued by the world around them. It is well worth the effort to get this book and take a peek:)"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers paints a wonderful picture of life in a southern town in 1939. The novel is filled with thought provoking images about lonliness, slavery, and hopelessness. But in the end, if you're willing to spend time thinking about the writing, you will enjoy the book.The book is dripping with descriptive prose (I didn't think there were so many ways to describe the sunrise or sunset)and the action moves very slow. Many people who prefer the current-day dramatic novel with it's fast paced action and heavy reliance on dialog may not find this book to be their cup of tea. But, in my opinion, it's worth reading this book if only to understand the world of 1940 when she wrote it.Afterall, reading is not about what the author is doing with her right hand but what she is subtly doing with her left."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"For all of you who belittled this text with your unenlightened comments, I simply want you to know that this book not only changed my entire life, it saved my life. So, when you learn how to read and understand what you read and have finally grown up, READ IT AGAIN! Till then, take Mommy's credit card and buy yourself some more brain decaying Cleff notes or some stupid, inane videos. If &quot;Ignorance is bliss&quot; you must be truly happy."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I have seldom read a book with so little \\"action\\" yet so stirring. Admittedly, I am not a great friend of the South much less the language, but the characters of this book had me engulfed so deeply that I was not able to read any other book shortly thereafter for lack of depth, sincerity, emotion and total involvement. Exceptional!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a very good book that is well written and well developed. However, this is one of the saddest books I have ever read. It seemed that nothing good happened to the characters. Nonetheless I really liked how all the characters were all tied together in this one little town, especially with the use of a mute person.The book is about several different characters a deaf mute man who longs for friendship and for someone like himself, a little girl who loves music but because her family is poor always struggles to keep that love for music, a store owner who has somewhat feminine tendencies and possibly be a pedophile, a black doctor who wants to help his people, and a communist man who wants to spread his knowledge.Some of the minor characters are interesting too and include an obese deaf mute, the little girls family, and the doctors daughter.Well thoughout and developed book. I recommend is highly."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Much has been written about the literary merits of this book-a few points.1. Of all the recognized classics I've read, easily over 100, this one ranked the lowest-with Ironweed a close second.2. The book is marketed with McCuller's homely mug on the cover and the premise that \\"a white girl in her early twenties wrote the book in the 1940s in the American South; it was her first novel.\\" That a classic does not make-if this same novel had been written in the last ten years, it would be considered sophomoric, second rate, high school literature with contrived, stereotypical characterization. (Hemingway described this book as \\"phony\\" over fifty years ago.)3. A painfully slow, patronizing read. By the time I reached the last sentence in part two, the climax of the book, I was relieved that something of significance had finally happened.4. There are two great passages in the book-the first is Doc Copeland's thoughts about raising his children, expectations versus reality, and Jake Blounts thoughts about \\"those who know and those who don't know.\\" Unfortunately, most of the rest of the book falls flat.5. Spoiler alert: lonely, directless people in a small southern town project their thoughts onto a deaf mute who becomes what they want him to become-this basic idea, with some detours into the social injustices prevalent at the time, spun out over 359 pages.6. Obviously this book deeply affected many readers, and to them my apologies, but as for this guy-sorry-hated it. I want ten hours of my life back."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is, without a doubt, one of the few perfect books. While I love Oprah's picks, some of them haven't resonated with me. But \\"The Heat is a Lonely Hunter\\" does, along with \\"East of Eden.\\" By far, this pick is long overdue. Having initially read this novel in high school, it was a great pleasure to revisit it once again. Thank you Oprah for bringing this great work of fiction back into our lives (...)"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I bought this book because it was part of Oprah's Book Club. This is the first one I've read since she changed her selections to classics. I saw her promoting the book after everyone was already finished reading it. She spoke mostly about the mute character in the book and had Marlee Matlin on her show to speak about being deaf. What surprised me was that Oprah did not speak about the racial aspect of the story, which I found to be far more interesting than that of the deaf character.I do feel that Carson McCullers put all of her eggs in one basket and it may have been more suitable to have two separate books. One dealing with life as a deaf man, and the other dealing with race in the South. She obviously had great knowledge on both topics, but reading about them in the same book took something away from the whole context of the story.As far as character development is concerned, I really only enjoyed reading one of the five characters that were followed. She made the men almost indestructible at times, and so grounded in their beliefs that to sympathize with any of them was difficult. Even when the worst of situations befell them, I really couldn't have cared less.I was drawn into the book because of the character of Mick Kelly. Mick was a feisty teenager on the outside, but terribly lost on the inside. She was the only character I related to, and the only one that I felt was the most rounded.I assume this book is considered a classic and is required reading in schools, because of the racial tones to the book. While it does give a glimpse into the world of the 1930's racially divided South, I think there are other books that document it much better."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The language in this book was wonderful. The writer does have a way with words and imagery. The ending was unsuspected. BUT, not an easy read. It was difficult to finish the book. It felt flat."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Reputations! Some so portenuous that the mere title bristles with their scent. Such is, The heart Is a Lonely Hunter, a killer title that has become an inherited cliche, absorbed into mainstream language.It is timeless and gripping. You can sense kinship with, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', and the more florid Cormac McCarthy's, 'Suttree'. It's realisation of ambivalent, struggling, and confounded people is so complete that some of the social economic reforms, petitioned between the covers, would have to actualise before its impact paled to irrelevance. The pace is unhurried. The weather necessarily imposes itself on the lives of its fistful of characters. And as they saunter and scrape through a year, mostly perplexed and projecting their anxieties on the mute, Singer, (an ironic nomenclature) the plot waxes and wanes for each of them. The injustices of power and wealth distribution are given vent by the most driven, most outsiderish two men, who find peace and consolation in the company of the mute. Their political and spiritual impotence at first pulls them close, then segregates them, ideologically and racially. The random violence that so rudely grooves their destinies is casually evoked: dramas to be sure, but absorbed in a literary consciousness that has no urge to moralise or proselytize. It's a remarkable book, if for this alone; its lack of pretension. And, in its very ordinariness it both attains and retains the dignity of its vivid life."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCuller's novel about a deaf mute, Harry Singer is one of the most poignant books I have ever read. Outstanding characters and great story. It was made into a motion picture in 1969 and starred Alan Arkin as Singer, the deaf mute."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"In an enlightened world the future of young southern girl Mick Kelly should look as bright as her shining intellect and many talents. Instead, a feeling of dread and foreboding seems to hang over her future and that of her motley group of friends that includes Blacks and Jews. The deaf but refined Mr. Singer, a skilled Jewish engraver, whose best friend is an institutionalized and mentally-challenged Greek deaf-mute, is a special friend and beacon to young Mick--but his own life suffers under the constraints imposed by his disability. A distinguished Black physician and his son also suffer greatly at the hands of a world that is alternately hostile and indifferent. A kindly cafe owner mourns the passing of Mick's youth as she assumes the mantle of adulthood and her hum-drum job at the cheap Woolworths 5 and 10 cent store--while listening anxiously to radio reports of advancing Nazism in Europe.This book was first published in 1940. Carson McCullers could never had guessed that these once poor Americans would staff the factories and armed forces that helped bury Fascism."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The writing in this book is wonderfully subtle. It's as though Carson McCullers spends the whole novel chopping quietly away at a grand old oak tree. You don't realize so much is happening in the small everyday acts of these characters until the end when the whole tree comes down, leaving everyone shocked and sad and hyper-aware of a vast emptiness left behind.The novel centers around John Singer, a deaf-mute who lives happily contented with his best friend, another deaf-mute, until the friend goes insane and must be institutionalized. Singer moves into a boarding house and becomes the receptacle for the dreams, thoughts, rants and loneliness of the rest of the main characters in the book including young Mick Kelly, the teenage girl whose family owns the boarding house, Dr. Copeland, the town's only black doctor, Biff Brannon, a restaurant owner, and Jake Blount, a drunk mad with his ideas about how society should work. They all talk and talk at Singer, sometimes to his bewilderment, but none of them listen to him. Then, when tragedy strikes, they are all shocked and surprised. Isn't that how life usually works, in too many sad and awful ways to mention?I enjoyed \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter\\" for McCullers's well-observed scenes and the thought-provoking clarity with which she sees the predicament of each of her characters. The way she develops this languid world of the south, layer upon layer, with sights, sounds, smells and the overall feeling of impotent dreams and disappointed hopes is truly a marvel to behold. I shall remember always the many small gestures that I found so touching as to be heartbreaking: the way Singer would look earnestly into the face of his friend before they parted each day to go to work; Mick spray painting the names of her idols on the walls of a house and then lying up on the roof so she could make her plans; Dr. Copeland wanting so much to reach out to his family, but being tongue-tied as though he and they would forever speak a different language; Biff Brannon dotting his dead wife's perfume to his temples and absorbing the memories of when he had loved.I highly recommend this book with the hope that each person who reads it will come away pondering the state of their own \\"inside rooms,\\" and take care to tend and spend time in that cherished space."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is one of those books I wish I had read decades ago. I picked up a copy at a used book sale and was immediately captivated by the five main characters. The Amazon purchase I made was a gift for a relative, made even before I reached the halfway point of the book. Service of the seller was excellent, mirroring the themes of the book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The disparate lives of five people come together when a gay, deaf man takes a room in a boarding house and befriends them all. Set in a southern mill town during the 1930's, The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, explores the desperation that we all experience when we feel that we are alone in the world.I first read this book when I was in high school, about thirty-three years ago. Although there were some subtleties that I didn't pick up on (such as the fact that the character John Singer is gay), I was profoundly moved by the lives of each character and the loneliness and hopelessness they all felt. For a book in which very little happens, the story is gripping. Every character - from an elderly African-American doctor to a thirteen-year-old white girl - is written with such compassion and insight that I felt that I knew them all intimately.Unfortunately, the book is heartbreaking, and the end leaves the reader with a sense of hopelessness. It's a book that stayed with me back when I was fourteen, and a book that continues to live within me all this time later."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager. Loved it then. I was surprised at how much I remembered about it.I am going to purchase this book for my teenage grand daughters. Loved it!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The theme of isolation is at the forefront in McCullers' novel The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, which is set in a rural Southern community in the 1930s. The plot revolves around the stories of several central characters who all gravitate towards the main character, mute John Singer, who has an aura of spirituality and wisdom about him that make others turn to him. Each has their own sense of longing and emptiness within their soul, and Singer represents the link that gives them spiritual comfort. Despite their differences of each (Mick, Dr. Copeland, Jake Blount, Biff Brannon), all are connected and linked by their need for comfort. Even Singer shares this common feeling of loneliness, as he sees his best friend, Spiros, sent to an asylum within the book's first chapters.The question that The Heart is a Lonely Hunter seems to address is: How do we deal with isolation or sense of loss when we experience it? Mick, for instance, seems to find peace in music, but comes to trust in Singer as well. Doctor Copeland feels anger and injustice in the world and seeks answers. Others, Jake and Biff, both trust in Singer as a means of expressing their frustrations. Although Singer cannot speak to them, they build a bond, a connection. The book's title is fitting because it is symbolic of each person's search for a connection to share life's experiences--goals, hopes, aspirations, frustrations. Singer is the catalyst for hope.I think many people read The Heart is a Lonely Hunter and see it as \\"depressing\\", but the book is also hopeful at points. Certain tragedies arise that like a punch to the gut, a major letdown, but there is also a sense of hope and resolve within the novel. The author leaves some ambiguity for us to decide how things will go on.McCullers writes with such a descript prose that isn't too flowery, but is poetic and illustrative of the human condition. She takes you right into this small town community. She has such a command for description and transition from one tale to the next that it is an easy and smooth, yet powerful Southern read. Another great read from McCullers is her short story collection that features \\"The Ballad of the Sad Caf&eacute;.\\""},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is a classic for a reason. The work-a-day lives of individuals in a small southern town are tenderly related to us, with all of their egos, inadequacies, (perceived and otherwise) are laid bare to our eyes. We watch as a young mind finds strange new feelings emerging, which seek a focal point for the developing affections. We watch as a husband-wife pair slowly circles a sink-hole of desperation, and an old man combats the growing realization of his own inconsequence. Such is life."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"In a small mill town in the South in the 1930s, a group of very different people live. Jake is a passionate labor defender, who keeps trying to prod the people in town into unionizing. Biff is the owner of a bar, who mourns his lack of children and his unhappy marriage. Dr. Coleman is a black physician, profoundly disappointed by his grown children, who share none of his ideas on how to better their race. Mick is an adolescent trying to find her way in the world, figuring out which dreams she should follow.Also in town is John Singer, a deaf-mute who is devastated when his only friend leaves town. Singer has a special presence, a certain aura of understanding and compassion, and the other characters crave his attention. Each one believes that he or she shares a bond with Singer, although nobody really seems to be communicating with anyone.I really loved the descriptions in this book, the way that the town and its inhabitants came alive. The language was beautiful, and I especially was enthralled with Mick and the way the world seemed so magical and the possibilities so endless to her.I would have liked to have seen more explanation of the relationship between Singer and Antonapoulos. Singer seemed so bright and strong; I couldn't understand why he was so dependent on his friend, who seemed to bring nothing but heartache and trouble to the relationship."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"It does say on the posting that this is from the first edition library, which I just didn't attend to when making the purchase and didn't realize until I received the book that it was in fact published much later than I had initially expected.

Finely drawn characters fill out this book, and the writing is superb."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I recently saw the flim, a second time on TCM, after seeing it when the film came out. I subsequently purchased the book on Kindle, and would have to say once again, the book is much better than the film. For me, the film was about people not listning, exemplified by the mute character of Singer. The relationship of the Black doctor, his family and his torments are more complicated. The film is trite compared to the reality brought out by McCullers. The knife fight in the brothel is a raw but all too common of black anger against other blacks. The book, like the film is not something to read on the beach. The anger that Dr. Copeland is a strikingly complex character. Surving the hardship of being black and poor, he becomes a doctor. Not only does he hate white people, he doesn't have a relationship with his family which he tries to elevate to his idea of improving their lot of being black. In frustration, he strikes his wife who leaves him, along with his children. Only Portia, his daughter, a maid in the small southern town visits her father occasionally. The black doctor, lives by himself and and finds a common sprit in the white deaf mute. The irony only adds to the pain of striving to care for his people and his growing affliction with pneumonia.Mick, the tall, skinny daughter of a handicapped father, becomes drawn into the world of the mute, Mr. Singer.His relationship with the only other mute in town is a difficult and tragedy. The result is a strange assortment of lonely people, bound together not by family relationships, race, age or education. Their only bond is their poverty and search for a meaning to their lives. Mr Singer is the glue that holds them together. Like Carson McCullers other book, Member of the Wedding, this novel reaches deep into the hearts of its characters and places them in an odd caldron of life, hard, cruel and at times with the greatest of love for other suffering humans."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Unbelievable writer.

One of the best opening lines ever. &quot;In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together.&quot; Mr. Singer was conducting a brilliant symphony of loneliness. He was rather like bugs bunny conducting a piece that he had never heard. Hands flying here and there, nodding, smiling, but not understanding. A wonderful character. Each noun, verb, and adjective had such an overwhelming sense of passion and sensitivity. Her writing, I think, betrays the happenings of her own life. The BALLAD OF THE SAD CAFE is another of Carson McCullers' coups."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The characters, themes, and style make this book awesome."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Like it did for another reviewer above, this book also recalled To Kill A Mockingbird for me. The deceptively simple writing style, the setting --the South in the '30s -- the involvement and viewpoint of a strong girl character (even more believable than Lee's Scout) and the sympathetic treatment of Blacks, all seem to have influenced Harper Lee. But who knows?The only thing lacking, for better or worse, is a sense of humor. However, it would have been a true challenge to inject humor into such an un-sentimental story. But because the story avoids sentiment, it occasionally takes on an air of a modern magazine feature article.Mockingbird, despite its similarities and overall serious intent, provides plenty of humor. I guess no comic relief is one of the qualities that distinguishes the Southern Gothic, but also it may be behind its short-lived influence.I regard this as McCullers' best, but there is also considerable power in The Member of the Wedding. As for the critics love for The Ballad of the Sad Cafe, I guess I missed the point and it's greatness.McCullers' writing is always so clean, but in The Heart is a Lonely Hunter, she combines a great and unique story about universal and personal isolation in people rarely written about to make a true modern classic."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I found &quot;The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter&quot; a very good book.I think a lot of people can relate to any of the characters in this book.Each person comes across one or more problems that I find a lot of people dealing with in every day life.I think this book would be good for people who are in similar situations.This books tells about what it's like for black people in a town of racist whites,what it's like for a deaf person to live in a world of silence,of a little girl's dream to play and write music.The book tells of many other things also.Most of all I recommend this to anyone who would like to read a great novel."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book, which reminded me of To Kill a Mockingbird even though the two are completely unrelated, was very good.

The story is more driven by characters than by plot and there is no doubt that it is a sad, slow story where race, politics, and poverty converge.My disappointment is not with the book itself, but with its placement on the The Publishing Triangle's list of 100 best lesbian and gay novels. Modern readers expecting gay/lesbian content will be disappointed. It is possible to construe Singer's behavior as motivated by same-sex affection, but that is the only portion of the story with a gay subtext; many readers may not even read Singer as gay. Granted, at the time the novel was written, gay content was often coded, but there are other novels from the same period with much clearer gay/lesbian content. While it appears McCullers had feelings for another woman that does not qualify her works as gay/lesbian \\"novels\\"; perhaps a list of gay/lesbian novelists is a more appropriate place for McCullers works"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"this turned out to be one of those books that i purposely read slower and slower as i get to the final chapters because i did not want the story to end. this book definitely goes into my top three all time favorite books. it's amazing how the characters all feed off the character of the deaf mute, a compassionate man who is just as desperately lonely as the four misfits who come to depend on him. the characters became so real to me. i would give ANYTHING to write like this. it was painful to witness mick's transformation from a child with endless plans and ambitions to a work weary adult sacrificing for her family. it was hard to read about blount's seemingly never-ending frustration and anger, finding the only person who felt the same way as him, dr. copeland, impossible to talk to. the saddest was dr. copeland, a man so committed to his belief in his mission that it cost him his family, his health and peace of mind. biff was a mystery i thoroughly enjoyed. but like the others, i fell a little in love with john singer, with his capacity of patience and compassion to those around him. it's a story i will never forget."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I thought I would be bored listening to an audio book and not pay attention. I listened to this while driving 1200 miles in one weekend. It was the nicest, incredibly long drive I've ever had. The book is a little dark but I was impressed with the writing, especially since Carson McCullers was only 23 when she wrote it. My book club had selected this book and I don't think I would have listened to it otherwise. Although, I like lighter Southern Genre books. Still, having grown up in the South, I thought it was a pretty realistic portrayal of the times and the people. But just one tragedy after another and from what I have read about McCullers, somewhat autobiographical."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is simply one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. It catches the rhythm of life for the lonely 'invisible' people, and its emotion is conveyed so forcefully that the tragedy becomes cathartic. Buy this book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is set in a small, indistinct southern town, full of misfits -- people who don't feel like they quite fit in anywhere -- with different desires and dreams. A lot of what McCullers focuses on is the inability of individuals to express themselves to others. Instead, they put their energies towards self-destructive habits such as drinking, fighting, and sexual depravity.Two of the main characters are Mick Kelly and John Singer. Mick is a young tomboy who comes of age in the story. She doesn't have money for instruments or lessons, but she goes through a deeply personal attempt to find the kind of happiness and beauty she finds from musical expression. Mick, like many of the townspeople, finds beauty and intrigue in the deaf mute, John Singer. John Singer leads a quiet life, but is deeply troubled by the loss of his longtime friend Anatopolous, who is also a deaf mute. John Singer becomes a mystical figure to the townspeople, becoming a projection of each individual's personal desires. Part of his mysticism forms around the fact that he is a deaf mute, therefore communication is limited, mostly a one-way event. People pour all their wishes and dreams into their projections of him.Amazingly, Carson McCullers was only 23 when this book was published. How a person that young (well, my age, in fact) could write with such an insightful view of humanity, as well as politics, art & music is impressive. Her prose is descriptive, but at the same time spare. The narrator of the book gives a limited-omniscient view, so while you know what each character might think, you feel you only are scratching the surface of their thoughts. In many cases, what you find is that the individuals themselves don't quite understand their own motives or desires.This book in many ways reminds me of Sherwood Anderson's classic novel, Winesburg, Ohio. It shares commonality in narrative style, themes of isolation, loneliness and the inability to express everything in words. The power of these books is not in what is said or the events themselves, but the things left unexplained, what we are prompted to think about as a result. I enjoyed Heart Is a Lonely Hunter very much, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy! Another book I need to recommend -- completely unrelated to Carson McCullers, but very much on my mind since I purchased a \\"used\\" copy off Amazon is \\"The Losers' Club: Complete Restored Edition,\\" an odd, engaging, highly entertaining little novel I can't stop thinking about."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book is set in a small, indistinct southern town, full of misfits -- people who don't feel like they quite fit in anywhere -- with different desires and dreams. A lot of what McCullers focuses on is the inability of individuals to express themselves to others. Instead, they put their energies towards self-destructive habits such as drinking, fighting, and sexual depravity.Two of the main characters are Mick Kelly and John Singer. Mick is a young tomboy who comes of age in the story. She doesn't have money for instruments or lessons, but she goes through a deeply personal attempt to find the kind of happiness and beauty she finds from musical expression. Mick, like many of the townspeople, finds beauty and intrigue in the deaf mute, John Singer. John Singer leads a quiet life, but is deeply troubled by the loss of his longtime friend Anatopolous, who is also a deaf mute. John Singer becomes a mystical figure to the townspeople, becoming a projection of each individual's personal desires. Part of his mysticism forms around the fact that he is a deaf mute, therefore communication is limited, mostly a one-way event. People pour all their wishes and dreams into their projections of him.Amazingly, Carson McCullers was only 23 when this book was published. How a person that young (well, my age, in fact) could write with such an insightful view of humanity, as well as politics, art & music is impressive. Her prose is descriptive, but at the same time spare. The narrator of the book gives a limited-omniscient view, so while you know what each character might think, you feel you only are scratching the surface of their thoughts. In many cases, what you find is that the individuals themselves don't quite understand their own motives or desires.This book in many ways reminds me of Sherwood Anderson's classic novel, Winesburg, Ohio. It shares commonality in narrative style, themes of isolation, loneliness and the inability to express everything in words. The power of these books is not in what is said or the events themselves, but the things left unexplained, what we are prompted to think about as a result. I enjoyed Heart Is a Lonely Hunter very much, but try it for yourself! Pick up a copy!

This is alleviated by the most unlikely character, whom the others are finally able to relate to. Set in the depression era south, a few of these characters have some radical political beliefs, but I think that is understandable given their economic situation. I listened to the unabridged audio version and it was extremely well done."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I can totally understand now why this is an 'Oprah Pick'. It is a magnificent piece of work, masterfully written (though it was originally published in the '40's). I applaud this pick as a hard to put down wonderfully written book.It is a wonderful memoir and very memorable in the prolific pages. I rank it up there with \\"He Never Called Again\\",\\"A Child Called It\\" for it's integrity to the story. I highly recommend this book.Thank you Oprah!!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson McCullers is the voice of a generation. Better than Salinger by far. So moving and disturbing. If you haven't read this yet, get thee to a bookstore ASAP!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I enjoyed this book. To those who find it too depressing, I would like to say that anything that deserves to be designated as &quot;literature&quot; irritates the reader. I recommend this book to anyone who looks for reading material that is not just entertaining or funny, but for something that enriches their minds."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I'm surprised at the spate of negative reviews. It wasn't the greatest book ever, and I certainly don't agree with what it says on the jacket about McCullers being &quot;the most enduring of all the Southern writers&quot; but the book has a lot of really great insight and it was obviously meant to be have a low key, lazy pace, aimless....just like the South itself.I admire the style, I especially appreciated how, eventhough it was all written from a third person limited omniscient perspective, that the voice of the writing subtly changed to suit the clip of the character in the chapter.Not just any writer can do that."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book in one sitting. Oprah made a good choice. The heart is a lonely hunter and the story teaches not to see through people beacause you never know who you could meet. A deaf mute could be one of the best people to know in the world. You never know what he has been through in his life."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The book asks many questions, answers few and just refuses to reach any kind of conclusion on anything.It's standing at #17 in the Modern Library Top 100 borders on the absurd"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Please take the time to consider what kind of reader you are. I hated this book. It took me at least 6 months to read this because I could not force myself to read it. But that being said I also hate stream of consciousness and now wished that I had looked at some reviews and realized that was what I was getting myself into. I read 'As I Lay Dying' in High School and hated it too. There is no plot, and no point. I hated it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Oprah's book club has lost a lot of its credibility with this book.This book just seemed to go on and on and on without anything really happening.It babbled on for something like 360 pages to document the following things: A quasi-homosexual relationship between two mutes; A revolutionary drunk; A snotty, pretentious doctor who babbled on about Karl Marx (*yawn*-- how long is it going to be before people let him go?); A white trash girl who loved music.Save your money (and your time)."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is the most boring book I have ever read. I kept hoping something would happen and nothing ever did. I only cared about two of the characters out of about 5 featured and I was shocked to find that nothing ever really brought them together. I wasn't expecting a John Grisham thriller here, but I did expect to at least enjoy reading the book or even have something to think about after I was finished. By the time the last 20 pages came, I found myself just skimming to get to the end so that I could say I finished it and that my opinion was valid. All I thought about was how many hours I wasted reading it. Sorry, but it was that bad!!!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is not the kind of book that the average Oprah-watcher likes to read and understand. That's why so many complains. Oprah-readers like fast and shallow books, and she has disappointed them picking profound and complex novels -- like this one and Anna Karenina. I think it is great that this lady want people to read, but she must realize that most of her audience is not able to read complex novels -- let alone classics.And regarding the 'comunism' in this novel... please, the 50s are over. It is really narrow mind of a person to say such a thing a of book in the XXI century. Whitch hunting is over!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"My lord, I should have gone with my instincts. I originally thought a book called The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was bound to be a piece of overwrought trash. Then I found out it was one of the best books of the century. What a farce that list is. This woman described a black man's hair as a &quot;woolly cap&quot;. The endless overbearing light-dark motif. Oh, everybody's so lonely. Every other word is &quot;lonely&quot;. Stay away from this book!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Don't let anyone talk you into reading this book. It is truly awful. Anyone who tells you there is some deeper meaning to this book is full of blasphemy. I should know. I wrote a 500-word essay on this book for Honors English and it got an A, and it was nothing but a tissue of random guesses on what the author was trying to say. I don't think anybody knows what the meaning of this book is. They just want to act like they can see something in it that you don't. Just ignore them and read smomething interesting! The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is written in a snobby tone that makes you think you are stupid for not understanding it, but it means NOTHING! This book is nothing but a bunch of random, boring scenes in a bunch of random, boring people's lives. Avoid it at all costs!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"First of all, I would like to praise Carson McCullers for writing that such poise and character exposition but she labeled Deaf characters wrong. As a deaf invividual, I am a culturally and literally novel reader and a teacher of Deaf studies at a community college. I want to clear about real Deaf people in the United States and their perspectives. First, I want to present myths about deafness and its facts. Here is a lisdt of the following myths and facts below:Myth#1: Deaf people are sucidial. They tend to be lonely and uncommunicative among the majority of hearing people.Fact: A very tiny percent of Deaf people are sucidial. They are basically happy human beings. Many of my friends have decent lives along with good jobs, houses, and even cars. In 1950's, there was the very same situations in which we live in today. They do usually communciate with hearing people by writing on pads, speeching, using thru interpreters, and gesturing.Myth#2: Deaf people are slow learners because they can't hear nor speak well.Fact: There's no significent co-relation on intelligence between the hearing people and the deaf counterparts. Most of Deaf people can read and write in despite of any hearing loss and muteness. Again, there is a small minority of deaf people who have mental health histories or emotional disturbances. They do everything except hearing.Myth#3: All deaf people can lipread.Fact: Not all deaf people can do it well. They can only master lipreading skills up to 30% of all words they can detect. The most skilled lipreader can detect up to 70%. Therefore, lipreading is not a very good communication strategy. The best way to communicate is to write on pads or using a certified interpreter.Myth#4: Many deaf people are somewhat lonesome or isolated because they don't like hearing people.Fact: Most deaf people seek for another deaf people in big cities or towns that contain residential schools for the deaf. They can be lonely if you don't let them go what they want. It considers an act of oppression if you keep them at bay from interacting with other deaf people. They do like hearing people as long as they respect their independence and well-being. You can make friends if you are willing to learn sign language. They would appreciate if you show your efforts to talk with them. If they feel somewhat lonely, they would move to the communities where many deaf people work and live without question. I don't know why that such deaf characters decided to stay in that town and let it happened to them.Myth#5: Deaf people seek for your mercy or help.Fact: Again, the majority of Deaf people don't ask for your mercy or help. They are proud and fierce independents. They don't usually beg for money. Peddling is unacceptable today but in the past, they had good reasons to do that because they hardly find decent jobs everywhere. How can they support themselves if you don't offer them? During 1950's, they usually were skilled workers. They did printing newspapers, assembly lines, and driving deliveries. They earned decent wages and salaries, too.Overally, I want to make a clear and simple emphasis to you that not all Deaf people are lonely, unintelligent, uncommunicative, poor, or emotional. So I consider that novel is still invalid and stereotypical. I recommend that you should read other reading materials about Deaf culture and its history and arts which represent more positive and bright sides instead of that rubbish unrealistic novel.Carson, who is in a Heavenly place, I want to let you know that I do appreciate your writing style with good insights about other people in the South but you should have to study deaf people more carefully before starting writing. Sorry, Carson. Hugs."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"A boring book about lonely people and the things lonely people do (nothing). The photo on the cover of the book is perfect, and sums up the feeling through the entire book."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This book was very hard to get into. I didn't like the way the story jumped from one character to another. It was like the author's mind was all over the place when she wrote it. I really didn't understand the point in the story.It took me forever to finish this book,I just had a hard time picking it up again.I eventually did finish it, but was very disappointed in it."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This was the first book that I read by McCullers, but certainly not the last. I loved the characters!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Carson portrays life as it really is. It isn't for those that want to escape reality and expect the happy ending. We are too expectant of fast entertainment that comes cheap and without meaning. This is a book that divulges into the lives of true human beings and their struggles. I found it profoundly moving. It was a book that really did catch the essence of human feeling such as loneliness and the struggle for something true in life. Overall, I found this an excellent read."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I would not recommend this book to anybody who does not enjoy reading for the sole joy of it.(If you are forced to read it, you'll hate it) i read it because it was here with me and i like to read, and lo and behold it became my honors research paper. Not a big adventure novel, but it impressed me."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"i had to read it for school, but it turned out to actually be pretty good. i love how mccullers can completely relate and explain the human condition of solitude, lonliness, and hope.

I re-read it recently, and found it even more beautiful. It takes us to the meaning of loneliness and love in ways that other books don't. If you can appreciate works that pack a lot of meaning into the limited actions of characters (It's not a thriller, gang) and ask the reader to associate rather than merely see, you'll love this book. My favorite book is a toss up between this and To Kill a Mockingbird."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I read this book because it was voted in the top 100 of all time. I'm trying to expand on the kind of popular fiction I usually read. While I found the book insightful and well-written, it was very depressing. I kept waiting for something &quot;good&quot; to happen to somebody. I did think the book's various plots were remarkable for its time (1940)."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I am a teenager from Missouri, and I chose to read The Heart is a Lonely Hunter from my summer reading list freshman year. I enjoy many classic novels, but I found this one to be extremely slow-paced and boring. Everytime you think that something interesting happens, or it does, it just ends there and picks up on another uninteresting scene. I think Carson had a nice writing style, but maybe should have worked on her creativity."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"I always love delving into a well-written, even complex book and getting into the minds of the characters. I was not bored or disappointed at all by this book.

Plus, I mostly read adult murders by Patricia Cornwell, Robin Cook, etc. I had to read this book for my honors english class and I find this book very entertaining, insightful, and somewhat depressing, especially about all the lonliness."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Overall I liked The Heart is a Lonely Hunter. It started out kind of slow but got better towards the end. It was kinda shocking at some parts, but that was what made the book enjoyable. I was surprised that everyone seemed to revolve around Singer. I thought Mick would be the main character. After I was finished with the book, I sat back and thought about all the troubles and feeling of isolation that all the characters had to go through. All in all, I thought it was pretty good."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is great. But I was expecting the one that has McCullers on the cover.

I ordered the books for one of my academic teams and was surprised with the price. The overall experience with the seller made it a pleasure!"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"This is a classic and has been well critiqued by many more versed than myself. It's a very interior book in that it's more about what happens in the minds of the characters. The setting, during the segregated south, is perfect for this sort of torturous outward/inward life these people endured. Yes, it's depressing, but McCullers very convincingly takes you to these strange places in the minds of her characters. This historical aspect, while familiar in a textbook sense, really makes you feel the agony of it all."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"Its reputation as one of the great depressing American novels notwithstanding, \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\" offers unexpected riches, presenting the \\"Southern Gothic\\" style at its most accessible and immediate as well as multiple story arcs that flow rather seamlessly toward a common end. Yes, it's depressing, and wantonly so at that. So, too often, is life.The four characters whose story arcs make up \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\" converge on one man, friend to all but known by none, a deaf-mute named John Singer. Is it his tranquil, compassionate face that stirs the four divergent characters to seek him out? Or is his voiceless condition an opportunity for them to see in him what they want, and disregard the rest?Carson McCullers was a young woman just finding herself when she published this in 1940. Knowing this, it's easy to recognize her in the character of Mick Kelly, a young girl taking a larger view of life through art. In Mick's case, music is her muse.At one point Mick catches an orchestral piece on Singer's radio. What Singer is doing with a radio is just one of many questions that identify him as a kind of secular Christ-figure, finding joy only by giving to others. Mick's reaction seems to capture some of the pain behind McCullers' worldview.\\"Wonderful music like this was the worst hurt there could be. The whole world was this symphony, and there was not enough of her to listen.\\"Some will find that sentiment twee and quaint, but it is backed up by a book that seems to work like a symphonic piece, its four movements running simultaneously rather than sequentially, and assorted common motifs and themes darting in and out. One can't help thinking of a Robert Altman film, or a really good episode of \\"The Office\\", working their magic along similar lines. But McCullers got there first.What doesn't move me? I thought the ending a little abrupt and too \\"Richard Cory\\" for its own good. Others say it's the book's greatest moment, but to me it was a cheap out. Mick has a sexual experience so tastefully written it seems to take place only in her head, though I don't think that was the author's intention. The character I was most interested in, caf&eacute; owner Biff Brannon, is never developed in the same deep way as the other three core players and seemed mostly employed as a narrative device for processing observations.\\"Do not attempt to stand alone\\" says the black Marxist, Doctor Copeland, even though its advice he's in no position to heed. His story, and that of the more radically-minded Jake Blount, give the novel much of its passion, its best lines, and root it firmly in the pre-World War II period where depression at home and fascism abroad were challenging what Americans believed about themselves. McCullers is too smart and too focused to allow communism to be presented as the be-all answer; it's one of the book's many ironies that two such like-minded fellows find so much about which they can violently disagree.The book is, like the title suggests, an essay on loneliness, one that sidesteps incident (though wild things do happen) for character and an overriding sense of existential ache. It's not everyone's cup of tea, but blue-minded people will find a lot to commiserate with here."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"My first impression of McCullers' The Heart is a Lonely Hunter was amazement: amazement that a twenty-three year old woman had both the life experience and writing skills to craft such a book. In terse, no nonsense sentences McCullers tells a haunting story of friendships strange and unlikely. The story opens with the relationship between the deaf mute, John Singer and his mute friend Spiros Antonapoulus. Their handicaps seem to be the only thing they have in common. Spiros is a slow-witted fellow much like Lennie in Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men; Singer is a compassionate loner who takes Spiros into his care and even though the two are separated, remains devoted to his friend until the end. Whether it is Singer's compassionate nature or the fact that in spite of his handicap he appears to understand and empathize with others, he acquires a following of damaged and wounded souls: young Mick Kelly (perhaps the author herself) who loves music and aspires to compose and play the piano; Jake Blount whose political idealism drives him to berserk rants; the Negro doctor Benedict Mady Copeland equally idealistic and crazed about leading his \\"people\\" out of ignorance and poverty and sacrifices his health in doing so; and Biff Brannon, owner of the New York Cafe and widower whose own loneliness is eased by the presence of the deaf mute. Singer becomes a sort of kingpin in these characters' lives and satisfies a hungry need in each. When Singer abruptly leaves the story in the manner of E. A. Robinson's Richard Cory, his four disciples are devastated and cast helplessly upon the winds of their own lives.There is something about the South that makes its authors twist stories and characters to the bizarre. In The Heart is a Lonely Hunter McCullers' tale is steeped in this gothic darkness: Bubber's accidental shooting of Baby Wilson; Copeland's son Willie loses his \\"feets\\" to amputation, the effect of cruel and inhumane treatment by his white jailors. McCullers' South is the South of Flannery O'Connor and Tennessee Williams. But because we are human and once young, we are moved to pathos by young Mick Kelly's two rooms: her \\"inside\\" room where she holds her dreams in safe keeping, a room that only Singer is allowed to enter and her \\"outside\\" room, which is life, its ugliness, disappointments and dashed hopes. As the door shuts on Mick's inside room, we mourn for her. And we mourn for ourselves."},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"i simply drifted away ... i almost lost connection with the real world ... one of the best"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"\\"In the town there were two mutes, and they were always together.\\" This opening line in Carson McCullers \\"The Heart Is A Lonely Hunter\\" lured me into a world of discovery. The story isn't one of adventure nor is it the revealing of a crime committed. The author simply sets you in a small community of 1930's southern culture and presents everyday characters in everyday circumstances. What the reader discovers is how different people and circumstances mixed into the same pot can produce a flavorful brew.Thanks to the writing of McCullers, the meal in this book tastes like a home cooked southern meal with all the trimmings. I believe the author set a slow pace to the story to allow for easier digestion as well as contemplation of what ingredients went into the meal.The talent of a gifted writer is to be able to describe a place and people to their audience with honesty. Carson McCullers does this to perfection in this book. Though we as readers may not fully understand all the parts people play in this book, McCullers was aware of every detail she put into the making of her creation.I wasn't taken so much by the story as I was by the writing. I could have put the story down at the half-way mark and read something more exciting, but with a style of writing like McCullers you miss it as soon as you begin reading something else.To be in the presence of great literature is to discover the shortcomings of our own thinking and ideas. 3.5 stars"},{"Title":"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter","review":"The story and the characters are so quirky, I found it very difficult to get really interested----picking it up and putting it down numerous times, until I made it about half-way through.
