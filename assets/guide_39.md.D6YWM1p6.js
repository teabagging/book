Bradbury's writing is powerful and at times nerve wracking as he takes us through fireman Montag's conversion from a book burning drone to one who wants to read and preserve them. Through his almost stream of consciousness writing, his edgy use of adverbs which create powerful images, Bradbury builds the suspense and action at a breakneck speed. Bradbury is prophetic in characterizing how modern technology can turn humans into mindless, manipulated morons. The TV screens surrounding the typical home in the novel are eerily familiar to the way reality shows today envelop the minds of their viewers, making them obsess on meaningless and mindless things like which rich wife yelled at whom, while those in power create and manipulte the world for us for their own ends."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Even though this book was written 60 years ago it's amazing how much it still applies to today. In Montag's world books were not only banned but destroyed, burned to ashes along with the house they were held in and in many cases the people who hid them. The government says that books are silly and the words meaningless yet destroys them all proving that someone in authority firmly believes that a book is a dangerous thing. Which is actually what happens. Montag meets a girl who society deems 'crazy' and she puts a little thought in his head. Next thing he knows he is questioning why. Why he is a fireman. Why the books are so dangerous. Why Why Why. Questions that to maintain peace and balance should not be asked.Overall I found that I enjoyed this book despite it being totally different from what I am used to reading even though many times I had to read a paragraph over again because I missed some thing that ended up being important. I found Montag's discovery of himself and nature a bit hard to follow. His journey to discovery read a lot like descent into madness which I thought was hard at times to follow. I did like that this book was thought provoking and I plan to follow up with searching for some discussion web pages to see other people's interpretations. A book you definitely need to read at least once in your lifetime."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book is filled with action and suspense. If you like a book that has many twists and turns, then you'll enjoy this book by Ray Bradberry. He tried to write about what he thought would be the worst future, with no books. They would set books onfire, because to read and poses a book is unlawful. The people believed that books made people upset, think up different ideas, and unequal. The firefighters we know now would set things on fire, not put out the fire like they do now. This book is fairly easy to understand, middle schoollers should be able to understand the vocabulary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is a perfect example of a science fiction book. This book is about the life of a fire fighter named Guy Montag who lives in a futuristic city where books are banned. The job of fire fighters in his view of the future are to set books and the houses they are hiding in on fire. The reasoning for this is that books are said to be evil and contain many different thoughts and emotions that are considered \\"dangerous\\" if people are exposed to them. This book pretty difficult to read based on its challenging vocabulary and its confusing situations. I would recommend this book to people no younger than 7th grade based on the content of the book, and I would recommend it to people with a strong interest in science fiction and futuristic books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not being a passionate Science Fiction reader, I did not enjoy Bradbury's writing ideas and form. I found this book to be a very slow read, not moving very fast. Some of Bradbury's ideas did not seem to fit into the story. I found this story to be too far into the future to relate to. I found the action of burning books to be very unreal in any society. I have read some other stories from Bradbury and part of one of his other books, Dandelion Wine, and Fahrenheit 451 did not match up to some of Bradbury's other works."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"THIS SHyT IS FREAKY AND REALLY COOL YOU SHOULD GIVE IT A TRY YOU WILL LIKE IT TRUST ME"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well while waiting for a late friend I happened to be wanderingaround a bookstore when this book caught my eye.

I did enjoy reading about a dystopian society, but altogether, the book is tedious and slow-moving."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is more important today than it was on the day it was written: it is terrifying to see how many things described in this book are coming to pass. It makes you wonder if a future in which books are burned and readers are chased like criminals is indeed so impossible or fantastic. This is in fact one of those books with &quot;plenty of ideas per square inch,&quot; so much so, one could be discussing it for days, and indeed using more than the 1,000 words you are allowed to use here: the character of Beatty, who sincerely believes that books make you unhappy (and of course, he is right), but at the same time he's aware of the fact that books also give you power; the dislike of controversy and all things &quot;difficult;&quot; the hate directed against outstanding people; the watering down of art and literature through political correctness; the brainwashed TV people who think themselves happy but are in fact dissatisfied and violent...I find this book very moving and not &quot;confusing&quot; at all. In fact it is written in a very clean and economic style, with all that purple prose that ruins so many other books by Bradbury kept to the minimum. If you liked this book, check out the movie by Franois Truffault. If you missed Clarisse in the book, you will be glad to know that Truffault thought the same and her role in the movie is much more developed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic novel that depicts a haunting totalitarian society that practices censorship and destroys individual thought. The book follows fireman Guy Montag, whose job it is to start fires to burn homes with books rather than put out fires. After Montag has conversations with an old English professor and a young girl named Clarisse who both have the rare gift of being able to think for themselves, Montag begins to question his life. He realizes that there is something missing and that he is greatly unhappy, and he feels that whatever he is missing can be found in the books. In a since, he is write. Montag begins to realize the importance of ideas and things such as books, and decides to try to change the ways of his society.Bradbury clearly paints a terrorizing image in the reader's mind of this all-powerful, brain-washing society. Through his strong use of metaphors, the reader is able to better understand the complex feelings and emotions of the characters that would otherwise be difficult to describe. The division of the book helps the reader watch the main character, Montag, progress and develop. The first part focuses on his realization that he is empty and lacking something, and he starts to realize just what he's missing. In the second part, he discovers the importance of the books(ideas) and why he and society are empty without them. The third part focuses on his attempt to create change.Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written, thought-provoking novel that gives society a warning about censorship and losing individual thought that should not be ingonored."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Mr. Bradbury's prophetic work has come to pass in the politically correct world of thought controlled by political expediency and special interests.Enter a day when words and thoughts that might offend are banned. If ignorance is bliss we should never be happier. Few books of fiction speak so clearly to our political and social climate of today. Would somebody please memorize this book? It too may be banned one day."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This somber book, with its theme of government-encouraged anti-intellectualism, was written during an age when \\"eggheads\\" were suspected of being subversive somehow, maybe even godless commies. This distrust of intelligence and non-conformity is taken to the extreme by Bradbury, with stark and memorable results. By discouraging education and all forms of intelligent discourse, the future government is able to control the population not merely by force or threats, but by providing an endless flow of mindless entertainment, which (nearly) everyone happily accepts. Like sheep before the slaughter, the placated citizenry of Fahrenheit 451 simply doesn't know any better than to believe what the government pronounces at face value. This perverse form of \\"mind control\\"- enforced by keeping minds happily engaged in only the most trivial of pursuits- works only too well, since it is far easier to remain ignorant than struggle to form an opposing opinion that might require courage to express. And by burning the last remaining learning tools that threaten its empire- books- the government tries to erase the possibility that anyone could stir an uprising based on ancient philosophical principles such as democracy, liberty, and self-determination.Ignorance becomes not only bliss, but a frightening way of life.Bradbury is one of the original \\"Golden Age\\" science fiction writers, and that shows in this book. There's the element of the fantastic in the everyday gadgets here, more speculation and wonder that science. For this reason, it doesn't quite have the realistic edge that most mainstream fiction has, although the philosophical themes in the book elevate it to mainstream status.

Tolkein. (And yes, i understand, you can't compare the two) Fahrenheit 451 is filled to the brim with metaphors and things that seem so outlandish, that they fit with the whole aura of the novel. Now, even though, it is a very small novel, it packs a very lasting punch.According to the world(it might be our world in the future) that Bradbury created, the U.S. and possibly everyone else, hes become so automated that the people had no use for knowledge anymore! Thus, books were for burning. Thus, the title Fahrenheit 451 (the degree that paper burns). Also, the reason that books were burnt was that there were conflicting ideas in them.Ray Bradbury has created this horribly believable and yet extremely frightening FUTURE for the United States, in my opinion! Also, ity deals very slightly with the effects of war, and the fact that ALL other countries hate the U.S. in the story. (that never helps)Over all, i would reccommend this as a quick read that will make an impression on you for a LONG, LONG, LONG, long time.ENJOY, i give it five stars :)~~:)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Encouraged by a co-worker I revisited this classic, perfect for easy summertime reading. Its fun is in its portrait of future technology that has now become commonplace. But it also remains a thought-provoking piece about what it means to be human, happy and a healthy society. It's not just about book burning. Unfortunately, Cold War references really date the book. If your only notion of this Bradbury masterpiece is the movie, you don't really know what's in the book at all. Check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's book is poetic in its description of a future world lacking emotion, human connection, and intellectual depth. Firemen burn books; televisions, ear piece radios, and amusement parks provide distraction; and citizens self-medicate to suppress unhappiness. The background of war is ever present and frightening. The very beginning of the book requires patience. It takes some time to understand what is occuring. The book is absolutely worth the time and effort. Readers may or may not agree with all of the political messages, but the world that is created is disturbingly similar to our own in many ways."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this book was awsome! the ideas and points brought up in this novel by bradbury reflects our own society today"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is fun, enjoyable reading. The story from Bradbury's imagination causes the reader to think... Why are books so important? Why is censorship dangerous? Why is the individual more important than the society? Why are mindless activities (such as television overdose) harmful and unprofitable? The author writes of treasures that our society takes for granted, and shows how these riches should be guarded and appreciated- not ignored.In the 50th anniversary edition of the book, the author writes an afterword about the different ways that books are \`burned' today. This censorship is not as evident as the censorship depicted in the story of Montag, but it is still happening. Bradbury suggests that political correctness has served as a censor to art. Authors and readers alike are afraid of offending someone, therefore art has been reduced to little more than People magazines and reality TV shows. Bradbury writes that it is difficult for \\"any author who dares to speak above a whisper or write above a nursery rhyme.\\" Also included at the end of the book is an interview with Ray Bradbury. This is an excellent 10-pages of interaction with the author.Will censorship ever get as radical as what happened to Montag? I doubt it. But the story is fun, and the reader should put the book down with a new respect for thinking, learning and freedom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 written by Ray Bradbury was in the Science Fiction section and was located in the future. Guy Montag was a fireman, but in the future they do not put out fires, they they start them. Guy is trying to figure out his hard and confusing life in the future. When he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan who changes everything and gives him a new point of view of the world.What I like most about this book was the setting and the time, the future makes you wonder about what you're living in now and what might happen in the future. What I didn't like about the book was that it was a little hard and confusing at times for my age reading.My favorite charater in this book was Clarisse McCellan because she has such a different mind than everyone else and sees things in different perspectives. A paragraph that meant something to me was on page 37 and said \\"Books bombarded his shoulders, his arms, his upturned face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his hands, wings fluttering. In the dim light, a page flung open and it was like a snow feather, the words delicately painted thereon.\\" It meant something to me beacause all of these books around him makes him wonder about his job, life, and Clarisse and what she had said.I would tell someone about this book that it is great but to read it at a good reading level. So it's not too hard or confusing to read. The only question I have after reading this is, in some ways is Beatty the villan of Station 451? My strongest reason for recommending this book is that it describes each pararaph beautifully and has a great plot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sure, this book gives some harsh warnings about the desensitization of our culture and the withering away of intellectual importance, but its radical premise detracts from the story's legitimacy and worth. Bradbury anticipates a complete elimination of all books and literature, and I do agree that we are moving in a more automated, fast-paced society with less emphasis on love and personal relationships. But we will never reach such an extreme level, its simply a rediculous concept. I contest that we cannot worry about whether others are getting their daily dose of Shakespeare, Joyce or the Bible, and if we choose to read on our own, we will always have the chance to do so. I imagine that if you are reading this review, you don't run a high risk of losing interest in books in your lifetime. Yes, Bradbury does offer a striking prophesy of the direction of societal development, but to use this book as the basis for an outrcy against our culture's future is ludicrous."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a huge science fiction fan and heard from many people that this is one of the ultimate Sci-fi classics.

At least the Martian Chronicles was creative, had an emotional core, kept me captivated. The only thing creative about Farenheit 451 is its title. It paints a blurry picture of a simply boring civilization. I found myself not really caring what happened to Guy and Mildred and all the rest. There is no real prophetic vision as there is in say, Huxley's Brave New World, which gives a vivid depiction of a fully-fleshed out and interesting futuristic world, unlike Bradbury's, which is quite similar to any modern town that would exist when the book was written. Also unlike Brave New World, F451 isn't even very compelling, as censorship nowadays is much less of an issue than the genetic engineering and other issues Huxley raises. Overall, a thorougly unsatisfying and overhyped novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book about firemen burning books. The story is quite fascinating but the way Bradbury works it along is a little confusing. The storyline- Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books and is very proud of his job, that is until one day he meets a girl named Clarrisse and an old man. The story is basically what he decides to do in order to find out why books were banned and what is inside a book that leads people to love them or hate them. The confusing part of this book is that it leaves you thinking &quot;Ok, What just happened?&quot;. I recall that more than once I had to re-read a page 4 times and still couldn't figure out what happened. I'm guessing that the reason this book is so confusing is that it takes place in the future yet sometimes it seems so old (probably because it was written awhile ago). You sit there thinking &quot;Is this the real world (in the novel) or are they discussing the past, or are they discussing the future?&quot;. If you happen to watch the movie of Fahrenheit 451, watch it after you read the book, or better yet, don't watch it at all.

Ehh... and I really don't admire reading that much. I can compare this futuristic story with that of Huxley's Brave New World and Orwell's 1984, both of which I read right before this one. I kind of think that this one was totally more interesting that the other two, no doubt about it. It's primarily about a fireman, Montag, who works for a book-burning fire deparment. One day the thought of reading those books that he burns crosses his minds. As a result, he steals some and hides them in his home. His wife, Mildred, reports him and all of a sudden he becomes a wanted fugitive. You wanna know how to the book ends?

It did not matter if there people in them or not. As the story developes, Montag becomes curious about what the prohibited books contain, so he steals them. Towards the end of the book he gets caught and becomes a fugitive. Although the book has a good message, it was extremely boring. It made us reflect on our own lifestyles, yet we didn't enjoy the way Bradbury wrote it. It was dry and basically boring. Yet the theme about finding our humanity and ourselves was eye opening. It made us wonder if our civilization will end up as Bradbury's novel depicts. Will we end up, so wrapped up in ourselves and our technology that we will no longer have time to love others and have a mind of our own?

It really makes you think about what is actually happeningBFont"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you wish to read an Orwellian, dystopian novel set in the future, read the novels by George Orwell himself, 1984 and Animal Farm. Undoubtedly, Fahrenheit 451 is a classic and I guess required reading, if only for completenes, but it certainly failed to hold my interest. I found the writing to be a little more fluffy than what I find enjoyable and the plot is remarkably thin, unlike the richly constructed 1984 and the taut Animal Farm. I'm afraid I can't call myself a Bradbury fan just yet."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the signs of a great book, in my opinion, is that it disturbs you - twists with your emotions and never leaves you. More importantly, that it makes you think.Farenheit 451 does this and more. As I read it, it horrified me how much it applies to today's society. People are always offended about one thing, or they want you to delete that. Some people detest reading at all and are content to spend their days watching sitcoms - most of which are not funny and have no point to them whatsoever. These days, people seem to be longing for an easy, brainless, sacchrine happiness and existence. Farenheit 451 shows what happens when those people get their wish.A must-read for anybody of any age - five stars from me! If you like it, and haven't already read other books of this genre (dystopias and such) - may I also recommend 1984 by George Orwell, Anthem by Ayn Rand, and The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The real purpose of burning the books is clearly explained by Montag's boss himself. Those books present opinions that might upset different social, racial, etc. groups. Look at our society where polical correctness so oftent replaces the facts, the truth, and just plain common sense. False sense of social stability achieved this way is the same fallacy that is so brilliantly explored in this book. Extremely relevant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This, I'm sad to say, was the first time I'd taken the time to read a Bradbury novel. I had no idea what I was missing! This book deserves the status of a classic, all right. It has memorable characters, vivid sentences and scenes, and holds a mirror to the errors of society. Though fifty years old, the book is surprisingly modern in its perceptions.The story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. His job is to start fires, rather than put them out. When the station receives calls about homes that harbor books, the Salamander fire engine races out with kerosene hoses to douse the residence and destroy the threatening pages.What is really under attack in Montag's world is thought, intellectualism, connection between people. The effects of TV and useless trivia, the conflict between art and entertainment, are highlighted here in the flames of Montag's burning. When Montag turns the corner, deciding to combat this world gone mad, he faces deep and long-lasting consequences. And the world will never be the same.Bradbury succeeds in writing a very personal, yet very global tale. The heat of this novel still emanates today. Pick up this book--at the risk of feeling the heat!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this book is so great it makes me want to read more, it inspired me to read because its about about not being able to read books and fighting for the right to do so"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked the book Fahrenheit 451. This book takes place in a futuristic American city. In the book, the main character, Guy Montag, works for a fire station. But instead of putting out fires, they start them. The book is about this group of firemen who find people that own books, go to their house, and burn them. Guys wife, Mildred, is a completely opposite character. She is a woman with absolutly no life at all, she prefers to watch tv in their parlor room all day, and listen to the radio in her &quot;seeshell radio&quot;, that is attached to her ear. Mildred seems to be a completely empty person, and doesnt even realize it when she tries to commit suicide. Beatty, Montags fire chief, is the leader of this group that burn books. As he notices that Guy is starting to realize what books have to offer, Beatty gets more and more curious as to what Guy is really doing on his days off. These two turn out to be enemies towards the end of the book, because of Guys new love of books. In the beginning of the book, Guy meets a seventeen year old girl, named Clarise. Clarise is a different kind of girl for her age in this society. She is more in touch with herself and nature and the people around her. Everyone in this society is completely opposite of that, and consider Clarise an outsider. A few days after Guy meets Clarise, she is killed by a speeding car. When Guys love for books exceeds his passion to burn them, Guy sees an old english professor for help. When Beatty finds out what Guy is up to, he sends the fire department to Guys house. Beatty forces Guy to burn his own house down because of having the books, then places Guy under arrest. Guy takes the flamethrower and burns Beatty to ashes, and knocks out the rest of the members of the fire department. His last obsticle is the Mechanical Hound, which is a machine set to find people that have escaped from the police and fire department. Before Beatty was killed, he had set the hound to find Guy. After Guy is done with the fire department, the Hound finds Guy. The Hound leaps at Guy and injects anesthetic into Guys leg, to get him to stop running. Guy manages to burn the hound and get away. Guy meets a group of people like himself, runaways from the city who enjoy books. The point of this book I think is a possibility of what computers might do to civilization. With the ever expanding computer technololgy we have, books are starting to phase themselves out. They portrayed this in the book by saying that books were written to offend people and had to be rid of. This was a good yet different interpretation of what the future of our society can become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book about the world in the future. This book really made me think about how the world would really be. Will there ever be a time when books will not be allowed?

This is a great book to read and it really makes you think.Fahrenheit 451 is about a time when books are banned from the world. Anyone with books will get their house burned down by the fire department. The cars are really fast and everyone cares only about themselves. Montag, the main character in the book, is on the fire department. He likes to burn books, until he reads a few.

The brillant start to book about burning and changing not only sets up the book's major themes, it also foreshadows Montag's transformation. Then the book offers an exciting plot with a backdrop of an intriguing false utopia. Suddenly the book ends -thirty pages before it actually ends. Bradbury seems to put the last events on cruise control. The contrived ending sort of gives the book a bad after taste.However, this book is fantastic even with the flawed ending. The dialogs surrounding books and the concepts they contain often make the reader pause and reflect. The fact that sitting and reading can be deemed revolutionary is something every reader dreams of.

Eventually one can infer what is going on, but very little is explained plainly.

The thought that the day will come when firemen will burn books instead of putting out fires is original and quite symbolic. There are some subtle highlights throughout the text but on the whole it isn't real exciting or fun. It is short and to the point, however.For me, the real story is in the writing of the text and the history of the author. His story is highly inspirational and fun to read. While the book isn't a real entertainment, it is potent in message and subtlties. There is a wothwhile message awating the thoughtful reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was a great book that I really enjoyed. This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book. By the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker. She helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong.I think that this book is a very good book, it kept me interested the whole time that I read it.It only took me about 3 days to read it and that was between work and school. For those of you kids that have to read a book for a book report this would be my choice."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury delivered an interesting concept. This science fiction was about how books are evil and should be burned. Mr. Bradbury gave us a concept that has never been thought about before. Although this idea is completely original, in this case, the amount of originality put into this book is not directly proportional to how much I enjoyed the book.Fahrenheit 451 is about a man named Guy Montag who is a futuristic fireman. Guy is basically paid to burn books rather than let people read them. To me, this whole concept seems too far fetched. Not only is reading or possessing books illegal but it can be punished severely. Everyone in this book is just too afraid to read books. I did not like this concept because that would never happen, and is never possible. People would always be interested even if, and sometimes especially if, it is illegal. Despite the laws Montag starts reading books illegally when he becomes completely dissatisfied with life. He begins to enjoy reading and tries to show some others about reading but instead they do not understand his super intellect.This book makes the reader think about the plot too much. The author should say what is going on rather than make the reader think too much because the reading might read too far into things and not completely understand. Books became illegal to read when minorities got overly upset about books that offended them. Eventually the minorities came got enough people to agree with them that all books were banished. Books have so much to offer that this idea seems completely unreasonable and stupid to me.Eventually Guy learns to like books. He even derives a plan to turn the world against illiteracy. Guys wife leaves him when he is not around and reports that he has been reading books. The fire department comes to burn his house down with all of the books in it. The force Montag to do it instead. Many of the concepts like this one seem like nothing of that manner would ever occur in reality. Did he not pay for that house. Why would someone burn another's house down for such a meaningless crime as reading books.This book delivers an interesting concept which may be too far fetched for myself. If you are a book and science fiction lover, this may not be the case for yourself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel, Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, is about a man named Guy Montag who is a fireman. Unlike most ordinary firemen, he starts fires instead of puts them out. He burns books. If anyone in their town is caught with even only one book in their house, he comes and set the entire house on fire and lets it all burn to the ground. After a while he meets a girl and starts to fall in love with her. However, she likes books, and she reads them. So, he tries reading a book and he loves it. Then he stops burning them and instead he reads them while they live together. One time his boss came to his house while he was reading his book and he had to hide it. While he was talking his wife was cleaning and almost found the book.At first I thought that this was going to be a pretty good book. It might be kind of exciting, being about burning books and all. Since I personally hate reading then hearing about someone that burns books caught my attention. It turned out to be another boring book.This book would be better suited for older adults that like to read. Books that kids are required to read should be fun and exciting books not any of these boring books. There are plenty of books out there that would be much more interesting to read than the ones that we do read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book because i enjoyed the futuristic ideas in Bradbury's &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; This novel was a good thoughtful book but a little too slow-paced.

So the firemen end up burning her house, the books that were in it, and the old lady. That made him think that there must have been something in those books worth dying for.

When I was halfway through I was warming to it. I thought about how a lot of Ray Bradbury's predictions have come true, and I geared myself up for a spectacular ending. Well, that ending never came. Bradbury finishes his book by leaving his main character, Montag, wandering aimlessly through the country, reciting books with some other men. Besides being terribly sexist, this book doesn't have much of a plot, and it leaves what little it has hanging at the end. For instance, my favorite character, Clarisse, disappears. Why doesn't Bradbury have something definite happen to her? It is hinted that she has been run over by a car, but the reader knows nothing specific. This book drove em nuts in its vagueness. You can't tell what are actual happenings in Montag's life, what are metaphors for other happenings, and what are simply Montag's imaginings. This book could be a well-loved book by some readers or a hated book by others. Or it could not have any definite spot in a reader's heart. I, personally, don't love it, but I don't hate it, either. I just don't care either way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my &quot;burn this book&quot; list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named &quot;GUY MONTAG&quot;. How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all &quot;offensive&quot; material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the &quot;family&quot; argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As much as I love Ray Bradbury and all of his books, he should have the good sense to have an actor read Farenheit 451 -- Ray stumbles and mumbles his way through the book, to the point that his beautiful writing loses all it's power and grace. Can't recommend this version, although the last disc is a nice interview with Ray about his writing process."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a classic science fiction novel written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953. This book has followed in the purpose for which the genre of science fiction was created; to predict and speculate about what will happen to humans in the future--and especially--to warn readers away from the less desirable futures. So much of what is written in this book has already or may come to pass that readers may find it disturbing to read.One aspect of Fahrenheit 451 that I thought was particularly well done is its realistic portrayal of human behavior. One instance where this was displayed occurs right after Guy Montag had turned traitor and started both reading and trying to save the books he was supposed to be burning. The very firehouse he worked for programmed a mechanical hound, called simply, the \\"Hound\\" to search for and destroy his DNA code. As the media built up feelings of antipathy and hatred of Guy, the public responded by growing increasingly excited and exultant about seeing him caught and killed, even to the point of following the media's suggestion that everyone check to see if Guy is outside of their house. This, to me, sounds like an accurate representation of human responses to the media's stimuli.Another aspect of Fahrenheit 451 I liked was that the main characters are given backgrounds and histories to make it possible to understand their actions, opinions, beliefs, and morals. For example, the book describes an occasion in Guy Montag's childhood when power was down for an evening and he and his mother used candles instead of electric lights, and talked, instead of watching TV, which helps to explain Guys rationalizations for preferring real people and hating the characters on the three-dimensional TV. Also, Clarisse, one of the supporting characters has a very rich past that is highly developed. In her case, this takes on the form of her father and uncle, who greatly influence her opinion and provide the background and embodiment for most of her convictions. They never actually appear in the book, but Clarisse's descriptions of them and constant references to them make them seem almost like characters themselves.One of the things for which this book is the most renowned--and, in my opinion, is its most valuable feature is its philosophy. No matter which opinion is being portrayed, the dialogue and explanation of that philosophy is passionate and convincing. For example, when Guy first goes to the retired Professor Faber, Faber describes three things which men need if humanity is to be truly free. The first is, a wealth of information, the second, time to analyze this information, and the third, the right and ability to act on this information.I have given this book a five-star rating because I consider it to be one of the finest literary works of this century, because not only did he right it with fine character development, but also with a unique plot and profound philosophies."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A great story to pass the time during travel, such as on a plane or in car, because it should only take 2-and-a-half Hours to read. It starts with Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to actually start fires, primarily to burn books and their owner's houses. After being encountered by a strange 17-year old girl who asks not only \\"what\\" things are about but \\"why\\", and witnessing a woman commit suicide by lighting her house (bearing books) on fire rather than let the Firemen do it themselves, he decides there must be something else to books than just words and paper. The story is about his struggles to revive the book world and save it from certain destruction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, the setting is a place in the near future in which reading books is prohibited and being caught with them is punishable. The book begins with Guy Montag, whose job in life is to go around and set fires to houses in which books are being kept. When a woman sets fire to her herself and her house rather then give up her books, Guy starts to question what exactly he is doing. At first he does not believe this is wrong, but when he takes a few books home one day, he is enlightened and realizes that the burning of such great works would be preposterous and their loss monumental. As soon as he has this awakening, he comes under danger due to it.This book is not only about censorship as although it may seem this way. This book portrays an eerie depiction about what the world would be like without some individual freedoms. No one wants to offend anybody in the city that is the setting for the book. Because of this, freedom of speech is limited. The book makes you dig deep into your own mind and really makes you think about how the world could be different.There were many strong points to this book. The first is the interesting and thought provoking plot. Through much excitement in the novel, it keeps you interested until you turn the last page. Another great strong point is the great details. I could truly sense that I was in the book and it played similar to a movie in my head. There is more then enough detail to give you exactly what the author wants you to see, while leaving some to the imagination as well. The only weakness of the book that I found was it starts off a little slow in the beginning, but other then that is an amazing readFahrenheit 451 is a pleasure to read and leaves you wanting more. The book is an instant classic and I suggest anyone who has any interest in science fiction to read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books are insightful and thought-provoking because he writes fictional short stories and novels about the future, with a common theme on how society uses technology. In particular, Bradbury's book, Fahrenheit 451, discusses relevant concerns about applying technology to teaching. In the back of the 50th Anniversary Edition published by Del Rey Books, there is a recent interview with Bradbury where he discusses his concerns about using radio and television in the classroom as a replacement for sound traditional teaching methodologies. When Bradbury wrote the book in the 1950's, he imagines a society where reading is no longer taught. In his recent book interview, Bradbury expresses that he is still concerned about the quality of education today and believes that there is a current problem in the educational system, with less emphasis placed on quality in comparison to when he attended school back in 1926.Many readers feel that the book is about censorship but it actually focuses more specifically upon the idea of freedom. Bradbury says in the interview that he does not regard censorship as a problem within the United States and feels that there are many diverse groups who provide voices for various interests; yet, he considers television, including local news, as a culprit towards ignorance. In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury attributes intelligence to free thinking and expresses that books are merely an agent towards learning and not a magical device to create intelligence. In a subtle way, Bradbury points out that wisdom comes from trial-and-error types of experiences and intellectual growth comes from making real-life decisions, albeit not always correct choices, but nonetheless, independent thinking is an important part of the learning process. In a democratic society, both freedom and independent choices are vital for keeping its structure sound.The story goes something like this: there exists a dysfunctional, sick society where \\"thinking\\" is no longer valued and education is censored. Through the advent of radio and television, information is absorbed but there is no longer reflection or judgment over the validity of the source. Book burning becomes fashionable because \\"truth\\" is too disturbing. Firemen are used to keep social order and to maintain majority group satisfaction. In this time frame, religion exits but only serves to function as a media tool used for commercialism. The main character, Montag, is a fireman who sets fires to the homes where books are stored illegally. Over time, Montag is plagued by many questions, such as, why people are willing to die for books and why are the qualities of independent thinking not valued in his society? At the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he meets a teenage girl who asks him numerous questions about how the society is structured and what would happen if things were to change. He is particularly bothered with her question as to whether he is happy. This specific question brings an important issue to light; what constitutes freedom. What would happen if academic freedom became outlawed? As Montag grows sympathetic with the rebellious cause over intellectual freedom, he discovers the history behind why his culture became dysfunctional and what future scenario has to happen in order to change it. Reading is more than an action of digesting words but requires reflection and a foundation set towards higher thinking.Overall Fahrenheit 451 provides intriguing concepts and a very interesting story line, although Bradbury finishes with a very weak ending. There is more than one way to change society, and not necessarily through the 1950's notion that an atomic bomb has to rip through social fabric in order to create new thinking. Yet perhaps, atomic war can serve as a powerful symbolic weapon to the destruction ignorance does to society and its people. His final advice to teachers is also useful: assess the quality of what is taught and encourage students to become independent thinkers.In Bradbury's interview, he expresses that his concern with radio and television is over its application to learning. Even though he doesn't show how radio and television can be used in education or explains the definition of quality media, Bradbury does not dismiss the idea that electronic transmissions can be used effectively. In Fahrenheit 451, Montag is told directly by Professor Faber that books do not create learning but that they are merely vehicles to describe thoughts. Montag, however, is still bothered about the role of books and education because he recognizes that men spend their entire lives to record thoughts and experiences, and Montag believes that society can learn from this type of wisdom. In fact, at the moment when Montag begins to question his social structure, it leads him into independent thought and freedom. Furthermore, because Montag is able to discern between authors who contribute greatly to social thinking and writers who produce work for entertainment purposes, he is willing eventually to put his own life at risk for knowledge.Yet, whether radio, television, or books are used for teaching, the point is clear, it is the way that they are used and the values which are placed upon the medium that makes a difference in learning. A page from a book can be just as meaningless as a television commercial that is tuned out by the listener. How teachers reach students is a very critical issue in Bradbury's Farenheit 451. Montag becomes the next teacher and leader in his dysfunctional society, and as observers, we too can learn from Montag about our future roles in determining social values. This book is small enough to read within a few evenings but has enough material to \\"think\\" about for a long time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's science-fiction story Fahrenheit 451, he tells of a world set in the future when it's illegal to own books.

Guy Montag soon realizes that burning the books would ruin years of writing and history, when he takes home a handful of books he is put in danger. The setting is believable, unknown, and familiar all at the same time. It has a lot of similar issues as today's world does, but with a futuristic spin on them.

He was a fire fighter, a person who burns books and had everything he would ever need to be happy. But something is missing and all Montag wants to do is figure it out. Could the books he has been destroying all these years be what have been missing in his life? Is knowledge the power that Montag needs? Fahrenheit 451 is a book that will open your eyes and make you realize how much the little things you have in your life mean.Guy Montag is a true hero who battles against himself and the way of the world to find the truth. Montag was a firefighter who started reading the books instead of burning them. His wife never loved him and Beatty is out to get him. But this doesn't stop Montag. He kills Beatty with a flame thrower and then proceeds to run from the law until they kill an innocent bystander to make a good television show. Now Montag is just one of the few that must rebuild the world.This book shows just how much we should appreciate the things we have, like books. People committed suicide everyday because they could not take the pain. Something was missing from their lives, and Montag discovers that books are what his life is missing. His wife, Mildred tries to kill herself by overdosing because she can't take the hurt. The book teaches you to appreciate the things you have in your life and how much it hurts when they are gone.Fahrenheit 451 is a book that makes you realize where our world may be going. Books and newspapers are being dumbed down so that nobody will be offended or discriminated against. Just like in the book, could the pain from the missing of good literature cause people to be unhappy and eventually commit suicide? Could we become like the people in the book?Fahrenheit 451 is an eye opening book that makes you appreciate what you have. Montag had no idea what he was missing until he began reading books. This book opens your eyes to the dangers of not having good literature and how the little things in life are never fully appreciated until they are gone. Everyone should read this book at least once in their life.--V. McGee"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Possessing books is illegal, for which your house may burn. Guy Montag is a man in living in the near future and his occupation is a fireman, whose job it is to burn books. He grows sick of his the society and decides to see what is all about the books he burns. He sees another man in the city who enjoys books as well and they plan to bring them back into society. But after being forced to burn his own house, he commits murder and runs away. He flees to the outskirts of the city where there are retired philosophers and literaturists who help Montag. They watch as an atomic bomb destroy the city, then go and put their book knowledge to use. This book is excellent and very unique and is recommended to all readers.The plot and flow of this story is also interesting. It begins with Montag first meeting Clarisse who strikes him as an odd person. He then comes home to find his wife unconscious and overdosed on sleeping pills. He burns a lady and her house, and begins to read the books he steals from the homes. After seeking help from a retired professor, Montag is forced to burn his own house. There he commits murder, which sends him on the run from the city. Outside the city, he witnesses it being destroyed by an atomic bomb.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting story because of the unique setting. It is set in the near future in a modern city, but with a much different type of society. Thought they do not realize it, everyone seems to be depressed, compared to real modern society. The setting is also interesting because of the censorship at full extent. With houses being fireproof, firemen's new job is too set them ablaze. With no books, the true facts a completely unknown to the public, with false facts like Benjamin Franklin began the Firehouse and that houses have always been fireproof.The characters are also interesting. Guy Montag is the lone person he knows who reads books, though he burns them and makes no sense of them. Beatty is an ironic man. Though he is big on burning books and how useless they are, it is obvious he reads them as well because he is a rather cunning intellectual and is able to manipulate almost anybody effortlessly. Another unique person is Clarisse McClellan. She is what one in their society might call an antisocial figure because of her odd habits and strange curiosityThis book is a must read, with such realistic settings and people. It almost seems like a real event, which took place in the past. This book is indeed unique and the best among all the novels.I.Leung(Vin)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very interesting and prescient, considering it was written 50 years ago - it really foresees the advent of the computer age and lowest common denominator mass media. Saw the film a few years ago and it remained in my mind."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book that should not be taken in a literal sense, as it is jam packed with symbolism. In this futuristic setting, nobody seems to be concerned with anything but their own happiness. These people spend majority of their time on frivolous things like fast cars, large televisions, and a type of ear-piece radio. All of the books in the city are to be burned because they create conflicting views amongst the people, ultimately resulting in fighting and unhappiness. Majority of the people are unable to form their own independent thoughts, as the schools are even changed in a way that students only learn facts and not problem solving, logic, reason, or other philosophical subjects. The main character, Montag, is a firefighter that has always done his job (burning books) without questioning. However, after a strange series of events, he slowly begins to develop his own thoughts, and starts questioning the society he lives in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Generally my favorite Bradbury illustrator is Ray's compadre Joe Mugnani, but Steadman's crazed, violent visions sharpen the edge on this book and help you see just how frightening Bradbury's dystopia really is. Craig Graham has done Bradbury fans a service. A beautiful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a firefighter, but not what you expect. He starts the fires. Guy meets a girl who turns his whole world upside down. She opens the doors to his mind and changes his whole perspective on life. She changes everything he ever knew.I enjoyed this book. I learned that you might not know people or even yourself as well as you thought. I also learned that you don't really know what you have until you have it ripped away from you.Some parts in this book made me want to keep reading because it was so interesting. Other times the reading was harder and it went slower. A lot of the little questions went unanswered; however the big ones were answered and basically laid out for you. It wasn't that hard of a book to understand. It didn't skip around too much. It stayed with Montag until the end."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of my all time favorite books. Montag lives in a world where books are burned and firemen actually set fires instead of putting them out. It's hard to imagine what Montag had to go through to make such a change in his life and go against all social norms, to be one of the most revered in society (a fireman) to an outcast. It's also very interesting to see the correlations to today's lifestyle."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a prescient, cautionary tale about the dangers of censorship and the stifling of reason and empathy.Guy Montag, the protagonist, represents the moral conscience of a society gone mad. In the imaginary, hellish society created by Bradbury, Montag has conformed to the prevailing irrational belief that books are for burning--and, by extension, that the fire of intellectual curiosity is something to be extinguished. Yet persistent reminders of a time when people could think for themselves compel him to look for the causes of his own as well as his society's senselessness. A beautiful girl reminds him of the simple power of nature and art. An aging professor extols the virtue of great literature. In the process of Monatag's search, the reader, too, explores the nature of curiosity and the forces that would squash it. For example, we come against the deadening superficiality of television and the unyielding closed-mindedness of the authority figures in total control.Unlike 1984, another dystopian novel pitting man against an irrational society, Bradbury offers a hopeful, uplifting ending, where those who would dare to think are about to escape to start a better world. This injection of cautious optimism is but one of the masterful flourishes Bradbury offers that make his work stand out from others of this genre. This is a magnificent story of the triumph of knowledge over artificiality and pretense."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The unfamiliar circumstances in this story are analogous to the present in several aspects, conveying a relatable character in a strange world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To be perfectly honest, I really don't understand how this classic is rated below a 4-star by any reader. Yes I know that every reader has their own personal taste but this story is a classic for the ages. Every kid in a middle school should have to read this story about how lucky we are to be able to read books, no matter what the content or agenda the story might contain.Anyone who has never read this story should pick up a copy and start immediately. It's the best $.25 you will ever spend."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this book for my husband for his school. He loved reading the book. The author wrote the book so good that anyone reading it will surely love it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a beautifully written book with a haunting image of humanities future. It portrays a world where censorship reigns and individuality subcomes to the &quot;common good&quot;. In this book political correctness is at an all time high and anything that would make a human think is destroyed for the common good of the society. Including books. Fire fighters no longer put fires out in this book but they start fires to destroy books and all other things that may prompt society to have an origional thought or two. They even set fire to all &quot;law breakers&quot; who refuse to give up their precious reading material.This book; though it has a slow story line; is a masterpeice and warning for today's society. A lesson we should learn well as we can see the obvious comparisons between our society and the society portrayed by Ray Bradbury.Highly recommended to all with a good attention span."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A well written tale of our dark future. The story hopes to show that humans are moving to an era of faster, louder, stronger lives and giving up thinking. Force feeding the people information and opinions and expecting no opposition is the goal of the government and the people feel good about their lives. But, in this world there is no happiness. In fact, the only emotions left are negative or false. I think everyone should read this book once and see if it opens your eyes. The story is a little futuristic and does get a little difficult at times but is still worth the effort. And if 200 pages is too much for you, then the future is coming sooner then we think - rent the movie."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is about a community that has banned and outlawed the viewing and reading of books. The community had firemen burn books. Guy Montag is one of the firemen described in this book. Problems develop between him and his wife, Mildred. Bradbury describes their life as being boring and dull. Guy Montag and his family are only allowed to watch television. Montag's neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse, is excited by the ideas of reading books. He then decides to hide a stash of books in his home.I found this book to be really strange. It is ironic to see how Bradbury was basically able to predict how the world and society is now. It was interesting to see how this book developed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury has a vision for the future; firemen don't put out fires-they start them in order to burn books. Inthis society trivial information is good and knowledge and ideas are bad. Guy Montag is a book burning fireman undergoing a crisis of faith. People around him and his job cause this crisis. His wife spends all day watching her TV and being sucked into the fake reality of the world. She wants a room full of T.V.'s so she can just be connected to society. His next door neighbor Clarisse, is the one who I think starts Montag's thinking about society and what kind of knowledge and ideas are in books. Clarisse is more interested in what she can see in the world around her than in the mindless T.V. This book is a good representation of our society today. The TV and music are affecting our lives a lot more than reading books. These days we are constantly being bombarded by flashes of images and sounds. This is a good book for those who think outside the box and want to look at a different perspective of information these days and what we are really affected by."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451I like the thought that the world could be a completely different place if we did not have books. Before I read this book, I always used to think that it would be cool and a lot better if books did not exist in the world. However, I realized that without books nobody would have their own views on certain subjects, and everyone would be dull like Montag's wife. This fantasy no longer appeals to me, because I hate talking to people like Mildred. Everyone would live in their virtual world and the television would tell them what to think. I like the fact that Montag is forced to think about what he is doing, and he steals books because he has a desire to learn. I feel that I would have done the same thing in his situation, and I feel that I am a lot like him because I like to go with the flow but I don't agree with everything, and I question what I feel is wrong. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who feels the world would be a better place without books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books that I have ever read. I am one of those people who don't read often and don't enjoy books, so having said that is amazing enough for me. What astounds me is that this book was written in the 1950's and the author was able to make some predictions about the future. Now we may not be quite where this book takes place time wise, but some of the technology that is mentioned in this book is not too distant in our future. This book really caught my attention because some of the ideas were ones that I too have thought about. The main reason they burned the books was because they didn't like anything that was fiction, or were unsure it was true. They saw that there was no point in discussing such matters of scientific or religious nature if they could not be proved, but that's just my theory. If you end up reading this book, than you might come up with your own. I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to have an open mind."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have really enjoyed reading the book Fahrenheit 451. The book takes place in a society which is completely different than ours, at some point in the future. In this society it is illegal to have books of any kind, and the story depicts the man whose job it is to go around and burn these books. The fireman, Guy Montag, begins to go against his job, and sneaks books so that he can read them. I am not usually a fan of many books, so I thought that a world without books would be a great place to live. After reading this Ray Bradbury novel my view has changed. Because there are no books in this society there is no way for the people to express themselves, and everyone ends up being almost exactly the same. This type of uniformity was the direct result of not having books for people to read and allow them to write to express their feelings. This story has taught me that books are an important forum for expression, and when a book can keep me interested and reading throughout, and send an important message, that is a quality book in my mind. That is why Fahrenheit 451 got a four star rating from me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A nice easy read for someone who may be interested in a futuristic fun read.

If these two facts weren't enough to make me pick a book to do a project on, I don't know what else would make me. Fortunately, my interest in this book would later become much deeper than simple laziness.What started off as a series of stories in a science fiction magazine would become a novel set in the future world. Books have been banned, and there was a strong force to enforce this policy. Guy Montag, the main character of this story, was one of the many who set ablaze to homes containing books. Montag was happy in a world where the role of the fire department had been reversed from years ago. That is, until he meets a young lady named Clarisse. After a couple of pleasureful conversations and her sudden disappearance, Montag's subconscious dislike of the society he lives in is unlocked. He realizes the shallowness of society starting with his own wife who thinks of her family as three television screens in the parlor. He is also particulary bothered by a woman who was willing to burn with her house after being caught with books. It is all now clear that this society and its censorship has gone terribly wrong.What Bradbury wants to bring our attention to is not that books have been banned, but that restricted society didn't happen in a matter or 24 hours. One word banned over the airwaves leads to another, leads to another leads to another. Pretty soon, free speech and thought aren't even tangible. Though this is a ficticious society, it is realisitic that this type of thing has happened in past civilizations and is still being tried in other areas of the world.At first a slow read became a blazing pace through words of predicition and fear of what could theoretically happen to a society in this world. The fact this could happen will stay with me for a long time. The book makes me want to keep my mind open to everything that i can. I think that's a pretty good thing to come out with after a short 2 hour read.

A book that can be referred to by one name by a couple of generations. If your going to start with Bradbury (May he Rest in Peace hopefully in Green Town Illinois) this is the place: Fahrenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper ignites--\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\").Fahrenheit has been called dystopian, a clssification that can be applied I suppose, but in reality Bradbury is just extending trends he saw back in the late \`50s and early \`6os. The book is a story of what we ultimately would do to ourselves, so it's not so shocking in the plugged in soceity that we have become with our reality televisiohn, our big screan T.V.s and our playtime phones, and of course, this web of disinformation and nonsense that I am using. Sometimes I wonder if CEOs didn't just read Bradbury's nightmare and say, \\"hey, here's the way we can turn everyone into mindless, easily manipulated, slugs. It's more terrifying than 1984 with all the overtones of Stalanism and what you want to call the psycho patyhology of the Nazis, because the tyrrany in Fahrenheit is self inflicted and quite normal in a wayThe coversion of Montague the fireman and the main character, is Bradbury's optimism coming through and is the character hook that drags the reader through the tale. At least there are people who just keep the faith of intelligence and inspiration, the book people who are a threat to the dystopian society just by quietly reading and remembering.If you start here with Fahrenheit the _Martian Chronicles_ should come next, because even though its science is now quaint, there is a moral tale in that episodic compilation and one begins to see Bradbury's syle emerge. Just as with Wells in _War of the Worlds_ the message is more powerful than the factual underpinings. That's why calling anything \\"High Teck SciFi\\" just means tha it's up to date with the science of the moment and the we can ask with the Martian in one of the episodes \\"whose to say I'm not the future and your the past.\\" Who knows? long after we are all gone where may be goldened eyed Martians, living in chess piece cities beside wine dark canals.We see no one of Bardbury's ilke until we go back to the 19th century. In _Dandelion Wine_, that golden elixer, and _Something Wicked this Way Comes_, both of which can hardly be called SciFi, we see that sytyle mature into the trope of the remembered past.But to go down that road it is best to start at Fahrenheit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"bought this for a siblings course requirement. does what it needs too. this was a good purchase at a reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for a book that will make you think, then this is the book for you.

Cccccc cccccc cccccc cch"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So I seem to be on a dystopian kick when it comes to some of my recent selections. I have heard of this before and was some how part of a small group who didn't have to read this in high school or College. So I decided to give this classic a try.I loved the premise of this book, the idea that \\"Firemen\\" were causing fires instead of putting them out. And then the idea that the government is eliminating all books. It would mean a severe downfall in education. This was fun to read and I found the more I got into this book the more freaked out I became. Since I have gotten into reading more lately it was a scary thought of a world without books.I began asking myself questions, \\"What would I do if I couldn't read?, Would I be courageous enough to stand up to a government who would take away this great art, or would I hide my personal collection?\\" Well, over all I really enjoyed it and was glad I finally read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For the past few years, I've been reading a lot of \\"classics\\" (everything from ancient epics/mythologies/Arthurian legend/Matter of France to Chaucer/Shakespeare to Kant/Hegel/Kierkegaard to the 19th-Century Russian novels to Borges, Joyce, Woolf, Kundera, etc.), so I approached this work from a very literary perspective and with a reasonably solid foundation in literature. That being said, I am not entirely sure why this is considered a modern \\"masterpiece.\\" The concept is okay despite being derivative of earlier novels (of which, as has been said elsewhere, \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" are prime examples, though I think he owes a fair amount to Kafka as well (and, given the relatively prevalent fear of totalitarianism/tyranny throughout history, probably many others as well)), but the execution is unexceptional to say--er, type--the least.I find the writing to be sophomoric and unpredictable: sometimes flowery metaphors or analogies are used without real purpose, and there are several unimpressive \\"paradoxes\\" (x is on fire yet x is also cold, y is living but y is also dead, etc.) producing the illusion of depth. What makes such rhetorical language so jarring, however, is that it is almost randomly thrown into an otherwise concise and straightforward narrative, as if Bradbury went back and tried \\"spicing up\\" his writing by thoughtlessly peppering it with unnecessary metaphors. (For example: early on, there is a paragraph discussing Mildred's eyes as \\"moonstones,\\" a poetical paragraph that was initially (for me) utterly confusing because it was totally unexpected and, considering the text within which it is couched, unfitting.) I can respect various registers and don't suscribe to New Criticism's imperative for self-contained organic harmony--I (eventually) loved \\"Ulysses,\\" which is neither consistent nor self-contained--but Bradbury's changes of style accomplish nothing but confusion, distraction, and perhaps an occasional \\"how beautiful!\\" from readers admiring a pretty but misplaced sentence.While the characters aren't developed with any depth, I can respect this decision: the protagonist becomes an \\"everyman,\\" the characters become symbols, the plot can unfold more rapidly, etc. Nonetheless, Bradbury is very heavy-handed with his symbolism and messages (even the ironic reversal of firefighters' duties is anything but subtle) and, despite the \\"think for yourself\\" message, it is almost as if Bradbury is a prophetic preacher telling you what to think. Thus, the novel lacks the nuanced depth of many great works of fiction. Likewise, the plot itself is presented sloppily and often seems contrived: a man who loves to watch books burn suddenly changes his entire outlook because of a few conversations with a teenager? (If the \\"loving to watch books burn\\" were written in free indirect discourse, then fine; Guy has hidden books in his house, slightly unsettled, but still *thinks* he likes burning books. But the narrative appears unilaterally third person limited.) Books must be burned, but there is no mention of paintings, movies, musical pieces, and other art/media, so what happened to those? How, exactly, did culture go from minorities/over-commodification/instant gratification to \\"we must burn every bloody book, dammit!\\"? Moreover, the dialogue is not believable--it feels unnaturally fast, especially Guy's interactions with Faber--and it seems artificial, tailored to further the plot even at the expense of conversational logic.While not always disappointing, overall the writing gave me the impression that it was written by a smart and overeager high-schooler, not a literary master. The book has its audience, but those expecting/hoping to find a modern literary \\"masterpiece\\" will be sorely disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a 13-year-old girl in an Extended Projects Program English class, and so I read this book (because it was a classic, and that fulfilled the assignment).

I would reccomend this book to any bright student who enjoys any type of books ranging from sci-fi to plain fiction, or anyone who just likes to read classics. I must admit that there were some facts and happenings in this book that I did not necessarily understand completely, or a line of events that seemed out of order or somewhat confusing.

As we see in other books like &quot;Brave New World&quot;, the primary characters in &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; may appear to be naieve or even stupid, at times. But, one doesn't have to look very far or very hard to see examples of blind acceptance of ideas and leaders. To intelligent, critical minds, this acceptance is often ludicrous. Look back 60 or 70 years and you see a whole nation succumbing to stupid ideas - and 6 million people died.&quot;Farenheit 451&quot; is a prime example of what science fiction can often do better than any other type of fiction - give us parables or lessons of those things that are best and worst in ALL of us"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury tells a bizarre tale of a world were firemen burnbooks, books are banned, and vidio media rules.

For some reason, this was not part of my high school's curriculum and it has evaded me until now. However, with Mr. Bradbury's recent passing and in his honor, I decided now was the time. This is a book that has fairly embedded itself in American popular culture so, despite not having read it and having seen bits and pieces of the 1966 film starring Oskar Werner, I was already familiar with its basic premise and themes. And as they say, the book is better than the movie!As is the case with great science fiction, it continues to be as relevant today as it was at the time of original publication. Especially relevant is Bradbury's emphasis on electronic media's usurpation of peoples' attention. Everyone has a \\"Wall\\" (i.e. big screen television) that spews mindless entertainment. Everyone interacts with a disembodied \\"family,\\" which might be like the Internet-based social networks of today. With the addiction to these media, people stop knowing or caring about what's going on around them to the point where they even begin to forget why they do what they do or even how they met their spouses. Superficial interactions supplant true human intimacy. Most significantly, they lose their capacity for critical thought because their society has promoted the idea that individualism leads to conflict and avoiding conflict is paramount even if it results in a society of conformists. Ignorance, as they say, is bliss. The irony is, while Americans may not be fighting amongst themselves, they are fighting with the rest of the world. Their abdication of critical thought keeps them placid and easily tractable, but provides no salvation.If you're trying to understand why you should read this book, the reason is basically this: It's a parable about what happens when people don't read at all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Awesome book!

It matches the novel perfectly and allowed us to stop and discuss often!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a controversial book that takes place in the future. It revolves around a firefighter named Guy Montag, but is very unlike firefighters of our time. In Fahrenheit 451, the job of firefighters is to burn books and houses where they are kept, even if that means burning the people in the homes. The people of authority believe that books are bad for society because they cause conflict between groups of people. They also make people think more than necessary, which always causes trouble. Because of the censorship in society, the citizens have become no more than robots; the few people who refuse to conform are killed by the government. Montag finally sees the truth to the life that he has been blindly living for thirty years and decides that there is need for reform in society, and that he can help to change it.The main characters of this book are Montag, Mildred, Clarrise and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag is a fireman from the third generation that burns books. He is not often aware of the actions that he takes. But when he meets Clarisse he opens his eyes and starts to realize the true meaning of books and life. Mildred is Montag's sick wife. She is suicidal and her only life is with her fake \\"family\\" within the walls of her parlor. Mildred doesn't care about Montag, nor does she understand him. Clarisse is an intelligent and adventurous seventeen year old girl who becomes friends with Montag. She introduces him to the meaning and beauty of life. Clarisse is very different from other because she \\"ask's \`why' rather than \`how'\\". Captain Beatty is perhaps one of the most interesting characters of the story because he is the enlightened man who has given up because it is simply easier to lose than to fight.The main themes are censorship, ignorance, and redemption. Censorship is shown in destruction and fear because authoritative figures burn houses down that have books and other material that is harmful to the community; books, magazines, and anything that is educational that might cause someone to question the community that they live in. For example, the firefighters burned an elderly ladies' house because she questioned the community. The leadership is so corrupt that they end up burning the old lady as well because she wanted to stay with her books and they didn't feel like trying to get her to leave. Montag shows ignorance when Clarisse starts sharing her ideas with him and he thinks that she is crazy even though almost everything she says is completely true. Eventually he starts to question his own actions about burning houses. He redeems his ignorance by listening to her and finally by having a paradigm shift and fighting back against his own fellow firefighters and society's structure.One of the strengths of the book was a strong use of imagery. One example being what Montag said about his wife Mildred: \\"If only someone else's flesh and brain and memory. If only they could have taken her mind along to the dry cleaner's and emptied the pockets and steamed and cleansed it and reblocked it and brought it back in the morning.\\" In this small passage you could imagine the picture your head and live the scene. Ray Bradbury used strong imagery to enhance the story and make it seem more real. Another strength of the book is the use of symbols, such as Montag, which is the name of a paper manufacturer. Some of the weaknesses are that some of the characters, mainly Mildred and Clarrise, did not play a big enough role in the story. They made short appearances and then left or died, but they were two of the most interesting characters. One final weakness of this story was that the end came so suddenly and it felt as though we had been ripped off because the whole story led up to an unexciting end. In conclusion, the book was a good book it was very interesting and had some meaning in it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Timeless work on a futuristic society completely and utterly ignorant of any reality except their corporate jingles, giant TV's, and fake families. A look into a shallow desensitized self censored society where intellectuals are targeted as criminals, books are outlawed, and those who refuse to submit are tracked down by the mechanical hound.Fahrenheit 451 is a frightening look inside of a corporate dystopian hell where there is no \`We the People' just \`we the market' and the State is omnipotent. Out on the fringes of the state's control remains a remnant of society, mostly hobos, who are dedicated to preserving the words that many will never read. A classic example when people stop thinking for themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's story of how he wrote this genius book in the UCLA basement on a manual typewriter at 10-cents an hour is such a perfect start. The nine days in dimes that he spent came to so much good. This is a classic because it is science-fiction that predicts our world today. If you look closely, you'll see ipods and cell phones and flatscreen TVs in Bradbury's artistic vision. The message is obvious but insidious. We know that books are the knowledge of our anscestors, that writing is ideas and that without them we would be vapid, yet we still don't actually get it. Bradbury has created a world with evil every bit as tempting as our own, then turns it all around into a greater good. It's magic!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reviewer who said there are frightening similarities between the book and what we see happening today is bang on the money.I first read the book in highschool, then reread it several times when I became an adult. I hope they still give this book to high school students to read. It's written clearly and cleanly and is easily digestible. Much like brave new world, we should be shocked at the society portrayed in the book. But if you look carefully around you we are more like that society that we care to admit. I have a friend, a university grad, who refuses to read any books because she thinks they are geeky and dry. She prefers the world of TV and glossy magazines with few words. How different is she from the main characters wife?It's an excellent book you will read quickly but think about for ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What a treat to re-read this book with the added bonus of the Coda at the end and the Conversation with Ray Bradbury.In my memory 451 was about book burning, but it is actually about the death of thinking and conversation and culture. Anyone who watches TV today knows we are certainly headed in that direction with the dumbed down shows and news casts. We are certainly not supposed to question authority. Our library checkouts and bookstore purchases can be monitored for daring to read outside the boundries of correctness.Dare to read this book and think about what Ray Bradbury foretold."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have to be honest and confess that my rating is really three stars + one star for the historic value. This is the novel that 7th grade English teachers across the US recommend to teach children the value of books-- I guess that that fact alone earns it a star.Bradbury creates a vision of a world where Firemen burn books when they're found instead of putting out fires. People have wall-sized interactive television which has taken the place of family life. Teenagers are encouraged to drive as quickly as possible when bored, and bearing children is officially nearly forbidden. One fireman, spurred on by a non-conformist neighbor, begins to question his task and becomes alive to the value in books.While some of the messages certainly are still relevant, the book is not as strong of an effort of other Bradbury novels. The tone and the heavy message focus date the book and tend to say more to someone interested in the concerns of the 50s then they really appeal to modern readers.Difficult not to recommend, all things considered, but don't expect too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ignore the people who claim this book is boring, horrible, or even offensive-this is one of the best books written, and paints a future that sometimes doesn't seem that far off. A book worth reading again and again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's Fahenheit 451, we get to look at a futuristic world where books are banned and reading is prohibited. The narrator is a firefighter named Montag and unlike the firefighters of out modern society the firefighters of Montag's world start fires to burn books as opposed to extingushing fires to help citizens. Through the novel, we see how the government controls society by watching the citizens everymove and controlling what they may see or hear by using their own propaganda. This can be seen through Montag's wife, who is a drug using zombie addicted to watching government TV twenty four hours a day. Montag eventually becomes a victim when becomes interested in the books he is hired to destroy, steals them and hides them in his home. Through Montag's experiences we get a close look at how individuals in his world have no control of their destiny. However, when it seems most bleak and Montag is close to being discovered, Bradbury introduces some savior like characters. Fleeing from the law, Montag finally discovers the Book People living in the forest. These people memorize books and then they repeat the book to others so that books will live on forever in their memory even though they are being destroyed by the government. Although Bradbury builds a complex plot, the message is simple, when a society tries to control peoples basic freedoms so that they can manipulate them with their own propaganda, its time to start heading for the woods."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a classic story of censorship, in an overprotective society. Stories are told of people's happiness, newly found after learning from the many banned works of classic authors such as Shakespeare. This distopic society uses feigned happiness to mask the true meaning of life. They are overwhelmed by external stimuli to prevent them from learning anything new from within.This is an excellent book, and I reccommend that anybody who has had any experience with censorship read this. Anybody who has already read Fahrenheit 451 should read it again, and again, to see how society has changed to, or away from this form."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's classic is another look at how the world could be headed for literary distruction. In his own thoughts at the end of this novel he compares the actual burning of books to the figurative slow burning of books by abridging. He believes that every book should be left in it's original text as the auther so intended; every verb, adjective and comma.This book is a must read for all appreciaters of any type of literature. It reinforced my forgotten belief of a book's true value.So throw down that remote and pick up a good novel, unless of course there's a good episode of Seinfeld on ... or a good movie... and of course you have to watch the world series, and every other sports playoffs .... ahhhh forget books they take up to much time anyway. That didn't last long, did it?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was to discriptive in some of the sceens and others had barly anything.

I'm not much of a reader, in fact I don't read at all unless I have to. I thought this was a good book, but could have been better without all the elaboration. Every little thing that he talked about whether it was the firehouse or the match he described it to the nth degree. Overall I thought it was a fairly good book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury crafts a dark future that strikes at humanity's desire to destroy the mirror that reflects our short comings.In an age where books seem to be losing popularity, this novel reminds the readers the importance of the written word and the necessity to preserve our history, lest we be doomed to repeat it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Must read if you are a slacker like me and didn't read all the books you should have when you were in high school :D"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While some authors may have ruined this book by hammering the central theme of the novel with hackneyed phrases and over the top situations, Bradbury succeeds in twisting a tale that manages to nudge the reader towards his point of view. Brilliantly crafted and downright cunning, Bradbury proves to be one of the greatest writers of his, or any generation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A quick read with a big font, and only 170 pages, yet it was so good.A terrific story of a fireman who doesn't fit in with the rest of the group and then goes a stray.If the book has multiple introductions, prefaces or whatever only read one, (preferably the longest one) otherwise its just repetitive, though somewhat interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recommend this book to people so that they can finally see whats happening to our society. They can't keep taking things away from us, or this is how we'll end up. We have to be allowed to think for ourselves, not told what we should think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The whole culture's shot through. The skeleton needs melting and reshaping. Good God, it isn't just as simple as picking up a book you laid down half a century ago. Remember, the firemen are rarely necessary. The public itself stopped reading of its own accord.\\"--Faber to Montag in Fahrenheit 451Montag is a fireman, but not in the sense we understand. In Bradbury's bleak vision of the future, houses are fireproof, freeing firemen from their traditional roles. Instead, firemen burn books, which have been banned by an oppressive government. A fireman for ten years, Montag takes great pride in his work, but has always harbored curiosity about the objects he destroys.Montag's life is changed by a chance meeting with his new neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. At the end of their initial encounter, Clarisse asks him if he's happy. The question reverberates in Montag's consciousness, causing him to question his ideas and attitudes, especially on the subject of books. Simply put, Montag's life and psyche are transformed by an idea. At novel's end, he has become a fugitive from justice, but he's happier than he has ever been, for he has discovered the power of the written word.Bradbury's classic novel has only improved with age. Reading the book, you have to be impressed by his prescience in predicting the advent of political correctness, teen violence, the ascendancy of television, the sound bite, and the general decline of our society. You'll also be impressed by his economy with words--in less than 200 pages, Bradbury conveys a powerful, moving message about overwhelming social problems. If you have read it before, it's time to reread it. If you've not yet had the pleasure, you'll get to enjoy a sublime reading experience."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is such a classic, and sadly, I had never read it. Now that I have, I can see why it's a classic and can see why it will always remain one and remain relevant. This was a very powerful book. Picture a world engaged in war, a world full of censorship, a world where there is no speed limit, a world where people do not engage with each other, but rather engage with the walls. This is the world that Ray Bradbury has created in Fahrenheit 451.451 is the number that the firemen wear on their uniforms. The jobs of the firemen are not to put out fires, but rather, start them. Books are banned in Bradbury's world. Books are seen as not real, silly, impersonal, influential, propaganda and will not be tolerated by the government. So it is that the job of the firemen is to burn every book in existence and to imprison the owner of the books. Quite a scary thing. One of the firemen, Montag (the central character) has kept some books of his own. Upon reading them, he finds that books should exist, and you can see the dilemma that this could cause. That's all I'll say so as not to ruin the story for those who have never read this.This is also my first Bradbury work, and I'm very happy that I've finally discovered him. He is Orson Scott Card's favorite author, so I figured he had to be a pretty damn good writer...and he is! I look forward to reading more of his work. I have Something Wicked This Way Comes sitting on my shelf, so that'll be the next Bradbury. I also have a short story by the name of The Homecoming illustrated by Dave McKean.It's very ironic that this book has been banned seeing as the book is about books being banned and censorship. My thoughts on why it may be banned is because of Montag's challenge of authority. This is shown as a good thing in this book and he is the hero, and it's generally not well taken in our society when one goes up against the government or any form of authority. I think it's ridiculous to ban this book though. This book speaks volumes about power in the wrong hands, ignorance, and many other themes that I could go on forever about. Bottom line is that this is a wonderful book and although it has been banned in some places, I'm glad to see that it is required reading in so many other places."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason I chose to read Fahrenheit 451 was because my teachers and my group chose it for me.. It wasn't a book I knew much about in the beginning. Some of my peers and friends throughout my school had already read it and the reviews by them would have probably been a bit more harsh than mine. Despite persuasion and influence by my peers, I still think it is an excellent book that is definitely worth reading. After I finished Fahrenheit 451 I discovered it is a very controversial and inspirational book.It's a book that is understandably controversial. It didn't surprise me that it was. The book is based around a main character named Guy Montag who was a fireman but not just your normal fireman. Firemen in this book actually make fires. They make fires to burn books. The society in Fahrenheit 451 believes that books are wrong. They think that it is filling your brain with nonsense. A lot of characters in this book aren't very intellectual; they don't have very deep thoughts, and seem to all have a very short attention span. This was the same for Montag until a teenage girl named Clarisse comes into his life. Clarisse is a deep thinking character that had a great influence on Montag. Montag was persuaded to question everything including his job of burning books, which he never had a problem with before. He realizes the truth about books and about being intellectual. He decides to take actionn.This book is not an easy read in my opinion. It uses a lot of rhetoric throughout the book. It contains many metaphors and a lot of the times the sections you are reading mean much more than what it might appear. I had to read these parts several times to understand them. It's not a book that you can skim or really read in one night with ease. It really causes the reader to think. It really helped that it was a group project in my class. That way I could get someone else's opinion on what a certain section really meant or I could get someone else to explain it to me in a better way than I could explain it to myself. It's a really superb book if the reader has someone to discuss the book with and here other opinions to influence the reader's opinions on what a section or area really means.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, inspirational, and controversial book. It shows how a character changes from calling out other people for \\"thinking to many things\\" to a character that is very intellectual and begins to go into deep thoughts such as \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote proves how Montag progresses through the book but it also shows how the book can be analyzed to get a better understanding of the book. Overall this is an exceptional book. It isn't a book anyone should read if they do not have the time, because of this I would recommend buying it to allow the reader to have unlimited time to read and analyze every aspect of the book. It is an inspirational and controversial book about many meanings, such as censorship and rising against unjust leadership and despite Fahrenheit 451 being a difficult book to read, I would still recommend it give it four out of five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a frightful vision of what the future may have in store for us. The novel follows a fireman, not just any ordinary fireman that puts out fires and rescues people. This fireman, Guy Montag, creates fires. They are required by law to destroy all books and the houses that contain the books. Weird, I know! Montag's society believes books bring harm and destruction to people mentally and even physically. However, Guy soon begins to realize that all the ideas he once believed in were all morally incorrect and he begins to embark on a quest to cease this destruction and find true meaning in himself and in society.I chose this book for an independent reading assignment for school and I first thought, \\"Wow, this is gunna suck!\\" However, like they always say dont judge a book by its cover. This novel gave way to a new way of thinking about how the future may end up. It was realistic and I guess that's why I enjoyed it. I do recommend this book to anyone that likes easy reading and realistic fiction, though I dont recommend doing four seperate essays afterword for a test grade!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is just a short review of the audio book of this great classic read by the author. The rendition is just terrible. It may be interesting to listen to the author's voice, but he is clearly no professional reader (and of course he should not expected to be!!), his voice is hoarse, and the rendition overall very very unpleasant to listen to, to the point that I ended up stopping listening to the CDs after a short while. I love audio books, but this one cannot be recommended at all, unless you have a special interest in getting acquainted with Bradbury's voice. If you want to listen to a good author who's also an accomplished reader of his own stories, try Neil Gaiman!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a read rich with a delicious story and social commentary. Guy Montag lives in a world made ironic because of the stark contrast to the way we wish our society was today. Firemen don't keep people safe from fires, they bust into houses starting fires. Scholars and professors live on the outside of society because of their love for books, philosophy, and sociology where in our world professors are on the inside and the ignorant majority are on the outside because of their lack of interest for the said disciplines.Literature is correctly portrayed by the leaders of Montag's twisted Earth as a tool that helps people keep in touch with their government and the reality of the world in which they live. This realization by the government lead to a life in which people are encouraged to live \`within' the television. Not literally within the television, but completely enamored by a world of entertainment, visual images, and trivial information symbolized by the television. I have a feeling this society isn't hooked to the Discovery Channel.Some go as far as to suggest that our world today is headed towards being like the world of Fahrenheit 451. The explosion of television, fashion, cinema, video games, and the internet certainly suggest that our society is very much interested in entertainment, and probably at the expense of intuitive thought. However entertainment is not a crime, as we all enjoy being entertained. The publishing business is thriving, and so are newspapers, blogs, and other sources of text. It will be interesting to see how far our Earth will progress towards the world of Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was at the Foreign Language Bookstore on Yanan Road here in Hangzhou when I saw this classic on the shelf. Would you believe I'd never read it? We read some Bradbury in school about 25 or 30 years ago, and he didn't make much of an impression on me. I can't remember why. But knowing the fault could've been mine, I gave him another shot. Books are cheap here, and hey, it's famous, right?Well, folks, it's famous for a damn good reason. Many, in fact. Fifty years old, and it is perhaps more relevant than ever. But so what? Is it good writing? Does it entertain? Does it have real characters?

If not, it doesn't matter. I can say \\"transcends the genre\\" with a straight face. Yes I can. I'll be reading this one again, folks. I didn't write it and I'm just sick with jealousy about it, okay?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This disturbing classic by Ray Bradbury (born 1920) grabs the reader with its chilling tone. Guy Montag is a fireman in a society where fire fighters don't extinguish flames but set fire to books because books are considered a threat by the powers that be. After meeting a free-thinking neighbor and seeing his sick wife mistreated, Montag begins to question his values and the values of a society that burns books. In time he becomes a rebel, flees from the authorities, and meets a group of vagabonds that memorize the books and then burn them (to destroy the evidence). Finally war breaks out, and despite much destruction there is hope that a new society will be rebult from the ashes.Bradbury hits a number of themes in this compelling novel, penned in 1951. Censorship is one, but so is a sense of increasing automation, the dumbing down of society, disdain for independent thinking, and probably McCarthyism. The dialog is snappy with many slang expressions that perhaps were more relevant in 1951 than today. The result, of course, is a somewhat eerie but gripping classic. Readers might also enjoy THE PEDESTRIAN and THE FLYING MACHINE, two Bradbury short stories that present similar themes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic that should be reread from time to time and pondered. It is interesting and its message is significant. It is a sermon that few clergy would dare make.I read the story as a parable that denounces the ancient but still existing wrong-headed notion that it is better, far better, for people to be ignorant.Governmental leaders and thinkers have known since the beginning of time that most people are constitutionally unable to understand many truths. Several ways were developed to manage the masses. One, discussed even by Plato in the fourth century BCE, was to reveal complex real truths only to intellectuals, but to teach the general population only \\"essential truths,\\" essential to keep them safe, but not really true.An example is the false notion that God becomes angry when he sees people sinning. This is wrong. A superior dispassionate all-knowing God would never become angry. Anger is a human not a divine emotion. God has no emotions. But clerics teach their congregants that God becomes angry because it helps control the otherwise uncontrollable masses who, if they did not fear God's anger and punishment, would rob, steal, kill and commit other wrongs.A second way of handling these people is stop them from learning the truths about the world. This is why the ancient Roman Catholic Church kept people from knowing the Bible, why they fought against translations other than in Latin, which non-clergy did not understand. This is why Europe existed, if we could use a word suggesting life, in the \\"Dark Ages,\\" in ignorance, like zombies, like cattle munching grass in the fields, until they awakened when they smelt the fresh air of the enlightenment. This is why books were censored and burned during the middle ages. This is why people, human books, were burned during inquisitions.Having this terrible dehumanizing notion in mind, the leadership of the future world in Fahrenheit 451 believed that people would be able to live a better life without books because books, they were convinced, cause wrong ideas, disharmony, confusion and unhappiness.Guy Montag was a government fireman whose job was to burn books. He didn't need to stop fires because homes were fireproof. Burning books seemed right to Montag. It seemed natural and rational. He knew nothing else. This is what he was taught by those who were much smarter than him.But one day a girl woke him up. She was like the child in another parable who was able to see that the king was naked. She told him that people once read books, learnt from them and improved themselves and society. She told him that people could think for themselves and did not need others to tell them what to think.Is the book outdated? Have people finally learned that they are closing their minds? Unfortunately people still need the message of Fahrenheit 451. Most people are still convinced that God becomes angry and, what is worse, far worse, they are still burning books today when they ignore new ideas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman. But he doesn't fight fires. He starts them. And he starts them to burn books. Already a bit disillusioned about his job, he meets an almost seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse, whose nonconformist views on life are a breath of fresh air. He secrets away some books. He fights with his wife, whose overdose on pills can neither be categorized with certainty as intentional or accidental. He defies his boss, a walking book of quotes from famous novels.

It speaks of a society which has rotted underneath through a loss of one of the most important devices ever created by man: the book. In this modern day \\"burst culture\\" of Blackberry's, Wi-Fi, 24/7 TV, and countless mindless entertainment outlets this book could not be more relevant. The story is a short read about a fireman living in a world where his job is not to save but to destroy. He burns books and by doing so destroys ideas. Today as the library becomes more antiquated, and reading and writing skills become increasing less sharpened by the education system, the story reminds us of the dangers in letting such fundamental skills going uncultured in the next generation. This book should be required reading for all students in elementary or middle school, for (like other Bradbury tales)it stretches the imagination beyond the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 gives readers the shock of a world where literature becomes irrelevant to the world around them. The world of Guy Montag was a macrocosm of the growing society as seen by Bradbury during the mid-twentieth century. Its symbolism continues to fit in with modern-day society more and more. As civilization continues to modernize, the end that is Fahrenheit 451 continues to become more possible.As a fifteen year-old living in the United States, I am well acquainted with technology and modern gadgets. After reading this book, it was hard to not see that Bradbury was showing his readers that the new forms of media are replacing the art of literature. As the book pulled me in further, the world began to match that of Guy Montag, as books and the love of reading is quickly replaced by television and radio. Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent thriller that questions the reader: what will happen when books are no longer relevant to anything? The stereotypic reader of a book that is set into the future often thinks, \\"this will never happen in real life.\\" With Fahrenheit 451, I had to really think about that question. With the world as it is-television becoming more prominent, society's youth becoming less and less interested with books-why couldn't this happen? Bradbury does an excellent job at reminding his readers that literature is the basis of knowledge, and knowledge is the basis for a successful society.For any reader looking for a read that will challenge both your mind and your heart, I highly recommend reading this unbelievable book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"reading to be against the law?In this classic book, Ray Bradbury paints a picture of a future society where it is actually a crime to read. Before you laugh at the thought, seriously think of how, in many ways, reading is actually becoming more and more discouraged. Every day you read where in school libraries certain books are considered as being \\"unfit\\" reading material for young adults. Books are becoming more and more a thing of the past. Have you gone into a library lately? Just 20 years ago, when I was in my late teens, libraries used to be filled with people and now they look like ghost towns. A lot of libraries across the country have been closed down.In the book the firemen do not put out fires, they start them. 451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature that book paper burns. That is an actual fact. The protagonist of the story, is fireman Guy Montag who is at a point in his life where he is really beginning to question what he does for a living. He really doesn't know why books are being burned, he just does it. Sounds like a lot of us, doesn't it? Sometimes we find ourselves doing things or believing things not because we have personally investigated the matter, but we do it because everyone else is doing it, or because we don't feel that we have a choice in the matter. I tell you this, and this may be a little difficult for some of you people to hear, but in every situation we are in, we always have a choice.What are we choosing to do when we hear that schools are banning certain books? What are we choosing to do when libraries are being shut down? What are we choosing to do when other forms of media are taking over reading? I have a couple of friends who are in their late 30s, early 40s, who actually admitted to me recently that they do not like to read. I found it completely appalling.Without our knowing it, we are gradually making it easier and easier for the \\"authorities\\" to decide for us; this book isn't just a piece of fiction, it's a warning. A lot of things in this book have already come true. I'm not going to tell you what they are because I want you to read the book, but it's almost kind of frightening that we, as a supposedly \\"advanced\\" society have allowed these things to come to pass.When we let others tell us what to believe, how to believe, what to read, how to think, we give away our original power. One must become a \\"soul-rebel\\". One must learn to protect those things that rightfully ours to express. We cannot let others do our thinking. We cannot let others tell us what to believe. We cannot let \\"authorities\\" decide what we are to read. Make no mistake about it; this is an extremely dangerous book. I suggest you read it before it, too, is gone from sight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I sat down to read this book a bit listlessly. I was reading it, not for pleasure, but for school. We had to pick a novel to read, and Fahrenheit 451 is the one my mom suggested. As soon as I'd finished the first two or three pages, I was hooked. Fahrenheit 451 had perpetual tension at every turn. I could never wait to find out what would happen next.Ray Bradbury wove a vision of a future civilization that burned books and the houses in which they were hidden. As The New York Times put it, \\"Bradbury's account of this insane world, which bears many alarming resemblances to our own, is fascinating.\\" And they are absolutely right. Of all the characters in the book, the one I saw most clearly was Guy Montag, a fireman whose job it was to start fires. Guy is the main character in this story. He agonizes over what life to choose: the ignorant one as a fireman or the life on the run. In the end, he must make a choice.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most provocative and interesting books I've ever read. All things accounted for; I would say that this novel is one of the most amazing novels of the twentieth century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book that I had been yearning to read for a long time. A friend of mine had been reading it and I borrowed it one day in class to fill up my free time. I was immediatly sucked in after reading the first chapter.Once I picked up the book a second time, I realized that it gets very confusing past the first couple of chapters. The story turns into more of a portal through which you can read Bradbury's thoughts and ideas of what the future might be like, and what he would do about it. There are many different issues brought up and many ideas conveyed through the story of a fireman whose purpose is to burn books.I picked up the presence of a lot of anger while reading this book. Anger towards authority, anger towards the society that Bradbury envisioned. And all this anger was channeled into Mr. Montag's (the main character) story.Everything within this book captivated me, and definately made me think a lot. It takes a mature mind to read and then understand this book, and I know I'm not fully there. I'm still not sure I received the message Bradbury might have been trying to send. Maybe there isn't one. But this is the kind of book that you would want to read more than once in your life. I know that the next time I read it, I will understand just a little bit more, and learn a little bit more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine this:The world no longer reads. Instead, they sit around for hours and watch giant screens at home, viewing mind-numbing programming with no real intellectual value. Then, they get in the car and drive 90+ mph, not even for a second thinking about the danger that they put themselves in. People no longer care about anything really. They no longer think for themselves. They have no ideas that make them unique individuals.Sound familiar? It can be honestly said that today, the TV has replaced reading as the number one mode of aquiring information for the majority of people in our nation. They have their minds filled overflowing with ideas that the program presents. And this is how people shape their worldview today. After all, all \\"normal\\" women look like Cindy Crawford or Halle Berry, right? All kids have sex before marriage, right? Everyone has to look like they do on TV, and be like the \\"normal\\" families portrayed on TV...right?In the year 2004, the vast majority of what is seen on TV is absolute garbage. No? Well, OK. To each his own. If you think that watching a fashion model having needles pierced up and down her arm in order to win a challenge is perfectly fine to watch, then OK. If you think gay men running around an island butt naked is considered normal during the \\"family\\" hour, or having kids in a game show soaked with green slime, or someone having plastic surgery and cosmetic dentistry in order to win a beauty contest, or...Thankfully, we don't have to worry about losing our First Amendment rights; there are enough watchdog groups around to ensure that our rights don't disappear. May God help us all if we ever did. The Bill of Rights ensures that in the corner of the world in which we live, we have the freedom to ignore the \\"idiot box\\" and read a good book, or newspaper, or magazine, or whatever we want to read without fear of arrest or intimidation.In the \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" world, books are illegal. Since everyone got their dose of enlightenment from the big screen and didn't care about reading anymore, the government said, \\"Since no one reads anymore, why do we need books?\\" and promptly banned all of them. Those fortunate ones who manage to hang on to a few tomes for their enjoyment are paid a visit by the fire department.The \\"firemen\\" in this story, unlike their real-world counterparts, start fires, instead of extinguish them. Kerosene shoots out of their hoses instead of water. The FD (with the number \\"451\\" on their uniforms, indicating the temperature in which paper burns) is dispatched to the \\"criminal's\\" home, and not only sets the books ablaze, but also the home in which they are hidden. After all, they have to set an example to the rest of the community that books are bad and if you are caught with them, your books and your home are toast...literally.The central character in the book, named Montag, is one of these firemen. For years, he has done his job setting fires, and he does it well. But after a run-in with a girl who's a free thinker, and a professor who remembers the days when books were taken for granted, he begins to question why the firemen have to burn the books at all.Though written over half a century ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is no longer considered science fiction. It is a glimpse of the future to come, and a warning of what the future could hold for us."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to write a review for this book that is different from all of the others.All I can say is this is a classic story of censorship and and government intrusion in our lives. This is the 50th anniversary edition and I really enjoyed the author notes in the back. Over the years, Ray had been asked by many people asking to modify his work so it's slightly less offensive, something specifically talked about in this book!Certainly makes you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What would it be like to live in a world where firemen go around burning books to \\"protect\\" citizens from thinking? What book would you be if you could be a book? This is one of my favorite thought-provoking dystopias about freedom of the press. A companion book for discussion could be God's Smuggler which talks about smuggling Bibles (a forbidden book) behind the Iron Curtain. Both books are age appropriate for teens and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time and it simply gets better with age, like a vintage wine. How can we picture a world where there are no books, particularly novels?Like most of us on Amazon, I'm a voracious reader and have been since I was in elementary school. Books transport us to another world and allow us to have insight into lives, situations other countries that we may never otherwise experience. Good books pose tough questions about ethics, coping with adversity, and dealing with loss, sorrow or facing hard choices -- for example, Sophie's Choice, when she had to choose between which one of her children she would save from the Nazis.When I was 19 and I first read this book, I thought it was just about banning books. I didn't fully comprehend the depth of mind control that would be involved in restricting information, and consequently creating a reality that is so sanitized that it bears no resemblance to real life. No wonder people were glued to the flatscreen TVs and hooked on mood altering substances to get through the day.As always, Ray Bradbury does a fantastic job of making us think long and hard after we put this book down. The video version is also quite good, but I sometimes had trouble making out people's accents, and it was created in the days before subtitles were available. Altogether, a terrific read that bears rereading over the decades."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is set in a dystopian society that any book-lover would loathe. Firemen don't put out fires, they start them. They burn books, all books, for the safety of society. Guy is a fireman who is content with the world around him, until he starts reading a contraband books.Censorship, freedom of speech and the idea that knowledge is dangerous are at the forefront of this novel. Even today, people are still banning books and trying to stop certain ideas from infecting the minds of the populace. The books relevance has clearly stood the test of time, but perhaps that's more a problem with society than praise for this book.While the premise is scary and all too possible, the writing itself is dull. Fahrenheit 451 is a short book full of description. In this case, being overly descriptive isn't a good thing. The wording is choppy and the only time you can really get into the flow of the book is when Bradbury goes on a rambling tangent.The concept is sure to outrage and book-lovers will easily become enthralled with Guy as he embraces the knowledge and power books provide. Fahrenheit 451 is a good book, but it is written in a way that aggravating and distracting. I don't think it deserves the gushing praise that's heaped upon it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book for the first time when I was probably 13 and I have loved it every since. It truly is an amazing book and one you can never forget. Randomly during a regular conversation even 10 years after reading this book I find myself connecting coversations to things in the book. A book everyone should read. I can't wait to have my daughter read it in a few years!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wonderful story.

He reports that the book is of exceptional quality and very easy to use. I would recommend this book based on his comments. I have read this book in hardback, and it is a very good book by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply put, society has always been caught up in the pursuit of happiness. And after so much time, we of the modern world have almost achieved it. The only thing that holds us back is the incessant racket caused by thinkers, and all the time we spend pondering their works, to gain no \\"fun\\" out of it all! Better than, that we ignore {or even burn!} their holier-than-thou books and live blissfully in our ignorance {or should we say pure euphoria?}. Analyzation and thought have only ever given us misery...That Bradbury can create a world so perfectly grasped by this reasoning is an incredible literary feet. This argument has slithered into every mind to the point where you can hardly resist believing it yourself as the novel seamlessly flows from page to page.Guy Montag himself composes the perfect vessel through which to traverse Fahrenheit 451's future. He is wracked with doubts and utterly shaken by his fears... that he is the only person in the entire world who notices its paramount shift towards the abandonment of all the lessons we have learned. Bradbury's writing style impeccably mirrors Montag's convoluted thoughts, his words whipping back and forth along every end of the emotional spectrum, capturing every nuance of Montag's terror, rage, anguish, and sheer morbid indifference to his environs......Those environs that perfectly mirror the [...] of our society. At first glance the book might take place in the modern America in which it was written, building a sense of unconscious connection with the reader... A connection which is soon brutally shattered by the seamless integration of nightmarish facets of our [...]: from fire men who \\"protect\\" with kerosene and a match to massive atomic wars constantly shattering the sky. The way these are injected into the story makes them seem almost fitting, as if our society has already fallen so much as to welcome such things. This cruel betrayal of the reader's thoughts is a powerful wake-up call, and will stir strong emotions within you.Fahrenheit 451 is an unbelievable journey through the future. The world conjured up by the work is as perfectly woven as it is terrifying. Its extreme and twisted inhabitants guide you briskly through the tale, and convincingly complete one of the greatest books I have ever read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book years ago but in having a conversation with my friend's 16-year-old nephew, i thought i would hope on and give a review to a profoundly impactful book. i tossed bradbury my friend's nephew's way when i heard it was not required reading (i read in high school). the reason being: \\"it's too controversial\\" how sad and yet indicative of the very issues bradbury warns us of in his book. having survived the embarassment of the bush admin. and the perversions to thought and liberty (issues bradbury writes on)i can only hope this book experiences a resurgence in class room reading lists."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a high school junior, I was recently made to read Farenheit 451. Unlike the typical high school student, reading is one of my most cherished activities. Thus I was pleased to find that we would be reading 'heavy' novels and were expected to do some thinking beyond the usual confines of teen thought. I was shocked at the way most of my peers responded to the novel and the assignment itself. Most hated the novel and were disgruntled to find that we were (gasp) supposed to think? The very idea! It was actually quite ironic to find that the very ideas of lax thought and caring that Mr. Bradbury was trying to convey were precisely what I found in my classmates. It was also a disturbing discovery for me to make. Farenheit 451 was an excellent novel although I believe it was written far in advance of its time. Had it been published just recently, perhaps more people would understand the troubles it predicts, which are indeed staring us in the face. The most interesting part of the novel is that it came in a time when the Guy Montags of the world were frowned upon, as were individualism and self-expression. The struggles which Guy faces are a perfect example of today's struggles. There are some of us in the world who refuse to conform and think exactly like the government wants or society decrees. It makes one truly think about how close we have come to slipping into Guy's society. Look at Hitler and WW II. Look at genetic engineering and euthansia. Mr. Bradbury's novel gives a chilling and striking depeiction of what the world would be like without a few individualists. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes Kate Chopin or Ross Perot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first started reading this book, I realized it was just another quirky scifi book, that would end up with somebody killing somebody, and that would be the end.

For all of the people who thought it was stupid, what Bradbury is talking about has already happened to you! At 14, I do not find this book at all confusing, unless to you confusing means that it actually makes you think (The horrors!!). It made me realize how lucky we are to be free to read whatever we want to read and think whatever we want to think.

I am a junior in high school and quite frankly hate to read. It's very difficult for me to get interested in a book. This book, however, caught my attention. Maybe I just like books about the future. It's an entertaining novel discussing the struggle between Conformity and Individuality. Montag acts just as his society intends him to until he meets some very important people that show him a more interesting and exciting life filled with knowledge. Of course, his brainwashed wife, Millie, continues to acts as one of the androids that society has made her to be.

I may be slightly bias, since I love to read, particularly Sci-fi (Star Trek rules!), but this book was really good. I know many read this book in their junior high years, but I think it's better if it's read a little later, when it can be &quot;digested&quot; more thoroughly by a more mature audience. So many people, regardless of high school levels, hate to read, and I sincerely believe that is one of the most dangerous things in today's society. Schools do not stress music, art, and literature nearly as much as they should. We learn to THINK--we gain WISDOM from what we READ, not from playing sports and playing games on computers. Even many colleges give out more sports scholarships than academic scholarships.

Bradbury portrays the future in a very interesting way. The firemen burndown buildings, instead of saving them. Bradbury portrayed what he thought the future would be like. He portrays a world where people who think for themselves and question are outcasts and fugitives. Fehrenheit 451 is a very interesting story, but it can be confusing at times, making the reader reread paragraphs to understand what is going on. Bradbury doesn't use complicated words, so the reader won't need a dictionary by their side. I like the lenghth of this book. It is only about 150 pages long. The story also moves at a very fast pace. The plot is set right from the beginning. I feel that the story is developed well until the end. The climax comes and the end is right after that. There are not many characters to get bogged down with either. I liked this because the whole book centered around one person, not many people showing many stories. Over all, Fehrenheit 451 is very well written and exciting. I would recomend this to anyone interested in sci-fi and fantasy books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book very much and would definitly recomend it to others. It is very fast paced and the action starts right from the begining of the book. The plot is very interesting because of the similarities between Ray's world and ours. If you like futurist books or even books about our world, and science fiction, this is definitly a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was confusing, but overall a fun adventure! I punched Schesnuk in the FACE!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has created a shockingly realistic future for us, where the desire to be happy overrules the need to be informed. The most frightening part, perhaps, is that this style of censorship is practiced in high schools across the country. As a high school senior, I have witnessed several instances of attempted &quot;book bannings&quot; from school libraries, mostly led by misinformed parents who could not see through the 4-letter words or &quot;disturbing&quot; situations to the true worth of the novel. Unlike 1984 or Brave New World before him, Bradbury's world is closer to ours, and much more attainable.The theme of Fahrenheit 451 is seeing through the clutter and propaganda to what is truly important. Not necessarily books in particular, but the essence of life which they capture and present in sometimes startling ways. Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, Faber, and few others can see that butterfly in a landfill essence of truth, and their contrast against the rest of the world shocks the most disillusioned reader into realizing that, in literature, there is truth. In a world where science and technology are increasingly more important, Fahrenheit 451 is a far-sighted message from the past telling us, indeed, the arts are what puts us above the primates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This isn't exactly a review. I don't enjoy writing reviews for books that already have so many reviews written for them, because what's the point? And a classic like this has already been described so many times, who needs another person to repeat the same synopsis again? But two days ago, after a kid ran into my Science class screaming that Ray Bradbury had died, I knew I had to write something about this book.As said before, I won't describe this book, since if you're reading this, you probably know already. When I first read this book two years ago, I was enthralled. For me at the time, classics were overrated, boring, and way too old to be relevant. Then came Fahrenheit 451. After finding out that it was published relatively recently by an author who had not yet died, I whined in my head, 'But then it's not a _true_ classic.' Eventually, and miraculously, I managed to discipline myself to read it-and I LOVED it. It was so original, and actually SUSPENSEFUL-all of a sudden, my view on classics were changed. I realized I was stupid for not thinking that before, and how childish I was (fine, I was in middle school, but still). Soon I will have to read Fahrenheit 451 for high school, and I actually feel quite happy about that.I'm writing this in honor of Ray Bradbury, in a way. He died on the fifth of June, 2012. I would just like to say, Mr. Bradbury, that your book was truly a masterpiece, and changed my life in more ways than one. I hope that you rest in peace. And wherever you are now, I hope you died knowing that your book would soon become a true classic.--written by a teenager."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Give Fahrenheit 451 a read. It describes a world where people are sucked into tv/media and become drones of the state. If you've ever seen Fight Club or opposed censorship you'll enjoy it. The author Ray Bradbury passed last night, he was 91."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I feel almost guilty giving this book a review like this, it is hailed as a classic and usually when I read books that are considered classics I can see the many strong qualities that put them on the 'classic' pedestal. But I must be honest, I'm not going to make this book sound better then I thought it was simply because it is considered a classic. The only redeeming quality this book really has is the overall idea and like many reviewers have already pointed out - the idea is good, the execution of said idea is quite lacking.This story follows Guy Montag, a fireman. Unlike the firemen of today, these firemen burn books rather than put out fires. The world has become a dystopian society that favors pleasure over reality. We almost have a 'stepford-society' of sorts. Critical thinking is said to create sadness and conflict so something must be done about it. The books must be burned.In Fahrenheit 451 Montag has an epiphany after talking with his light-hearted neighbor Clarisse. Clarisse represents the very thing this society is trying to rid. Guy Montags wife represents the opposite. You can already see the conflict here, so what is Guy to do?I'll admit the first 40 pages or so really had me going. The story was unique and the message was interesting. I did notice right away that Bradbury likes to be overly-poetic in some parts, and a straight-shooter in others. His writing is a little inconsistent but I was able to look past that. At first I really hated Montags wife (a good thing, when books conjure up these types of feelings then they are doing their job) and I really felt empathetic towards Guy. The problem is that this book really started becoming silly. The characters really become forced and the plot as a whole takes an eye-rolling turn for the worst. The ending is one of the most forced endings I've ever read. This book could have been written a million different ways and Bradbury chose a really silly path. I had to force myself to finish the book and I started to lose my feelings towards the main characters, I just started to not care anymore. It's almost as if Bradbury had a good idea for a short-story one day and forced it into a novel.In the end I would give this book a 2.5/5. There are some interesting ideas and some of the writing is pretty good, though it is inconsistent. Unfortunately I can't give half-stars so it's either a 2 or a 3. Tough choice but ultimately this book was more on the disappointing end of the spectrum for me."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"You've heard about the title, so you know this is a book in which books are burned. That is, indeed the most symbolic aspect of the novel. But the novel's richness comes not so much from the scenes and fact of book burnings, as the daily life of mind-numbing television and prescription drugs. As our narrator notes, \\"the firemen are rarely necessary.\\" Most people simply lost themselves in \\"wall televisions,\\" joy rides, advertising, shopping, and--above all--infotainment. This dystopian society is not unlike our own: people often prefer to have others do their thinking, machines do their walking, corporations to make their meals, pundits (\\"televisors\\") to do their political thinking, TVs to do their childcare, and televangelists to do their religion.This America offers a Bible-free, guilt-free, effort-free Christianity. It offers hedonism, sports, and the lowest common denominator. Who wants books in a society committed to individual ease?Books then, are not a magic bullet: this future America has been so dumbed down and has become so lazy that a mere book won't change a thing: no more than a recording of Mozart. What has been lost is a way of life--an integrated, critical, self-examining, strenuous life. This whole has been chopped up and swept away by a society obsessed with products and leisure.The narration is often overly blunt or even exaggerated. It's as if Bradbury doesn't trust that we'll get it: so he lays it on, thick and plain. This is not a subtle book. It's not great literature, but it is an important work of fiction. It is particularly a good book for the young reader.For all of these reasons, I think that Fahrenheit 451 should be canonized for high school. It's short, simple, direct, and relevant. And its well worth reading for anyone who lives in a society more obsessed with consumerism than the pleasure of a campfire, the look of a daisy, or the pleasure of a book as good as this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was well on my way to dropping out of high school due to sheer boredom when my English II teacher assigned this book. It read like it was written just months before, illustrating the sinkholes modern society had been slowly hollowing out in the 20th (and now 21st) Century. Always pertient and on topic, it's the kind of story that never looses its edge and becomes more true every time you read it. Sometimes we're Mildred, sometime's we're Guy, sometime's we're Clarisse. Always, 451 assures that humanity will make it somehow. All we've got to do is follow the tracks."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that will never show its age. Ray Bradbury wrote it in 1953 but it feels contemporary even today and its warnings are as applicable (if not more applicable) to today's society as society in the 50's. Like George Orwell's 1984, it comments on humanity by imagining its hypothetical future; a dysfunctional society conditioning itself into thinking that everything is OK when it really is not. Unlike George Orwell's 1984, however, Fahrenheit 451 is a fairly easy read, and can be enjoyed by pretty much anyone. This is definitely a good thing, though, because many casual readers would be turned off by Orwell's long philosophical passages questioning what defines reality. Fahrenheit 451 stands among 1984, Brave New World, and The Handmaid's Tale because of its significance, but because of its less technical and easier-to-read format appeals to a wider audience than any of these other books--giving it a distinct advantage for casual readers who still wonder where mankind might be headed.As far as plot goes, the book follows its main character, Guy Montag, through a short period of time in his life. Montag is a fireman in the unspecified future--but it's far enough in the future that the meaning of the word \\"fireman\\" has changed. In Montag's world, instead of putting fires out, firemen start fires. In this future, reading books is illegal for purposes of mass censorship and anyone caught with books has their fireproof house burned clean of their contraband libraries. Montag lives a happy life with a happy wife and enjoys his job until one day a young girl named Clarisse teaches him to ask questions--something the government does not want its citizens to do. Ultimately, this causes him to \\"wake up\\" and see everything that is wrong with his life.He is not in love with his wife (in fact, he can not even remember where he met her), his job is to ruin other people's lives, and he doesn't even know what happiness really means. Happiness to the masses is mindlessness; staring at wall-sized television screens in-between work and sleep. Obviously this pacification is no substitute for true happiness, and when Montag becomes aware of this and the fact that everyone else in the nation thinks they are happy as unthinking sheep, he feels the need to change it. He decides to read some books to find out how, effectively becoming a criminal.The main reason this is a great book is because its implications are very important to our society. However, it is also just a well-written book. It doesn't get stuck at any part of the story with too much of Montag's thoughts and not enough action, but it doesn't leave out the thought-provoking parts, either; it's a careful balance that keeps you interested enough to want to keep reading and intrigued enough to want to think. The book also has great character development, as most of its main characters go through drastic changes over the course of the story. When Montag first talks to Clarisse it is obvious though the dialogue and narration that she really annoys him. Slowly, though, as he talks to her more, his opinion changes, and eventually, even though he is offended by her, he has taken a liking to her.Still, what keeps this book important is what it means. In modern society many of Bradbury's predictions have come true--TV screens get bigger and clearer as people walk around with iPod earbuds blaring, ignoring one another completely. Reading may not be illegal, but the entertainment industry has a pretty strong grip on a huge portion of the population through television, discouraging reading by encouraging watching. The main thing Bradbury is promoting here is thought--the downfall of man in the book is ultimately attributed to losing interest in thinking. Which is why Clarisse has such a profound impact on Montag while doing something as simple as making him think.And who knows? If you watch a lot of reality TV, this book may do to you what Clarisse did to Montag. That's right--turn you into a fugitive. Oh, and it might make you think, too. Hopefully it will do that instead of making you a fugitive. Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting, enjoyable, and important book for modern-day readers to read. Even if you read it, end up disliking it, and find yourself wanting to set it on fire, at least that would somehow be ironically appropriate. Because Fahrenheit 451 is a very quick and easy read, you have nothing to lose by reading it, and if what it predicts is true, you may have everything to lose by not reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"With great prescience, Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451 over fifty years ago. Today, this story is no longer prescient but instead insightful of the situation of the West as it stands. Pluralism which was celebrated in the past has become a prison against plurality, destroying freedom of speech because of political correctness. Materialism (both practical and philosophical) has driven us in two different directions: (1) Absolute obsession with making money at all costs. (2) Absolute obsession with not working at all costs. These two factors appear in different quantities in the population, creating workaholics who destroy their lives (both by means of work and the escape from it) as well as those who merely play games with the world.Bradbury foresaw the rise of these forces in his day and astutely analyzed them to their ultimate end. This perfect storm of ideals has brought us to the edge of a cultural collapse, a collapse which is highlighted in Fahrenheit 451 and enacted in its fully decadence in the plot of the story. For Bradbury, materialism ultimately ends with the destruction of work ethic and the true pursuit of knowledge (and hence the Truth). Life becomes a game, without serious ramifications, for life without the Truth is nothing more than a masquerade. Bradbury's tale teaches, however, that all masquerades end, all masks fall off, when the Truth blankly stares us in the eye, making us realize the piteous state to which our closed minds have led us. This end is, for Bradbury, only possible when carried out to the full collapse, a collapse which is quickly coming to the entirety of Western Civilization.I highly recommend this book for its analysis as well as its very engrossing style. In a day when true knowledge is not looked for over the din of iPods, Fahrenheit 451 stands as a stern wakeup call to a culture in the throes of death."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Compared to many books that I have read Fahrenheit 451 was enlightening, imaginative and illustrative. Today, people now are glued to the television and they seem to take no interest in being active. Although Bradbury's novel seemed out of the ordinary, it is somewhat close to the society that we are in today.In Ray Bradbury's novel Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and never questioned anything in his life until he met this young woman named Clarisse Mclellan. Clarisse was an eccentric young girl, she was happy, thoughtful, and questioned many things around her. The people around her were busy watching TV on walls, listening to seashells, and driving dangerously fast. When she met Montag, she knew he was different. He looked at her when she talked, he followed things that she said and was intrigued by her personality. Clarisse touched Montag's life in many ways, which triggered him to realize that life wasn't just about burning books, it is about discovery and thinking. Shortly, after Clarisse's death Montag became confused and began to seek for an old friend named Professor Faber. When he saw Montag again, he was afraid he had come to burn his books instead Montag had come to Faber for answers. After speaking with Faber, Montag had realized what a fool he had been and knew that something needed to be done.Ray Bradbury's novel is very close to unveiling the truth of what our society might become if there is no longer a use for intelligence, individuality, and knowledge. Television networks come up with reality TV shows, competitive shows, comedies, and mysteries to keep viewers interested in what the electric box has to offer. With people attached to the television all day the information that is offered out there will become obsolete."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Upon first thinking of the book burning concept, I thought to myself, \\"That's unrealistic. It would never get that far.\\" After reading Fahrenheit 451, however, I've come to realize that the creep towards censorship is insidious, and the American society is closer than I had previously realized. With the several groups, races, sects, and organizations complaining and protesting over every word that offends their fragile egos, with political correctness rewriting books and documentation even as I write this review, Bradbury was much closer to predicting the future than even he had probably imagined.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the new world, a world where firemen start fires rather than douse the blazes. He travels from house to house, totally incinerating any location that dares possess and read books that do not fit the very limited list that has become acceptable. Regardless of families, livelihoods, or other considerations, if the occupant owns books, the house will be set ablaze. Montag's job, however, has started to make him consider the consequences and reasons his job exists.Montag meets a teenage girl named Clarisse in his neighborhood with an odd aura about her. She causes him to think deeply, to consider that which he had previously taken for granted. Her entire way of life, her family atmosphere, it all takes him by surprise, and eventually invigorates him with life he hadn't felt in quite some time. The daily monotony of his life, his marriage, and his job had Montag quite melancholy, and the new perspective brought on by the young girl with an odd wisdom becomes the catalyst for life changes.What follows is a brilliantly described story, where the details fly off the pages in colorful and lively metaphors. Bradbury's style allows each reader to clearly and easily see the images of Montag's world, a world in which Montag must now make a decision to continue living his life, or to follow his heart and mind into a new and dangerous journey.In the end it's a story about the dangers of groupthink and the loss of freedom. It's a prophetic warning, showing how seemingly minor forms of censorship could eventually lead to a society without the basic freedoms of individual thought, self-expression, or self-growth.I can't recommend this book highly enough, and it should be required reading for every school across the nation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit gives me a new appreciation of future based plots, it tells of a futuristic world where people have no love of art or creativity, and their lives consist mostly of TV viewing and speeding. Guy Montag, is a firefighter in this strange world, and instead of putting out fires, his job is to start them and to burn all books because they are not wanted because of how they make people think and consider things. This puts us in a place of a heartless society that is, in many ways, like our modern day society.The book is written in an eerie manner that makes you feel uncomfortable about the art deprived world that is being portrayed from the book, which is entirely a good thing. When Montag comes to realize that the world he lives in and the world he has been destroying could be a great place, he decides to stop his work and attempt to create a better world. He finds himself heading through a well detailed journey to create a world with free spirits rather than ignorant drones. The writing of the book is not cryptic however it still has a lost and ghostly feel to it, that really makes you think about our modern day society. For a book written in the 1950's, the idea still applies to today and how our society is in ways heading towards the deprived society that is portrayed in Fahrenheit 451. Bradbury creates a timeless point of how reading, art, and nature are the most important elements of someone's life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I usually don't like books that look into the future, but Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an exception to this. I like how the author vividly describes the future. He makes you feel like you are there when the firefighters light the houses on fire. Firefighters of the future don't put out fires but start fires.People of the future wanted to only be happy. They felt that books make you sad and weren't real. Books were made illegal and if you were caught with a book your house was burned and you were put in jail or burned with the house. I like the main character, Guy Montag. Montag is a firefighter with the numbers 451 on his helmet. He takes great pleasure in seeing the bright orange flames that engulf the books and the house were the books were found. The smell, the excitement is all that he needs to be happy. That is until the day he meets up with the \\"crazy girl\\".The story gets more interesting when he listens to the girl who asks too many questions and she was curious about everything. She opened his eyes to other things around him and he is amused by her curiosity. He becomes more interested in books the day when the old lady gets burned in her house. Montag tries to get her out but all she does is chant about books she has read. She makes him realize that books must be important if she was willing to end her life for them. Then a book falls into his hands and a page opens and he reads a few lines. This is the beginning of his interest of books. He wants to learn more and read more but it would be suicide. He's willing to take the chance.I recommend this book because it has a different perspective of the future. It is very interesting and exciting. Some parts are a little slow but once you get past those the rest is good. There is an unexpected twist at the end that adds to the book. Fahrenheit 451 makes you stop and think about the impact that books have on our lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What makes an excellent story? Many people have their own thoughts and opinions on this subject. But, what makes a book a bestseller? How does Romeo and Juliet, Animal Farm, Lord of the Flies, and other legendary titles sell? Some of the reasons might be that the titles makes the reader comprehend their thoughts. Another reason could be that the story might make the reader gain knowledge of a life lessons or it might just make the reader emotional towards the story. Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury does all three of those things. Fahrenheit 451 is a tremendous read because it makes the reader comprehend their thought about the consequences of their actions, gain knowledge about life lessons on how to be human, and makes the reader feel emotion through out the story.Bradbury does a superior job in his book Fahrenheit 451 on making the reader think through their thoughts about the actions they take through out life. He introduces a confused and semi-depressed main character into his book named Guy Montag. Guy works for fire department in future America not putting out fire, but making fire to burn books. Right away one sees that Guy is not satisfied with his life at all. He is very puzzled about where he should go in life. Guy sees the pain and agony he brings to people because of his job. One day when he burns a women who would rather be burned with her books then die without them, Guy begins to reflect on why does he do what he does. The reader also starts to think about ones actions towards life. The reader begin to see that Guy has made the wrong choice in becoming a firefighter for it brings to much pain towards others and himself. The viewing of Guy's unhappiness forces the reader think about how ones own actions affect not only other people but one's self too. Seeing how one's actions affect one's self and other people is not the only thing that Fahrenheit 451 shows, it also show simply how to be human.Reading through out the book the reader sees that Guy has tons of choices to make. Guy seeing that since people are prepared to die for their books there has to be something amazingly special about them. Guy starts to hide books for future reading. He has a choice to make. He can read the book and jeopardize his life or he can keep on living depressed, with out looking for answers on how to get better. He makes the choice to read the books so he might learn how to live. The reader can see that Guy made the choice to be human, to risk his life so that he might live life to the fullest. The reader picks up that in order to live life too, one will have to take risks also. Guy finds that poetry helps him become less angry and irritated when he reads it. Not everyone in his life thinks the same things. His wife and her friends think that literature is pointless and when he reads it to them, some go to complain. Through this the reader can see that making the right choice to live like one thinks a human should live doesn't always agree with everyone. The reader starts to feel emotion for Guy. What should guy do about this situation? The book does another victories job on making the reader feel for the book and the outcome.Bradbury hooks the reader into the story by forcing one to be emotionally attached to the story. Guy is a character that everyone feels for because somehow one can relate to him. One can relate to Guy by knowing how hard it is to make risky choices, being depressed about life, having a job, or even not knowing what to do about certain situations. Guy has gone through all of those situations and more. After Guy's wife's friends turns him in, he goes back to his job and burns the book he was reading. Right after that the firemen gets called to go out to burn books. Guy finds out that he has to burn his own house. Guy can't stand this fact and kills the firemen and escapes from the law. The reader starts to get even more emotionally attached to the book by the suspension of if Guy will get caught or not. The book does a stupendous job of keeping the reader in the story the whole time. This is the best reason for why the book is not just a ordinary book but fanatic tale of a man who chooses to live rather then to die.From getting emotionally evolved with the book, to learning how to be human, and even making the reader comprehend their actions, Fahrenheit 451 is an extraordinary book. The novel desires not only to be on being on the bestseller list of all time but deserves to be on every shelf of every house. For this book is not just a book but a masterpiece of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's true: A lot of what Bradbury predicted for us when he wrote his classic Fahrenheit 451 about 50 years ago is becoming more and more eminent in today's world. Scary, yes?Books are on the decline, especially in our younger generation. Although a total ban/burning seems a little farfetched and unlikely, it is possible the public will lose interest in books year after year until there are no books being bought anymore... a sad day that will be.People are relying more and more on TV and other forms of &quot;entertainment&quot; ... some are filling, but most are rather empty. Are we destined to become mindless and frivolous like Mildred and Co.? If we keep on going at this rate, yes.&quot;Cliffsnotes&quot;, although they seem innocent enough, are on the rise. You can see cliffsnotes *replace* the good ol' classics in the classroom today, unfortunately (&quot;learn this classic in five minutes!!&quot;) A lot of today's kids are missing out on the great classics by reading only the material that leaves no room for their own personal interpretation...Children are killing each other, as Clarisse points out (&quot;I'm afraid of children my own age. They kill each other.&quot;) We have our fair share of adolescents murdering their own peers in the . How would Bradbury have known?Seashell radios - aka cd players, perhaps? People don't listen anymore because they're immersed in their own world of music. Not a good thing.All these (and more) got my eyebrow raising. Books that open your eyes and mind are rare gems. Although Bradbury's style might take some time to get used to - it took me a ton of rereadings and highlights to understand - this is very riveting, and I recommend picking up this book. Like my teacher said, your mind will not think the same after reading this classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have owned this book for a very long time and have read it more than once. In this day of computers and a near-paperless society, it would be tragic indeed if, for some reason, books were not only banned, but special &quot;fireman&quot; would come to collect and burn them, not to mention the prosecution and punishment of the book-loving individual. This work by Bradbury is among my other favorite sci-fi works, old and new: &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Puppet Masters&quot;, &quot;Foundation&quot;, &quot;2001&quot;, &quot;2010&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, all the &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; books, as well as books as new to the genre as &quot;Advent of the Corps&quot; and others."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. There were some good aspects but also a few bad. The first aspect of the novel is how futuristic it is. It was hard to follow in some places. One example is &quot;And the uncles, the aunts, the cousins, the nieces, the nephews, that lived in those walls,&quot; (pg. 44). This is talking about a tv family that Mildred watches but she talks about them like they are her real family.Also Bradbury discribes some things in a way that is difficult to understand. For example, when he describes the stomach pump used on Mildred, &quot;One of them slid down into your stomach like a black cobra down an echoing well looking for all the old water and the old time gathered there. It drank up the green matter that flowed to the top in a slow boil&quot; (pg. 14). This was hard to understand. I had to look at Sparknotes to figure out what he was talking about in some of the parts.Bradbury is very descriptive, which allows you to picture the novel while you read. &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history,&quot; (pg. 3). This really describes how he burns books in great detail. You can picture it in your mind what he is doing and how he is doing it.&quot;Her head was half bent to watch her shoes stir the circling leaves. Her face was slender and milk-white,and in it was a kind of gentle hunger that touched over everything with tireless curiosity. It was a look, almost, of pale surprise; the dark eyes were so fixed to the world that no move escaped them. Her dress was white and it whispered,&quot; (pg. 5). This shows how he describes his characters in great detail. He uses character developement so that you get a feeling for all of the characters. He also doesn't have so many characters that you get lost.The book as a whole is very good. The meaning behind it about the society could happen in the future. One day society could get as bad as it is in Fahrenheit 451. They tried to make everyone happy but there was still war and death which make people sad. They were hiding people from the truth of the world by not letting them read books. I think this is a good book and I would recommend it; just be aware of how futuristic it is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first began to read the book I was excited at the idea of a fireman's job was to burn books, not read them. As I read more I realized that this is what is happening to today's society but not to the same level of watching TV and not reading as much. People watch more TV than ever before and read less. You can ask anyone about any TV show and they probably have seen it. Reading books has become a inferior form of entertainment since the invention of TV and radios and other forms of entertainment.Montag, the main character in Fahrenheit 451, is a fireman who doesn't any longer put out fires, but starts the fires. The job of the fireman is to burn all books because they are illegal and not wanted in society. People have turned to wall TV's or parlor walls and seashell radios that fit in your ear for entertainment and pleasure and enjoyment so they don't have to have feelings and choose between right and wrong. People no longer care about their government or even their on children. Montag thinks that everyone is happy with their chosen society but he meets a girl named Clarisse who is a teenager that moved in next door to him. She talks to Montag about what firemen used to do and Montag couldn't believe what she was telling him. She asked him questions that made him think which he didn't like. She confused him but he listened to what she had to say and walked home from work with her everyday.A few things that changed Montag's views of their so called happy society was when he found his wife lying on her bed having overdosed on her sleeping pills which could have killed her. These men came in to help her by cleaning out her stomach and purifying her blood stream and then they were on their way. Montag realized that this was an everyday event for these men and many people have tried this suicide attempt. Montag understands that the people may enjoy their entertainment but they are still unhappy. He and his wife were even unhappy and he was going to change this. A second reason was when they were called on duty to burn some old ladies books. The police usually would come and arrest the person committing the crimes but they had not come yet and the old lady wouldn't let them burn her books. The firemen covered the illegal books in kerosene and the lady actually lit the match that burnt her and her house down because she didn't want to live without her books. Montag didn't understand why someone would die for their books. What was so good about them? He got fired from his job for having books and ran away to try to change society. He met up with other men who used to be professors at a college and they decided to leave their city and try to start again somewhere else. As they left a bomb was dropped on their city and they saw the remains of the city and turned around to go and start their new society.I really liked this book because I can relate to it. People in our society are reading less and enjoy the entertainment of television and radios just having fun in life. I don't think it will ever get as extreme as written in the novel but is closely related to it. I really enjoyed the book and would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was an ok book at best. I did think that the plot was very creative, but very far-fetched at the same time. While the fact that I am not a big fan of fiction books that stretch the truth may have some say in my decision, I was still disappointed with other things. I thought that the author did a poor job of mixing up his vocabulary as well as using very little detail to describe things. If the author wants to write a book about the future, he needs to do a good job of telling us what he wants or thinks it will be like. I had heard a lot of good things about this book and that is the reason I decided to read it. In the end I was very disappointed with the book and wouldn't recommend it to most people. There were some things in the book that I enjoyed though such as certain quotes. Here is one quote that I enjoyed: \\"Only the \`family' is people.\\"(Page 84). I believe that this means that only people are real, books are not.So in conclusion, I believe that those people who get into crazy future books may enjoy it, but I personally was disappointed. My expectations may have been too high, but either way its only my opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book to sit side by side with '1984' and 'Brave New World,' Bradbury's classic on censorship is less bleak in execution than 1984 and more focused than 'Brave New World,' resulting in a thoroughly readable tome that remains as relevant today as it was years ago. Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.As always with Bradbury, expect a steady pacing to his prose with an almost melodic rhythm. Bradbury reads well, especially aloud, and rewards readers who allow themselves to sink into the pace of the book.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bad reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough). Not unexpected, and rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view, as these narrow-minded children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future.

Can't we just watch the movie?&quot; As I got deeper and deeper into the book, I grew increasingly depressed about the future of the world.Then I realized: Bradbury has given me a picture of what might be, if we are not careful. His book written nearly fifty years ago peers just twenty minutes into the future now. Technological developments he had no name for then are very real today. For example, his seashell radio is clearly the walkman many of us see pressed in the ears of teenagers daily. TV screens are growing larger and larger and flat screens with HDTV are on the market now. The next step is clearly the full wall television of Mildred's parlor. Robot dogs like Aibo are just a hop skip and a jump away from the dreaded hound.But this is a future preventable. Maybe. But if popular culture is constantly valued above thoughtful consideration and education, we'll march right into a land of burning books and intellectualism on the run.Bradbury's book made me feel defiant. They could never take my books from me. They could burn me with them if they want, but that's what it'll take before I give up my freedom to think for myself.And as for my students, they remind me every day what an uphill battle I have been sent to fight."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is absolutely amazing. It describes a time in the future where censorship prevails and minds are caged. Nobody has original thoughts; with the abolishing of books creativity was lost as well. Guy Montag, the protagonist, is a fireman (firemen burn books in this story) who has to fight to pull himself from the grip of an overpowering government and tradition, only to see that it is all useless (why teach to people who can't understand?). The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and why individuals must not accept the norm without questioning its integrity and implications. Overall, read this book immediately and apply what you learn from it into everyday life.By the way, ignore all of the reviewers that gave the book a low score because they could not understand the plot and symbolism. Their comments are similar to saying Shakespeare's works are poorly written because he uses odd vocabulary and the plot is too complex. Unfortunately, these people make of the mass of society, which is why these reviews are commonplace. (The funny thing is, the novel specifically targets these kind of people...)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a simply great book. Yes, it's quite distressing and unpleasant to read - because what Bradbury describes is much closer to truth than we'd like it to be. And that is precisely what makes the reality of the book so alike our own - it's more pleasant not to think about such things, and therefore one can merely say the book doesn't suit one's taste and go 'get entertained' in front of the TV.The disturbing thing about the book is that, unlike many other books that deal with the distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" (written in 1953) hasn't been proved wrong simply by time itself. Not at all. Actually, what is shocking to realize is that we've come quite close to the society Bradbury writes about. Perhaps books haven't been banned yet, but it is indeed the entertainment industry that controls people's minds, the political correctness has reached ridiculous levels, there are ads everywhere and now we even have Segways so that we don't have to walk anywhere... And, of course, we can get a thousand page long classics shortened to a hundred pages - or, better yet, simply watch the movie.The book also has other qualities besides making one think (which is, judging by some other reviews, one of its biggest downsides). One cannot but admire the brilliant way Bradbury uses absurd and creates a completely surreal feeling by using the methods of expressionism to describe the feelings and thoughts of the main character.Bradbury sure had things to write about - and that can be proved by even something as simple as the fact I've spent the last half an hour writing a review on the Internet rather than reading a good book or looking at the world..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book about 18 months ago, but I am writing a review now because the book came up during a mealtime conversation. We talked about how prophetic a very good science fiction writer can be. This is definitely the case in Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag lives in a world that represses freedom of speech, creativity, and the core of human spirit. People, including his estranged wife, are drones glued to these pseudo realities in television. It describes senseless trivia shows (can anyone say \\"Who wants to be a millionaire?\\") and awfully realistic soap operas that his wife affectionatly refers to as the \\"family.\\"What is most disturbing is that as televisions and technology become more \\"artificially intelligent\\" we will face some of the brainless drivel (we already do) that the major media networks provide us.As a fireman, Guy Montag starts fires with books as the culprit - rather than putting them out. The idea is that books can make some people feel bad and as a result we should get rid of them - in other words books can be controversial and our country does not need disputes. The enforcer is a mechanical dog (which I found a little unrealistic and distracting) that injects a lethal poison into any opponents. Despite the silliness of the mechanical dog - the underlying theme is fantastic - open your mind and save the beauty of spontaneity and creativity of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was a pleasure to burn. So begins, with this absolutely perfect opening line, Ray Bradbury's celebrated exposition of the dangers of censorship. Everybody knows that Fahrenheit 451 is a novel about book-burning, but this story goes much deeper than those not having read it may suspect. Its message truly does become even more germane and prophetic with every passing day. The skeleton of the plot is rather basic, really. Guy Montag is a fireman whose job it is to burn books and the houses in which these dangerous manifestations of inane scribbling reside - usually hidden. No one even remembers a time when firemen actually put out fires. We join Guy's life as he enters into a cusp of uncertainty. He has dared to pilfer a book here and there and stash them in his house, a most dangerous crime indeed. He soon meets a free-spirited teenager who breathes life into his state of uncertainty and opens his mind to brand new thoughts and possibilities. When she makes him admit that he is not happy, his life is changed forever. He can't take the lack of substance all around him, the wife who thinks of nothing but \\"the family\\" (a type of interactive programming that dominates the living room), the impending war which everyone essentially ignores. He knows there must be something else in life, and he comes to believe that the enlightenment he is after must surely be contained in books. Montag's conversations with his Fire Chief on this subject are quite astounding and revealing, and between this and Montag's friendship with an old former professor, we learn how Montag's world came to be this way.The government did not simply ban books overnight. Censorship started slowly and at low levels. Some minority group complained about this - deleted; another group complained about that - gone; these fellows over here object to so-and-so - zip. So many little pieces of books were removed that, over time, the very essence of books was destroyed. While the government has now come to insist that reading books is a crime, the horrible truth of the matter is that the society itself, in its fractious ways, is the party responsible for this tragic state of affairs. Can there be a more timely topic for our own time? We continually see history books being rewritten, \\"objectionable\\" words, phrases, and (horror of horrors) ideas removed from novels and poems so that no one can possibly be offended by anything under the sun. Censorship is a cancer on society, and the world needs visionaries such as Ray Bradbury to forcefully draw attention to the cold hard facts that a majority of the population seems to ignore or fails to acknowledge. Once the true meaning has been chopped out of the books lining our shelves, it will be too late to reverse the momentum without the aid of some kind of miracle. Fahrenheit 451's message is one that all people should be exposed to, and this novel is such a quick (but powerful) read that everyone really should read it. As horrible as it is to envision, I fear that this type of censorship could indeed happen here."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am teaching &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavy weight examples as George Orwell's &quot;1984,&quot; Aldous Huxley's &quot;Brave New World,&quot; Yevgeny Zamiatin's &quot;We,&quot; Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of &quot;book burning,&quot; albeit in less literal forms, since &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in &quot;1984,&quot; it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, &quot;The Fireman,&quot; that Bradbury published in &quot;Galaxy Science Fiction&quot; in 1951 and then expanded into &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story &quot;Pillar of Fire&quot; and the &quot;Usher II&quot; story from his 1950 work &quot;The Martian Chronicles.&quot; Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old &quot;Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour&quot; (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because &quot;there is always the danger of something being said.&quot; Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.\\" Thus says FAHRENHEIT 451's Professor Faber in explaining to Guy Montag the importance of the \\"telling detail\\" of books. Montag is ready to hear these words, his job as a book burner in this twisted society of Ray Bradbury's invention no longer makes sense to him.Books are illegal in the world of FAHRENHEIT 451. So is driving under 55 m.p.h. Faster is always considered better. Montag's society doesn't want anyone to stop and reflect, because it realizes that if people stop and think about things, they'll get restless. As Montag's fire captain tells him, \\"You ask why to a lot of things and you wind up very unhappy indeed.\\" An important difference between this futuristic society created in 1953 and George Orwell's world of 1984 is that Orwell's government was top-down while all the minorities (of every race, color and creed) in Bradbury's dystopia got together to burn everything that offended them. In this case, lack of tolerance for differing voices led to no voices at all--democracy has eaten itself by misunderstanding itself. Problems aren't faced; they are burned. This is the world Guy Montag rebels against; how deeply it reflects our own world is something to think about along the way.Ray Bradbury is a good writer, one who encourages people to ask the question &quot;why&quot;. He wants everyone to have a voice and to be able to express himself or herself, but not in such a way that they drown out other voices--the best ideas, he seems to believe, will naturally come to the fore. A short book of under 180 pages, FAHRENHEIT 451 is often assigned to middle school students. For those--like myself--who missed it in school, it still stands as an important work for all lovers of reading, freedom, and ideas for their own sake."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sometime in the not-so-distant future, the world will change severely. Soon people's homes will be completely fireproofed, leaving no use for firemen as they are thought of today. But they will not be out of work; their role will simply change. In an ever increasingly television oriented society where yesterday's classics are now thought of as censurable tripe, firemen will be starting fires, not stopping them. Their new role will be of a secret police that search out the hated books and raise their temperature to the level at which books burn, Fahrenheit 451. This is the premise of Ray Bradbury's novel. Bradbury's story is an ominous look into where he fears society is presently headed. It is in many ways a warning against existing increasing rates of demoralization, drug use, addiction to non thought-provoking activities, and illiteracy. He easily communicates how such simple trends could evolve into societal brainwashing and individuals who say they are happy, think they are 'social,' and simply spend all their time in their parlors (the ultimate in new television technology). One of the self-proclaimed 'odd' people of this book went decidedly against the norm in saying, &quot;But I don't think it's social to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you?&quot; However, this book is not solidly a story of doom and gloom. The main character is a fireman named Montag and he ends up providing hope for the reader. While he is not a godlike hero, made up of courage and thew, he does fit the quixotic template in that he is a sad classicist in a new and frightening time. After only a small jolt of reality from an imaginative child, he realizes the world could be made of truth and beauty, rather than the contemporary cheap thrills and insatiable cupidity. Furthermore, this tale has much in common with two other critically acclaimed classics. Montag's government is merely interested in controlling the people while waging war with other super powers, much like the opression in George Orwell's 1984. Additionally, individuals hold very little sacred, no one cares for human life and everyone is looking for a cheap (often-dangerous) thrill. This is a public where men who handle drug overdoses are not concerned that such matters happen &quot;nine or ten a night,&quot; all of this general apathy is mirrored in the novel Brave New World. But, again, Bradbury is a creative author, and his visions of the future are not nearly as hopeless as 1984, or so alien and drug based as Brave New World. Fahrenheit 451's point is twofold. While it warns against where society is headed, it also shows that it only takes good people like Montag to bring society back from the brink of ruination. This faith in the goodness of the common man does not falter and shows optimism that is not always part of such works. Upbeat themes can be hard to find in such otherwise bleak forewarnings, and even in most normal classics it is hard to find a purely happy ending and/or main point. Seeing as this book was published over forty years ago one would assume that it is out of date, but this is not true. It is a science-fiction book without any unbelievable differences between this projected world and our own. Also, Fahrenheit 451 is easily read. The book communicates its point in a mere 160 pages, none of which are filled with incomprehensible vocabulary. It contains enough action for those who like it, and plenty of Montag's self-realizations for readers interested in seeing characters delve into their own mind's inner recesses. This book should be a joy to anyone who chooses to pick it up. Conversely, this easily enjoyed book carries with it some strong meaning. Montag's experiences are a warning to people who would get so used to their impersonal lifestyle that they would become desensitized to many of the world's horrors. Upon finishing the book, one is sure to be more guarded against choosing an easy path, and therefore becoming less of a human. Bradbury did well in bringing the way life became more and more impersonal and barbaric. &quot;I put up with (my children) when they come home three days a month; it's not bad at all. You heave them into the 'parlor' and turn on the switch. It's like washing clothes.&quot; In likening children to annoying creatures which deserve as much attention as laundry, the character who made this statement both disgusts the audience and says the statement as if it were only natural. The author has a talent for letting his audience see situations both as they normally would and as the characters do. Even through the opening we see some of the book's many themes played out in Montag."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot;, written by Ray Bradbury, is the chilling, prophetic, science fiction novel of the future. About censorship, it portrays a world where books are outlawed by a totalitarian goverenment, it shows how society's only goal is to achieve &quot;pleasure&quot; through the senses. It tells of a world where petty facts are more valued than knowledge and ideas; a place and time where no one questions what they are doing and why, but just doing it by rote. Guy Montag is a fireman of the future. Ironically, his job is to start fires, to burn everything, especially &quot;corrupt&quot; books that contradict the government, and society's way of life; books that make people think and learn to question things. Like all others, he doesn't ask questions, and enjoys his job, enjoys burning things, because &quot;fire is bright and fire is clean.&quot; He lives oblivious to the frightening realities of life until his next-door neighbor, Clarisse, a young girl of seventeen, teaches him to ponder what might be behind the books that he burns, to learn to ask the question &quot;why?&quot; This causes him to undergo a &quot;crisis of fiath.&quot; Examining his life for the first time, he sees how empty and meaningless it is. His wife cares for nothing else than her &quot;television family&quot; and is sucked into a world of endless chatter, movement, and moving images. He realizes the terrible horror of what society is doing; watching the tube, &quot;oohing&quot; and &quot;aahing&quot; but not really talking nor communicating with one another. Montag grows to recognize what a corrupt society he is living in. When clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag is motivated to make some changes in his life. During nighttime &quot;calls,&quot; he starts hoarding books away in his home, determined to understand what is behind those pages. Montag also tries to ignore Captain Beatty who tries to confuse him in his search for the meaning of books. Pondering the questions of life, his futile search for the ultimate &quot;truth&quot; leads him to Faber, a retired English professor. With Faber's help, Montag finds the road to justice and restoring the &quot;past&quot; where people are not afraid. Written in third-person, this book is an excellent portrayal of human nature; the good, the bad, and the in-between. Ray Bradbury, the author, paints a vivid picture of a future with no books, and makes the reader realize that without books, creativity and thought would be stifled. Literary devices such as similes, metaphors, and rich symbolism (example: &quot;seashells&quot; are the future generation's discmans) are used by the author to enrich the story. There are many types of conflicts shown in &quot;Fahrenheit 451;&quot; person vs. self, person vs. society, and person vs. person. Montag struggles with himself and tries to distinguish between right and wrong. He also battles with the society around him, and tries to make them realize that books are not to be feared, but worshipped. This is evident when he reads the poem to Mildred and her friends while they are in the &quot;parlor&quot; watching the &quot;walls.&quot; But becuase of their lack of understanding and depth, they do not udnerstand the purpose and meaning behind the poem and regards Montag as being &quot;crazy.&quot; Montag'ss struggles with Captain Beatty is the person vs. person conflict represented in the book. Since the world declining to conditions recounted in the book is hgihly possible, the novel has an &quot;aura of chilling prophecy,&quot; which I like. A sense of the &quot;not so distant future,&quot; with fantastic magical realism such as &quot;spacecrafts&quot;are common in all of Ray Bradbury's work, such as the &quot;Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Fahrenheit 451.&quot; I enjoyed reading this &quot;thought-provoking novel,&quot; about the future and censorship. It is no small wonder why there are over four and a half million copies in print all over the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Several reviews on here have given Fahrenheit 451 a low score because they thought the premise was too far-fetched. These reviewers aren't aware of the situations that exist in certain theocracies around the world. Afghanistan under the Taliban outlawed television and women were not allowed to read or educate themselves. In several Middle East countries, merely speaking up against the government makes you a target.Bradbury looked at different phenomena in our society- the desire to not offend anyone, the dumbing-down of a society in love with television, etc., and simply extrapolated these until he reached an end very similar to the conditions that existed under the Taliban.Part of the point of science fiction is to be far-fetched, but good science fiction uses those far-fetched ideas to warn us of the dangers of the present, in this case the dangers of censorship, of political correctness, of television, and anyone who thinks those dangers are not real, that this book doesn't have relevant warnings, hasn't studied the real world enough.Everyone should read this book. It's an entertaining and easy read but also has a lot of idealogical depth behind it for those who are willing to think and read at the same time. If you don't want to think about what you read, well, go watch TV and be done with it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is not only about censorship and government control but is also about mankind's denial to confront the very things that make us human. Control is a good thing in society however to much control can make you paranoid and a threat not only to yourself but to society. This book is very relevant to even today's time when we seek to censor not only books but anyhting we deem harmful. This book is even being censored as I write. Such cnesorship has its basis within a lack of understanding and puts our society on the path of retrogression.This is book is probably best for those who are just beginning to tapp into their conscious mind and examine the world around them. I recommend this book for a mature, discerning mind"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe that the book Fahrenheit 451 was very well written and very interesting. Mr. Bradbury made the book have a lot of good vocabulary for a 12 year old to learn. This book is one of the better books that I have had to read in school. Prior to reading this book I never really liked science fiction books. This book has changed that dramatically. It also taught me fun facts like (before reading this i didn't know) paper burns at 451 degrees. WOW if a book can just do that, i don't even know why people would ban them in the future. LOL :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I heard about this book from noticing it cropping up on listmania lists on this website as a very \\"literary\\" book, meaning pretentious and boring. Now i've read it, i can almost not see why its there - true, the book is artistic - bradbury lists every adjectival detail of his narrative, at times painstakingly - if you like prose where if there's smoke, its wispy and curling and dissipating, instead of being able to imagine what it looks like - then Ray Bradbury is for you. At times this style of writing feels laboured, and many recognise it as simple artistic. I happen to feel that a true artist knows when to linger and when to stride forward and get straight to the point. I could argue that Bradbury fits into this category. In fact, his story of Montag, a \\"fireman\\" in a futuristic state where books have become the enemies and need to be destroyed - is quite an action based piece which set the tone for much successive science fiction. Of course, Bradbury was not the founder of this genre, though i don't know much about it, i think George Orwell's 1984 and Huxley's Brave New World preceded it. It is old - about 1950 i think, but it doesn't feel old. I thought Bradbury's nervous fear of the advent of television in the 40's was funny, but has ended up being quite prophetic - TV has indeed come to be quite a maniupulative medium.If you love a book which is big on story as well as being big on ideas, if you love a nostalgic adjective-packed prose, if you love science fiction - and if you don't, just damn well read 1984 and then maybe some Phillip K Dick like i did, and you'll see what all the fuss is about - and btw, science fiction isn't really science, its ABOUT science, or the fantasy of science, what science can do to us, the thirst for knowledge and advancement - but its really about people struggling against a system. Actually, strike all that, SF is about story. In fact, its one of the best genres for telling ideas through story.In Fahrenheit 451, the idea is censorship, freedom of thought, and the repression of it by the state - and its told through the involving story of Montag, the officer of repression who finds himself in a bit of a pickle when he accidentally spies a line of prose on a page he's been ordered to burn, and wonders what the big mystery is.Plus, its short - only about 150 pages - so you can eat it up over a couple of long train rides if time is a factor.For me, though, only 3 out of 5 because i started struggling about half way b.c of the profusion of adjectives. But for some people, its a plus - if you have trouble imagining novels, then Bradbury gives you all the info, almost like on a movie screen.B.P"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a portrait of civilization in collapse.Bruno Bettelheim once gave a lecture in which he said that modern mass-society displays a manic and unhealthy preoccupation with speed and motion, and that this preoccupation betrays the inner emptiness of \\"a hollow man\\". \\"Instead of asking where we are [inwardly] we just jump into the car and say, 'Let's get going'.\\" Like Mike Judge's satiric filmIdiocracy, Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451 develops the idea of a fallen modernity to its logical conclusion. But unlike Idiocracy, Fahrenheit 451 is no satire. It is serious social criticism without a glimmer of humor. Bradbury's fictional world is a fascist state built on what NeoCon Philip Zelikow calls \\"public presumption\\", \\"public myth\\" --- shared ideas assumed to be true but not known to be true. In other words, reality is what a government says it is. Bradbury's fictional world shares much, therefore, in common with George Orwell's novel 1984.The plot is built around the awaking conscience of a government employee, a firefighter who has always accepted public presumption as truth. The awakening is not pretty. Guy Montag, the protagonist, begins to question his culture: Mindless entertainment, disrespect for life, constant motion. In Guy Montag's culture, the public presumption is that books are a potential terrorist threat. The job of firefighters, therefore, is to seek out and burn books. Given recent developments in US politics and society, Fahrenheit 451 --- like Orwell's 1984 --- has become more trenchant with each passing year. Bradbury explores the longterm moral and social implications of our present Zeitgeist."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a story about a sick and twisted future in which books are forbidden by a Totalitarian Regime. The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all the books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this store, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The world of tomorrow, where no one knows what could happen next. Everyone has their opinion, and Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a great example of a realistic future. This book is a cautionary story. The message is that we should consider the dangers of electronics, if we don't, people will start to forget the value of books, reading, and learning. I really enjoyed this book and reading what the author thinks the future holds.Fahrenheit 451 is based in the 24th century where electronics and television are valued more than school, learning, and books. Reading is considered a crime. Firemen are now used to destroy books. Guy Montag is one of those firemen. After meeting a neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, he is left wondering about his world and what it has come to. Upon Clarisse's death, Montag considers books and what is going on. He starts stealing and reading books. Montag says in part 1, \\"There must be something in books, things we can't imagine, to make a woman stay in a burning house; there must be something there. You don't stay for nothing.\\" Turned in by his wife, Mildred, Montag finds himself having to destroy his house and getting arrested. He manages to escape by murdering his chief. While hiding from the police, Montag meets a group of men hiding for the same reason. In the end, Montag leaves his city as it is being bombed and a war has begun.Fahrenheit 451 teaches us that we need to realize the value of books, reading, and thinking. Also, it's showing us the dangers of electronics. Every day some new technology comes along and people tend to rely on it way too much. This book is trying to tell us that we should realize and understand how addicting electronics can be, and that we need to always value books, reading, and learning.Fahrenheit 451 is very good and I really enjoyed reading it. It was very suspenseful and you always wanted to keep reading to find out what happens next. It isn't a very hard book to read, and it also isn't very long. It only has a couple flaws. It felt very rushed in the beginning, and it didn't give a good description of the characters. However, people should read this book because not only is it a very interesting story, but it also cautions us about the future. I give it 4 stars out of 5. If you enjoy this story, some other books like it are: \\"1984\\" by George Orwell, \\"A Brave New World\\" by Aldous Huxley, and \\"The Caves of Steel\\" by Isaac Asimov.Fahrenheit 451 has great messages about how we should consider the dangers of electronics and TV. Other messages include how valuable books, reading, and thinking really are. I definitely think that others should read it as well. I can't wait to try reading other books that are similar to this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote the novel Fahrenheit 451 in the spring of 1950, while living with his family in California. At the time that Bradbury was writing the novel, the surrounding society began to read condensed versions of books, not wanting to bother with thinking too much about the actual full-lengthed book. This little bit of information found its way into Fahrenheit 451 and is part of one of its larger themes that deal with ignorance and censorship.In Fahrenheit 451, Bradbury builds a futuristic environment in which books are degraded by burning, a method which enables society to achieve equality. The title is significantly chosen because it represents the temperature at which books ignite. The majority of the members of this revolutionary society do not want books destroying their equality; they hate to feel inferior to others who have read more books and have obtained more knowledge.One of the key elements that Bradbury stresses in this novel is \\"knowledge versus ignorance.\\" In a society with no books, there is a better chance of equality among the people. If all the books are banned and then thrown into an incinerator, the envy and jealously of knowledge stops, which in turn makes society content. Because of this lack of knowledge and experience with books, the general public becomes consumed with technological advances, such as \\"Seashells\\" which are described as electronic devices, situated in the ear, that speak directly to the user. Books are burned in answer to differing opinions. If no one reads books, then no one can be offended by what the books have printed in them. It is all a systematically planned structure to endorse \\"sameness\\" among the members of society.Montag enjoys burning books until he meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who gives Montag a shove towards a new way of believing. She does not fall victim to the censored society norms and views the world from a different perspective, playing a key role in enhancing the plot. She is described as having \\"odd habits\\" which often times included nature, spending time by herself, and asking questions; all activities which were frowned upon by other members of the community. Clarisse tragically gets hit by a high-speed car and dies, only encouraging the idea that Montag's life needed rearranging. After all, Clarisse was the first one to ask if Montag was really happy in life and only after her tragic death does he realize how unhappy he has become.Truth is what one has faith in. Montag begins to have faith in books and the knowledge that he gains from them, and so he commences to find his inner truth. Bradbury devotes a small section of the novel to the discussion of truths in the chapter entitled \\"The Sieve and The Sand.\\" While Montag is struggling over what the books offer to him and what he reads, he has a flashback to a time when he was on the beach attempting to fill a sieve with sand to win a dime. With this task came frustration because no matter how hard he tried, he could not fill the sieve up with the sand. A similar situation arises with Montag in his present state; he knows that something good will come out of the books, but he just has a hard time \\"filling up the sieve,\\" or figuring out what that something is. In a theological sense, the sand can come to symbolize the concrete truth that Montag desperately tries to find, while the sieve represents the intellect seeking a truth that is much greater, indefinable, and impossible to seize.Throughout the novel, Montag increasingly becomes estranged from his wife, his co-workers, and society as a whole. As he becomes more interested in books, he loses the common beliefs that tie him to the society in which he lives. No longer is he victim to the violent overthrow of nature, knowledge, and books. Montag is able to fight against his doubts and separate himself against the others in hopes of a better tomorrow.Montag stumbles upon a group of men sitting around a campfire, a fire which is comforting and inviting; a stark contrast to the fire that Montag is used to. Granger, the leader of the group, quickly welcomes Montag and describes the group as the \\"Book People.\\" The group is part of a nation-wide network of people devoted to saving books. Each member memorizes a book and waits until the opportune time to tell the retained knowledge. Montag is given a title to remember and recite and thus is initiated into the book society. The novel ends with Montag's spiritual revitalization - own intellectual journey - and the complete destruction of the city due to the war that very few citizens were aware of. Bradbury leaves Montag and the \\"Book People\\" to revive the city and with hopes of a new society where books will flourish.The \\"Book People\\" are alienated from society in that their ideas and theories are different from the accepted beliefs of the city dwellers. Instead of burning books, the \\"Book People\\" acknowledge a book's worth and capture the words of wisdom in their memories. The members of this elite group live outside the city, on the outskirts of the woods or wherever the path of knowledge leads them, thus separating them from civilization.The futuristic environment created by Bradbury may have been influenced by society at the time, however, society may actually be slowly slipping towards this censored environment. Just like in the novel, modern governments now censor news and media to influence the opinion of its people. Internet sites like Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter are just a few examples. By promoting censorship and \\"sameness\\" you limit societies progression that is gained the knowledge included in reading. If this trend continues we may all change our names to Guy Montag and hope for the phoenix to rise from the ashes of our destructed society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"im in highschool right now and had to read this book for summer homework. normally i find reading books for class to be strenuous, but i really enjoyed this book. being the first time i read a piece of bradbury's work, i definently came away impressed with his unique writing style. it makes you re-think how we use technology in our daily lives and offers a future that is frightening to consider. a really good story to top it off, this book is well worth a read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first book I had to read for school that I actually liked, and was therefore to a large extent responsible for keeping my love of reading alive into adulthood. That was nearly two decades ago, and rereading it now has been an equally delightful experience. It is a truly great novel, and this is even easier to appreciate after having read the earlier versions \\"The Fireman\\" and \\"Long After Midnight\\", which by comparison and contrast serve to highlight the structure, the richness of descriptive detail, the astonishing variations in metaphors about heat and fire (and their opposites) throughout, and more. Even apparently trivial lines of dialogue are laden with layers of meaning, as when Montag's wife tells him, \\"You don't look so hot yourself.\\"It is also fairly philosophically sophisticated. While the novel is about a fireman who burns books, and Bradbury is clearly enamored of books, they are just a symbol: \\"It's not books you need, it's some of the things that once were in books. The same things could be in the 'parlour families' today. The same infinite detail and awareness could be projected through the radios and televisors, but are not. No, no, it's not books at all you're looking for! Take it where you can find it, in old phonograph records, old motion pictures, and in old friends; look for it in nature and look for it in yourself. Books were only one type of receptacle where we stored a lot of things we were afraid we might forget. There is nothing magical in them at all. The magic is only in what books say, how they stitched the patches of the universe together into one garment for us.\\"And it is not just about one political program versus another, or even about the individual versus the state, but about independence in the moral sphere, thinking and feeling for oneself: \\"I took the others on faith!...I don't want to change sides and just be *told* what to do. There's no reason to change if I do that.\\"He even abstracts from books to the nature of creative activity in general: \\"It doesn't matter what you do,...so long as you change something from the way it was before you touched it into something that's like you after you take your hands away. The difference between the man who just cuts lawns and a real gardener is in the touching.... The lawn-cutter might just as well not have been there at all; the gardener will be there a lifetime.\\"And there's so much more that's absolutely wonderful in this book that I can't even touch on here. Bradbury isn't always entirely consistent and the book has some other minor flaws, but they are insignificant compared to its virtues. Four and a half stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When Ray Bradbury died on June 5, 2012, his classic novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was sitting on my bedstand. I had picked up the 50th anniversary edition while romancing a quaint, quality bookstore (yes, some still exist) in Montpelier, Vermont. (Sorry, Amazon, it was just a fling, but oh what an affair.) It was a book that I had somehow neglected to read up to this point in my life and thought it high time that I did so.Published in 1953, the story takes place in an American city several decades in the future (which would be, I guess, about now). Bradbury depicts a society in which the state picks up where the public left off: having largely abandoned the written word, people live to be mesmerized by music, by moving pictures, by all manner of electronic stimulation. The state simply completes the migration by banning books altogether; books, the state asserts, cause people only confusion and unhappiness. Fire departments, rather than putting out fires, now burn down houses containing books. (Houses had been made fireproof, so there was no need to put out fires; on the other hand, it takes a lot of fire department-provided kerosene to get them burning.) In the background of the story, the U.S. is also on the verge of nuclear war with some unnamed country; bomber jets forebodingly streak across the sky at supersonic speeds. The message of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is transparent: electronic media is fast becoming the opiate of the masses, who have become so numbed by electronic sound, image and color that they pay little heed to their potential annihilation.Guy Montag is a fireman (in the new sense) who, having long been secretly intrigued by books, now finds that he is inflamed with the desire to protect them. His wife, who is nearly always either zoned out with a \\"seashell\\"--an iPod-like device--in her ear, or transfixed by the three-wall-sized 3D color television, is frightened by her husband's illicit bibliophilia. Lonely, Guy makes a series of impulsive, dangerous moves that he cannot walk back.The novel moves fairly briskly, and at about 165 pages, one can burn through it more-or-less quickly. Bradbury's language is surprisingly literary, though; the result is a pulp fiction story written in highbrow style. Sometimes his language sings, sometimes it comes off as merely prolix or high flown. I was also struck by how like 1950s television teleplays parts of the novel read: characters talk to each other in articulate mini-speeches, or they erupt in emotional ejaculations: \\"You're mad!\\" \\"Why would I be mad!\\" \\"Because!\\" Think \\"Playhouse 90.\\"Bradbury was prescient about both the miniaturization of electronics (the seashell earbud radio) and its extreme opposite (super large-screen, 3D color television). But he either didn't think of e-books, or perhaps dismissed the possibility as simply a stage towards the utter elimination of books.What Bradbury seemed less able to do was to think beyond the social norms of his own time: besides a sylph who serves as the catalyst for Montag's later actions, the only other intelligent, thoughtful characters are male. Bradbury belittles this line of criticism in the coda to his book (pp. 177-78, e.g., \\"For it is a mad world and it will get madder if we allow the minorities...to interfere with aesthetics\\"), but I don't think he gets off quite that easily. The point is not that there aren't women in the book, it's that almost all of them are nitwits and, perhaps for that reason, they don't appear at all among the story's intelligentsia. At one point, for instance, a group of people who all have memorized books gather round, and not one woman among them. Really, Ray?What of his central point about the rise of electronic media and the decline of books? How relevant is the story to today's reader? To my mind, Bradbury's story continues to be insightful about social trends, just not quite with the same sense of dread. Smart phones and e-tablets proliferate. Bookstores are disappearing and fewer books are being read by fewer people. According to a 2007 study by the National Endowment for the Arts, \\"On average, Americans ages 15 to 24 spend almost two hours a day watching TV, and only seven minutes of their daily leisure time on reading.\\" But do people care? In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" the sense of dread is heightened by apocalyptic notes of imminent atomic war. Would there be greater concern over the slow death of reading for pleasure if there were a renewed sense of doom in our society?In short, Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a thought-provoking novel about a dystopian future. It's excellent material for a book club, if there are still any left."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The ideas and the issues \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" addresses are reason enough to read this book. Those deeply passionate about reading and literature will be greatly disturbed (and even devastated) by the bleak world Bradbury depicts in this novel, a world in which books are illegal and burned.I loved that this book gives us pause to think about what books mean to each of us and what their role and purpose is in society and to humanity as a whole. A small tome, it is rife with provocative and serious questions that could lead to many lively discussions. There's a lot of great symbolism running throughout, and is very meaty intellectually speaking.However, there were a few things about the novel that were somewhat regretable, in my opinion. First, the book felt very dated to me; without knowing when exactly it had been published, I was able to identify the decade based on the prose. Also, I generally did not respond to Bradbury's writing, which I found to be folksy and inelegant. I do not think that this book is considered a classic because of the magnificance of the author's writing, that's for sure!Ultimately, this is an important book that everyone ought to read and discuss. It will probably have the greatest impact if you read it as a teen, but if you missed out on it during your high school years, as I did, better to read it late than never. It's a shame about the actual writing, but the issues it examines transcend the weak prose."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A wonderful read. A commentary borne from the risidual fears from WWII. Belongs in the same category of Orwell's 1984. I like to write short reviews that get to the point, and not ramble on. Read it! If for no other reason, than seeing the parallels between Guy Montag's world and the type of world George W is trying to create."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was reading this book for Lang. Arts and at first I thought it was boring. But the more I read the more intresting it got. My favorite part was when Montag fought of the Mechanical Hound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I happened to only hear of this book a few weeks back when i read an article about 'Farenheit 9/11'. They mentioned how the title was taken from this book, and it mentioned how this book is about how in the future, firemen burn houses instead of put out fires. It mentioned about this fireman, Guy Montag, who meets a girl but then she vanishes. And in this day of age, their tv parlour, is his wife's family. I was pretty interested in the book and bought it soon after.A week after, and ive completed the short novel based on three short stories. I really liked it a lot, and there are lots of things which, even though this was written in 1953, that are similar to whats going on these days. There was one paragraph, where Montag says about America attacking countries for no reason. Now what does that remind you of? The whole book is Montag journey in discovering what books really are, how much of an inpact they have on people, and the truth.Overall, i would recommend this book. Its a very deep book, that makes you think about whats going on these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"1984 and Fahrenheit 451 are 2 books I've been wanting to read for a long time. The ideas behind them certainly interest me, and I've heard them hailed many times as masterpieces. I'm currently reading 1984 right now, and I can tell you right from the beginning that it's a better choice.That isn't to say, of course, that Fahrenheit 451 is a bad book. Far from it, the characters are, for the most part, well developed, and the idea behind the book is an interesting one. Ray Bradbury's idea of a censored future where war is a constant, yet supressed, issue is interesting, yet borrows heavily from 1984.My two major problems with the book, though, are the character interactions and the ending.Perhaps it's just Ray Bradbury's way of character development, but by the way the characters talk you would think they were all deeply mentally disturbed. They talk for pages and pages, constantly changing the subjects on a whim. It gives you the idea of a future where people never dwell too long on anything, but it also makes the book uninteresting. Oftentimes you can't tell the distinction between a character's ramblings in their own mind and a character's actions. I had to double-take a couple times just to make sure something really happened and the character wasn't just thinking about it.My second problem is the ending. It almost seems like Bradbury ran out of steam and couldn't think of anything else to put in the book, so he decided to nuke the city. Yes, it was a suprising ending and an interesting way to conclude the book, but it seemed like a rushed afterthought. Bradbury could have done so much with the characters after Montag left the city, but he decided to end it right there.If you're interested in this kind of book, I'd suggest it. It kept me captivated at times, even if in the end it was less than what it was made out to me. If you have to choose between 1984 and 451, go for 1984. If you can pick up both, do so."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book in my L.A. class at school. This book has many meanings tied into it. Fahrenheit 451 is different then what I usally read. This book has so many hidden detals in it. In this book I can acutally see our world now ending up like the world in this book. The author of this book was brillant to make up a world like this. The main character Montag was great I could realt to him and put myself in his shoes that's what I like so much about this book. If I didn't read this book in class I probably would never read it.Hi Ms. O!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, takes place in a futuristic society where reading books, or the written word, is against the law and if you get caught all of your belongings, house and all, get burned to the ground.Even though this book is completely unrealistic to our society and has firefighters burning down homes instead of saving them, it offers an insight to what live would really be like if there was no written word and if technology ruled our lives.Guy Montag, the main character and our look into the firefighting world, is a man content with his life and never thought of the right and wrong of his job until one day when everything goes wrong and he feels that his freedom is being oppressed.This novel contains some action and it better reading for an older reading audience but will be liked for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What if the Nazis had won WWII? Would the world change for the better, or worse? Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury deals with a society controlled to the point where firefighters and firemen are used to start fires in the middle of the night. Animals are no longer living, but programmed machines, and thinking out of the ordinary is considered blasphemous. This is the exact type of lifestyle the Nazis would have enforced. Guy Montag, a fireman, questions these ethics after a book burning at an old woman's house goes terribly wrong. This incident inspires Guy to question his type of life and the government's thinking. As society and the fire chief catch on to Guy's unorthodox behavior, Guy finds himself a target by society and the hunt for his life begins.The setting of this book is very difficult to follow. Ray Bradbury does a poor job of showing or even telling where the story takes place, and what the date is. Because of this, you find yourself wondering throughout the piece about simple things like where Guy is and the city he lives in. However, this sketchy plot gives you the sense that the city could actually be anywhere, which seems to be the goal of Ray Bradbury. When he first reveals to you that the city in which Guy lives is called City, it makes you wonder where in fact this story takes place. You do get clues about the type of lifestyle people live, like TV's in every household that are the size of whole walls, and the mechanical pets that are in each household. When reading this book I found myself picturing where I thought Guy was. So this was an effective way of writing to me. When Ray Bradbury describes Guy's wife driving on an isolated road in a forest, running over small mechanical animals at will, you know that the area must be in an area that has a temperate climate like Europe.I believe that a major fault in the book would be the main character Guy Montag. Guy pretty much has two personalities: the one where he doesn't think for himself and the one where he does. His ideas and attitudes change quickly in the beginning and then they stay the same again for the majority of the book. However, the supporting characters were developed quite well and I especially like the fire chief. As Guy's main antagonist, the fire chief played a pivotal part in the transformation of Guy.The plot on the other hand is done quite well. The first half of the book slowly sets the tone, and introduces and develops the characters. As soon as you switch over to the second half of the book, you are just blown away. The second half deals with Guy's struggles in his quest to find the truth and flee from the hell in which he lives.It is very simple to tell when the book is in each of the action stages and when the conflicts change. The books builds up so well to the climax that you can't wait to turn the page to see what happens next. The climax keeps you glued to the book and never gives you a chance to take a break.The theme and topic are very unique and are what keep you interested. I couldn't put down the book because I just wanted to see how a society so influenced by specific rules would turn out in the end. I recommend this book to readers who enjoy science fiction books and suspense novels. This is one of Ray Bradbury's best pieces and I think everyone will enjoy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying \\"Don't judge a book by its cover\\", you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book takes place in a futuristic society (around 2500 probably). It was written in 1950 and many of the predictions Bradbury made back then are happening right now. It really is scary when you think about it.Guy Montag isn't a regular fireman. His job isn't to put fires out but to burn houses with books in them. In Bradbury's futuristic society books are illegal. People who read them are called crazy and usually put in an asylum. Montag really loves his job and has fun doing it, until the day that he meets a girl named Clarisse. Clarisse isn't like other people - she likes to smell flowers, to climb trees, and to talk and think, which isn't something most other people care about. In this society, people watch their TVs, go to work, and sleep. No one talks, no one thinks...Clarisse starts Montag thinking, &quot;What do books say? Why were they banned?&quot;. I can't say much about the plot because I'd be giving away a lot of interesting things about the book but I can say, you won't be disappointed. The book is guaranteed to make you think, and keep you up all night until you finish it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A standard in the dystopian utopia that Brave New World and 1984 also capture, this is the third in a triad of phenomenal dystopian books written that everyone should read. While banned in some jurisdictions, the idea of book burning and reading being illegal is still a serious issue. We ban books in our library systems, and in our schools. While we do not burn books on a regular basis, the vision timeliness of this book still has not faded since it first came out in print.The book centers on a \\"fireman\\" Guy Montage and how he has to adjust his beliefs in line with the people around him that he meets, especially the Professor and the teen-age girl that provide an interesting counterpoint to the vacant wife that he lives with. Books are dangerous, and in the society here, even more so as books are burned, and the newspaper is reduced to a comic strip without words. As he looks around the environment that he lives in and compares his needs to the way that the world is going, supervisors, wife, and friends all notice that he is pulling back from long held beliefs. This is the problem, and the reason that the book works so well. While the society is not constantly monitored like in other books, friends and family eventually have a major impact on where Guy goes, and what Guy does throughout the course of this book. It is almost like he has no control or purpose outside of what others think, say, watch, or do.This is probably the best Bradbury book written, and should be on everyone's bookshelf. Five of Five stars, the more copies in the house the better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"True FictionThough this book [Faremhieght 451] is a piece science fiction, it relates in its own little ways to the way the world is today.

Farenhieght 451 is a must read for anyone who likes a good philosophical novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a few years out of college and most people are shocked to find out that I have never read \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Given how much of an avid reader I am, it is rather shocking that I had never read this. I was never assigned this in High School, though in retrospect I would have rather read this than the books I read in High School, such as John Steinbeck novels, my arch nemesis. I was also shocked to see that as I'm writing this 79 people gave this book a rating of one star. Clearly these people do not know what is out there; this book is not that bad. Granted I have some misgivings about the book, but it brings up some excellent concepts and I can't help but feel these people lack the education level to go beyond what the book is about. Maybe I am simply thinking on this level because I am older and can no longer truly identify with the High School mentality, but I don't think I ever did. There is this factor and the fact that their reviews were quite poorly written for the most part, so they clearly lacked literary prowess and their reviews do not hold much weight.Either way you look at it this book is now considered quite the classic. It is usually lumped together with Orwell's \\"1984\\" and I do agree with others that \\"1984\\" was the better story. Orwell created a much more vibrant and tangible world, Bradbury on the other hand did not succeed nearly as well. I can't help but think that Bradbury likely had read \\"1984\\" and thought of a slightly different worldview and thus did not feel the need to flesh his ideas out nearly as much. Whatever was the motivation for this, it was not a great move. This book starts off fairly slowly and ends on a rather sour note making the reader want to know what happened after.Essentially the reader is thrust into a futuristic world where it is illegal to read or own books. Thus most of the population is borderline mentally challenged and gets most of its information through news blips on their television screens or these radio earbud things. (Strangely we have earbud headphones now that are quite popular.) During this technological advancement they also made houses fireproof and thus no longer needed firemen, but they eventually developed a new job for them... burning books. Guy Montag, a fireman, is our protagonist throughout the story and after meeting a young girl that sends his mind reeling he ends up unconsciously working against this perverted society. He starts to slowly figure out that his wife is essentially a zombie to this society and she doesn't have any substance to her person. The book focuses more on his emotional responses to learning all of these things, and thus in heightened emotional states he doesn't make very great decisions. Although, his Fire Chief, Beatty, is the main antagonist and pursues Montag after he figures out what is really going on with his employee. Beatty was probably one of my favorite characters because he was so eloquently spoken. Unfortunately Montag was no real match for such a man's intellect and there was never a real battle of wits between them. Eventually Montag's disgust for society grows to paramount levels and he naturally becomes the outlaw of the land. Naturally, I couldn't help but see the parallel to 1984's characters. A great fugitive chase takes place and his chased by a robot dog, which is pretty much the only major weak part of this futuristic world, mostly due to the fact it's a goofy idea. Anyway, Montag covers his scent, though I can't help but think this is unrealistic even for this novel knowing what I do about genetics, pheromones and computer systems. Technically a robot dog primarily used for its olfactory sense should be able to detect him no matter what, because on a molecular level you still emit your scent.I don't want to give too much away, but suffice to say the book eventually abruptly ends. I felt like it was rather lacking at this point because I wanted to know what happened afterwards. I can't really give away the ending of the book because there really wasn't an ending. Of which, I left a ton of stuff out here and never even explained what actually happened in full, so don't feel cheated out of the adventure of the book. Once you get into this book the middle section is great and moves along quite briskly, but it trails off eventually.The book is important from a literary perspective because it really shows some of the major dangers in censorship. It even outlines things that are done now. How about the part of this book that points out that it all started off catering to the minorities... how often is that done today. We need to accommodate the small groups so that everyone is happy, it doesn't matter if it's wrong? This is happening more and more in the world today, like if a child has problems learning then it's not the parents fault, it's the schools fault, or it's some obscure genetic related fault, thus it is no the child's responsibility to learn anything anymore. How about making books abridged today to bolster a High Schoolers interest in getting to read a classic? Snip off a few words here, a few words there. Obviously they wouldn't find these books interesting so we have to dumb them down to their intellectual level. Naturally this will help progress society?That's how it all starts, and then people start to wonder why they need the full text at all, why not a paragraph summary? Why not a single sentence? Bradbury spells it out plainly for us in this book that that is exactly what happened in his imagined future. How long before simplicity replaces completeness in our society? Now we learn today that blurbs mean everything and people get a major amount of information from quick blurbs to feed our fast paced society, so they just write clever headlines and people think they have the news. It's progressively happening more and more. People don't want to take the time to read, so they get Cliff Notes. They don't desire to comprehend on their own half the time, so they watch a movie about it where there is less internal struggle to see from the characters. People who think that the problems this novel portrays aren't happening today aren't living in the same world the rest of the intellectual community is living. Those people are living in Orwell's world, in Bradbury's world. And pretty soon they will be the ones making decisions for everyone else in this world when they are the ones who eventually come into power because they are the best at writing clever headlines for two bit readers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 deals with the anti-intellectual society that is America. How everyone distracts themselved with materialistic values and doesn't take ahold of education as well as they should. This book was released ahead of it's time and is beautifully written. The way Bradbury describes each situation helps to place you right there with Montsg (the main character). It's a must have for any personal library."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Everything that needs to be said, already has been in other reviews. All I will say is this book is one of the best I have read in a while. The scary thing is, it isn't to far from the truth as well.People who don't like reading SHOULD read this book. It will make you think, and it only takes a few hours to read. So why not read it?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic fantasy set in an America in which reading is forbidden, firemen burn books and everyone rushes without taking time to \\"stop and smell the flowers.\\" I believe that the people who compare this work to McCarthyism and Nazism are missing the point. It depicts a world in which reading has fallen out of favor, people watch television constantly, engage in shallow conversations and are in incessant rushes to get somewhere. Funerals are banned because they bring sadness and people have forgotten to appreciate nature, contemplate beauty and love one another.The principal action of this book occurs when a seventeen year old neighbor introduces the protagonist, Montag, to the world of nature. The book progresses as Montag gradually changes into a person more to our ideal.Although set in the future, this book contains much that is familiar. Portions remind the reader of Lost Horizon. More moving than that are factors which we see in our own world. Have we arrived in a world in which television has decreased reading and shortened attention spans? Is our literature and discourse made blander because minorities and special interest groups demand protection from anything which may hurt their feelings? Do we try to equalize the weak by weakening the strong? I am afraid that we see much of this future world in our own. Fahrenheit 451 provides, not only a pleasant read, but also a wake up call for all who are concerned about our culture."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books that leaves you thinking after reading it, one of those that would have been destroyed in Bradbury's story. A tale of a future where books are burnt so that people don't have to think. They're only allowed to watch TV, especially sports and soaps. Does it sound you familiar?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Simply a classic piece of literature, there is no possible way you can read this book and not take something valuable from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So everyone else seems to praise Bradbury's cultural observations and what-if scenario that man is eventually destined for, which I appreciate, a lot, but you can read about in other reviews.When it comes down to it the writing of the book isn't entirely great. Bradbury intentionally made the characters childlike and naive, and the writing had the same feel. I want to think this was on purpose, but it was probably more because it was easy.Why is it in great novels where the world has become a giant conspiracy that there is always only one or two random, seemingly normal people that figure it out. \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World\\" also do this and it drives me nuts. There's no real reason why it all of a sudden dawned on the character that the world that has been presented to them is flawed. Why is it only one person ever realizes it, and for no real apparent reason. They just wake up and say \\"wait a minute...\\".I also wish these books went 1. more into the reasons why the society got to the way it is and 2. more into how the character reconciles the truth of the situation and carries on for a better world. The plot is too simple of a line. Society is dumb, man realizes society is dumb, man calls it out, society tries to shut man up, society does something dumb to itself, man says \\"ha, i told you so\\".As far as a thought proviking warning to our culture and framing a plausible future to teach our kids with, this books succeeds. As far as being a well written literary masterpiece this book is overly simplified. But then again, that could be what truly sets it apart. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 was a very good book about Guy Montag who is a fireman. In his world fireman start fires instead of putting them out because the government had banned books so the population doesn't over come the Executive branch.Montag meets Clarisse who changes his life, he see's interesting books can be.My favorite part in the book was when Montag started to run from the police. He had got very mad at the firemen and went crazy. He burned the fire chief with his flame thrower then ran to try to get out of town. The whole city was looking for him and the government even had a mechanical hound that \\"never failed\\" when it came to chasing and finding someone. Well I guess the hound could fail because Montag jumped into a river as he goes out of the town. He wound up on a railroad track with a bunch of other tramps. They would read books and remember them. They were the only library in this world.I recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a very exciting book that draws you in and you'll never want to put down. Fahrenheit 451 kept me reading it till I finished. It has a lot of action and has a really creative story line. It is scary how realistic it is. I wish Ray Bradbury had made a sequel to this book to see what happens to Montage once he followed the train tracks. If you like books that keep you on the edge of your seat and that mesmerize you then you should read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was one of the most thought filled pieces of work I have read since &quot;Homer&quot;.

For example; montage said he had been a fireman for 6 years at begning of the book, but there is a place on the book that saiys he had been a fire man for about ten years.

The people who reviewed it poorly actually help show why its so important.Their comments about how they were forced to read agianst their wishs parell completely with the books theme. The books view that &quot;books were banned because they made people think, when they didn't want to&quot; is proved to be much more prevelant now that it was in the 1950's.

I read it in seventh grade and I recommend it to anyone who likes books. Fahrenheit 451 has a very captivating plot and is pretty well written, but at some parts it got extremely confusing, especially at the part when Guy Montag's wife took too much drugs or something like that. I read that part over 50 times and I still didn't get it until I had to asked my brother."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting to read.

I had recently wrote an essay about censorship and with the help of this book clearly made it easier for me to understand the issue better."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have previously read other book by Ray Bradbury, and it is true to say that I enjoyed this one the most. I don't really enjoy reading, but this book made me realize, maybe I should start. We were forced to read this book in school but, I didn't mind so much. This book really makes you thin of what the worls might become if we don't take action now. Technology will eventually get out of hand, and then we will need people like Granger to help us get our society out of the dilemma. I think everyone should read this book. Sure there are some boring parts where I found myslef falling asleep, but I recommend it to all ages."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The whole concept of this book bothered me. It made you think about other people persepctive, but the idea of book burning was something that was hard for me to get through when reading this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book because it's supposed to be one of the best dystopian sci-fi novels of all time. It was good, but not anywhere near as good as others I've read in this genre. I've found that I don't like Bradbury's style. He's a bit too ornamental, romantic, melodramatic for my taste. He's also rather egocentric--using his writing to serve himself rather than the writer, which turns me off. If you read some of his interviews, you'll see what I'm talking about. Nevertheless, I think all dystopian sci-fi fans should read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So, I ordered this book after consistent protesting from my fiance that this was fantastic. Maybe it was a combination of how high he had built it up, or the fact that I was never forced to read this when I was in school, but it did not impress me. It was an OKAY book, I am just was not overly impressed. Plus, I feel kinda cheated that I had to pay so much for it, compared to other Kindle books. Overall, I would recommend it if you are very interested in futuristic works, but otherwise, it is not the best read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message in the book is similar to that in \\"1984\\" and in the writings of Ayn Rand. At times the message seemed to be so \\"in your face\\" and I'm certain that Mr. Bradbury would have been more subtle had he written it 10 or 15 years later."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is typically a novelist you read as a child or an adolescent, much like Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke. For whatever reason, I never read Bradbury as a young man (other than a tiny handful of shorter pieces), and I've only recently decided to correct that omission. I thought I would begin with FAHRENHEIT 451, which is easily Bradbury's most famous work.Needless to say, this dystopian novel is quite impressive, and not just on the literary merits. What impressed me most was Bradbury's scalding critique of modern-day society, with its ever-shortening attention spans and its addiction to a media that is both ever-present and dumbed-down.FAHRENHEIT 451 was written way back in 1953, but it holds up beautifully. Many of its lessons are directly applicable to our multimedia age. Contrary to popular perception, this is a not a novel about state censorship, as much as it is a novel about how people willingly give up the power to think and reason for themselves. The books in FAHRENHEIT 451 are burned because the people demand it -- their increasingly rigid and shallow minds (both liberal and conservative) feel threatened by the ideas the books contain.FAHRENHEIT 451 is a short novel, one that lacks the literary style of a Margaret Atwood or even an Aldous Huxley. But it conveys its message quite powerfully, and it also success very well as a work of suspense. Not only is this book thought provoking, but it's exciting to read.It's rare when a \\"classic\\" novel exceeds my expectations, but FAHRENHEIT 451 by Bradbury accomplishes that feat. Based on my success with this book, I plan to read more of his work very soon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was one of my favorite books in high school, and reading it again had a certain charm, but my issue with it can be summed up in a small quote from an interview included in the final pages.\\"DEL RAY: In the introduction to the recently published Bradbury: An Illustrated Life\\", a wonderful book which I have spent hours immersed in--RAY BRADBURY: Isn't that an incredible book?\\"I had the same issue with Brave New World. Even though these science fiction romps are interesting and at times exciting, the authors are so in love with themselves and their prophetic ideas, it hurts; sometimes it even cramps the writing. The ham-fisted emotions of Guy Montag are bizarre and nonsensical to say the least--the other characters suffer a similar sort of cartoonishness.I do see why it's such a great book for high schoolers though."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I purchased this book for my teenaged son to do an English class book report.

Mr. Bradbury's voice is gruff and adds to the theme of the story, but also distracts. that is the only reason I did not give it a full 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a futuristic where all books are banned, and simple things, such as being a pedestrian can get you arrested. The book was written around the end of World War II, and was probably influenced by Nazi Germany because of their effort to censor everything. The main character is named Guy Montag, who is a firefighter. He is not a typical firefighter that we would think of though, his job is burn books. His life changes one day after having a conversation with his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, who asks him if he is happy or not. After this conversation he ends up on a wild journey that then leads him to fight to save the one thing that he used to destroy.This book has stood the test of time and is a true classic. It has been referenced to in many other books, TV shows, and movies since its publication in 1953. Ray Bradbury does an amazing job of writing the novel, with numerous twists and turns. It had me on the edge of my seat while reading the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book in 8th grade as part of a requirement. I found the book to be excellently written and with an amazing plot line. You'll despise the hound while pondering Montag. I recommend this book for ANYONE who enjoys a bit of imagination."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book that I highly recommend, particularly to today's youth,because I feel that the message is one very much needed in a society dominated by television. The book was a sort of prophesy by Bradbury in the 50's, warning Americans of what may happen to young minds today and in the future, if we allow television to blindly influence our lives and society. I view the &quot;families&quot; as the television, dangerous because it delivers suggestions to the brain, before one can approach it with analytical thought. Visual suggestions can alter your way of perceiving life if one doesn't approach it with question and analysis. Books, however, allow one to analyze and reason out ideas for themselves. This is a point clearly illustrated in Brabury's book, the importance of reading; the enhancers of free thought. Once again, I strongly recommend Fahrenheit 451 be read, particularly by the youth of the 90's and the millenium. This is definitely a book needed in our age of runaway technology."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A book you have to think about, and that makes you question society and the way you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"THE BOOK WAS GREAT IN THE WAY THAT IT WARNED US OF A FUTURE THAT COULD COME SOON, BUT FOR YOUNGER READERS THEY MAY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH ALL THE METAPHORS THAT HE THROWS IN THERE."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Overall, I liked this book. I am doing my 11th grade AP English-3 research paper on it. Overall, this book made me think. It made me think about how people of the WW 2 time period thought: that there might be another war.

A good example is when he returns to the firehouse the night his wife turns him in. they get a call and it turns out to be his own house. It was obvious from the beginning that they would be ending up at his house (I thought), but to describe it Bradbury writes: &quot;Why,&quot; said Montag slowly,&quot;we've stopped in front of *my* house&quot;.

I really liked how the main character had ethics change as the story went on and how he turned around and made sure that he not only stopped burning books himself, but that he brought justice to those who wanted this done. I also liked the idea the author painted of the value of books. His characters actually ran away to a far place, where they could each memorize a book and retain that knowledge. The scary thing about this book is that hiding of knowledge is actually being done right now. Maybe not by burning books, but by degrading them and making the population so dumb by drugging the, we no longer retain knowledge as a culture. It's a little different than now, but it's exposing what happens when people are not allowed to learn and know things. Very interesting story and I'm glad this is recommended reading in schools."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'd been meaning to read this book for some time, so I decided to purchase it recently and found it to be so gripping that I did not put it down except to sleep.For a novel written in 1951, the truth behind it remains timeless.

Teniendo similitudes con 1984, para mi gusto la supera por la simpleza de su planteamiento: bomberos del futuro que en lugar de apagra incendios, los provocan, y siempre de libros. &iquest;Cabe mayor aberraci&oacute;n que imaginar un futuro de la humanidad id&eacute;ntico al pasado m&aacute;s rancio, en el que se quemaban bibliotecas y se trataba de acabar con la libertad de pensamiento?La novela supone tambi&eacute;n una llamada de atenci&oacute;n.

As a fireman, Montag has the job of burning books. However, Montag starts to question what he is doing after he befriends Clarisse McClellan who is not afraid of firemen. Montag is also influenced by Professor Faber who believes that books are important for three reasons: 1) they provide quality and texture of information, 2) they provide leisure time, and 3) the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two. With the help of Professor Faber, Montag starts to challenge the status quo and eventually becomes a fugitive. This is a thought-provoking, alarming, and suspenseful book about what happens when people become too sensitive about what is printed in books and when the public stops reading of its own accord."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most famous works of science fiction, and with \\"Brave New World\\" and \\"1984\\" represents one of the most memorable and haunting dystopias. In a future world, books are banned and firemen actually set fires instead of extinguishing them. The state exercises a form of social control through controlling what sort of information people have access to. It turns out that not all books are banned, only those that we would today consider \\"great works\\" - Plato, Shakespeare, The Bible, Darwin, etc. For me one of the biggest surprises about Fahrenheit 451 was the rationale that was offered for the burning of those books. In a nutshell, they offended politically correct sensibilities and the authorities felt that they would undermine the social cohesion. This expunging of the classics from the culture has an uncanny resonance with the attempts over past few decades to expunge them from the undergraduate liberal arts curriculum. And rationale is also similar: these books are not \\"diverse\\" enough and may offend the sensibilities of an ever-increasing list of \\"minorities.\\" It is hard not to wonder if a milder, softer version of dystopian future that Bradbury was worried about in the early 1950s has not in fact arrived.Bradbury's writing and ideas are somewhere between those of George Orwell and Philip K. Dick. His style is very engaging, and even poetic. His writing is at its best when one of his characters engages in a prolonged monolog. However, the plot development could use some improvement. There is very little in terms of transition from one scene to the next, and most scenes are overly compressed. It is very hard to follow the plot developments at times. Nonetheless, Bradbury is a wonderful stylist and unlike much of science fiction this book is a pleasure to read on a purely literally level as well as for its sweeping ideas.As a last note, I found it incredibly ironic that I read this book on Kindle. Based on this alone I am fairly optimistic that reading and great books will not only survive but in fact thrive well into the 21st century."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a very important must-read for every person living in America at this time in history.

Well I am one of those teens that fit into that category, and, having read this book for an assignment, I have to say that I don't regret substituting passing notes for reading this book. The descriptions of the future are so exact and precise that it's mind boggling. Clarisse (In Part I) portrays almost perfectly what nobody else could.

He learns to love books, and is not afraid to do what he belives. Everyone else does what they are supposed to : watch T.V. and other forms of entertainment that require little, or no intellect whatsoever.(that is just the very beginning) This novel is very close to real life, and is the most acurate prediction of where our society is headed (Not literaly!, just the conformity, and the censorship) There is more to conformity than what appears to be, as Ray demonstrates. It also eliminates love in some ways, and &quot;life&quot;.

I recommend this book to anyone who still has some space left for something original, inducing thought, Un-Godzilla, Un-Happy-end-Hollywood-like movies and cheap made-to-order money-making books. My deep respects to Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was awsome. I read it in a matter of hours because I couldn't put it down. Just thinking about firemen starting the fires, to make the world &quot;agree&quot; with its self. If to read books was against the law, I don't see how people could live in a world like that. Censorship to the bone. This book is a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The lessons learned from good authors are timeless. Reading this book today one wonders how a writer 50 years ago could have so much insight into the society we live in today.Yes its about censorship, but its also about today's media and advertising culture. People are fed the news and told what opinion they should have about it... why bother thinking yourself?The parts of the book about television and how the media ties into law enforcement are chilling, in light of the new &quot;Amber Alerts&quot; adopted across the country.Good books make you think about your world, and this one makes you wonder how Bradbury could have known.The afterward (or coda) was priceless, and its comments on censorship and &quot;editing&quot; are far more frightening than people showing up to burn your books.&quot;I will not go gently onto a shelf, degutted, to become a non-book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book points out while at the absolute extreme mind you what the negative effects of censoring books can be. It is Ironic that this book is on the list of top 100 books challenged between 1990 and 2000. Besides being a great social commentary/civil liberties book, it is an exciting book. If you are in the mood just for a good page turner, read the book, if you are in the mood for a good social commentary, read the book.The story is basically about a man with an empty life who's job is to go around burning the homes of people who own books. A very good example of how empty a person's life can be without being able to exercise their mind. I think anyone who likes to read, will like this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's been a long time since I've read a book that I was so totally engrossed by. Fahrenheit 451 could have been written yesterday in as much as it relates heavily to todays world. When you read about this society in which people spend their lives glued to giant televisions, in which books, intellectual thought and art are forbidden, you can visualize it so perfectly in your mind that it's scary. This is not one of those simple books you pick up, read, and put back down. This is one that you will read again and that will stay in your mind as you ponder the meaning of the world around you and appreciate the fact that you are allowed to read at all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. Fahrenheit 451 is one of those books that you just can't put down. It's hard to say why, but you pick it up saying to yourself, \\"I'll just read a few pages,\\" and you end up reading for an hor or two because of the way it puls you in. The conflict starts imddediately, solving the problem of a slow beginning that some novels have. The very first few paragraphs show Guy Montag's love for fire that eventually becomes his personal struggle as well as the struggle of the world throughout the novel. There is alot of foreshadowing that you don't really recognize until you see what it's lead to, such as how Beatty doesn't run out of the kerosene-filled house as the others, but walks slowly almost delaying when the old lady pulls out a match. In leads into something very strange later on, but I don't want to give it away. This novel plays off the old concept of how you never really know how valuable something is until its taken away, playing on something as important as making books not only rare but illegal in the future. It also shows how destructive the world has and will become, with wars lasting technically 48 hours, and are decided in less time than it takes to blink. All and all it is a very interesting and entertaining book, and I would recommend Fahrenheith 451 to anyone, whehter they are heavy readers or not so heavy readers, such as myself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting book. Written by Ray Bradbury in the spring if 1950, this book gives a somewhat scary view of the future. In this future knowledge is suppressed. Fireman burn books, and start fires instead of preventing them. Life has only one purpose: to be happy. Now this doesn'tsound too bad, but when life loses all purpose, things are pretty bad. This book concerns censorship and how far it can go unchecked. It is also interesting to see what people thought the future would be like. It can be a little confusing for some, but overall it is a superb book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is just one of those you must read. The style is very good and it's loaded with phrases and metaphors for you to figure out well into the night. Nevertheless, I loved it and it's one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"FAHRENHEIT 451 is a grim yet thought-provoking novel of a dystopian future. Other novels that show a bleak future--1984 and BRAVE NEW WORLD come to mind--focus on what their authors see as the root cause of the implosion of human values. Ray Bradbury envisions this implosion as a gradual process of extreme cultural homogenization that, in the words of the novel's antagonist, Fire Captain Beatty, reduces 'everyone to the consistency of paste pudding.' Whatever it is that stamps one individual as different from another, the society of FAHRENHEIT 451 ruthlessly if not mindlessly grinds down and out that uniqueness that once marked a creative thinker.Guy Montag is a fireman who likes his job, which is to start fires and not extinguish them. He burns books to ashes, and then burns the ashes, as his firemen's slogan boasts. He sees nothing wrong with that, and at the start of the book, he is not unlike nearly everyone else in his acceptance of the Way of Things. Yet, Bradbury hints early on that Montag's mind and soul are ripe for a literary infection that is just as contagious as the Black Plague ever was. He meets a young girl Clarisse, who insists on asking him questions whose apparent nonsensical purpose is really meant to probe the paper thin layer of protection that Montag had built up over the years. She asks him if he is happy. She asks him if he has ever looked at the moon. With these seemingly innocuous questions, she infects Montag with the forbidden desire to know the 'why' of things. By the end of their first meeting, Montag now knows that his life has been a cotton candy lie. For the first time in his life, he can see that the society in which he lives is dedicated to the ultimate communistic ideal: each citizen is encouraged to reach only to a preordained level. To attempt to reach beyond that lies the swift punishment of the flamethrowers and the Mechanical Hounds. After only a few days, Montag is now stealing and reading forbidden books. The plot is not what sells the book or what has made it required reading on most college and high school campuses. The lure of FAHRENHEIT 451 is the manner in which Bradbury weaves the threads of present day trends of soap operas and quiz shows into a quilt whose collective and stifling weight crushes individualism just as surely as Orwell's Big Brother does in 1984. Bradbury uses a number of symbols (fire, books, the salamander, the Phoenix) which allow the reader to view a troika of social elements that contained within themselves the promise of death to the Thinking Man. Bradbury creates a triangle of public school education, technology, and interpersonal relations, all of which are perverted to create a society whose primary function is to use one's brains as minimally as possible for unthinking personal pleasure. The school system drills learning by rote in children's minds. No books are need for that. Technology provides huge televisions so that the stars of these shows interact with an audience to the extent that true human relations are shunted aside for a fake television 'family.' Personal relations of family and friends are then limited to inane conversations of the type that we here in the real world see on our tv commercials. Montag sees his wife Mildred as bad off as any of her equally brain-dead friends. He tries to infect her and them with the same teasing questions about the Meaning of Life that Clarisse used on him so successfully. To his horror, Montag learns that they are immune to the germ of curiosity. He cannot change his society, though he tries mightily by plotting with a former college professor named Faber to plant forbidden books in the homes of firemen. He learns that since he cannot change society, he must leave it.One of the best parts of the book is the cat and mouse game that Fire Captain Beatty plays with Montag. Beatty is seen as a man who once had been infected with the bug of individualism, but had since 'cured' himself and now is determined to cure Montag. Their extended dialogue is one of the great literary dialogues between oppressor and oppressed. Beatty explains how his society came to be and Montag learns that somewhere along the line, the process went horribly wrong. By the novel's end, the reader can only hope that the literary virus of infection will never meet its cure. For Ray Bradbury, this cure was not very far away. For Guy Montag, the cure was even closer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of those books that are like no others that I have read. A story of censorship where all fire men instead of put out fires they start fire but only to books. The book was written in the early 50's and is a novel of what is to be the future of all books, there are to be set ablaze. A man soon sees that it is wrong to set books on fire and tries to stop all that are against books. I think this is really a book like no other."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag, a futuristic fireman, works for the fire station where the goal is not putting out fires, but starting them.

Montag remains bothered by his event for a long time. He is unable to go on with his daily routine as he did before. After meeting with professor Faber, an old friend of Montag's, he receives a book from the professor and takes it home and begins to read.

Montag escapes the law and finds a group of people much like himself. Together they cultivate the knowledge they have gathered over the years and await a time in which they will be able to share the knowledge.Fahrenheit 451 is a well-written novel that invokes thoughts and questions in the reader's mind. Bradbury is a descriptive writer who paints a picture of a society that is not unrealistic or unimaginable. Written just after the era of Stalin, Fahrenheit 451 deals with oppression and an overly powerful society.

D. work on loneliness. Censorship certainly is the main theme, but another aspect of the book really touched my and might increasingly become critical for the 90s: I mean the feeling of being mentally isolated from a civilization that seeks nothing but distraction and variety - perfectly supplied by superficious media. Compared to this tendency, books might resemble dinosaurs, they require concentration, tranquility and a reader who is willing to think about the content. Every time I think of Guy Montag, I feel a little bit lonelier in this hasty culture. Unlike the end of the story, you shouldn't wait for collective self-destruction, from an individual point of view it will never be too late to re-discover the quality of slowliness in life, the taste of a conversation with somebody listening and understanding..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Twenty years ago I had to read Fahrenheit 451 as part of my required reading in the ninth grade. At the time reading wasn't my \\"thing\\". But for some reason, the book never left me, even though I could never remember why. Nothing about the book stayed with me, just the title.Now twenty years later, I have reread Fahrenheit 451 and know, without a doubt, why the book stayed with me.Imagine a world where books are burned. A world where firemen no longer come to the rescue to put out fires but come to burn your house down if you are caught with books. They no longer wield water hoses, but flamethrowers. That is the world that Guy Montag lives in. He is a fireman, and for years he's rejoiced in the destruction that his flamethrower produces, burning the hated nonsensical books of the past. And you know what the ironic thing about that is, books are illegal, yet not because of our government, oh no, because the citizens of our country made it so! It was the peoples choice to turn their backs on books. Life is not happy when you can think and criticize, form opinions, argue points. It complicates things. So what do they do? They dispense with anything that will allow for that type of communication.But then one night after work as Montag is walking home he encounters a young girl, Clarisse. She is a strange one. But why is she strange? She is strange because she actually talks and listens and looks and observes the things around her. And Montag is fascinated by that quality. He begins to question his job, his life. And then to further tempt his questioning curiosity about books and the reason they are so hated, a job comes in. Another burning is to be done. But this time the lady whose house is the next victim of the torch, sets herslef on fire along with her books. She cannot bare to be witness to the destruction and still live. But before the bonfire begins, Montag secretly snatches one of her books. Disturbed and unstable, Montag goes home and we learn that that is not the first book that Montag has lifted from a burn site. He has collected many books over the last year, secretly wanting to learn what the big deal is about reading and books. His life is not happy like it is supposed to be. Everyone is supposed to be happy without books. Without needing to think, to question, to wonder. He wonders what life was like before life became \\"simple\\". But in reality, the simplicity of life is not the outcome from life without books. With murders and suicides and violence and life at high speed, life is very much complicated. People have only brainwashed themselves into thinking that life is simple and happy, because they no longer think for themselves.I read this book just in time for banned book week. I find it very interesting the reasons people choose to ban this book or that book. Religious content, political views, profanity, nudity, sexually explicit, homosexuality. And you know what I gather from those reasons, the people making the fuss are simply insecure individuals. Each one of those reasons are part of our everyday life. If you are secure in who you are, then you would not feel threatened by its content. But you know, this whole thing with banning books due to content actually promotes the non-thinking, non-opinionated aspects of the society in Fahenheit 451 from happening. When a book is banned or is labeled controversial, it makes people wonder. It piques curiosity to learn what is within those pages that someone finds offensive. Take The DaVinci Code for instance. 80 million copies sold in 6 years! 80 million! That is a staggering number, especially in the short amount of time it's been in print. Now if you took away the controversy, and no one made a fuss, how many copies do you think would have sold? I doubt that many! So I say fuss over books, it brings them to light to some one who may not have known about it otherwise. It promotes critical thinking, opinions, and who are we without our opinions and thoughts? I don't agree with banning books, just because the content is written down doesn't mean it's going to become part of society, because you know what, it already is! So who cares if it's written. People do do drugs. People do have sex. People do say bad words. People are homosexual. And yes, people do have different religious beliefs. Just because you ban a book, doesn't make those things go away. We are individuals. We are who we are. And no one should be able to take that away by saying we cannot write this or that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is one of his finest works. It was first published in October of 1953, and then serialized in the March - May issues of Playboy magazine. The novel originally began as a short story \\"Bright Phoenix\\", though that was not published until 1963, and from there it was lengthened into the novelette \\"The Fireman\\" which was published in February of 1951 in \\"Galaxy Magazine\\". It is a novel of a dystopian society, and stands along with George Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\" as the best early examples of that type of work.Though it is easy to find similarities between \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the other two books, there are some key differences between them. In the earlier two works, the State appears to be the controlling force. We see this in the education centers in \\"Brave New World\\" and every aspect of the society in \\"1984\\", but in this work the society seems to have evolved from this through a change in social norms. People are judged by the number of wall sized televisions they have; books and intellectuals are spurned and eventually considered harmful to society. One should be happy, so news of the war is all in the background, and even the attempted suicide, or someone's death are mentioned in only in passing quickly and then the focus is back on happier subjects. People spend more time being entertained by a program called \\"My Family\\" then they spend interacting with their actual family, and for some children are a nuisance, so they are either not had, or if one has them they are sent off and only seen for short periods.One of the most effective parts of this short novel is the way he incorporates the feel of the society into his writing style. One of the key descriptions of the life which the hero, Fireman Guy Montag, is living is noise. He can't think, because of the noise of the televisions his wife has on, and it is apparent that he didn't even notice this until he met Clarisse McClellan, a free-spirited teenager who has moved in next door with her parents and her uncle. His conversations with her are different, they require thought, and there is time for him to think because they happen outside of the noise of life. This noise continues and gets worse when Clarisse disappears from his life, but she has helped bring forward his natural curiosity. The noise continues, and as Guy deals with his wife, her friends, his boss, the mechanical hound, the other firemen, the signs of war, an old professor acquaintance, etc. This noise is felt by the reader two, as Bradbury throws this mix together, though leaves it clear enough that the reader picks up on what is really going on.This noise is there through the first two sections of the book, and into the third section where at last Guy is pushed over the edge and commits the most desperate of acts, and by doing so he frees his mind. From then on, Guy is able to focus on the situation at hand, his being hunted, his escape, and his desire to save the thoughts and words of the books he has been destroying for so many years. He is able to discuss and think about the war and about Clarisse, his wife Mildred, and his actions; even though those are mostly sad and disturbing thoughts. The reader also feels the noise pressure is lifted, though he is certainly in danger.This is a tremendous book, though very short as far as novels go. It is not simply a rewrite of \\"Brave New World\\" or \\"1984\\". Those works were produced first, and those authors are often given more literary merit while Bradbury is too often thought of as a writer of speculative fiction. Those works teach us to be wary of the government becoming too powerful, while this work teaches us to be wary of our own laziness and the anti-intellectual movement of our society through entertainment such as television. This work also teaches us to be tolerant of those who are not like everyone else. This work was selected to receive the Retro Hugo in 2004 for novels written in the year 1953."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; a book in which the future is a scary place. In the beginning, however, it doesn't seem that way. Guy Montag is a fireman. His job is to create fires, not stop them. He burns books. Books, in this day and age, are illegal. Why? Because books promote thinking, and thinking creates ideas, and the leaders of the world don't want people thinking anymore.Montag steals one book, and then another, and another. He becomes fascinated with them so much, that he kills his superior officer when he finds out Montag has books.This book, although calm through most of the story, is a frightening look into the future. People don't think, so therefore, when someone gets killed, no one cares. There is a huge war going on, but no one knows why, and still no one cares.Bradbury really took the name of science fiction and put it to work, creating a book that was so unique it stretches your imagination beyond all belief."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; begins as an unremarkable piece of writing that makes you wish you had read it in Jr. High school when it would have seemed wondrous by virtue of the &quot;big ideas&quot; it contains. However, half-way through, author Ray Bradbury's dull prose suddenly turns pleasingly lyrical and, in terms of skill and style, catches up to the grandiose theme.The story takes place in a future where firemen no longer put out fires, they set fires - specifically, they set fires to books. The society in which this takes place is one where most people have become so deadened by the vacuous mass media television which pervades their existence, that they don't notice the absence of genuine thoughts or emotions in their lives. They are so numb that even their acts of suicide are committed absentmindedly.The novel follows fireman Guy Montag, who has an emotional epiphany when he meets one person who actually connects with his humanity in a life otherwise devoid of feeling. Feeling sets him to thinking and it's all downhill from there. While there are sections in the book where characters give majestic, pontificating soliloquies about the theme of book-burning which verge on Ayn Rand's literary bludgeonings in &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; there is plenty of suspense and action to offset the grandstanding.Bradbury, known for his futuristic novels is actually more adept here at rendering beautiful descriptions of nature than he is at depicting a three-dimensional futuristic world. When Montag views the destruction of his city by atomic blast, it is less compelling that the simultaneous image of him smelling the leaves and dirt in the forest from where he watches.In some ways &quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; chosen by Los Angeles Mayor Kenneth Hahn, as the first selection for that city's participation in the &quot;One Book, One City&quot; reading promotion, was an odd one. The book is, in many ways, a running indictment of the cavernously empty entertainments that many local residents produce on a daily basis. But it's okay, they won't have time to read the book anyway. They're too busy making &quot;reality&quot; shows about adulterous couples on cruiseships which are surprisingly like the stupefying television shows depicted in the book. Maybe someone did read this after all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I was in high School many moons ago, there were three books about the future that were required reading. Brave New World, 1984, and Fahrenheit 451. All three novels were dark looks at the future of a society that had lost its way. Fahrenhiet 451 is an a dark tale about the problems of modern life and how normal things taken for granted can be turned inside out. Bradbury's hero Montag, is a firemean that has the job of actually setting fires to burn books. For those of you who do not know, Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that paper catches fire. His world is about modern convenience and the lack of intimacy that society had developed over time. His chance meeting with another leads Montag down a path from book burner to exile on the run trying to save what he once destroyed. Bradbury tells a tale of the redemption of a man and the hope of society by learning what is important. It is an excellent read and very thought provoking. For those of you who do not think that books can ever be burned, I named this review what I did because this book is on an official banned book list in the United States. What do those who want to ban books to our children fear from this book? Makes one wonder."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Play the man, Master Ridley; we shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England as I trust shall never be put out. -Hugh LatimerGuy Montag is a Fireman, but in the future envisioned by Ray Bradbury, firemen don't put out fires, they start them. Firemen are responsible for burning books; all of which are banned, so that the people of this dystopia will not be troubled by difficult thoughts. Instead of reading, they watch endless soap operas on large screen TV's and the government provides for all their needs. Guy has had some qualms about his job, but he's never really thought through exactly what it is he's doing. But then, in short order, he meets an odd young neighborhood girl named Clarisse McClellan, his wife nearly kills herself with sleeping pills and, finally, when the firemen are called to an old woman's house, she refuses to leave:Montag placed his hand on the woman's elbow. &quot;You can come with me,&quot;&quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;Thank you, anyway.&quot;&quot;I'm counting to ten,&quot; said Beatty. &quot;One. Two.&quot;&quot;Please,&quot; said Montag.&quot;Go on,&quot; said the woman.&quot;Three. Four.&quot;&quot;Here.&quot; Montag pulled at the woman.The woman relied quietly, &quot;I want to stay here.&quot;&quot;Five. Six.&quot;&quot;You can stop counting,&quot; she said. She opened the fingers of one hand slightly and in the palm of the hand was a single slender object.An ordinary kitchen match.And before they can light the fire, she lights it herself and Guy is forced to consider what it is about books that would make a person do such a thing. As he tells his wife:Last night I thought about all the kerosene I've used in the past ten years. And I though about books. And for the first time I realized that a man was behind each one of the books. A man had to think them up. A man had to take a long time to put them down on paper. And I'd never thought of that before.As it turns out, the old woman has, like Hugh Latimore, lit a fire that will change the world, because Guy joins the nascent resistance to the book-burning government.He remembers meeting an old man named Faber in a park some time earlier and the hunch he had that the man had a book. Indeed, when Guy tracks him down, it turns out that Faber was a professor and he explains to Guy why books are of value:Number one, ... quality of information. Number two: leisure to digest it. And number three: the right to carry out actions based on what we learn from the interaction of the first two.Each bolstering the other's confidence, Guy and Faber set out to resist the system and, ultimately, Guy escapes to the wilderness beyond the city, where wandering bands of men are preserving great texts in memory, against the day when the knowledge is needed and learning is again valued.While not quite in a league with Orwell or Koestler, Bradbury's classic tale is an important treatment of the central themes of the century (of every century). His vision of a society where people have traded freedom for security had a particular resonance during the Cold War, but it should continue to be read as a cautionary tale. We head to the new millennium in the midst of the most spectacular flowering of Freedom that the world has ever known, but there is a continual tension in the species, between those who value that freedom, whatever its costs, and those who would choose the security offered by a controlled society and those who are afraid of uncomfortable ideas. freedom has the upper hand, but the struggle continues...GRADE: A-"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 depicts the futuristic world that we all fear: One in which freedom of thought and speech are gone; a world where personal communication is cut down to a minimum, and machines and technology are considered friends. In this fictional (but possibly realistic world), pedestrians are few and far between, and firemen actually create fires rather than put them out. Fahrenheit 451 depicts the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who is a typical twenty-first century citizen; self centered, obsessed with technology, and too busy to appreciate the simple things in life. After meeting a young lady named Clarisse, Montag engages in deep conversations with her, in which he learns to like the small things. Eventually, she even gets him to like the very things that he burns: Books. Meeting this girl also makes him realize how dull and boring his friends and family are, especially his wife. In a climactic ending, Montag escapes from his city after killing the fire-chief and running away with several books. He arrives at a small village of people who each have memorized one book, so as to keep the stories alive (whether or not they physically exist). This book is right next to 'The Martian Chronicles' as far as the best sci-fi books go. As is the case with all of his books, Bradbury paints a picture of a society which has much in common with ours today. He points out the various flaws in our world, but also shows us that there is still hope yet.

But when one woman refuses to leave her home and then stoicly burns beside her collection of books, Montag dares to wonder if all books are so dangerous as the government has trained him to believe.Of course, I can't forget to mention Clarisse, a young woman who seems interested in helping Montag decide for himself whether or not his line of work is justified or foolishly cruel.Fahrenheit 451 is about censorship and the lengths that a future government might go to to restrict the public's ability to access past knowledge. Orwell's 1984 was a slightly better example of this kind of story, but that doesn't take away from the satisfaction of Mr. Bradbury's finely written classic. The book's pace becomes incredibly exciting as Montag learns of his mistakes and decides to go against the common will. The fugitive chase and scholarly transients who keep passages of important texts in their memories(the Bible seems a popular choice of Bradbury)is a near perfect final touch.Go ahead, read this book.

This is definitely one of the more thought provoking books I have ever read in my 13 years on this earth. Considering that it was written nearly 30 years ago, it is quite remarkable in its prophecy. Just look at what's happening in this country today - countless numbers of mindless chatterboxes on every one of our 325 or so cable stations babbling on about Monica Lewinsky or OJ Simpson or George Bush's alleged cocaine use, or some other utterly senseless topic. And just look at all of these old fools in congress and the senate with nothing better to do than talking about Monica Lewinsky and preaching morality to all of us while they're all sleeping around on their own wives. I think the time is already here. There is no desire in this country for any meaningful ruminations of philosophy or history or the meaning of life. We have become that nation of vain, selfish dullards with no other goal in life except to make ourselves happy with our big screen tv sets and our armies of idiot babblers to tell us what to think. Mr. Bradbury, please write another book to help snap us back into real life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is really the only science fiction I've read, other than Tolkein.(Is he considered a science fiction writer?

F451 is a really great book to read, but a fabulous book to discuss. We had some of the richest discussion about human nature and societal pressures during our seminars on this book. I liked this book so much, my essay on it made the exceptional writing board! (which only happens when I really care) Most of the books read at school get a bad rep as overrated classics written just for English geeks who love slowly digesting and turning over every stone in the book, but Bradbury's writing style is so warm annd easy to read, anyone can conquer this classic. Unlike other books of its genre (science fiction) its ideas of science fiction in a somewhat more approachable manner, stuff you could really see happening. Overall, F451 is a great read for anyone with some extra time on their hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ages 14 and up.

Despite being hailed as a book about censorship, I prefer to stress the aspect Ray Bradbury himself prefers: that long before the government mandated the burning of books, people had abandoned them, considering them 'obsolete.' It isn't so much about politics, but about society. I also want to mention that it is not objectionable books being burned, but ALL books, and with it, mental thought processes. People are being reduced to robots, with short attention spans. The essence of life is being sucked out of them, and this is the best theme of the book, in my opinion: the emotional pain and suffering of those who have nothing to cherish in life. The suicides and murders, the agony of the protagonist, Guy Montag, the bursting into tears of a woman . . . it is a much weightier theme than censorship.The book does have its drawbacks- an emotional but often confusing writing style mucks the clarity of the content, and there is an annoying on-purpose disregard of grammar. The character of Faber rubbed me the wrong way, as did the group of hobo learned men in the end, who declare themselves unimportant except as vessels for the books they have memorized. In fact, there is a paragraph in which Montag seems to notice and be conflicted by it- which is COMPLETELY UNRESOLVED! That got to me.Overall, the book is not a literary classic, but it's worth reading for the ideas in it, for the simple pleasure denied Bradbury's characters- to think about it, to talk and discuss. Montag is a sympathetic character, Clarisse is wondrous with her childlike enthusiasm, and Beatty is deliciously evil in that he gets straight to the root of what happened and what he does- and continues. No self-delusion of grandeur.Read it! See what you think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book has it all. Bradbury's fascinating description, a engrossing plot, a skewed but interesting hero, and a cause any reader can get behind. I know there are probably thousands of reviews of this book, but I just had to say it again. If for some strange reason you haven't read it, read it now. You are missing out!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of instant &quot;classics&quot;, this book has stood the the test of time. Let us remember, this book was written in the 1950's, not today. So, yes, the story line might seem a little worn, but that's because it has been repeated, used, and indead, to pardon a pun, worn by humanity for five decades. Like many of Bradbury's works, this stands as a warning of humanity's arrogance, dependance upon technology, and lack of learning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've heard some people say that this book rips off 1984, that is NOT true. It's essentially the converse of 1984. In Orwell's masterpiece (I won't deny either of these books that title) the government has absolute power. 1984 has been called &quot;The end of all Utopias&quot; because the people can't win.In Bradbury's work, however, the government is not all powerful, and still has those who work against it that it foolishly ignores. Furthermore, the war is not to permanently distract the people, it is a real thing to win or lose. The people aren't closely monitored, they can even have ideas so long as they don't have books. In the end this is the beggining of a Utopia, in 451 the government can't win, they will eventually fall and a new age of learning will rise...to fall again, and again, and again, but as Bradbury points out unlike the Phoenix we may eventually learn NOT TO JUMP IN THE FREAKIN' FUNERAL PYRE, OR EVEN TO BUILD IT IN THE FIRST PLACE!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a novel about a futuristic society where censorship reigns supreme and independent thought is deeply scrutinized. This is a world where the televisions talk to you, vehicular manslaughter is an innocent charge as long as you have insurance, and fireman burn books instead of putting fires out. The main character in this novel is a fireman named Guy Montag, a man happy with his job, his wife, his place in society, and life in general. All of this holds true until one fateful evening, after a successful night of setting millions of pages ablaze, Montag runs into a wistful teenager named Clarisse. She is an introverted girl by this future society's standards because she doesn't enjoy playing sports, or driving fast. Her main interests are thinking and talking about what she's thinking--very anti-social to everyone else. Clarisse is the catalyst for Montag's rise from subservient book burner to independent thinking intellectual. Montag begins to take books from the houses he burns and hide them in his air conditioner, promising to read them one day. One night, the firemen come to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection of books. Beatty, the firehouse captain, douses her collection of books with kerosene, but instead of letting that be the end of it, the old woman decides to set herself on fire along with her treasures. Montag becomes very sickened by this event and decides not to be a fireman anymore. This is where one of the most crucial scenes comes into play, Beatty comes to Montag's house to talk him into staying a fireman, using all of his cunning and sly words to tell him how things were, and how they are better now. Montag makes a choice not go with what society wants, and to become a rebel. Montag meets with a professor to learn how to fully understand what he's reading, and they come upon an insidious plan to plant books in fireman's houses and call alarms on them, effectively destroying the idea that books should be burned if the burners themselves want them. Montag decides to go into work one last time, and after they get a call, much to his surprise, they arrive at his house. Montag's own wife Mildred had called in an alarm, and quickly left. Montag kills the other firemen and goes on the run, eventually meeting a gang of old college professors in the woods, and becoming one of them.The character I felt I could most relate to was the main character Guy Montag. Montag was really confused with his life, and how it was turning out, he didn't know if he liked the person he had become. I think I would do the same thing as Montag did if I were in his position. Montag's society reminded me of today's society slightly where censorship is still a problem, but to only a small extent. Also, the only way people in Montag's society could enjoy anything was if it was fast paced and devoid of any need to think, sometimes I feel that holds true with our society as well. Take our sports for example: football, basketball, hockey, all of these are extremely violent and fast.I did not like the book for a few reasons. The first is that I felt the view point of the novel was too extreme, and it lost some of its value because I just could not relate to it as well as the novel wanted me to. Another was the characters, outside of Montag, all the characters are static and flat, not one of them changes. I did enjoy the digressions in the book, the time Bradbury took to stretch his own personal talents with beautiful, and sometimes scary, descriptions of what Montag was thinking. But, I felt that Bradbury was trying to hard to fit into an Ernest Hemingway style of quick thoughts without explanation, giving the reader the opportunity to figure out what is being said like a puzzle. It just didn't do it for me.My recommendation is that people should read this novel because it can give insight to how any society works. But I do not believe it is an important novel because it just did not get its point across well enough. Read this novel if you dislike censorship and wish to see it completely abolished, but this is the only type of reader I feel could totally enjoy this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author of the book Fahrenheit 451 was focused on teaching appreciation of God-given rights to his readers. Ray Bradbury considered a life without reading, without control of one's own thoughts, and without knowing history. He also considered a life where parents don't like the children that they have. Bradbury considered this and thought best to write a book so that people would not take their lives for granted. He considers reading a privilege, while most others would consider it a right, a right that isn't thought of as a right, but just is. Bradbury conveys a horrible story that helps his readers understand what they should value in life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Despite Bradbury's encouragement of going against authority, which could be problematic for already wild high school students, Bradbury also shows readers how society can change and encourages them to fight for what they believe, which are two lessons in life that all high school students could use. I think this is a great book for high school students to read for class for many reasons. First, Bradbury shows that it is okay to fight for what a person believes. I feel this is a great life lesson because if no one fought for what they believed, then everyone would all believe the same. That is good for high school students to realize because most teenagers keep their beliefs to themselves for fear of being bullied or made fun of. Even though fighting for what a person believes can cause that person to go against authority, which should not be encouraged in today's society, the overall result is better than not fighting for their belief. Secondly, Bradbury shows how society is able to change by the using examples of how the society in Fahrenheit 451 has changed and the reactions the people have in the society. That is also a great life lesson for high school students because nowadays students are so focused in on technology and their social life that they do not realize that the world outside them is majorly changing, not always in a good way either. I think that the students that read Fahrenheit 451 will have a positive attitude after reading this book. Mainly because it gives the students a different perspective and point of view of today's world and how they can improve what they think should be improved. Bradbury makes an excellent high school book author because he knows how the teenagers think and so he can help express to them the importance of fighting for what they believe in their own \\"language\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic and predicts many products that we use today such as flat screen tv on the wall, blue tooth, and drones."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a very good science fiction book. it reminds me the important to read books.

Oh, not really because of what happens in the book (which is not a bowl of cherries), but because of how close we are to the society he describes. We've pretty much reached the big media/pervasive television/don't read point that he describes as the precursor to his universe. The only thing left is the actual banning of books. Though horrible for us, Bradbury writes a pretty good story around it. The problem I have with the book is that Bradbury jumps the \\"tell-a-story\\" rails quite a bit and ends up on the \\"classic citations\\" and philosophy tracks too often and for too long. It just gets in the way of what he's saying. Of course, my saying that is one of the slippery slopes he describes (condense books down by removing the thought-producing parts) as leading to his world. But, even so, because of these \\"interruptions\\" to the story, I rate this book at merely an OK 3 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My son needed this book for his summer reading. Because he needs to make notes and create references in the book, this is the perfect solution at a very reasonable price."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can definitely see why this book was written and why people get wrapped up in its moral. However, the delivery needs some work. I find that the entire buildup to the climax was weak and mostly unnecessary. It either needed to be much longer with greater detail, or entirely rewritten. The author, for some reason, enjoys repeating words or sentences to add stress on the situation... which is fine until it is done on practically EVERY page. He also likes lists. It gets to the point to where you can read the first sentence, then skip the entire rest of the paragraph because all it is is the repeating of the same information. The book also has a weak ending. I reference it to the Tortilla Curtain. A wonderful book with a good moral... but the author decides to rape your mind of everything you've been trying to build of what your expecting in the end. It just doesn't make sense. It does, but of all the ways you could have ended it? REALLY?A few other flaws in the book is that there is virtually no background of... the background. Its quite a few pages before you manage to figure out what kind of year theyre in (past or future). And you only do this by them referencing futuristic devices that you're somehow supposed to already know what they do and why they exist. You almost have to accept that you don't know and move on.The book is sometimes compared to 1984... however 1984 does a much better job at a similar, yet different moral of society. 1984 is government focused, 451 is literature focused.I would recommend this book simply because it is a highly referenced book. Not because of his excellent writing style or plot abilities... but because the lesson needs to be learned. I really only started caring during the 2nd half of the last section. The rest... meh. It's almost like taking the highway vs the scenic route. sure you get there... but it's not nearly as exciting. And don't we read books FOR the scenic route?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I finally finished reading Fahrenheit 451 by Bradbury. For such a small book I sure took my time finishing it. I did not enjoy this book. It had its moments, as do all books, but they were minimal. The characters don't develop much, and the ending is a bit extreme. I'm not a fan of long books but this one was just too short for the story to go anywhere. The ending felt rushed and a bit too dramatic for the speed at which it developed. I probably won't read another Bradbury book for a long time. This book was so hyped up, and for me it just didn't deliver."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was exactly as described, the only \\"flaw\\" being that the cover had a clean cut about halfway across the front cover.

However, as a science fiction story, what may have been riveting in the early 1950s seems a bit tame by today's standards. Particularly interesting is Bradbury's vision of the evolution of television, which of course was still in its infancy at the time he wrote the story. The idea of a room in which the visual image surrounds you on all sides sounds a projection screen TV owner's fantasy. Bradbury's vision of a totalitarian society is as scary as anything out of &quot;1984,&quot; but ultimately Bradley was mistaken in believing that television could pacify the masses for totalitarianism. In fact, instant communications has made a totalitarian government, which relies on total control of information, less likely. The book is brief, checking in at a quickly read 160 pages. And this edition features a couple of scenes Bradbury wrote later on that were not featured in the original novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The Firemen of tomorrow do not put out fires anymore..... they START them.

In the first half of the book the main character Montag a firefighter trys to discover himself. After all a firefighter starts fires in this story, and that might get to a person after a while. He wants to know why firefighters are supposed to burn books and why books are so bad.In the second half of the book Montag starts to use his head and stop letting everyone else control him. He becomes a fugitive and this is where the action begins. He ends up being chased by mechanical dog's and hellicopters and gets in fights with flamethrowers. I think that sais it all for the second half of the story. The soft Sci-Fi novel was very interesting and gets you thinking.

This book by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is eye catching. It's an easy read and won't take you a long time to read it. Bradbury's writing style is very compelling in nature. He depicts a futuristic society where the government controls everything. In this book he tells the story of a man (Guy Montag) that works for the government. He is a fireman who gets paid not to put fires out but to start them. In the society that Bradbury builds, the job of a fireman is to burn all books. The government feels that books make people anti-social and is the reason why there are so many problems with people in their world. Guy Montag upon many events in the book starts to struggle with his on self. He starts to find a new found love for books in which he is intrigued by. He struggles with this throughout the book. He is disregarded by his comrads and they are displeased with his change in attitude. Throughout the book the heat gets intense as Guy struggles with his own feelings. The government is on the look for him and out for his arrest. Will he survive? or Will he fall under the governmental society? Hope you read it and find out. This is a great read an will give you a deeper feeling of what to think about in the future. This book will give you an greater insight on what may and could happen in the future. So if you like intense heat give Fahrenheit 451 a try and see if you can stand the heat.Happy Reading"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I found this book to be an extremely eye-opening work of art.

Since I was assigned this book to read, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book were I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for mindless entertainment you might find Farenheit 451 a difficult or boring read, but if you are seeking a book that will make you think, or stimulate your own philosophical ponderings, then you are right on target.Like Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury expresses his concerns regarding the human condition through the dialouges of his characters. The language might seems a bit dry, but one must consider the time and environment in which it was written.This book is truely a classic, so grow yourself and those around you; Read this book and then share it with someone willing to discuss it with you. Or you can just watch TV!;)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A truly excellent book that spans the generations since it's 1953 debut. This book is along the same lines as Brave New World and 1984 in the sense that it creates a futuristic society (not unlike our own in many ways) in which control has shifted toward an entity other than the will of the people. A certain amount of propaganda and coersion, mainly propogated through television, has transformed the populace into a sick and backwards culture without substance. All the wonderful knowledge found in literature has been abandoned, and burned, while the people have become so unaware that they don't even know that the ashes they are choking on are the ashes of books that used to live on their shelves. Essentially, the ashes of value, and morality. One of the things I liked best about the book was that it highlights the control people have over their life in reguards to books. You always have the power of choice, whether it be in the subject matter of what you read, or the choice of chosing not to read at all. You can put down a book whenever you wish, but in contrast, the television has control over what you see, and what your exposed to. So, kill your TV, and read this book. It is a great story reminiscent of some of our past, and possibly of things to come.

Beforehand i had never read Bradbury, or had been interested in him at all. The book changed everything for me. This insane landscape of mindlessness and of throwing away free thought enchanted me mentally and i was hooked. Mr. Bradbury is one of the greatest liberal thinkers in the world. Reading 451 can break the silly chains of political bias, and start you thinking for a change about how much freedom you need and how much you should use it. The ignorance and greed in us today echoes the insane eletric city of the firemen, and we mustnt shut our minds off to the world of literature and creativity if we ever wish to truly think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. It is about a futuristic world that we all fear. This is a where freedom of speech and thought are completely taken away.

Later in the story they talk about Guy Montag meeting this girl named Clarisse. They engage in deep conversation and he soon learn to like the small things in life. After he met her he realizes how dull and boring his family really is. In the end of the story he escapes from the city after killing the fire-cheif and taking a couple of books with him. Guy Montag has the ability to like his job without knowing what he is actually doing to the society. He went to work and liked to watch the book get consumed by the flames.

Real Science-Fiction plays not only in the future but in a society very different from ours and with people who have habits and a mentality which also are different from ours. Fahrenheit 451 is a very good example of that. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature that makes books burn and this is the problem we are dealing with (and no longer in the far future I'm afraid). Guy Montag is the hero of the novel. He's a fireman who burns books that are in people's houses, usually because someone denounced them at the police. It's forbidden to read books because they make you think and therefore make you unhappy. (Clothes have only zippers and no buttons; buttons take to much time so you start thinking and once again this makes you unhappy.) But Montag is a lonely person who has no contact with his wife; she only watches TV from dawn till dusk. The irony is that all the measures, which are taken by the government to protect people from being unhappy only, make them more unhappy than before. As the story unfolds, Guy Montag starts wondering what books are all about and he starts meeting people who read books (without notifying his superiors). The novel ends in a peculiar way.I said in the beginning that the problem is maybe no longer in the far future: a psychologist I know once said that all books ought to have a happy ending. I never asked her what would become of the books that don't have a happy ending because I'm afraid what she might answer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I hate reading by hits book was really interesting and kept me wanting to read more.

In this world, instead of putting out fires and keeping people safe, firefighters burn entire houses containing books, and occasionally even people. One of these firefighters, Guy Montag, has doubts about the whole situation, and those doubts are strengthened when he meets a freethinking girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan. The major themes in this book include the value of intelligence and human interaction. I would suggest everyone read this book at least once, to help understand why it is important to attain knowledge and break free from ignorance.

The lasting power of his short novelis shown in how long it's lived, being published now for 60+ years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Whenever I first read this book it scared me because of the realism and how relevant it was to how American society is and where it is going. Even though I was much younger than I am now when I finished it (I'm 20), I was still able to realize that the future Ray Bradbury portrays in this wonderful work of fiction is entirely possible. I absolutely love to read, a bibliophile if you will, and when I first realized that the world in this book takes pride in BURNING them AND the people who read them I remember thinking, \\"God help us\\". What made me say that is the realization that many of my fellow class mates all throughout school (K-12) did NOT like to read one bit but they did like to burn and destroy things. Society, in the story, values everything that destroys knowledge and wisdom so that those in charge are able to stay in power and keep everyone under there thumb. Turning people into mindless sheep. Many of the technological \\"advances\\" (I consider them more of a step back then a step forward) include only a few hours of school with nothing actually learned, destruction parks where people can go smash and destroy everything there, insanely fast cars, and (in my opinion the worst one) the ENTIRE room dedicated to television. This book is an extremely accurate portrayal of where American society is headed if we do not do something to stop this trend. We must value knowledge and wisdom above all else because those two things are what primarily separate us from all other animals. I absolutely loved this book and author and I hope you will pick this up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reached in time for my daughter's school . My daughter enjoy it. It was for her course material so not much can be said."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This gripping dystopian classic hooks you from the start and thrills as the narrative moves eerily forward. Bradbury's ephemeral writing style may not be instantly accessible to some, but readers can lessen the distance they might feel between the Fahrenheit 451 world and characters by simply diving into the text and enjoying the surreal ride while not getting caught up in specific verbiage. Censorship remains a relevant topic and all those interested in science fiction and socio-political trends will find this tale fascinating."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has been a classic all my adult life, and, given its topic, I'm somewhat embarrassed that I haven't read it before. While I knew the story, I wanted to see how the metaphor was developed and I was also curious about how this 1953 work held up.The message holds up. There are still censors (TX will not teach higher order thinking skills) and proverbial book burners. Bradbury showed that people, by general disinterest can abet censorship. Not all the police state defenders are \\"sold\\". Citizens find it in their interest to speak out about how books can make you unhappy, cause divisiveness, etc. Beatty, a leader of the censorship fire troops, spouts classical literature and poetry in much the way today's family values politicians exhibit their cognitive dissonance.The text is wordy. The \\"50th Anniversary\\" paperback edition has an interview with Bradbury at the end. He said this was originally a 25,000 word story that he later doubled in size for a novel. The stretching clearly shows.After 58 years, while the theme holds up reasonably well, but the particulars are dated and may be more so as years go on. The main characters are all white men. The two main females are stereotypes: the bored housewife and the ingenue. Many cigarettes are lit. Many Millennials would probably not recognize Beatty's literary references and the literature noted as being preserved is probably not what would be the choices of today.Some of Bradbury's future has arrived. The wall has come to us as Skype, with real people. The Hound is the drone. The seashell phone is now the cell phone. The TV style viewer is the I-Pad. It seems the Freedom to Read issues are settled (but the access issues are not).Bradbury gets 5 stars for the metaphor, but, unfortunately, its development suffers by padding a short story into a novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is part of the troika of great dystopian novels of the 20th century, along with \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World.\\" What makes this book even more disturbing is the seemingly voluntary oppression of ignorance of a fun-seeking society turning fascist from within. Ray Bradbury considered this his only work of science-fiction, where he defines the genre as something that would at some point become possible. Contrary to expectations of self-preventing prophecies, these books are at least as relevant today as they were 50 years ago. We are faced with questions of personal freedom where it interferes with national security. Social media changed and continue to change our private life in a way that lets a handful of companies monitor our every move already. We can find almost any information on the internet which may just cover up the relevant and confirmed facts in favor of those that are spread the fastest - we're happy as long as we are entertained (whatever that means).This book is a great piece of literature that will keep you thinking for a long time after putting it down. There is an afterword and a coda to the story which reveals a little more of Ray Bradbury's own thoughts. For me, this was probably the most controversial part where I was missing a clear distinction between censorship and an editing process. I don't think that minorities threaten the liberty of arts - nor should they - when it comes to civil rights and equality."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Despite not being that familiar with Sci-Fi literature, I am learning to love it. In this book, Bradbury creates a powerful, disturbing imagery to ilustrate his distopia, which has bone-chilling similarities with our days. A must-read, even for those who are not Sci-Fi lovers. Why didn't I five-stared? Well, I didn't like the style so much, it could be more concise. Someone said that writing is the art of eliminating words, rather than adding them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Great book that may be more relevant today than when the author wrote it.

I highly recommend this book to every single person who is able to read honestly."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently decided to go back and read some of the books that I was forced to read back in high school. I was not the avid reader back then that I am today (sixteen years later) so I wanted to compare what I thought of them then to now. I decided to start with Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 because it's a relatively short read and because I remembered it being one of the books that I actually enjoyed in high school.I thought I remembered the book being a warning about government power and censorship and while those are certainly addressed at some level in the book, after reading it again now I realize that this book is equally about the dangers of mindless entertainment and about allowing ourselves to forget what it's like to think for ourselves. I couldn't help but laugh as I read the interactions between Montag and his wife. While she's hopelessly lost in her shows, I kept picturing her watching \\"Teen Mom\\" and \\"The Kardashians\\".There were some exchanges that got to be a little difficult to get through while Guy argued with himself. The dialogue got choppy and hard to follow. Aside from that, the book stands up remarkably well even after six or seven decades. The last few pages of dialogue between Montag and Granger are both meaningful and beautifully written. I hope this book continues to be required reading for kids in school. It's teaches a valuable lesson....one that we need to be reminded of. Kudos to Mr. Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Item was exactly as described and was shipped very quickly.

I think that it is like the book Z for Zachariah in the fact that they are both in the future. Also the people in the books are, at first, leading boring, uneventful lives. Then suddenly their lives change drastically. They are also alike in the fact that the main character in each book makes a dangerous escape. They are dislike because Montag's life changes mostly because of outside influence that he could have stopped.

The plot behind the book is very simple to me but the hole basic story is kinda wierd, maybe because its written in such a theretical that sometimes I just get lost. Anyway the story is about a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books in the future. throuhout the story he is incounterd with a little girl who challenges him to free himself and to feel his emotions and to do what he feels is right but he is also incounterd by his commanding officer that believes burning books and killing the people who have them is the right thing to do in the society that they live in today. Although Montag follows the wishes of his commanding officer he decides to do away with being a fireman and to do what is right and educate his society on books but his wife Mildred turns Montag in because she is scared of what the fireman will do to her if she is caught with the books in her house. After Montags house is burnt to the ground he decides to run and hide from the police until he meets up with the book people. When he meets up with the book people he tells them that he used to be a fireman and that he has changed and now the police and the fireman are after him.

Some people have said that this book is written for high school students, but I really don't think that it is. I'm a freshman in high school and I really did not understand what was going on. I figured it out enough to kind of follow the story, but definitely not enough to actually get into the book. This is one of only about 3 books that I have ever read that I did not perfectly understand and enjoy. The basic idea of the plot is that Guy Montag, a fireman in the future, is paid to burn down houses that illegally store books in them. He meets some other characters (such as Clarisse, a 17 year old who lives in his neighborhood) who help him open his eyes to the world that he is being so blind to. If you enjoy reading about censorship or science fiction, this book might be okay for you. If you like stories that are pretty easy to follow and have a more realistic plot, don't bother. -- luckiestarre"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of the worst I have read!!

I'm just not into it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This small book starts off nicely with a \\"Fireman\\" name Montag walking down the street. This takes place in the future where books are banned, and fireman set fires to houses with books. It's a world where the government controls everything, and people are content watching television. As Montag walks he encounters a strange girl. A inquisitive teenager who tends to slowly open Montag's eyes to the life that himself and the government has tried to prevent him from seeing.However, the book goes downhill from there. We later learn that the girl died, maybe or maybe not by the government. Then all forms of subtlety are thrown out the window. Montag burns a lady and her house down, but only after picking up a few books. He starts a conversation with a former literature professor, who discusses how the government and people disengaged themselves from the world of literature, and how to change their thinking. The worst part was when his fire chief enters his house and gives the typical bad guy expose to the good guy on what the government is trying to do. This dialogue is extremely forced and contrived and quickly bores the reader along while taking away much of the imagination of the what and why.He later kills that fireman and goes on the run after his house burns down, only to be left in a the countryside as a survivor, and tries to resurrect the world of books and open thinking. This again overtly ties into an over the top message on the good of literature and open-mindedness.For those who value subtlety and imagination, this book is not for you. While I respect and admire Bradbury's plot and perspective, it could have been done in a much more presentable, believable, thought provoking, and by far more engaging way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read the book Fahrenheit 451 for English class and was not impressed with the way the story was written. In general, the book is about censorship. It is the story of a society where books are outlawed because the lead to conflicting points of view, offend minorities, and cause confusion. Firefighters have the job of finding 'criminals' who are hiding books in thier homes and burn the books.I found this book to be boring and unexciting. There was very little description and this led me to be confused about several parts of the book. A few of the repeated aspects of the story were never fully described which led me to be unsure of what exactly they were. For example, the seashell radio that Montag's wife Mildred uses. A little more description would have made me understand more clearly, what it did and said. I was also confused about what the 'family' was that Mildred and her friends were constantly watching on the wall. These details of the story made me lose interest in the book. I also think that the reason for banning books was not made extremely clear. More solid reasons should have been given, other than the vague explanations.Another fact that I found annoying was that houses were fireproofed in this society. That is why firemen as we know them were not needed any longer. Therefore, it seems to me that the firemen in the book should not have been able to burn the houses of the people hiding books.The most exciting and best part of the book came at the end when Montag had escaped from his old world and was living with intellectuals away from civilization. Montag and his new friends survive an attack during a war and set out to rebuild the world. Although this book ended better than it began, I do not recommend it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is very dissapointing, cause after all i heard about the book i thought it suppose to be a masterpiece, but after reading it i discoverd that the writing is very poor, the story is bery weak, and the plot is dull.i think the book lost most of it's taste - a similat book like 1984 is more prefferd to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel 'Fahrenheit 451\` written by Ray Bradbury and published in 1953 takes place in a futuristic dystopian society. The totalitarian state forbids books and most of the people don't question it or offer no resistance. Guy Montag, the main character of the novel, is one of the firemen, who have the assignment to burn books. Until he witnesses, that an old woman wants to die with her books, Guy Montag doesn't question any orders and even likes his job, but after that experience he begins to think about the meaning and power of literature/books and history.The novel 'Fahrenheit 451\` shows, what kind of terrible things censorship can do to a society and the importance of free speech. We need to think for ourselves and never accept everything. The author maybe wanted to express a warning through this novel about a society we might have to live in some day. I think this novel is suitable for school reading, because it includes important topics which can be discussed well in class with a teacher, although I didn't really enjoy reading it. It's not a book I would like to read in my freetime, but in class there might be interesting topics to think and discuss about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has set forth some interesting ideas and prophecies in this book but as far as entertaining and suspensful goes I would give it about an &quot;F&quot; grade. It squeeks two stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have infinite patience when I am personally pretentious, self-absorbed, and dull. I don't have the same patience when I read books that are that way, though.The story is about a futuristic world where knowledge, thought, and argument have been banished in favor of momentary happiness, thrill, and pleasure. The protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman. In the future, instead of fighting fires, they are in charge of lighting them. They are the front line defense for society against the societal decay caused by books, so their job is to go around burning down the houses of those who own and read books. Montag, at some point, realizes the importance of books and instantly becomes an enemy of the state, a target of the same department that he worked for.One problem with this book is in the fact that Bradbury can't create a realistic world in which these events could become a reality. Granted, he was writing 50 years ago, so he wouldn't have had knowledge of the type of entertainment which exists today, but all he seems able to conjure up is the concept of immediate, personalized entertainment as if that is the only type of entertainment that would remain. He creates a world (or just a city, because this type of environment only seems to exist in the city) where people are zombies sitting in their homes surrounded by television screens that are running all the time telling the people what they should think and feel. Conceptually he wasn't wrong, it's just his clumsy handling of the telling. He can't create a solid series of steps that lead from the present day to that future (though he tries). He can't recreate the sort of television show that these people would watch, and he can't explain clearly why anyone would want to watch it.Beyond the setting, the characters themselves are one-dimensional. They are all archetypes, and none have the spark of life which would make them interesting. Clarisse, the dangerous intellectual adolescent; Montag, the newborn Man whose eyes have recently been open; Faber, the reluctant wise man; Beatty, the hardened symbol of the State, who is a very capable parry to the thrusts of Faber; none of the characters have any depth whatsoever.The writing itself was a pain to read. Bradbury can't seem to figure out which word he needs to use, so he opens a thesaurus and dumps as many words as he can onto the page. In addition, he wanders off on tangents without bringing those tangents back to the main storyline. Furthermore, his dire need to make his point (a panoply of ideas is good, not bad) by either having the characters themselves soliloquize it, or by doing it himself in wandering, dull monologues. This is the sort of self-absorption I allude to in the title to this review.To drive home the fact that Bradbury thinks he's God's gift to knowledge, the afterword and coda and interview with the author leave nothing to the imagination. According to Bradbury himself, he's got tons of ideas of how to make the story better. None of those ideas have to do with improving the writing, just making each character's monologue longer. He claims to refrain from adding those updates to this edition of the book (50th anniversary edition) because he feels the original text, as the author wrote it, is pristine and perfect. His contempt for editors is plainly spelled out at various places in the tacked-on content.I really can't recommend this book to anyone who has already graduated from high school. The story is poor. The writing is poor. The author's point is all it's got of value, and even that is nothing special. It may be helpful to know the character of Guy Montag in case it ever comes up in conversation, but other than that, I can't think of any reason to spend time with this book. 2 stars"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school.

I only like to read the trash, or the entertainment when i know its trash or entertainment. I found the characters in the book shallow (Like Clarisse) and under developed. It was too bland and meaningless for what people make of it. And the phoenix metaphor at the end? That was a chiche. I wouldn't say this is a bad book, i mean its fairly well written, but i found 1984, which had a similar cautionary note to it and was also a Dystopian novel much more meaningful."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can see why so many people like the works of Ray Bradbury. He is a very effective story teller, he has a particular talent for building vivid imagery with few words (his \\"less is more\\" style is DEFINITELY a winner) and he is able to take very important, very relevent modern themes and inject them into his stories. In this story, we see how Bradbury has taken aim at the world of electronic media as an advancement that very well may, over time, become the downfall of mankind.So why did I only give him three stars? Two reasons: (1) While Bradbury is long on imagery, in this book he's short on character development. It works well with the protagonist's wife because Bradbury created her to be shallow and indifferent, but what about the young neighbor girl who was so intriguing and just disappeared one day, with no explanation at all? As for the protagonist and his \\"boss,\\" their characters weren't developed to the point where I cared for them either way. In order for a novel-length story to be a good one, you have to have at least one character that you identify with or get emotionally attached to, and that doesn't happen here. (2) As in \\"The Martian Chronicles,\\" Bradbury puts his dystopian society to an end by dropping the big bomb on it, leaving the small band of survivors to go on to -- what? Sorry; end of story. Makes me wonder if Patricia Cornwall was schooled in the not-so-fine art of ending books by Bradbury..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazing.

This story takes place in the United States in the distant future on the brink of another war. The main character of this story is named Guy Montag. Montag is a third generation fireman, which means that instead of trying to put out fires, his job is to start them. Books have been outlawed and anyone in possession of one can be punished by law. The fireman's job is to go around and respond to calls about reported book sightings and burn them. Due to the lack of books, the entire nation has turned completely to television and radio. Montag had been completely happy with his life until he met Clarisse McClellan, a peculiar seven-teen year old girl. Clarisse opens Montag eyes to the beauty of the simple things in life such as nature. Clarisse asked Montag the question, \\"are you happy?\\" This caused Montag to realize that he was not at all happy or satisfied with his life. Clarisse was killed by a speeding car soon after. Montag's problems increase when his wife, Mildred Montag, attempts to kill herself with sleeping pills, and when Montag was attempting to persuade an old lady to leave the house that they were going to burn, the lady started herself on fire and burned alive. Montag begins to try and turn to books for answers, but is unable to make sense of them. For this reason he turns to Faber, an English professor who, Mildred knows, has a strong passion for his books. Mildred decides to plant books in the houses of fellow firemen so to discredit the reputation of the profession. Later at work Mildred receives a call, which is made from his house. His wife had betrayed him and his boss, Captain Beatty, forced him to burn down his house. After he did this, Mildred was going to be arrested, so instead of going quietly he turned on his boss with his flamethrower and burnt him alive. After knocking out the rest of the police force that was present and destroying the mechanical hound Mildred had to run. Faber told him how to evade the new mechanical hound and that he should follow the railroad tracks until he finds the hobo intellectuals. Mildred successfully reaches the intellectuals and meets their leader Granger. Granger explains that the intellectuals are a group of book lovers that are all over the country and they hope to help mankind with their knowledge in the aftermath of the war. Shortly after enemy fighters flew in and dropped their bombs and nearly incinerated the entire city. One particular thing that I appreciated was the comment that Granger made about human kind where he compares human kind to a phoenix, and says that they keep rising up from their own ashes. Overall, I felt that this was a fairly good book. It definitely has some action pact scenes, but what I also enjoyed was that the whole idea that TV, radio, computers, and other forms of media are in a way taking control of our lives. This argument can be made now days, even though not to that extreme. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who has an interest in science fiction books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are a high-school student, this would be a stunner, but to anyone with a little more life experience and a shred of political awareness, the book comes across as dated, patronizing and condescending."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read but deadly to listen to on the CD.

From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is pretty good, except it is definitely very advanced.

His job is to destroy books, but he soon realizes that there is more to the world than what is told to him. With the help of some very interesting supporting characters Montag's life is drastically changed. This is a really quick read under 200 pages. It was definantly thought provoking and the whole message fits in any time period."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first read this book, I was so incredibly lost. It was the first Bradbury book I'd ever read, and I guess I just wasn't used to his style. There were so many times I would have to reread 5 or 6 pages 3 or 4 times because I was so confused about what was going on. The characters were strange, and I couldn't ever tell what side they were on;it was really unpredictable. It's one of those books where you need to sit down and read it in a quiet atmosphere and focus on Bradbury's symbolism all throughout the book. If you miss the symbolism, you won't get much out of the book. I think it's hard for people under 13 to really understand some of the symbolism that's in the book, so there's really no purpose in them reading the book, since they won't understand it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an excellent book dealing with the ever prominent debate of censorship. Fahrenheit 451 is extremely well-written and organized and in an age where outrage is frowned upon very, very timely.

Thumbs up to Mr. Bradbury!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Did anyone see the Washington Post article a few days ago about more and more people choosing not to read books anymore for pleasure? It's frightening: in Bradbury's novel, this situation was the precursor to the banning of books!I was so moved at the end of the book that I was overwhelmed with tears. What an astounding book! I'm so embarrassed that I never read this important book before now.To all of the reviewers out there decrying it as too hard to read: Yes, the language is a little difficult to get through and interpret at times, but isn't that what reading is all about? Part of the joy and challenge of reading is figuring out what the author is trying to say. It's not supposed to be easy!

I mean the guy is GOOD!! He's got the smarts, he's got the talent and he proves it with every single novel he has published. But I'm not the only one holding such an opinion, after all Disney studios could have had any of ther scripting staff do a screenplay of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; but nooo. They had the smarts (a very rare and scarce thing in Hollywood) to ask Mr.Bradbury himself to write a screenplay of his own work. According to my memory Mr.Bradbury in a TV plug said that &quot;about 80% of what went onscreen&quot; was his work. Now there's writing that commands respect, and rightly so, when such little cinematic licence as only 20% is taken in filming a given screenplay. Makes a person curious as to how much of Stephen King's own efforts went into, say, &quot;Creepshow&quot; or &quot;Silver Bullet&quot;. I tell ya people Mr.Bradbury has got what it takes!! Go out, read his stuff for yourselves and see if I'm wrong! I mean hey, you all got minds of your own, whatta ya need me telling you what's worth reading for? Read the book(s) see for yourselves and decide, go ahead! Put me and all the other critics and reviewers on unemployment!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Although the author of this book, Ray Bradbury, is mainly known as a science fiction author, this book has become popular and infulential enough that it has had the fortune (or misfortune, depending on your politics) a standard book on English-lit courses. Thus, it is a widely read novel. That fact taken in stride, it's sad that it's message hasn't been more widely transmitted. Fahrenheit 451 depicts a future (definitely a not-too-distant one) in which books are illegal and society is forced to take everything as it is, without questioning &quot;why?&quot; The ironic thing about this is that in subsequent printings, this book has been edited, changed around-.... Parts were taken out of it frequently, and it frequently shows up on banned book lists. What does this say about our society? Nothing too great, I'm afraid. Pull yourself away from the meaningless masses, read this book, take it's message to heart, and try to prevent the future depicted in this book from ever coming into fruitition, and maybe we can take a detour from this headlong-forward trainwreck our society is currently apathetically riding on. As Bradbury himself has said, &quot;I'm not interested in predicting the future, I'm interested in PREVENTING it.&quot; Let's help him."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a very interesting book. This book touches on the subject of censorship, and the damages that censorship can have in our society. While some forms of censorship are good such as keeping kids out of movies that they shouldn't be seeing, there is another side to it. Censorship, as shown by Bradbury can be a very damaging thing.In this book, fireman were required to start fires, not put them out. They started Fires by finding people who owned books, and then burning their houses down with the books inside of them. In our society today this would seem a proposterous idea, but somewhere down the line, who knows, anything is possible.The story line in this book is very interesting as well. It is fast reading, easy to understand, and has a great story with believable characters in it as well. I fully enjoyed this book, I actually read it from cover to cover without putting it down because I continually wanted to know what was going to happen to the main character. My advise to those who are interested in this book is to definitely buy it, you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read a series of letters-to-the-editor in my local newspaper from a group of middle schoolers who had just read Fahrenheit 451. 8 out of 10 didn't like the book because it &quot;encouraged burning books.&quot; Ahem, did they ACTUALLY read the book or just the back cover? Also many of them were pro-cencorship....I don't know what it is about that class, but I also read this in 8th grade (I am a senior in h.s. now) and I loved it. No one that age should have trouble grasping that the book is ANTI-censorship. Bradbury's style is a little hard to follow at first, but I quickly got used to it and found it fascinating. It is still one of my favorite books, and it gets better every time that I read it (probably because I get older). This is definitely five stars!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction. Technology is not important in the great scheme of things. Human interaction, knowledge, beauty, these are what life is all about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through all of the metaphors, complication, and similies, Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book to read. Ray Bradbury made this book very interesting especially with his similies and metaphors. In order to get anything out of this book you really had to read closely to enderstand what Bradbury was trying to communicate to the reader. Also, the reader had to use their common sence to understand the story, because it is very different from our world today. The scary part of the story, was how it was written fifty years ago, but the reader can see how the society of today is becoming more and more like the book.Amagine a world were reading certain books ment that you were breaking the law, with possible punishment of death. This was the world Guy Montag lives in. He was a fireman that started fires. In the story's day and age this was a common job. Houses that contained books were houses that needed to be burnt down. Montage enjoyed his job because he did what he was told, and never thought outside of the box. Until he met a girl named Clarisse who made him think outside of the box with three words she asked Montag,&quot;Are you happy?&quot; To learn more about what happens to Montag, you will have to read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book when I was a junior in high school, and I immediately loved it. Five years later, I decided to read it again, just to keep my memory refreshed.Wow, had I forgotten a lot. I mentioned I thought it was great the first time; the second, it was even better. It is easy reading, so I managed to get through it within a couple of days, and would've been able to read it in its entirety if I had had a whole Saturday to myself. As other books that I would group into this general genre (such as &quot;1984&quot; and &quot;On the Beach&quot;), it projects a frightening future in which firemen don't put fires out, they start them--in the homes of people who are reported to possess books. As a raging bibliophile, this is one of the most frightening scenarios I can imagine.Ray Bradbury is a masterful writer who commands your attention like few I have read before. He succinctly depicts the struggle of Guy Montag, the main character and a fireman, as he slowly begins to realize that perhaps his job is not as spectacular and wonderful as it once was. He lives in a climate of violence, where people driving run over pedestrians for sport, and wars come and go as frequently as the change in tides. And, most of all, it is a world where books are viewed as a waste of time, considering TV shows have been condensed to five minutes long and billboards are two hundred feet long so that drivers may see them as they drive by at breakneck speeds. Bradbury paints quite a grim picture of the future, along with his contemporaries, Nevil Shute and George Orwell, that seems frighteningly near. Haven't we heard the news stories about how the younger generation doesn't read? And Montag's wife, Mildred, interacts with her &quot;family&quot; on wall-sized TVs in the parlor...an interactive &quot;reality&quot; show that seems like it may be drawing closer by the second with the advent of all the reality shows in the past year. Rather than having her own life, Mildred seems to live her life in conjunction with these characters on the screens.Bradbury gives us an ominous warning about what may be in the future. We should definitely all pay close attention.This book is more pertinent than ever, and I hope they're continuing to teach it in the schools. It is important that we read these books, so that when things begin looking eerily familiar, we can stop it before it gets to this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The premises of Fahrenheit 451 are promising: the ever looming &quot;this-could-happen&quot; is enacted out in the form of Guy Montag and his little world where people desire only 4 screen televisions in their parlour, where advertising reigns supreme, etc. A vast majority of books are illegal because they inspire conflict (the Koran and the Bible, Wealth of Nations and The Communist Manifesto) with conflicting ideas. Who would want that? The human race might actually get somewhere.It's a fantastic concept, and should lead to a great book. However, I've read this three times and each time I get the same general feeling: this could have been so much better. So, read it, just for the sake of reading it, but don't expect a huge masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is by far one of my favorite books ever, along with Lord of the Flies. It starts out where Guy Montag is a happy, yet braindead fireman who seems to love his job. Which is burning houses that contain any books. Set in the future, everything seems backwards. Television seems to run their lives. No one reads. People on the street drive more than eighty miles an hour, which causes them to knock people over. And no one seems to care when someone dies. They just drive around knocking people over. Montag's wife Mildred (if memory serves) is just as braindead and likes to watch &quot;the family&quot; and that terrible clown show where the clown gets run over by a train in the walls, which are like giant TV screens that completely surroud her and engulf her. But Montag meets a girl who shows him the beauty of life outside their brainless conformaties. She tells him that, long ago, firemen put fires out, not started them. And he starts to wonder why there are no more porches or decks for people to sit on and talk. He wonders why there are people who love books so much that they would be willing to be burnt with their books. And he wonders what is really in the books.... So while he is reading (illegally) Mildred and her friends are sitting around watching the walls and talking about how many abortions or husbands they've had like it's nothing at all. Montag tries to get Mildred to read with him, but she thinks it's wrong and leaves. All the while, Captain Beatty, a chief at the fire station where Montag works is suspicious of Montag owning books, but he can't prove anything. Until the night Mildred leaves Montag and pulls the alarm that let's the firemen know someone has books in their house. Montag is shocked to have to burn his own house to the ground. He kills Beatty and the other two firemen with the flamethrower and runs away. The police are pursuing him but he eventually gets away, with the help of an old man who used to be a professor. In the end the city blows up. It is kind of a representation of the terrible lives the people there were living and how our society could someday end up like their's. It is a really beautiful book, science fiction at it's finest. Ray Bradbury did an amazing job with this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading over the other reviews, they basically sum up how fantastic this book is. I just wanted to add that when I read this book in my seventh grade English class, although it used a huge amount of symbolism and metaphors that would normally be hard for a younger people to understand, the majority of my reading group was able to decipher the book and take a great deal out of reading it. We worked together to figure out a few very difficult things but in general this book was not impossible for a young person. So, to anyone that wants to enrich themselves and really take a deeper look at the horrors of instant gratification, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first heard of the basic plot in which Firemen burn books rather than putting out fires I was a little skeptical. I was most definitely mistaken. This prophetic short story was engrossing. There is nothing I can say which hasn't been said before. Yes the underlying themes aren't so underlying but they are multilayered and provide a buffet of ideas to feast upon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age where most authors write tomes of 400+ pages, this classic by Bradbury says more about humanity, freedom, and the risk of opression from the state (and society) than just about any other book ever written. For anyone who loves books, this is a must-read. Even if you don't consider yourself a &quot;science fiction&quot; fan, this book is an essential - like _Brave New World_, _1984_ etc that should be read by any biliophile. And the story is exciting and entertaining enough that it more than earns its place among the truly classic literature of any time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's a really amazing story of how the world could be one day if we are all corrupted by the government"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fireman Guy Montag is happy with his work--burning books--until he runs into a teenaged neighbor who really talks to him, questions him, and starts his mind working in directions that don't feel comfortable and that lead him to question his entire existance. In Ray Bradbury's futuristic dystopia, books are illegal and wall-sized television sets, constantly babeling and even allowing user interactivity, rule the world. But, as we learn from the story, this isn't the result of harsh government sanctions, but of popular consensus only supported by the government when books were already almost extinct.Author Ray Bradbury is a powerful and effective writer. His use of the language adds color to a straightforward, if fascinating plot about a man's struggle to come to terms with himself in a world where comfort and 'happiness' are deemed more important than questioning and thought. Like George Orwell's 1984, FAHRENHEIT 451 survives because of its eternal message, its strong writing, and its insights into the future--a future that Bradbury might recognize as something similar to our own present. In an era where book reading declines each year, and where a greater and greater percentage of those books sold are best-sellers by a few favorite writers, Bradbury's message is certainly worth another look.Two characters make this novel--Guy Montag, with his doubts but also his hopes for the future, and fire chief Captain Beatty. Beatty knows the truth, knows more about books than Montag or even most intellectuals, and is willing to argue against them--but does so using arguments from the books themselves. Beatty's arguments are subtle and definitely worth stopping and thinking about--only if we are willing to pay Beatty's price can intellectual freedom survive and Beatty is right--few are really willing to pay.Although most reviewers focus on the book burning and anti-intellectualism that Bradbury describes in FAHRENHEIT 451, there is also a strong anti-war message that runs through this novel and much of Bradbury's early work. As in our own era, wars are expected to be easy and cheap, at least for the Americans. Bradbury argues that expectations don't always make the truth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've been re-reading some sci-fi books of my youth. I am somewhat amazed at how prophetic some of those books were. This book, written now almost 50 years ago, is a sociological treatise of things to come; and unfortunately - it has come to fruition. I am equally amazed how accurate Bradbury's predictions were. How did he know? What insights did he have? Is he truly a seer? Was this written as a fanciful warning, or of what our society WOULD be? The televised helicopter chase scenes; being more familiar and comfortable with our television families - than our own flesh and bloods. A society composed of Mildreds. No critical thinking - just having FUN. Don't disturb us with thoughts and ideas. We're happy, and we intend to stay that way - at the expense of all else. The banning and the burning of books. The revising and shredding of ideas being performed not by the government -- but by pressures from the minorities, the majorities, the intellectuals, special interest freaks, 2nd rate entertainers. Political Correctness. This book should be required reading for all young people. If you find this book DISTURBING -- then you are already a Mildred. You have lost.

Anyway, i was amazed that they had cliff's notes for it, until i read some of these reviews...its sad really.If you go into every book thinking that you are being FORCED to read it and FORCED to think about it, you won't like it.

Throughout the book, Bradbury says that books are made for people to think and without this ability to think, people are a mass of &quot;happy&quot; that care nothing of responsibility or consequence.This novel had a profound effect on me, even if I am only 16. I do not want to criticize, but there is some ignorance in the other reviews. People want this book to be exciting, like a TV show. Montag seems to prophisize this in his book. He says people like to be led and not think by a TV, rather than lead and think by a book. I guess it is sad that people think this. Montag's prophicy of a psuedo-happy world may realize. It seems to be leaning that way.If you think while you read, this book is excellent. It is a theme book, not plot. I enjoyed it greatly and it has given me a new outlook on life (as a book should).

Its protagonist, Guy Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books, but one night on the job he has a change of heart. He realizes how wrong it is to limit people's minds, and in this moment Bradbury makes the reader reflect about the importance of freedom and humanity. Montag reveals to his wife where he has hidden over twenty of the forbidden novels, and from that point on he finds himself being persecuted by the ignorance and coldness of the world around him. Montag's main antagonist is his former fire chief, Captain Beatty. Over the couse of the book he presents the reader with disturbingly realistic monologues concerning mankind's eventual decline into ignorance. The most alarming part of this decline is, as Beatty points out, that it was the people's choice. This ignorance is not only what leads to the burning of books, but also to a fear of their fellow man which made their world cold and unfeeling. Chilling in its realty, Fahrenheit 451 is just as relevant today as it was when first written."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The major complaint against this book, as far as I can see, is from elementary school students who resent being forced to read works they don't understand. I couldnt agree more. Although I am a bibliophile, and found this book very interesting, I am also consious of the unique ability of english teachers to analyse books to death.

Occasionally, I reread those books, and some of them still flare up my imagination. F451 is one of those. There is a misconception that scifi authors must predict the future in minute detail, the more so if they deal with social issues, lest their work becomes &quot;dated&quot;. Not so; good authors write about the present. If one chooses to select current trends and extrapolate them, it's irrelevant how accurate a prophet one is. It matters not whether or not firemen will ever go from firefighters to firesetters. What matters is that Bradbury foresaw, and denounced, a society drowned in entertainment - worse still, &quot;infotainment&quot; -, assailed by a barrage of GUIs, emoticons, acronyms, shoot-'em-down, trigger-happy computer games, &quot;educational&quot; software that is none other than, &quot;interactive&quot; TV shows plastered on wall-sized screens, complete with FX and surround sound ... And never a moment to be alone with ourselves and just plain think. From readers'comments, I garner F451 is being given as an assignment to 7th and 8th graders. Too little, too late.

My attitude now towards the subject of potential loss of freedom combined with mass culture, although much more down-to-earth than it was in my teens, is still pretty much the same: respect and appreciation of human freedom of expression. Bradbury is very clear in his fight for freedom, the extreme fictional situation he devised is now more real than ever - true we are not prohibited from keeping books (in this country anyway), but we are offered enough mass culture that most people will spend hours in front of the TV rather than reading books or visiting museums (I do that a lot too).

To start off with, it wasn't very well written and the characters and situations were unbelieveable and boring. Montag was a very odd character and hard to relate to and it bugged the [STUFF] out of me how he cried about everything! The book didn't really have a very powerful message either. It was basically don't watch TV, read books. The world will be lost without them! And the whole thing about the stupid Harvard degrees on the railroad tracks was cheesy and stupid. If you can memorize a piece of literature so easily, what's the point for books? I compared this book to Orwell's 1984, which I read last year, and there was no comparison. This book was not nearly as chilling and thought provoking and failed horribly in getting it's point across. With all the talk of firemen burning books, you were tempted to put a match to this one. I also disagree with a major point of the book that implies with the loss of literature comes the loss of morality. The book took place in the future but not that far in the future. I got the idea that it took place only one or two generations after it was written. The morality of the world could not be lost in that amount of time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury in my opinion is extremely confusing and difficult to read. The setting is in a futuristic world, where books are banned and anyone who is caught with books are prosecuted. The main character, Montag, is a fireman whose job is to burn books. The world he lives in is plain and dull, and he becomes desperate for something exciting, so he begins to read the books that he burns. Once caught by his fellow fireman, Montag must flee from his home and run away to escape imprisonment or possibly death. In the book, some of the concepts are hard to understand, and the futuristic conceptions in the book may confuse the reader. The vocabulary isn't too difficult, but there are sections of the book that may set the reader off track. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone younger than the seventh grade level, and I would recommend this book to people who like science-fiction. Personally, I thought this book was very boring and it didn't capture my interest."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If it is, then I will imediatly torch the books to bits and pieces.

The book mentions people Montag meets and is friends with and about his failing relationship with his wife. There are many 'futuristic' objects in this book which keeps you thinking and confused.

Ray Bradbury does not describe the story very elaborate and and so e.g. it is very difficult to understand what the people are talking about.Furthermore, the tension the fireman acts with doesn't get clear in the description by Bradbury. This is a very bad style of telling a story and makes me think the author himself didn't like the story.The dialogues between the fireman, Montag, and the girl he meets on the street are forced and do not seem vivid.

This should give you a rough overview of what the book is like: way to descriptive. A lot of my friends in the class didn't even read the second or third sections because it was so incredibly boring. There are so many metaphors and stuff that it is so hard to understand the story.While I hated this book, if you're the kind of person who likes sci-fi books with a lot of metaphors, then you should read Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a not so distant future, Guy Montag is a fireman. But, paradoxically, his mission is NOT to quench fires, but to set them up in order to burn books. Because in the world in which Montag lives, it is absolutely forbidden to read books. Because reading books forces one to think for oneself. And thinking for oneself might lead you to question the world and not be happy. And in this world, it is mandatory to be happy.This book warns about the dangers of a mechanized civilization which condemns the life of the spirit and the free mind. The prescience of Bradbury is remarkable: in a book written in the fifties, he foresaw the terribly negative effects TV could have. Today, there still are free thinkers in this world, but to most people they seem weird and strange. TV, of course, can be used for constructive purposes, but let's be honest and admit that some 90% of its consequences have been stupidly destructive.

This, sadly prophetic, book truly reflects modern day life. Amazingly, people don't read anymore, BY CHOICE! Were offended by any and all things serious. Life has become nothing but trivial, meaningless, stupid, &quot;fun.&quot; The movies, television, pastimes, everything, is completely empty and devoid of all substance, if it actually has a point, then it's called &quot;overly serious.&quot; After all, we just want to &quot;have fun;&quot; why waste our lives trying to fix problems? Forget the problems! Life's too short! Eat, drink, tomorrow we may die! Ozone depletion, global warming? Bah! Human beings like you and I starving to death? I don't see it! Poverty, pollution, living beyond our means, injustice, racism, classism, sexism, hatred of all differences, greed, and countless other serious problems? Who cares, I don't see 'em!

Why don't we read? Why don't we care? Why don't we think? Why do we allow this to go on? Ray Bradbury tackles all these questions and more in his book. While this isn't a difficult book to read, it is slow reading, because, to get the point, you must continually stop reading and think about what you've read, to ask the important questions: Is it better to know, or not to know? Is it better to read, or not to read? Why do I read? Why do I think? How do I separate two conflicting truths, which are equally true?

(And only those under 20 get to use the latter excuse.)You don't have to like this book. You don't need to agree with everything Mr. Bradbury says.

Befriended by a sixteen year old girl named Clarrise Mclellan, he begins to see through her eyes the beauty of simple nature. And books come alive to him.

For a little introduction before delving into my review of this book, I would like to say that I amuse myself with books more advanced for my age, as they are by far more interesting, and enhance my writing skills and whatnot. With that done, I will not begin my comments on the book and a bit of a summary.Concise Summary (in my standards): Fahrenheit 451, written by Ray Bradbury, concentrates on a man by the name of Guy Montag, living perhaps a century or so from modern day, when the world suddenly altered into a dystopia. Therefore, firemen, instead of extinguishing fire, generate fire. However, they perform such tasks because of certain objects: books. Books were thought to be threatening and complicated, and thus, were ordered to be destroyed. The entire history of firemen was completely changed to fit this. For example, Benjamin Franklin was the first fireman, but he was a fireman parallel to that of the world in Fahrenheit 451.Anyway, Guy Montag is happy with his life. Until he discovers a girl by the name of Clarisse McClellan, who forces upon intricate thoughts about the past. Certainly, she was an odd person. Later on, she disappears, possibly dying. However, despite this, she remains an impact to Montag, influencing him. By time, Montag betrays the society and becomes an avid book-reader. The tale journeys through a short, almost unbelievable period of Montag's life, twisting into the end with Montag joining a group of book fanatics whom memorized certain books.Comments: The story is interesting, unlike any book I've ever read. Instead of being based on the normal spaceship, out-of-the-world concept, it is based on a completely different world, frighteningly similar to ours in a way. Bradbury employs nice words, but does not suddenly place a difficult one right out of nowhere. Because of this, the flow is great.The writing style is at least normal, as it should be with most authors. The plot is overall good, although I do feel that everything occurs too quickly. In a week or so, Montag changes from a ten-year fireman to a book lover. Regardless, it is a good book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is the living master of the science fiction genre. This stuff is good, written in 1953, even if you are like me and don't like science fiction. Pass on those Bush-bashing movies by disingenuous poorly dressed film-makers and go to the real thing.This Fahrenheit is called 451 because that is the temperature at which books burn, more or less, and that is what this is about. Reminiscent of Hitlerian Germany, book burning is back in vogue in the eastern US in the late 20th century. The first ironic twist is that the firemen start the fires to burn the books, generally engulfing the book owner's home, and sometimes the book owner as well.Guy Montag is a third generation fireman who starts to question the purpose and meaning in burning books. All homes have been somehow fireproofed, so no real fires occur, only those started by the fire department. Montag's wife sits home all day, watching mindless broadcasts on large screens, and complaining that Guy needs to earn more money in order to purchase even larger screens. Her ultimate objective is to cover all four walls of the living room with monitors.Guy starts to sneak home some of the books and of course, he ultimately becomes the target of his own department. He learns that he should not trust his wife or his colleagues, all of whom long ago drank the kool-aid. He does make the acquaintance of an elderly professor, an intellectual and scholar from the old days, who ultimately puts him in touch with others of a similar ilk.Perhaps most interesting is the reason givien for burning the books. Non-fiction is bad, since it is all contradictory and impossible to prove, and fiction is even worse since it is not even true, just made-up people, places, and dialogue. And dont get me started on poetry or philosophy, that will only cause confusion, sorrow, and feelings of being lost. Society has made a clear selection in its entertainment, with an absolute preference for high speed sports, action, and adventure.More irony follows as Montag on several occasions becomes both the observer and the target as he is pursued by the authorities. Then we learn from reading a book that books are not a suitable way for humanity to store knowledge, that requires dedicated but powerless and marginalized scholars involved in constant peer review and analysis. The last irony is that Bradbury has written a very short book here, actually a novella, because he knows that we prefer action and adventure to reading.As of this 2005 writing, I understand that Bradbury is in his 80's and still working. In various interviews, he expressed anger that Michael Moore would adapt his title for a completely unrelated and unfunny diatribe. But then, Bradbury lifted \\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" right out of Shakespeare. What comes around, goes around."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"How many times have you ever wished that you never ever have to read another book again or how many times have you wished that books should be banned so that you could watch the TV all day long? Well, enter into Ray Bradbury's world where reading books are illegal, watching TV all day is encouraged and running people over with cars are acceptable.Remember in school, where the brainy kids would always answer the teacher's questions while the rest of us sat behind? The rest of us would always feel dumber and after class we would beat up the brainy kids. It was a no win situation but in this wonderful society, class consisted of - you guessed it - television and more television. But in this world, everyone was made equal, so much equality that practically everyone are mindless zombies.Guy Montag, the protagonist of FAHRENHEIT 451, mindlessly burn books for a living. His profession is being a fireman. What better way to prevent books from making us unhappy, right? Wrong! Everyone that follows the contraband-book-society is miserable. Right off the first few pages, someone wants to kill herself and it turns out to be Montag's wife.Clarisse McClellan enters the picture and she gives Montag a little shove towards the direction of actually making him think for himself. For a moment there, Montag starts to live. He sees nature meaning trees and flowers, you know, that sort of junk people really don't see when their mind and concentration is on the television. McClellan also makes Montag question his lifestyle and happiness. He starts to get upset because he realizes that there is something terribly wrong with how the society works. But don't worry. Before McClellan can complete the transformation of making Montag into a living and breathing person, she gets run over by a car, driven by a bunch of kids. A wonderful world, is it not?Since Montag is stuck in between the phase of being a zombie and being a full fledge person, he looks for help. Although he wants help, he's placing himself in danger, by - be prepared for this - reading books and by talking with Faber, a retired English professor. The journey that awaits Montag would be full of confusion, danger and anger especially when Faber and Beatty have a verbal one-on-one. By the way, Beatty is really Captain Beatty, as in captain of the fire department."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Set in a not-too-distant future where books are banned, firemen start fires rather than put them out and room-sized TVs provide all social interaction, Farenheit 451 is truly scary. In a world like this, that is at once strangely familiar yet radically different, Guy Montag's behavior throughout the novel helps the reader identify with him. Definitely thought provoking and frightening in how close to reality much of the subject matter has become."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's books make for immediate, mesmerizing, entirely compulsive reading. His prose is electrifying in its use of poetic metaphor and dramatic syntax. The reader is instantly plunged into an alien culture, or a terrifying future, and is not really released even after the last page is turned.I had been postponing reading this novel for years. I am, after all, a confirmed bibliophile. Reading a novel with a plot involving the burning of books would, I kept telling myself, be too traumatic for me.I finally decided to wade in.Need I say that I only put the book down when I absolutely had to, when reality intruded? The novel carried me along on its relentless wave of narrative. Of course, I tried not to picture the books burning as I read, but Bradbury wouldn't let me. Not when he was describing them as living creatures, dying, their pigeon wings flapping.... The fact that I managed to endure this at all is a real tribute to the greatness of his writing.The characters are indelibly imprinted on my brain. The most compelling, of course, is the protagonist, Montag. Equally compelling are Faber, who is obviously Montag's alter ego, and the numinous Clarisse. She is the one who first awakens Montag to the futility of denying his own soul, the stirrings of thought and penetrating questions that reading invariably arouses. The most tragic character is Beatty, who struggles hard against his love of books, in his work as chief fireman. This struggle culminates in a final, ironic conflagration. Montag's wife, Mildred, is to be pitied, since she is unable to acknowledge her emptiness, her consuming loneliness. She pushes away the power and beauty to be found in books. She refuses to come out of denial, preferring \`the family', a banal cast of characters she endlessly watches on the living room \`wall-to-wall TV', in order to anesthetize the deepest longings of her soul.As I read, I became aware of a deeper sense of discomfort, underneath that elicited by the burning of books. Due to my own life experiences, I, along with this disturbed society, had been unconsciously longing for a world in which no one would ever get his or her feelings hurt - a world where everyone's rights would be respected, especially those of minorities.Bradbury gave me a sobering look at such a world, and it was absolutely terrifying. It was \\"American Idol\\" gone wild, a world in which people no longer thought, felt, or even communicated on a soul level with other human beings. Instead, they spent all their time being \`happy', through mindless, ongoing entertainment.I realized that I didn't want to live in such a world; it would mean the total annihilation of what makes us most deeply human - the ability to dream, to wonder, to ponder the deep truths of life.Books and the questions they raise are incompatible with living in a world where nobody would offend anyone else. Books disturb, probe, anger and challenge. Books are flawed at times, due to their authors' all-too-human penchant for furthering their own pet theories, however twisted they might seem to a reader. Books can make us squirm, for they can force us to face the unwanted realities we try to bury.There is still a part of me that thinks that books such as \\"Mein Kampf\\" should be burned, or at least, allowed to expire by going, and staying, out of print. The Marquis de Sade also comes to mind as an author of books with a markedly offensive subject matter. Then there's Anais Nin. One of her books chronicles the incestuous relationship she had with her father...The problem is, where do you draw the line? Who decides which books merit extinction?I don't have a final, satisfactory answer.And so I am left feeling restless and slightly depressed, although I'm glad to have read the book, nevertheless. It has caused me to ponder what I really and truly believe regarding the banning of books, and their potentially harmful influences.Yet another uncomfortable element of the plot is Montag's desperate, evil act toward the end of the novel. I suppose it is inevitable, however. It is indeed immoral, but then, so is the entire, nihilistic society he is a part of. It is the act of a man who has turned on a symbol of that society, and so, turned on himself, in a sense, in order to be reborn as a new man, a man who thinks and feels, even if doing so causes him some measure of unhappiness. This act could, itself, be considered a harmful influence on a reader, since Montag evades punishment. Yet, as an act of rebellion, of a misplaced sort of justice, it is totally fitting. Therein lies \\"the treason of the artist\\", as Ursula K. LeGuin puts it. For the artist makes meaning out of pain, suffering, and tragedy. This is also part of the value to be found in books.The symbol of rebirth is ubiquitous in the novel. At one point, the myth of the Phoenix is mentioned. Ironically, civilization is being reborn out of the very fire it has used to destroy the very objects that had given it meaning - books.By the end of the novel, groups of people have quietly begun the reconstruction, the return to reading. It is a movement that is slowly gathering momentum. Civilization, suggests Bradbury, as Miller's \\"Canticle for Leibowitz\\" was to do years later, is constantly rising from the ashes of every Dark Age in order to reinvent itself.So I know that I will be re-reading this book sometime in the near future, as I intend to do with Miller's. Both are books that apparently dwell on despair, only to end with a feeling of hope.Bradbury has once again sparked my imagination and tickled my intellect. He also refuses to let me forget his incredible take on a future that may or may not turn out to become all too real."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have re-read this book twice. It is a profound, pivoting novel, redolent of dysthymic admonitions and insight into the depths of nature. We are truly moving closer to the future allocuted by Ray Bradbury, for we reside in a society of superficiality and vice, in which mass media precludes critical thought and engages in unmitigable ideological insemination. The infernal machine known as the television is everywhere, and the pretense of the machine's adoration of the viewer and pseudo-relationship manifests itself in the aplomb, homogenous you-centered advertising schemes. Political correctness is bilious and has reached a prodigious, nauseous height. We are absorbed in a sub-culture of vanity, asininity, and conformance, whilst the circumambient ecumenical situation continues to precipitate. But we can preclude the advent of a Bradburian future. We must destroy televisions everywhere, and rid the world of superficiality. degenerate literature such as modern romances and John Grisham should stop being idolized, and we must return to the antecedental genius of man, We must read Thackery, Bronte, Joyce, Mann, Goethe, Kant, and we must liberate ourselves from ignorance. reading this, i felt that Clarisse Mclellan was predicated upon me. I have always wandered amongst fecund leas and orchards and the fallow moors, engrossed in nature, and admonished and mocked for it. Just the other day, whilst seeing the reflection of a television's promulgations, i heard jets in the sky, their aquiline screech shattering the heterogenous tranquility of the pines diademed with mists of the sea... and all the while, the television blasted, and i thought eerily of Fahrenheit 451, and what would ensue...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very well written, worth the money!

This entire book is in that surrealistic style, beautiful to some and maddening to others. As the years go by, Fahrenheit 451 becomes ever more prophetic. For me, the most haunting theme is that this is not some 1984 style dictatorship. We subjugated ourselves through apathy and fear of anything different. Recent hits such as &#34;Feed&#34; by M.T.

It's one of those that I've always seen on lists of books that everyone should read but I never got around to it.\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\" Guy Montag is a fireman. But, in this world, fireman don't put out fires - they start them. The government doesn't allow citizens to have books and if it finds that someone has a stockpile, they send the firemen to burn them. Guy meets a seventeen year old girl who inspires him with stories of a world where people actually talk to each other and read for pleasure. When he looks for her a few days later, he finds that she has disappeared. (People who speak out don't last long in this world.) Guy takes a book from a house they are burning and starts to question the government's wisdom. He is, as expected, discovered for his treasonous actions and the government tries to kill him. He escapes and joins other outcasts outside the city. A war then begins and the city is bombed.Meh...I thought this would be a book to love. But, somehow, it was just okay. No, I don't support this kind of government interference in our daily lives. Yes, I love reading and can't imagine a world where reading is not only discouraged but illegal.

The idea of firemen not putting out fires but starting fires got my attention and held it. The way that Bradbury saw the future also kind of scared me, that people were killed all the time and no one noticed or even cared, but somehow this society was supposed to be perfect. The Mechanical Hound was something that also interested me, the perfect hunter. Something that can find the genetic make-up of your body and store it and then whenever you need to be killed, can track you down and finish the job. The only thing i could change about the book is to make it a little longer. After the city is bombed it just ends. I was hoping Montag would find Faber and the story would continue, but it didn't.

Bradbury is really a national treasure. If you ever get the chance to hear him speak, don't miss him. His stories are priceless. (Especially the one about his anger at people telling him for years that he was crazy to believe man would set foot on the moon in his lifetime. He said he called up every person who laughed in his face the night Neil Armstrong did--and pretty much laughed in their faces!) There is a fantastic one-on-one interview with him in the Walt Disney Tomorrowland-Disney in Space and Beyond DVD (interviewer is Leonard Maltin). His friendship with Disney (a fellow futurist) was fascinating. But it's the sense of wonder and child-like curiosity and optimism (not childish or blind optimism as he clearly understands what can create a dystopia) that make you realize why he is a national treasure. He's inspired me to look to the future, to look up, to look forward, to always be wary and alert to what can go wrong, (and the dangers of closed or lazy minds) BUT not to let any of that stop you--that anything is possible in a world willing to believe, in a free world with open and curious minds."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was first introduced to Ray Bradbury when I took up The Martian Chronicles at my community library. I was impressed. Now, several years later, I finally read Fahrenheit 451.The book is divided into three parts, and the first two were absolutely excellent. (The Afterword and Coda were, as well.) The third part of the story, however, lost me. Ray Bradbury decided, partway through the section, to abandon the easily flowing narrative that he had established in the rest of the book. Instead he picked up a very difficult to follow inner dialogue that lost my interest. Which made it even harder to follow for the rest of the book.But, Bradbury deserves a gold star for his insight into how society is working today (which he foresaw several years ago). We are giving up books and stopping thinking. Remember, at first, the government didn't have to burn books... People just stopped reading them.Love it or hate it, this is a book that rings with truth. And, whatever you do, don't burn it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Many other people have already said that they liked the book, but I really have to say, this is one of the most brilliant stories of all time. From the first sentence 'It was a pleasure to burn' to the end, I couldn't put this down. It's almost poetic, you don't get stuck in bogged down writing full of unimportant details. This book is an extremely easy read, yet it is a hundred times more impactful then a 500 page book that takes you weeks to finish. Sure, you'll think about that while you're reading it, but this book will come back to haunt you years down the line.For a story written so long ago, it's frightening that society has done nothing to prove it wrong. This is a classic story about censorship that manages to enforce it's point without sounding at all preachy. It encourages thought. I wish they had made me read this in school, surely this would strike a chord in many people bored by the onslought of bad shakespeare movies. Hopefully this story serves as a cautionary tale to the people of today. Our TV's keep getting bigger, our music more portable, our transportation faster, but it feels like, in our need for speed, we're leaving the important things behind.To conclude, this is a brilliant story, even who people who read but once a year.

Some pages depart from prose, and actually become poetry, and then revert back again.Due to the short length, this book can be done in a few hours, which is ideal for any casual reader.

It is a startling depiction of a life where books are taboo, and reading is illegal. Instead, the people are dumbed down with constant noise and emotion devoid of purposeful thought. This novel is enthralling. It is vivid and potent because the telltale signs of demise are familar in our everyday lives: the importance that people are placing in TV (i.e. entertainment), the growing violence in children, the dumbing down of literature, and the impersonal relationships between family members.

In this story Ray Bradbury portrays censorship in a way that only some one who thinks outside the box can. In this alternate future firemen are paid to burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman that is undecided. Every other fireman thinks only of the great blaze and wicked joy that comes from burning books. But Guy is the only one undecided. When he sets books ablaze he wonders whether this is right. One night while he was walking home from the latest book raid the awful stench of kerosene still in his hair he meets a strange girl who makes him think. What if books were not meant to burn? This question as he knew could endanger him and his wife. So he decided that he would forget about the queer girl. He soon found that it was nigh impossible to forget her. But the next day he was called in for another book raid. This time during the raid he thought about the girl and her strange thought of him saving a book for her. As Guy and his fellow firemen sprayed on the gallons upon gallons of kerosene on the books he saw a sentence of a book he would always remember. He had only a second to think about the sentence because someone reminded him to set the blaze with his salamander engraved lighter. After that he saw one helpless book try to escape the blaze. Like a bird's final push the book went up and down. Through out the book Guy Montag constantly battles with himself what is right and what is wrong."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First published in 1953, when the hysterical Red Scares of McCarthyism were near their peak, Fahrenheit 451 is set in a world where books are all but banned and critical thought is suppressed. Nonetheless, the author, Ray Bradbury, received from President George, and Laura, Bush, the National Medal of Arts. This was on November 17, 2004, as the attack on \\"scientism\\" was getting into high gear, and the USA Patriot Act allowed the government to compel librarians to release their patrons' borrowing records.The work was originally published in the second issue of Galaxy Science Fiction magazine. In an interview on the DVD, available separately, Bradbury claims that Fahrenheit 451 was his only work of science fiction. The central character, Guy Montag, is a \\"fireman.\\" In this disturbing vision of the future, firemen burn books. Books are all but banned by the government because they have \\"conflicting ideas\\" in them. Those ideas can make people feel bad. It is the government's job to keep people happy, with drugs, television, and other entertainment. Does anyone still remember the term \\"Happy Talk News? Let's keep it positive.The novel plays on the concerns of the time when it was written. Censorship and suppression of thought, mainly through intimidation, was being exercised in the United States. The intimidation was being done by radio and newspaper columnists, who supported McCarthy, who were as rude and ruthless as, say, Bill O'Reilly, on Fox News. The book burnings by Nazis, which started in Germany in 1933 and continued until the end of World War II, were still in living memory. And the world was still reeling from the horrible pictures of the explosions of nuclear weapons on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, as well as implications of the mass production of nuclear weapons.When the novel was released in book form, the publisher released a censored version that eliminated the words \\"hell\\" and \\"damn\\" for sales to schools. When Bradbury found out about it, he wrote an epilogue describing the censorship and his thoughts on \\"well-meaning\\" revisionism. The epilogue was published in some later editions.And I am sure that somewhere in Kansas, or Ohio, there is a school board that will not allow the novel in the library because of \\"those words.\\"Like Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451, describes a hedonist world, where the people need not think. I'll have my Valium now. And I have cable, so there must be something to watch. Maybe a rerun of Jerry Springer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Written by Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451 is about a fireman whose job is not to put out fires, but to start fires. Guy Montag was a fireman and he enjoyed setting books, and the houses where the books were hidden, on fire. He never questioned the law that said that books were illegal; he just excepted it. It was not until Montag met a young girl who told him about a time when books were legal and people enjoyed reading them that he began to wonder how the world came to be the way that it was. He wondered why people were afraid of books, and he also wondered why some people risk the chance of having their house burnt down in order to own a book. He wanted to learn why the world was the way that it was. He then met a retired professor that helped him to learn and to understand what society used to be like and what the future was going to be like. After hearing this, Montag knew what he had to do, but he was not exactly sure of how he was going to do it.One night walking home from work, Montag met a young girl, Clarisse. This chance encounter with this girl is one of the most significant moments of the book when the idea of the world being different in the past occurred to Montag for the first time. \\"They walked still farther and the girl said, \`Is it true that long ago firemen put fires out instead of going to start them?'\`No. Houses have always been fireproof, take my word for it.'\`Strange. I heard once that a long time ago houses used to burn by accident and they needed firemen to stop the flames.'\\" After this conversation, Montag begins to think. He begins to wonder if this girl who he just met is telling the truth and if he can believe her. This moment stages the rest of the entire novel, and Montag continually comes back to his conversations with Clarisse, like this one, that made him look at society and the past differently.Bradbury's unique ability to create worlds, address important universal themes, and evoke an emotional response in his readers makes him one of the best science fiction writers of our time. For Bradbury each sentence is an important building block that supports his creation without extraneous words and unnecessary frills. For example, note how completely Bradbury conveys the character's mood to the reader with his tight prose in the following quote: \\"I'm numb, he thought. When did the numbness really begin, in my face? In my body? The night I kicked the pill bottle in the dark, like kicking a buried mine.\\" (p. 77)In particular, I recommend Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 which explores the theme of censorship, a topic no less important today than it was in 1953 when the book was first published. Although the setting is ambiguous, one can easily understand that Bradbury is making a statement about the perils we face, if we let ourselves be thoughtlessly censored. If you were at all interested in understanding human nature, political propaganda, or the human thirst for knowledge, I would recommend you read Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book because of all the suspense it has to offer and just the fictitious setting in the near future. Montag, the main character in this book is a firefighter, but he is not your average firefighter. Firemen now start fires instead of putting them out; and they fuel the fires by burning books.This book has a very futuristic setting to it. People watch television on screens that are as big as the walls because books have been outlawed because the higher authorities were becoming offended by what was said in them. Therefore, soon it was impossible to write something without offending a person, which made literature dull and all the same. The world is going through very harsh times, there have already been a couple of wars since 1990.Montag is fed up with life until he runs into an open minded younger girl named Clarisse. She is different from most people at the time with a passion for nature and a love for other people. After Clarisse dies, Montag begins to turn to books for answers as to why they are being burned. Montags firechief Beatty finds out and gives Montag 24 hours to read as much as he wants. Montag will later find out that his wife betrays him because she is disgusted that he is reading and leaves him. Beatty orders Montag to burn his own house then places Montag under arrest only before Montag turns and burns Beatty alive.Montag then has to escape the law from a mechanical hound that is out to get him. In the end, Montag joins up with a group of \\"book people\\" that have memorized great literary pieces and are basically outlaws on the run. He stays with them and helps to rebuild society.When i got done reading this book i was very surprised to think that this is the way society is slowly becoming. Many more things are being censored now for fear of being chastized then in previous times. Kids nowadays are also much lazier and much less reading is being done by newer generations. This book, although fictitious, still shows what a world without books could do to a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"throughout the novel, you are exposed to many different thingS comparing to our world to this books words. the main character Guy is a firemen and his job in this world is to burn books that they find among the people.

I enjoyed reading this book because of all the fury and held in rage I have consumed over the years from reading [bad] books. I also enjoy burning misc. things. This was one of the better books I have been forced to read in school. I do not read much and when I must do book reports it makes school worse and worse but this book was not so bad. I do not usually get assigned good reading books as assignments. Reading is good for you. Stay in school. Read this book. I do suggest this book, however, to read this book even if not assigned. It will keep you wondering what will happen next. Keeping me on the edge of my seat is a good combination for a book when mixed with only 180 pages. This is a good book to read if you like to read AND if you hate reading and need a book report because of how short it is. I have given this book 4 stars for a good plot and it's worth reading. Writing 250 words is usually hard but when you write on constantly about nonsense it becomes easier. If you are being forced to read this book, do not fret, read it. It's not so bad.

I only give it three stars because the author doesn't describe the unknown things better to the reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is, from an analytical standpoint, about the meaning of life, values and the reactions of people. The book begins with the main character, Montag, as you will realize he lives the life of the classical fireman. He burns books because it is what he is paid to do, he goes home to his wife that, since they have no children, sits around and watches T.V. all day, and is completely brainwashed by the society. Montag then encounters a girl, named Clarise, who thinks about the world and he wonders. Not too much later he goes to see a professor who helps him to think, himself, and in so doing puts Montag against the society that he was the idealist for not so long ago.This book can be analyzed as an insight to the meaning of life for the different characters have such contrasted views as to what the true meaning of life is. First of all there is Montag the protagonist of the story, he changes his meaning of life from, work at my job, that isn't too bad, so I can support my wife and she can be happy. Then contrastingly to what I considered as my view on life before is flawed, because my wife isn't really happy; for two reasons, first she almost kills herself, without thinking much of it, and, second she doesn't understand how to think so she really can't be that happy anyway. This leads him to think that his purpose in life is to try and enlighten some part of the society to induce thought and maybe make people really happy instead of the temporary solutions they use all day long. The second character that is the general view you get on the people in society is Mildred, who is basically every average housewife. Mildred is a living zombie of absolute brainwashed stupidity, she really isn't capable of her own thought and she thinks she is happy, since she can't really think for herself and their isn't much material around about the meaning of life, she really doesn't have a view, but her character, or moreover what she represents matters to the story and how life is viewed by general people. The third person that shows the meaning of life that is generally accepted is that if you please your superiors you have done your job in life, this character is captain Beatty. Beatty is an interesting character he knows what Montag knows that books let people think, he has also read many but he utterly supports the government without objection or dispute. He knows what the government wants; yet he agrees and he tries to convince Montag that he is right and the government is right and he is doing what must be done. These three characters show contrasted views of three beliefs on the meaning of life, or what is good.Values are shown vividly in the book, there are different values shown, such as knowledge, material, and thought. The first example is the night call to the house where the woman burns with her books; this exemplifies value in knowledge. This is shown in what the books represent to her, she has such value in the knowledge, which the books contain, and value in the importance of this she doesn't feel she can live after they have been burned. The second instance where value is shown is in Mildred, and her value of material, in this case her parlor. The scene where this is most relevant is when Montag comes to burn the house, she complains more about her parlor as she goes away than she does about her husband who will be sent to jail. The third time value is shown though this is in no order is in Clarise. The value she represents is thought, she values thought without even having to try, she values it because her family values thought and she is fed on thought and conversation; throughout her life by her uncle and parents she is thought the value and meaning of thought, and so she expresses this value.The reactions of people are also in the theme of this book, for many times this is shown. The different reactions I will discuss are: first, the society's reaction to banning books, second the reaction Captain Beatty has to books, and third Montag's reaction to Clarise. First, I will discuss society's reaction to the banning of books. Society in this world is not so much different from ours, yet a ban against books wouldn't make sense to people, but it seems logical to people in this world. I am for the opinion that this is because the government structures the world around fast pleasure instead of the pleasure of knowledge, so it can be easy to ban books and make people into what Mildred and her friends represent. I believe given time this would easily follow through in our fast paced world, not because people wouldn't fight but because of people that wouldn't really care. The second reaction I would like to discuss is the reaction of Captain Beatty to his reading of books. This is intriguing, because even after reading many books Beatty still hates them, this is odd since the general reaction to something you hate is not to do it, yet Beatty knows his enemy like a friend an intelligent, hateful method of enforcing your opinion. The third, is Montag's reaction to Clarise, she doesn't have to do much to catalyze his thought, this is most likely due to the fact that he thinks a lot but not about the right things.To conclude this book has many an Interesting aspect to it, and is worth a good read, make sure to remember not to be a person that doesn't care."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story, Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about an alternate society set in the future where cars travel 100 miles per hour, TV walls interact with people and books are banned. Guy Montag is an enthusiastic fireman, who enjoys pouring kerosene over books and burning them and the entire house. In this society, firemen do not put out fires. They start them.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury. This book was action-packed and involved a lot of good writing. For example there were many metaphors in this book. They helped to connect Montag's society to ours, and show the frightening similarities between the two.Mildred Montag is Guy Montag's wife. She is an example of the people the government wants to create. Mildred is shallow and cares more about her possessions than about herself or her husband. Also, Mildred never shows interest in what Montag has to say. She regards him as an annoying younger brother rather than her husband. Mildred is the stereotypical housewife of this time period. She values all the things her society does. She seems to not think for herself, and only knows what the society wants her to know.In the beginning of this book, Montag seems perfectly content with his life and his job. He says it is a pleasure when he burns people's houses. He loves the smell of kerosene that comes from his job, and \`wears it like a perfume'. Then one day Montag meets a girl named Clarrise McClean, and his life changes forever.Clarrise is a peculiar girl for the time period. She thinks. She enjoys smelling the leaves in fall, staying up late at night talking and watching the stars. Clarrise seems like a girl that came from our time period and was placed in Montag's. The norm for teenagers in this book is to play video games, play sports, and kill each other. There are many gangs in this society and often innocent teenagers are shot. Also, teenagers like to drive their cars hundreds of miles per hour to see how many people they can run off the road. If a pedestrian were to be crossing the street in this society, they would most definitely be killed. However, no one walks anywhere. Rather, they take the subway or they drive to wherever they need to go. Pedestrians are seen as weird and are often watched by the police to make sure they don't do anything illegal.When Montag meets Clarrise and talks to her, he immediately wants to know more about her. She is unusual to him, and he likes that. Montag loves the way Clarrise doesn't care about what anyone else thinks of her. Clarrise teaches Montag to question society when the society seems wrong.The day after Montag met Clarrise, the firemen were called to a site where there were books in need of burning. Montag seemed detached from the routine that usually captured his every waking hour. The firemen were at the house of a woman who had hidden books in her attic. When the other firemen were pouring kerosene over the books, getting ready to burn them Montag stole one. He put the offensive book under his jacket and in doing so saved it from being burnt.When Montag got home he revealed to Mildred the stolen book. He opened up the air vent in his room and exposed 20 more books! Mildred was horrified, and gathered the books so she could burn them in her incinerator. Montag ordered Mildred to stop and said he wanted to read the books. He reasoned the authors must have spent their whole lives writing a book and therefore the books must be worth reading. Some people were willing to die for the ideas and opinions in these books, and Montag wanted to figure out why.Mildred, like most of the society, took no interest in Montag's books. She knew that if she did, she could be sent to jail. Mildred did not want to risk ruining her reputation, or loosing her house and TV walls. After Montag realized that Mildred would be of no help to him, he decided to talk to someone. Montag needed someone who would be aware of what he was going through, and could help him understand the books. Montag recalled an elderly man, by the name of Faber, he met in the park years ago. Faber told Montag that he was once a literary professor and he loved books. Montag went to Faber's house to visit him there. He brought with him one of his stolen books; the Bible.Faber eventually helped Montag in his quest to change the society. He told him that this couldn't be done quickly, but rather after a long period of time. Montag and Faber then began to discuss a plan to change society's views. They decided to place copies of books in firemen's homes. Then they would have the homes burnt. This would cause unease within the system and hopefully cause its demise.This book is about a society similar to ours. They have censored everything possibly offesive, thus only keeping the facts. The society is terrified of stepping on the toes of minorities for fear that they will rebel. They believe the bigger your market, the less you have to handle controversy. The public doesn't want to read anything that might offend someone. This aspect of Montag's society sounds frighteningly like ours. People watch what they say in public so as not to offend anyone. Montag's society grew to hate books because they might cause an uprising. What their society wanted above all, was for everyone to be happy. The story of Fahrenheit 451 is of the coming of age of Guy Montag. It is about his heroic efforts to restore civilization to it's thinking. This was an astounding book, and it is great for people who like action, controversy, and to think about life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 at school. Before I picked it my Mom was telling me how she enjoyed reading the book before me ,so naturally me being a teenager assumed that the book was going to be stupid ,but I got it anyway .It turned out that Fahrenheit 451 was one of the most enjoyable books I've ever read. It's true to life sci-fi theme puts me in the future world as depicted by Ray Bradbury where firemen are paid to start fires instead of put them out. I read the book once before but the second time around was much better. Allot of details in the book were overlooked by me the first time .It captures the decay of modern day literature to technological advances such as television and amplifies it with a sci-fi twist to the point where literature is forbidden .The reader follows the character montag through the story as the reluctant firemen begins to long for literature .His wife is addicted to television so she doesn't really help him with his self-esteem .He meets a man named Faber who helps him learn more about literature while his secret still remains kept .Eventually he ends up with a choice between his job and his life .A problems with this book is as follows ; If literature is forbidden how to they teach children ? Overall It was a good book and if you haven't read it yet I'd recommend that you do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book follows the same outline of the great novel \\"1984\\" by George Orwell. This book deals mainly with the threat that censorship poses on a nation. Guy Montag, a fireman, has never had a problem going along with the norm until he meets a young girl who changes his perspective on life. He then begins to question why he burns books which leads him into trouble with his boss Fire Chief Beatty. There are many important lessons that one can draw from this book but mainly the idea that books never die and that they live on in people's hearts and minds as long as there lessons are remembered. This book can teach young people to appreciate the importance of books, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"the book fahrenheit 451 was a decent book it involves a character named montag. he is a firefighter no, not the ones who put out fires . he burns books because its the law not to have them. later on in the book he grows to like books because of his own curiosoty, but he almost looses his life because of it. i wont give away the ending but if you want to know what happens then i suggest you read it. chances are youll like it"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's account of a bookless world is realistic in every way. Farenheit 451 is realistic in how it describes situations, people, and places throughout the book. In the beginning of the book it describes Guy Montag and a book burning. The author describes the book in how the books &quot;Flutter around like birds and the sky burns as black as night.Guy Mantag is a firefighter who, instead of fighting fires, he starts fires. Guy does this because of a massive government censorship act in order to keep people in line with the way they think. It is sort of like a cover up. Society agrees with this because they don't want to break the law.This book's in depth descriptions are so good they pull you in and its like your there. Farenheit 451 will fill you with a new way of looking at things."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would recommened this book for anyone ages 13 and up. It's a hard read, but has a strong theme and interesting characters. I enjoyed the whole book until the ending. I didn't like the ending because it was a little bit confusing and sad. Besides that I enjoyed this science-fiction which has a strong resemblence to the Giver by Lois Lowry."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Just finished reading this book and found it quite entertaining. Instead of giving you a synopsis of the book as many other readers have done, I found it interesting how the entire premise of book banning has even resurfaced in recent years. The entire Harry Potter series has received significant press as to whether the books are appropriate for younger readers. Bradbury's observations are not very far off those seen today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a very good book. The detail was very good. You could just picture the story. My favorite thing about the book was that you had to infer what happened to Clarisse. Was she killed, OR did she go to the railroad. I really think that the author Ray Bradbury is a great author because he puts the best similes in the the right places. For one example of a good simile is on page 3 of the book , \\"With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python sitting its venomous kerosene upon the world...\\" This talks about the nozzle that Montag uses to light the fires that burns the books. This book is a good book and I would recomend this book to anyone who wants to read it. It is filled with everything you could ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who job it is to start fires instead of stoping the. In this backwards world of his he burns books and the houses that they are hidden in. In this future world reading a book is against the law because it gives peoples ideas. Guy never qustioned his job until he actually thinks what it would be like to read a book.....I never never really thought what our world would be like with no books, but now that I think about it I can't believe how monotonous and boring it would be. Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always liked this book to read so I thought I would get it on CD. Ray Bradbury reads it, and it is very bad. It was so painful to listen to his voice I had to turn it off. He reads in such a monotone voice it put me to sleep. Someone needs to re-make the CD's."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not one for long reviews so.... I was kind of disappointed with the novel. I expected the greatness of 1984 and better writing. Loved the characters though. The ending, I feel, was a let down and not as well written as the first half. Read it, but I suggest 1984 or A Brave New World if you enjoy that genre, since they are better books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have never been too enthralled into science fiction to truly appreciate its genius and creative content. But with Fahrenheit 451, I somewhat admire the genre to some degree. More than anything of course, i admire the novel, which is truly a work of genius and creativity. It took me less than 3 or 4 hours to read it because it was that good! While reading it you can't help but feel a sense of so much irony because of the haunting aspect of a society and of a world where books are burned into ashes. But it's also enlightening that yet, in that world, people like the inspiring Clarisse McClellan, Professor Faber, the \\"Book People\\", Granger and other hopeful outcasts of society, as well as our hero, Guy Montag, can still have that hope and ambition to still keep that curiosity and passion for learning, not only from books, but from life in general. Reading this book overwhelmed me with all those allussions to Shakespeare, Plato, Plato's Republic, Einstein, etc., which embodied the foundation of our conscience in the history of world literature. This book is a quick read, and also an insightful book into a world that has to some extent become our modern society. You can have many twists to looking at this novel yourself. At the end, it's so worth reading the WHOLE thing, and seeing it in different views to make you appreciate more in the power of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The message of this book is that you always need books, no matter if you have internet, TV or whatever, you always will need a book, this message is written in a book of almost 200 pages, so if someone that doesn't like to read reads this book that person will never read again no matter the message, this book goes out of the story so many times that you almost forget that story, maybe the only book who needs to be burnt is this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"when i read Farenheit 451, my first impression was that this book is so screwed up. i mean like who would want to not read a book. thats just so wrong. the one thing i did like about the book was Guy's wife, Mildred. i liked her alot because she said that the t.v was her family. she was a little crazy though. i also liked the part where she called the firemen and told them that Guy had books. then she walked out on him. i also liked the mechanical dog. that was something very original. i gave the book 2 stars because i really thought that it was a waste of time to read it. but you know, that is only my impression of the book.Writen By:Jessica C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book talks about a fireman and his group starting fires and burning books.

This book takes place sometime in the future. It is a story is about a fireman, he is not a fireman that you and I think about; instead of putting fires out he starts them. He is a book burner. Because in the society that he lives in books are outlawed and are to be burnt. There were four main characters in this story. The most important was Guy Montag. He was a tall black haired man that questions society and himself. He is a fireman that burns books for a living. He makes a lot of changes throughout the book buy the end of the book he is a wanted man. The next character was Clarisse McClellan she is a young girl that is not like everyone else. She is a free thinker she helped Montag get started on his journey. Montag's boss is very important in the book. His name is Captain Beatty. He is a fat black haired man. He seems grumpy and he enjoys burning books. Towards the end of the book he is murdered. Professor Faber is an old professor that helps Motag learn about society and how it used to be. He is weak and cannot act out what he wants to , so he and Montag act as a team. Mildred Montag is Montag's wife. She is the perfect example of the rest of society. She believes that books are horrible and have nothing to offer. All she cares about is her family that was on T.V. and not much of anything else, just like the society she lived in.While reading this book I could relate to a couple of the characters. For example, Guy Montag questions his job and what he wants to do with his life. I have done this. So I quit my job and made the decision to go back to school. Another character is Clarisse she is outgoing and enjoys to be outside. I also enjoy going outside and I am always ready to try new things.I liked this book very much. It kept me interested the whole time. My favorite part is when Montag burns the other firemen and starts the chase to the river because it made me want find out if he was going to get caught. My least favorite part is when his wife called the fire alarm on him for hiding books in their house. As a result, Montag is forced to burn his own house.I would recommend this book to anyone that likes books about the future and what it holds for us. If you are young or old you will enjoy this book. It is a fast paced book with many exciting parts that will keep you reading and guessing the all the way to the end. If you have free time or need to do a book report go out and get a copy of Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this is a good book. buy it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is about a man Guy, Montag who questions why he is a fireman that burns books instead of reading them. The firemen of our society put out fires and help people, but the firemen of their society are futurist cops who burn books. The main character in the book is Montag Guy who is works for the \\"fire department\\". Montag meets a women named Clarisse McClellan who changes his mind about what he does as a fireman. Montag runs into many problems after this, when he decides to change his mind to not burn books. Captain Beatty is Montag's boss of the fire department, who eventually finds out that Montag is hiding something. Montag's behavior creates problems for Montag that put his life at risk.Montag is my favorite character in the book because he is an exciting person that does a lot of interesting things. You don't know what Montag will do next while he is on the run from the law.I compare my self to Montag because I remember when I was told what to do all the time. Just like Montag was told what to do by his society. Montag did not know that burning books is wrong because he had grown up in world that told him to it. Now that I am 18 years of age my parents can't tell me what to do anymore. It's like I am responsible more now than ever. I can start my life and do what ever I like. Montag is trying to fight for his freedom by getting out of his society so he can start a brand new society which is just and fair.This is a great science fiction book that will keep you guessing all the way through the book. My favorite part in the book is when Montag is forced to burn down his own house while Captain Beatty is waiting for him outside. After that he is arrested by Beatty. Instead of giving up, he turns the flame thrower on Captain Beatty and burns Beatty to death. I loved this part because the hand exactly symbolize what Montag's hands are doing to Captain Beatty-like they have a mind of their own. If I could change something in the novel it would be that Bradbury had more of the young women, Clarisse McClellan, because Montag talked to her a lot in the beginning of the book. I would have liked to see if there would be more of Montag and her interacting.I would recommend this book to people who like science fiction. I would also recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.

Fahrenheit 451 by Rad Bradbury is an intriguing book about what would happen if a society had gotten rid of books. I totally have grown to like this book. I have read it 3 times over and every time I Loved the way Rad Bradbury wrote as if the book was a debate of literay authors and ideas. The reader can visualize the pain and risk Guy Montag the main character goes through. The first thing I noticed about this book is the cover. How clever to have a person burning with newspaper and the title &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; which is the point where things burn. The best part of this unique book to me is the last part &quot;Burning Bright&quot; and the afterword. Bradbury's writing stands out the best. The reader can totally feel the fatigue as Guy takes his last step, before realizing he is safe.This book sparked a new &quot;flame&quot; for me because I could feel and taste the burning of books and how it could impact my society now. I can just feel what would happend if my city,state or country burned books. The chaos and killings. Books now are looked at as last resorts. The internet has taken over all books. But this book made me think a lot too. I reread his afterword and coda twice because I like to think of how he came up with this idea and his writing style. This is a great book that not only gets the reader lost in this world of burning but notices different authors, books, and new ideas that can bring just a better new generation of authors, poets and everyday writers and thinkers to come as one and share to the world that as quoted in Fahrenheit 451,&quot;Knowledge is Power!&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a well written and thought out science fiction novel that has many different levels of understanding to it. The book is designed to force people to consider the future of society seriously. This book is great because it changes the roles of people in the future to make the plot interesting. The plot of the book is set at a brisk pace to keep the reader from putting it down because the author is desparately trying to prove many points that are hidden throughout the story.The book places you into the future where the government tells the people what they can read and how they can live. The majority of the people loose their independence because they allow this to happen without protesting and they deserve what horrible thing will come of this. There are a few people like Montague who begin to fight back against the government. Montague used to be a fireman who in the government contolled society burns fictional books until there are none left in the city. The government wants all fictional books burned so everybody can be happy all the time. It turns out the people become ignorant because there are no fictional stories to compare their lives to. Montague attemps to escape the government with a few allies helping him out by storing the memories of the books in their heads to share with generations to come.Montague at first loves his job as a book burner, but he changes as he sees how ignorant the people in society are getting. Montague's curiosity lures him to the books. Montague is independent unlike all the characters in the story who are brainwashed except for Montague's ally Faber. Faber is a frightened old man who used to be a college proffesor until the government ruled that there will be no more fictional books, and he was forced to live alone without his beloved books. Montague came along and changed Faber so that he wasn't like all the other ignorant people. Faber now will fight back for what he believes by helping Montague bring books back to life. Montague and Faber need eachother to live in this society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not such a fan of Ray Bradbury but his book Fahrenheit 451 is excellent and is now among modern classics in the same line as 1984 and Brave New World. Most new versions of this book carry with it a great introduction from Bradbury about how he typed his manuscript on a typewriter that cost 10 cents to use every half hour. The story was first published by Playboy magazine. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn.Inspired by Hitler and Stalin book burning, 451 tells the futuristic tale of a fireman, Guy Montag, who works for the government as an emergency book burner that sets fires to books which have been banned. They storm houses, dig up floor boards, find books, destroy them and then arrest the owners.Montag begins to question the controlling society that he lives in. Why is he burning books? Inevitably this leads him to seek out books for himself and with it the paranoia of being found out while working for such an oppressive regime. There is some very good plot twists and the story is full of tension, suspicion and mistrust.You will read 451 in a day or two. It is less than 200 pages long and easy to get through. A modern classic that you should not miss."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Definetly this book is worth reading, it is interesting that even dough it was written in the 50s it represents many of today's issues, it is profetic in many ways.Book burning is only a representation of ways to hide knoledge, this can also be done by controling newspapers and news in general, by limiting information to a society or prohibiting books.Are we to far from fiction?, when our rights are steped on in the name of freedom something is seriously wrong, someone once said that going to war in the name of peace is like having sex in the name of virginity.I like the ending of this book, but to be honest I really beleive the story could have been done much better, I still give it four stars because I found the main issue, that is, free thinking and access to knoledge, are very well ejemplified trough the story, and it really gives the reader something to analize, it also makes for a great round table discussion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book, Bradbury demonstrates his talent of symbolism as he brings the inner meaning of the book to our eyes. 451 takes place in a distant future far from our time. In a world where the government is afraid that people will learn (from books)and rebel, firemen no longer are called to the scene to put out fires, but to start them. In this warp society, burning books is a swift, fast way to take out all education, and people who strive for it. Guy Montag, a fireman, meets a young girl who tells him about a past where things were totally different, and once more sparks his intrest in books he had before. In this book, Bradbury tells us about censorship. It gets the reader thinking is it good or bad? Could Bradbury be forshadowing what our lives will soon become? Overall, this book was good.

Montag had a job as a firefighter, but he was not assigned to stop fires from spreading. Instead hid job was to burn books and the houses in which they were hidden. Whenever Montag was at work, he always felt wrong when he was burning books. This change occurred after he met Clarisse. She helped him notice that books were a good thing. But one day at work Montag was faced with choice to either burn a book, or to keep the book and read it. I won't tell you what happens next because that would ruin the book.I liked a lot of things about this book, but the thing that enjoyed most was the amount of description and detail. When you read the book you could just picture yourself as the main character and see clearly in full detail you surroundings. Most authors lack this amount of imagination. Second I like the pace at which this book flows. It wasn't too fast or too slow. It would first fully explain one part of the story before it moved on to another part. I also liked the way he wrote this book. It was in such a way that you just had to keep reading until you finished the whole book. Third, I liked the vocabulary that Bradbury used. The words he used made his book sound professional, but the words were not so complex that you can't understand them. The vocabulary also helps in the descriptions that Bradbury made.I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who has a ninth grade reading level or higher. I think it is the type of book that anyone who reads would enjoy reading this book. People who enjoy science -fiction would like this book even better.

Only Guy doesn't put out fires like firemen today, he starts them instead. The point of these fires is to burn books, because his society has decided that books do more harm then good. After seeing the look on people's faces after their books were burned Guy becomes interested in books and wonders why people seem to care so much about them. He starts to read books and eventually gives up his old lifestyle.Overall, I thought that Fahrenheit-451 was an interesting and exciting book. It was a little slow and hard to understand at first but eventually it started to pick up and became hard to put down. I can't say much for the setting or the character development but the book was worth reading just for it's phenomenal theme. Near the end the suspense started to pour in and it does keep you on the edge of you seat but immediately after that it slows down. I myself did think that this was an all right book. If you like science fiction and enjoy creative and important themes then Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent choice.

Bradbury satirizes [in this book] what our society is slowly becomig through our own intellectualism(s). And that has been my thesis statement for the three papers I have written on this book: &quot;This book satyrizes what modern society is slowly becomming; as such then we can conclude that [through the socratic definition of justice] that our world is slowly becomming unjust. All in all this is the best book I have ever read. It will enlighten a true reader. Please, for the sake of all great literature, please read this book. I am a highschool freshmen, and I found it exciting enough to do a fifty two page paper on. Please, give Bradbury a chance.

From reading about Montag's quest to find out the truth behind the illegal books and the weird laws of his generation's government, it taught me to appreciate what I have now, and to pray that our world will never come to the point where they want to ban books all together from their love to new technology and a faster, better, easier way of life. Reading this great piece of work makes you, just as Montag, question.... are these people really happy?!? You learn throughout the book that it is important be able to think on your own, rather than being a mindless person just sitting as a statue { :) trick} in front a TV, watching what the government wants you to watch, not what you want to watch. I learned a very valuable lesson from this book that I will cherish for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a book that really get writers hooked.

What was wrong with my high school? No Bell Jar, no 451?*Anyway* fascinating read and crazy to think that books may be obsolete in the future, quite sad, since I'm an avid reader. The premise of the story is about a fireman who knows nothing else but his job and what life is like now, until he meets a young \\"strange\\" girl who discusses actual real life with him. After that, Montag starts to wonder things outside the realm of what he always knew and starts to question his job and the purpose of burning books. He ends up rebelling and fighting for the cause.If you liked 1984, this book is similar is some aspects (to me at least).

The story follows Guy, who is a firemen, as his new neighbor gets him to open his eyes to the world around him. The plot is enough to keep any reader chugging along, but the main hook to this book is Ray Bradbury's disturbing vision of the future. You can form your own opinions on if its an accurate vision, but whether you think it is going to happen or it is just a load of crap, it should defineatly get you to think about the world around you. This book certainly deserves the 5 stars I gave it and if you haven't read it then I seriously suggest you get a copy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An interesting story of book censorship and the consequences of mankind if we allow this to get out of had.

Montag's rebellious spirit builds up until he finally explodes. An old Professor, Faber, leads Montag on the right path and Montag finally feels at home at the end of the book. This book depicts what could happen in the future if we are not careful because the time Montag lives in is a time of great censorship and the Government is issuing the order of destruction of books.

He likes his job well enough until he meets an odd 17-year-old girl named Clarisse who lives in his neighborhood. She talks about all sorts of things that Guy has never considered and he starts to think about his life and the world he lives in. Thinking is not encouraged in this future world and the entire culture seems to revolve around sensory bombardment, mindless entertainment, and a mindless apathy about anything in the real world.This book is a classic largely due to the theme of censorship and free thought. The story is more powerful because it makes it clear that book burning and censorship from the government came well after most people had already turned away from books. It started with one group being offended by one thing, another group offended by something else, until no one wanted to bother with books or anything that challenged them. As many have pointed out, our culture has actually moved closer to the world that Bradbury portrayed and that is a bit scary.The weakness of Fahrenheit 451 is the writing itself as much of the prose reads like bad poetry. It's obvious that the author was attempting to use language to evoke images and feelings, he just wasn't quite up to the challenge of doing it well. It's also quite preachy at times. I found myself skimming through whole pages after a while and even though this is a very short book, it felt like a long read.Those who have never read this book should probably do so at least once. It does discuss important issues and is probably even more timely today than it was when it was written. Don't expect a sparkling read, but the story is strong and even suspenseful in the second half."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I do not want to tell much of the story, as the unfolding is part of the intrigue. However now that houses are fire proof the purpose of firemen is performing a service by burning books to maintain the happy social order.Naturally one fireman goes awry after several emotional incidences from someone burning up with the books to a young neighbor with strange ways, which run counter to his carrier. This leads to all kinds of deviant things like reading. What are you doing now?One big rift between the book and the movie [Fahrenheit 451 (1966) -- Oscar Werner, Julie Christie] is that in the movie the \\"written word\\" was completely removed (even from the credits); where as in the book the state was against was literature and not technical writing.Books are just symbols of ideas that could have been on the screen also. There is deference between training and education. Among other reasons the book was a symbol of one mans superiority over another in a world of equals.Fahrenheit 451"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is said to be the temperature at which books ignite. The concept of the novel was satirical. The book was set in a sort of parallel universe or alternate reality that says that a government has taken over, which has outlawed books and goes into people's homes and sets the books on fire. There is a law against books even in schools, this seems insane, and the backlash to an idea such as this is the current popularity of books today then the alternative to books, would be the ebook."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I have read it through three times now and love it every time. The interesting changes of the future, but steady curiosity of the main character kept me wondering. A splendid story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The narration is more cerebral than story-driven even though Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is one engaging dystopian thriller. What continually surprises me, as well as countless other reviewers, is how prophetic the novel has become. Predicting the future, even only for the sake of story, has a tendency to unravel a novel's relevancy if enough years pass since the original publication. Even that's putting it softly. A novel about the future will cease to matter UNLESS, as in the case of Fahrenheit 451, the story ages in a state of becoming mostly true.My favorite bit of wisdom came from the author's afterward of the particular edition I was reading. To summarize, he commented that people of all ages and all creeds have the potential and often do engage in the act of book burning without ever lighting a single match."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read this book in high school and loved it. Since then, I've read it again and still love it. Fahrenhiet 451 addresses the serious issues of censorship and how a controlled society of this sort could limit the well being of society as a whole. In this frightening world Ray Bradbury created, books are not allowed and people are encouraged to escape into fantasy television shows that encourage shallow thinking. Guy Montag, a fireman who burns books, begins to question his reality and sets out on a journey in pursuit of freedom and truth. The novel is highly thought provoking because it encourages its readers to think about societal rules and to question the structural foundations of the group mentality. It was also an exciting read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What else can be said about Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451? Nothing, but I'll try. It is an amazing book, with an amazing plot, an amazing story, and it must be read by anyone who enjoys dystopian themes. The world that Ray Bradbury envisions in Fahrenheit 451 is as close to realistic horror as it can get for any thinking individual - not even Stephen King could create anything as truly horrific."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to think of what to write in a review for your favorite novel, but I will certainly try. Fahrenheit 451 is frightening in the fact that the events laid out are plausible; it's completely accessible to a variety of readers. It has everything that a dystopic novel needs, even if the future setting is a bit vague. Bradbury's writing has stood the test of time and there's no doubt that high schoolers will still be studying this novel in another 50 years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book does a fine job at creating a dysfunctional, brainwashed American society of the future completely controlled by a dictator-like government. The story is easy to follow and has the moral of never lossing hope when everything around you feels lost. The book doesn't have too much deep meaning behind it, which means it basically reads out how it reads out. Ray Bradbury is a good author of these types, and provides interesting scenarios for these characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Obviously, most can tell if a book is good or not. This book hits you with an immediate blast of curiosity. By the time that you have finished part 1 of the book, you simply must go on and find out the truth about so many things. Is she really dead? What's going to happen next? Its all included in this book. I suggest that you go and pick this book up just for the enjoyment. I am not an avid reader nor do I enjoy reading, but with this book, I was forced to make an exception. Pick it up, and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"From the standpoint of literature as a whole, it seems 451 is an important piece of work simply because of its eternal message of censorship. Ray Bradbury was a science fiction writer but managed to elevate this novel to the most important rungs of the literary community, something not many SF authors do. There's a reason for that vacuum- typically SF writing is dry, much like 451. It's a good novel, but I don't think it added much to realm of science fiction as it did to the literary community.Science fiction novels from the 50s and 60s have a distinct feel and flow to them and Fahrenheit 451 is no exception. Like many of the other novels of the era, 451 was based on a short story written and was later lengthened to a novel. The basis is simple: books are illegal and must be burnt. That makes a tidy short story. But stretching a simple idea like that into a full length novel loses an ethereal something (the spirit? the essence? the soul?) from its inception. This occurs in many Poul Anderson novels, as well as John Brunner, James Blish and others from the same era.That ethereal something lost changes the feel and flow of a normally placid plot... much like in 451 where the onset of the protagonist's change of heart is sudden and undeveloped. The direction of change is clear and predictable. Perhaps 451 is the waving flag of examples of censorship, but its undeveloped underpinnings starve it of greater breadth."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have read this book more than once, when I first read it I had to for school but really enjoyed it. I read it again and even watched the movie, the book is way better. Very good message for those that think books are bad and useless. Books remind us of the past and can help us in our day to day lives."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Though I was long familiar with many of Bradbury's works, I had put off reading Fahrenheit 451 in favor of other books until a friend lent it to me recently. After finishing it, I'm angry with myself for having taken so long to pick it up. This book is a fantastic tale of a future society that abandons intellectual development and destroys its books. Like all great literature, it offers insight into our society today despite having been written over a half-century ago, and it continues to reward reading today.This book is more than a seminal work of dystopian literature, however; it is also one of the most elegant meditations on the value of literature in modern society that I have ever read. In envisioning a society that destroys books, Bradbury has to explain what is lost as a result. His answer, as we see in Faber's expositions during Montag's visit, is the exact thing which makes this book worth reading - the insights we gain into our own world and our own lives through reading. Integral to this process, of course, is the fact that people must read them and put what they take from them to good use for a society to thrive; as Bradbury notes, the first step towards the world of his novel was taken when people stopped reading. It is this message which makes this book essential reading, especially in a society where entertainment today bears an ever-closer resemblance to the noise-dominated media depicted in Bradbury's nightmarish future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are only going to get one Bradbury novel this should be it. There are many reviews about the plot, so I will not go into that. The story is one of the greatest ever told. Bradbury is very adamant on his views of education and reading and writing. This book proves that our ability to express feelings would be lostwithout writing. Get this book, but with some caution. It may seem a bit boring at first, but once you read it a few times you will grow to love it. A great work of art should not be very acessible, and this is a great work of art."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic story of the dark ages. Guy Montag, a fireman with the job of burning books, sees a problem with book burning after meeting a nonconformist neighborhood girl. Ultimately, this leads Montag on a path which encourages him to discover books. While he was told books are nonsensical and useless, he discovers their beauty. Montag rebels, destroying his own home and killing the fire chief. As a fugitive, he ends up on the outskirts of the city when a war destroys his former homeland. The insinuation is that the book keepers who live outside the city will bring about the end of the dark age, rebuilding civilization.Bradbury's futuristic society is effective because he creates a thorough picture of the future. In the same breath, I think the scenario is realistic because people do not read as often as they once did. It made me think about the likelihood of a new dark age.The story starts off slowly. Montag seems to have an unhealthy obsession with the young girl. But as the story develops, more conflicts are evident. As a consequence, the story flows more smoothly. I particularly enjoyed the police chase. The mechanical hounds seemed very realistic. They would seem to be such an effective crime fighting tool for this day and age.I would suggest this book is a classic.

Even from the start it is made apparent that Montag had a discomfort about his job. His new neighbor Clarisse McClellan helps to make his realize this and that reading and learning is not bad. His boss, the Fire Chief doubts his dedication to this job as is he. In a world where knowledge is strictly prohibited, Montag discovers the importance of literature.

It did have some strong points as well as its weak points as well. The characters in the novel I thought were very well developed and gave enough detail to make you get a picture in your mind about what he/she looked like. The character that I thought was the best developed out of them all was Guy Montag. He was described physically but also mentally so you could really understand what he was thinking in certain cituations, like how he goes against his heritage of a fireman and decides to start reading books. Guy was a fireman, and firemen in these times burned books. The book says \\" First Fireman: Benjamin Franklin\\" (64)I also like the technology of the novel. The technology was very relavent to what is reaslistic. The ear peaces that they wore to listen to the radio could become very popular in the near future. When Clarisse McClellan said \\"...did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last\\" (39). This shows what society was and that technology got so fast that they had to change billboards.The setting of the novel was developed well also. The setting was in a futuristic city, which seemed very high paced, like I would envision most large cities to become in the future.I did not like the fact that people did not have there own feelings about things. They never came up with there own ideas and just seemed to go through everyday monotonously. I do not agree that this is what the future holds and that people pride themselves on having there own ideas.I also disagreed with that nobody likes books and doesn't read them anymore. I feel that it was not a good idea to say that nobody reads and most of the people don't mind that. I would think that if people enjoyed reading like the group led by Granger, there would be violent revolts. When Mildred says \\"...Why should I read? What for...\\" (101). It shows that people had no desire to read or what reading had in store for them.Overall the book was very good and I suggest that you should read it if you are in the mood for an action novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a important and influential book.

When Montag knew he was caught by his boss Captain Beatty he threw fire on them and fled to avoid arrest, Montag now a delinquent joined a group of scholars whom were outlawed because they kept the contents of books in their heads. I liked this novel because it is very honest, it shows how the society does not always change for the people, but the people can change for the society. You will never see a time or a place where everyone agrees with the same thing and this novel is a great interpretation of a two sided belief ( books vs. no books).

In this society, they don't want you to think.There are walls that speak to you, you can drive as fast as you want, billboards stretch out for hundreds of feet because they want to make sure that you still get advertisements drilled into your head. Is this in the future, or did Ray Bradbury know what our society was coming to?When Guy came home from work, he met up with a strange girl who was curious, charming, and not like anyone he has known. She put questions into his head, and he would never be the same. After their meeting, he started to sneak books into his house knowing what would happen if he were caught. The question is: should he risk his life for the sake of knowledge, or live like everyone else: happy but ignorant?The only problem I had with it (and I don't normally say this) was that it was too short.

Reading books is a banned activity, and firemen are not used to put out fires, but to burn down houses where books are being covertly hidden.

He meets up with other readers in the countryside and decides to remember and preserve books rather than return to the city, which, by the way, just got anniliated by atomic warfare...This isn't so much a novel as a longer short story critiquing society's ever-decreasing attention span and lack of time spent actually thinking. Everything is based on entertainment, and ideas and concepts are spoonfed to the public in short, repeated soundbites. Sound disturbingly familiar? I found it amazing that, 50 years after having written the book, Bradbury's view of the future isn't that far removed from reality. We don't burn down houses with books, but we try to censor ideas and make everything &quot;politically correct&quot; so that no one is offended.This particular paperback edition is the 50th anniversary edition of the book, and features an interview with the writer at the end. He also expounds on what the characters in the book would say and do now if the book were to be expanded.Well worth reading (or reading again if you haven't done so lately)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What began as a short story in 1950, evolved into one of the greatest American novels of all time. Fahrenheit 451, originally titled The Fire Man, was Ray Bradbury's first novel. It is ironic that the place that Bradbury chose to write a novel about book burning was in a book haven - the basement of the University of California's library. Fahrenheit 451 takes place in a future where knowledge is despised and thought of as an unequalizer. People are made to believe that in order for everyone to be happy and live in harmony they must be equals. Since books spread knowledge and knowledge is an unequalizer, most books are banned from reading and burned in order to be kept from society's hands. Due to the fireproofing of houses, firemen are no longer needed to put out fires. Instead, firemen set ablaze houses that contain illegal books, sometimes burning the people within the houses if they refuse to leave. Guy Montag was a fireman who loved to watch the flames dance in the sky and the books shrivel and die, that is until he met a young girl named Clarisse. Clarisse opened his eyes to the world around him, and no longer did Montag want to burn books, he wanted to save and learn from them.The story picks up when the protagonist, Guy Montag, is walking home from work with his baked on smile and the smell of kerosene hanging about him, having just finished attending a call from the firehouse. While nearing his house, he is accompanied by a strange young girl who introduces herself as Clarisse McClellan. They begin to talk and Montag realizes she is very different from everyone else he knows. She looks at the world around her and sees it for what it is and then takes the time to wonder why it is that way. Before they part, Clarisse asks him something that turns his world upside-down, she asks, \\"Are you happy?\\" (Bradbury 10). One might say that those three little words are the most important in the entire book because they set in motion the series of events that are to follow. At first, Montag tries to laugh it off saying, \\"Happy! Of all the nonsense.\\" (10). However, as Montag entered his house and looked around the quiet rooms and at his silent, stone-like wife, he knew that he was not happy, he knew that something was missing.Subconsciously, Montag knew he was not happy for a long time and had been collecting books from the houses he went to burn. After further discussions with Clarisse and much thought of his own, Montag realizes that there had to be a better way to live and that books could teach him how. Montag pulled out the illegal books he had been hiding and began to read them. However, try as he might, he could not understand and retain what he was reading. Bradbury compared Montag's struggle with sand and a sieve, \\"the faster he poured, the faster it sifted through . . . His hands were tired, the sand was boiling, the sieve was empty\\" (78). The sand is a metaphor for the knowledge within the books and the sieve is a metaphor for Montag's brain. The more and the faster Montag read, the faster it slipped from his memory.Montag continued to try to read and learn more from books and was found out by his boss, Captain Beatty. Of Montag's situation, Beatty makes an allusion to the Greek myth of Icarus, saying \\"Old Montag wanted to fly near the sun and now that he's burnt his damn wings he wonders why\\" (113). In the story of Icarus, his father Daedalus builds him a set of wings, fastened together with wax, so that he can escape from the island of Crete. Icarus was reckless, though, and flew too close to the sun so that the wax melted, breaking his wings and causing him to fall to his death. For Montag, the island that he was trying to escape from was not a physical restraint, but a mental island of ignorance. Montag was reckless like Icarus and came too close to the sun, in his case, knowledge, which caused his downfall, according to Beatty.Overall, I found this book thoroughly enjoyable and frightening at the same time. I look at the world around me and see it slowly turning into the world that Bradbury so vividly described. There are several students in my class that when given the assignment to read a book and do a report on it, opt to watch the video and skim the cliff notes instead. Movies and cliff notes merely brush the surface of books, which is what the parlor walls in Fahrenheit 451 do to all the information and stories it portrays. The idea of a future society where people do not think about their actions, the consequences, or of anything with substance is terrifying and yet incredibly believable in this day and age. It is this idea that kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just read this book a couple days ago (it's a quick read--just a few hours) and felt it portrayed a lot of what I had been thinking for a long time. My mother always shuns shows like &quot;Family Guy&quot; and &quot;South Park&quot; because she feels they are too politically incorrect, but she misses the point of them entirely. Political correctness is good, but to a point. In the aforementioned shows, it's used to make points about society and often the ridiculasness of people who aren't tolerant. In Farenheit 451, people have rejected this in favor of making eveyone happy. The point is, in a world where free though isn't allowed, no once CAN be happy. Montag's wife is a victim of the new society, a woman who refuses to think about anyone or anything that upsets her and is completely enveloped by her tv shows, or her &quot;family&quot;, where everything is perfect and everyone is laughing. In fact, a common theme throughout the book is people saying they are happy only to let us discover later that they really aren't. At least they aren't subconsiously. This is evident in the beginning when Montag's wife tries to kill herself. The social commentary, even at fifty years old, is still very striking. The burning of books is only a part of this novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury opened the book with the line &quot;it was a pleasure to burn&quot;. A shocking and simple sentence began a story set in the near future where a firemen's job was to set fire, as opposed to putting them out. As the story progresses, the main character, Montag, meets more and more people who gradually begins to change his views of the society and analyze his actions as a fireman. What made this book interesting was the radical concepts and belief that the society embraced. The story tells us that a fireman&iexcl;s job was to set fire on books, which were considered to be bad. Not just books were bad, but knowledge in general was viewed as sinister. Montag lives in a society that only promotes very basic information to the public, and knowledge was forbidden and strictly controlled.The title of the book is also closely related to the content. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; is the temperature at which normal book paper catches on fire. I thought this title was not only unique and related to the story, but it also attracted its readers. By only stating &iexcl;Fahrenheit 451&iexcl; I would think to myself &iexcl;What would this book be about?&iexcl; and &iexcl;What is the significance of this particular temperature?&iexcl; These continuous questions really increased my curiosity on the book.I thought that the most successful aspect of this book is its ability to portray an image in my mind. Though Bradbury's vivid expressions, I could picture the scenes in the book. Bradbury used figurative language as the paintbrush to construct the image. Personification, metaphor, and similes were extensively utilized. In the first page of the book, every sentence contained figurative speech. For example, through Bradbury's magical use of language in &quot;With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world&quot; (P. 1 lines 2-4), I could very clearly portray a fireman holding the hose with kerosene coming out like a python spitting it's poison. This does not solely portray an image; it also leaves a strong memory, and impression afterwards. Through the use of these powerful and impressive words, Bradbury carved an everlasting image in my heart. I especially adore the quote &quot;He strode in a swarm of fire flies&quot; This effectively produces a complete image in my mind of Montag happily walking through a bunch of burning ashes. The &quot;swarm of fire flies&quot; really produces an everlasting powerful image.Another reason I gave this book five stars is that I thought it was not just an entertaining and poignant book, it was also a book that moved and influenced me as well as triggered me to contemplate about the presence and the importance of knowledge and books. The first time I read it, I could not understand it, so I read it again. After the second time reading it, I was stimulated to ponder about the significance of knowledge. I felt very deeply that controlling knowledge through the destruction of books is extremely inappropriate. I very powerfully felt that books were important to us in our daily lives, and that every one of them has value, and they should be kept and treasured. My emotions changed from detached to extremely motivated. I felt that this book really portrayed a very different world, such that books are absent. Through indirect speech, Bradbury has really moved and changed my views. I thought this book was both very thought provoking, enjoyable, and very well done. I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" has some very interesting ideas, but they get bungled in the execution. The book was written in the 1950's and takes place in the unspecified future. Books are now illegal and no one learns to read more than is absolutely necessary. The world is in a constant state of war, but drugs and mindless T.V. programs keep most people pacified.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. But firemen no longer put out fires; they start them to burn books and the houses that harbor them. (Because there is no written history, very few people are aware that this was not always so.) Montag meets an intriguing teenage neighbor, Clarice, who challenges him to think and not conform to society. This leads him to reexamine his life, and his relationship with his dull and placid wife. Montag is also troubled by a conversation with an old man about a year earlier. Though he was sure this man was harboring books, he never turned him in. Finally, Montag steals one of the books he is supposed to burn. He dreams of collecting books and sharing them with everyone willing to listen.What's good in this book are the theoretical ideas: the sheer horror of the society being depicted (it's like a less complex \\"Brave New World\\"), and the image of thousands of people memorizing books so they can keep the words alive. Here we see that books are not paper and ink, but living words that start with one person but can touch everybody. This is what makes them so potentially dangerous.Although the book is very involving, and reads quickly, I was dissatisfied with some aspects of the plot. Montag's conversion was much too quick. If that was all it took, why weren't there millions of others like him? He doesn't come across as an unusually bright man. Also, I think the ending of the book is rushed.A minor complaint: The 50th anniversary Ballentine edition is riddled with typos, which should be unacceptable in a commemorative volume."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;If they give you ruled paper, write the other way.&quot;-Juan Ramon JimenezIt is truly amazing how a person, different in any way from his peers, can be so the same. The year is somewhere in the 21st century and Guy Montag is a fireman--whose job it is to set fires instead of putting them out. The government of the time has professed a law which makes reading or merely owning a book illegal and the punishment? The books are burned along with your house and all of your belongings. Censorship and conformity are on an uprise in this world and Guy is right in the center. T That is until Clarisse, a girl who calls herself &quot;17 and crazy&quot;, tells him of a past where people were not afraid to be themselves. With the motivation Clariss gives him and the help of Faber, a once upon a time english professor, Guy plans on telling the world the truth about the books the government will not allow them to read. Fahrenheit 451 is a book filled with suspense and multiple plot twist that keep you reading until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's 1950's sci fi classic presents a plot frequent in futuristic tales: the rebellion of the protagonist against the mind-numbing status quo. Fireman Guy Montag knew the pleasure and psychological rush he experienced while burning books; it was privilege to ride the Dragon, to bear the Salamander emblem on his clothing. He delighted in destroying remnants of a previous era, when people foolishly believed and reacted to the printed word. Seeking ever more speed, noise and violence to substitute for lack of intellectual and emotional stimulus, this culture has become shallow, enjoying superficial interactions and slavish obedience to mass mentality. This was a disposable society, where the government manipulated war and city officials doctored the news--to keep an audience or merely save face.But Montag gradually realizes his own dis-ease, as doubts creep into his mind; he begins to stash forbidden books in a secret chache, and to seriously consider the ideas of the school girl next door, whose family has been watched and labeled as antisocial for years. It is very dangerous for an individual to question or defy the prescribed pattern for Happiness, as dictated by mass media techniques. Was there some secret--vital to mankind's happiness and peace of mind--hidden within those scorned and banned books? Could one man save civilization from its own misgudied zeal? This gripping tale (under 150 pages) depicts a society gone amuck; RB provides many serious themes for thoughtful readers of all ages to digest.The 1968 film, though inevitably different from the original, is also a powerful statement. I saw it as a student in Italy. While walking home from the theatre, my companion remarked grimly: &quot;Nobody's getting My books!&quot; It made us realize that we should not take books for granted or ever underestimate the power of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a novel that tells of a very grim, yet very likely future where books are burned, not to be read. But the novel is much more than that. There is more depth to it than a simple dystopian novel. It really is a warning to a future where TV and Film surpass reading ten fold as a prominent form of entertainment. It's not just the prophetic style that makes this a great read; It's also Bradbury's superior writing. The characters of Guy Montag, Clarisse McClellan, and Faber the Philosopher jump from the pages as you read. You will not want to put this novel down, and there are too many things to be said about this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm 54 years old and I am reading this for the first time ever...on my Kindle. How very fitting, and ironic that Mr. Bradbury, who is openly against e-books, the internet and such, would agree to release Fahrenheit 451, a cautionary that centers around why real books are important, and what could happen at their demise, as an e-book.Just a thought..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not going to review the book itself. Its place in literary history is assured with good reason. That Mr. Bradbury so accurately pinpointed that censorship would get out of control is only matched by Orwell.But Bradbury has been resisting the ebook format, stating that he prefers the old fashioned book, with its smells and textures of pages. I understand that and I prefer to hold an old fashioned book myself. But books allow us to have so many titles at our fingertips at a time that they have become invaluable. And now he has allowed this jewel to be the first of his novels to be in this format.I can only hope that his short story collection is next. It is very thick and quite heavy to take outside the home to read; then again, we need all his books in e-format...all his books can be considered classics."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was actually purchased for a friend of mine as I still have my original copy from when I was a kid along with a first edition I picked up on eBay. This is the book that first started my interest in my favorite genre of science fiction, dystopia. Ray Bradbury's story behind this book is almost as amazing as the book is in itself. I'm not going to go into it, but Google it sometime. This book is written about a world in which houses no longer burn and censorship is rampant. Because of these two issues, firemen eventually become part of the government censorship and burn books. This novel is a short read but it leaves you feeling changed. This is in my top 5 books of all time and will always be on my shelf."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"So I finally got around to reading Fahrenheit 451 and all I can say is that it's one heck of a book. Bradbury's dystopian tale of disenfranchised \\"fireman\\" Guy Montag is so spot on in some places, I had to do a re-read. The book was published in 1953 but some of the depictions are eerily current. For example, Montag's wife, Mildred, spends her days gorked out on TV from the three wall installed sets in their house. She says: \\"It will be even more fun when we can afford to have the fourth wall installed. How long you figure before we save up and get the fourth wall torn out and a fourth wall-TV put in? It's only two thousand dollars.\\" (p. 20)Sounds a lot like a plasma screen to me.When Mildred entertains her friends, the talk turns to children. One woman, Mrs. Bowles, says: \\"I've had two children by Caesarian section. No use going through all that agony for a baby. The world must reproduce, you know, the race must go on. Besides, they sometimes look just like you, and that's nice. Two Caesarians turned the trick, yes, sir. Oh, my doctor said, Caesarians aren't necessary; you've got the hips for it, everything's normal, but I insisted.\\" (p. 96).Isn't there a growing trend for elective Caesarians these days?The references get eerier when Montag talks of anti-American sentiment: \\"Is it because we're having so much fun at home we've forgotten the world? Is it because we're so rich and the rest of the world's so poor and we just don't care if they are? I've heard rumors; the world is starving, but we're well fed. Is it true, the world works hard and we play? Is that why we're hated so much?\\" (p. 74).I shivered when I read Bradbury's description of a hotel about to be flattened by a bomb \\"that was an inch, now a half inch, now a quarter inch from the top of the hotel\\" It was an image of 9/11 all over again, those horrific moments before the towers were struck. Montag's estranged wife is in the hotel. He imagines her looking up at the \\"ceiling as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon her, carrying her with a million pounds of brick, metal, plaster, and wood, to meet other people in the hives below, all on their quick way down to the cellar where the explosion rid itself of them in is own unreasonable way.\\"It's a sickening, visceral description and Bradbury nails it.I only hope he's wrong about the rest of it; that firemen start fires instead of put them out; that reading is a capital crime; that entertainment is a televised manhunt in which the unfortunate victim is dispatched by a diabolical mechanical hound.Bradbury is brilliant. The book is chilling. It's on a lot of reading lists. I wouldn't be surprised to find it on the list of banned books. If Bradbury is right, the future's coming and it isn't pretty. But there are survivors, men and women who are charged with remembering, who are living chapters of books that no longer exist.So maybe there is hope, too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montague, a fireman in Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, can't imagine anything better than watching books burn, the pages blacken and crumble. Guy's world is a futuristic America where firemen burn instead of extinguish and where books are illegal. Books will offend some people, so they all burn. As Beaty, the Fire Captain, explains so bluntly, \\"We can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, What do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy... Don't we keep them moving, don't we give them fun? That's all we live for isn't it?\\" And they do. Their world is all about entertainment, the faster and more they get, the better. Guy is compelled to ponder his world after meeting a young, seventeen-year-old girl, who actually watches and thinks about the world, and then she disappears.Bradbury's skill with words steers you effortlessly through the gripping story. I sincerely enjoyed reading this book. I could not put it down and after I finished it I wanted to start over to pick up on the details that I was sure I had missed. I would recommend this book to anyone willing to think. However, because of its depth, less experienced and younger readers may struggle with understanding and grasping the authors message and purpose.Even after fifty-eight years, Fahrenheit 451 still retains a prophetic bite that makes you stop and contemplate our own world's direction. It leaves you considering your own life and where you are allowing it to go. Hopefully enough people will stop for a moment and care, or we will end up in the same shallow world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The beauty within Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 comes from how it begs you to look at the world around you. The futuristic society depicted by Bradbury in the 1950's is almost frightening because of how closely it resembles the world that we live in now. We have filled our lives with technology and arguably have become more removed from society than ever before. Instead of sitting on the porch and conversing while watching the sunset or listening to crickets we tend to turn our television sets and let the propaganda and the garbage be forced down our gullets. This book opens your eyes and paints the picture of a very feasible and very scary future and it forces you to be aware of what is happening around us.I have read positive reviews from people who love this book and also reviews from those that think it is an overrated piece of garbage. When forging my own opinion of this book I look at the messages that Bradbury seems to be trying to convey and how well he does that. I have found that the most acclaimed message in the book is that propaganda and technology are poison to the human mind. The book creates a world where human beings have been hollowed out by these things and have become nothing more than automated drones seeking only entertainment - and to be free from worry and woe. Bradbury has said that the theme of his book is that television takes away the desire for people to read and appreciate literature.Aside from the previously mentioned theme - I feel that the most spectacular part of this read is the satirical society that Ray Bradbury has created. I feel the message goes further than television eats away at your mind. I found that the most significant message in the story is that technology as a whole is dangerous to us. The book illustrates how technology has people moving faster and faster and becoming detached from each other (comparable to real life). People in the society only care about what is on television, or about driving a 100 Miles Per Hour, or going to amusement parks. Families are not close-knit; people send their children away to school and never really know them. It seems that every person in the world around the main characters are completely empty and do not care about the well being of anyone. This is one of the most interesting points of analysis that I have found in this book. Comparing this to how people are becoming in real life. It is almost hard to admit how similar our world is to the horrible place from Bradbury's imagination.I cannot say that this is the greatest book that I have ever read, but I did really enjoy it. Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most thought provoking stories that I have ever read. I find it to be extremely interesting from cover to cover. It is a book that you can read several times and come away with different ideas and messages each time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really loved this book.

As other reviewers have noted, some of the details that Bradbury imagined in 1950 (when he wrote it, not the publication date of 1953) have come true (large TVs on the walls, a move towards simplistic sensationalism, the deep distrust of education and educated people, etc.) I found the writing to be serviceable, sometimes brilliant. Occasionally the metaphors get too long winded and overly descriptive.The 50th Anniversary Edition, published by Ballantine Books/Del Rey is wonderful. Not only do we get the full unedited text (ironically, this book about censorship has been censored frequently over the years), but we also get the afterword and coda (added in the late 70s, early 80s) and an illuminating 10 page interview with Bradbury himself.

Indeed, Bradbury gets his point across. At first, the book seems Orwellian, as if there is a tyrant or Stalinist leader in America. But this is not true, and the actual reason _why_ the books are burned is very interesting. The reason was a completely new concept I never really thought of.Bradbury makes you think.This novel tends to reflect heavily on Bradbury's fear of &quot;the bomb&quot; and of course, the opression of book reading (as does his other classic, &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot;).There has been much critical review about Bradbury's treatment of one of the main characters, Clarisse. Her ending tends to be unanswered and incomplete; however, this should not have an effect on your choice of reading the novel.Overall, the book should _definitly_ be read.

Like many people, I first read this book for school, and I fell in love with it. Fahrenheit 451 is an essential book for any reader, young or old. Bradbury did remarkable things with this little book, and I know I'll never feel the same way about censorship again.Fahrenheit 451, the temperature at which paper catches fire and burns, is a hauntingly appropriate title for this book. For a controlled and thoughtless society, the reading of books has been outlawed (note, the READING of books - a point in an important scene which Bradbury wrote but never placed into the book and can be read in the Afterward). Deep thoughts are discouraged, and the public instead recieves no more than what I sometimes call \\"on a platter\\" entertainment, such as the wall-to-wall television screens and miniature radios which are placed inside the ear to block out all other sound. Firemen are now paid to burn books and the houses in which they are hidden, to protect the society that books are believed to endanger.Like another favorite book of mine and also another very necessary book, Lord of the Flies, whos fiftieth anniversary passed last year with an unfortunate lack of recognition, Fahrenheit 451 takes place during a war in the outside world. Also Lord of the Flies, little light is shed on the subject of the war, although in Lord of the Flies it is often assumed that the war is World War II. But, as Mildred Montag and her friends know, \\"It's always somebody else's husband who dies.\\"Guy Montag is a fireman who, after meeting a young woman by the name of Clarisse McClellan, becomes disillusioned with the burning of books. Montag's life changes when a book falls into his possession and, needing to see what's in the tomes that are so forbidden, begins to read.As the book unfolds, Montag's metamorphosis is astounding. A pleased, fire-loving fireman becomes a curious reader and fledgling scholar, becomes a man determined to do something about the dangers of book-burning, no matter the cost.The book is not only a good book, an important book, but also a NECESSARY book, an IMPORTANT book, which I think everyone should read. I highly recommend Fahrenheit 451 and Lord of the Flies, both excellent and thought-provoking novels which will capture the interest of those willing to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's prophecy of a distant (or not so distant) future is essential reading in these times of self-censorship through the dumbing-down of the national dialogue. The story seems to peter out at the end, but as a plot device it succintly allows for the discussion of numerous topics that have 'come true', at least nearer to true than the time of the original publication. For instance, listen to Beatty's history of book-burning that encapsulates a media-saturation and political sensitivity (p. 54). Or perhaps you're intrigued by the dead-on Hubris Americana Montag bemoans in the post-war period (p. 74)? Faber's recollection of a Jesus before merchandising rings as a true indictment of the modern church (p. 81) - and his threefold explanation for the importance of books (quality of ideas, leisure to think, and freedom to act on the preceding two on p. 83) should be carefully considered by all of us as we rip through our reading lists. This book delivers an impact, and is well-worth the read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Not to be confused with fahrenheit 9/11, Fahrenheit 451 is the classic dystopian tale of rebbelion and the invasion of media in our private lives.It is the story of Montag, a fireman who burns books. He loves his job, until one day he meets Clarrisse. Clarrisse is a seventeen year old girl in love with life, in a society so desperate to escape life that it never notices its many wonders. In Montag's world, billboards have to be 200 feet long so that people will notice them. The walls of Montag's home have giant television screens that his wife spends all her time watching. The walls don't tell stories, they just give people feelings.Montag accepts all this until Clarrisse comes out of the blue to shed a new light on everything. She tells him about grass having dew on it in the morning, about the blue sky, and he changes. Slowly, but he does go through a change.Bradbury's writing has been accused by some reviewers as dull. I found his writing insightful, and very interesting. One of the many fascinating things about these amazon reviews is that there are large groups of people who find that the writing was too slow, completely disregarding how writing styles create mood. But amazon has created an environment where anyone can write their opinions. If you really want to know how good this book is, read both the best and worst reviews. Then, if you find that the good outweighs the bad, at least in your mind, then read the novel. Afterwards, you should try reading the reviews that are most contrary to your personal opinion.To reiterate, Breadbury is a genuine genius, he should be commended, this novel is a masterpiece, and you should check out the worst reviews for this book for further intellectual stimulation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Prior to reading the book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, I knew nothing about the book other than it was considered a classic by mane Some how I managed to work my way out of reading the book all through high school and it has always been on my list to read. So I decided to choose the book for our semester independent reading project, and I am glad I did.This science fiction novel expressed the natural occurring communism in a futuristic setting. Interestingly, the books setting could easily be believed to portray our world one hundred years ago. The reality of the book is somewhat depressing in that it actually is a lot closer to the truth than we would like to believe. Books have not been banned yet, but many schools across our country are not aloud to use certain classic novels in their teachings. And maybe we are not under a mind control because of the banning of books, however our sources for entertainment operate on mind control and there are ads for just about anything surrounding our lives.This novel does indeed deserve the literary merit I has received over the past years. The novel itself steers away from descriptive science fiction and into a more dreamy approach, which leaves more imagination on the readers' part. One of the overriding themes of novel is knowledge vs. Ignorance, which the main character Guy deals with the entire novel. He must decide whether to continue to read books and continue to gain knowledge, or to just be happy like everyone else and continue to be ignorant. Ray Bradbury's novel is quite intriguing and a very quick read. I recommend this book to everyone before entering the college level, for it is a classic which has been read for over 50 years."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was one of the best books I've ever read. I had to read it in high school and I'm glad for it. Bradbury's vision of the future is shockingly similar to our own society now. Sure we're not burning books, but many of us would prefer to be entertained by watching television than reading a book. This vision is also a future where censorship has replaced free press, shying the people about the disturbing world events taking place. Since this book was written in 1953, many would think that Bradbury's vision of this future would have been proven wrong over time but to this day school districts are banning certain books, such as this one, for what ideas they might express.This book is about a possible future where books are outlawed and firemen are given the job to set them ablaze. The story is centered on one particular fireman named Guy Montag who after meeting a seventeen year old girl and an old professor, decides to join the struggle to preserve books before they are wiped out forever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury has twisted imagination, fears, thoughts and a quick lesson together to capture our senses and keep us turning the pages!There is a certain depth to this book that is unreachable to anyone unless they are willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. Not only do the characters have feelings and thoughts; but all around the words are the feelings and sceneries that only the imagination can take in. What is actually shocking to realize is that our [country] is turning into exactly what this book says! No...were not burning books, but our entertainment and media has started controling our minds to thinking anything hard is not worth doing.Bradbury has taken all our thoughts and fears on the future and taken to writing them down into a book. Fascinating as it is, its only our fear that our society could actually turn into this nightmare."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a real page turner. It had a certain depth to it, one that could not be reached unless the reader was willing to dive beneath the surface to get it. It had so much information packed into a good adventure, it really taught [me] to appreciate the books we have today and that we can enjoy learning at the same time as finding the lesson taught inside it. Not many books have the same perspective as Fahrenheit 451. Not only did the main character have feelings that could be seen, but all around the words were different emotions and settings in them that made you feel like you were there, and it was so creatively written it made you think harder than most books normally do. Ray Bradbury knew what he was writing so well it flowed like thoughts, and he had the same thoughts as most of us do. But he kept them in these pages for us to read now and in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think the author wrote this book to tell people, who read this book, that it is necessary to bend or break rules once in a while. I agree because if you live your life always following the rules, and not making mistakes, you kind of get used to being perfect. You have to make mistakes and do something wrong once in a while. Break out of the shell and live your life curiously.I think Ray Bradbury handled setting the best because if you read this book correctly, you would figure out that the setting explains everything that happens. I love the way he uses bunches and bunches of personification, similes, metaphors, imagery and many other figurative languages.This book is science fiction. It's good because he uses so much imagery that you can literally see what the setting looked like and see what they were talking about. Some details in his book are for sure ficton but the way he described the government and the fire department is really, really unique. Ray Bradbury is an excellent author with a good imagination.I don't think the book is less than perfect because he makes the book reals and you wouldn't want to change something so realistic. I'm not saying that the setting is real, like today, but he tells you. No. He shows you how real the city is. Once you read it, you wouldn't want to change anything. I recommend this book if you love science fiction or fantasy books, you will fall in love with this book and the author."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am currently doing a research project for my sophomore project in my Honors English class. Part of the project is to read a book the author has written. My teacher told me about Fahrenheit 451 and told me that I should read this one. I didn't really know much about this book before she refered it to me. The opening page sucked me in and now that I have finished the book, it makes me wonder if society will ever turn out this way. It is amazing how Bradbury \\"predicts\\" the future with some of the events in his book. After reading this book I have so far brought the movie, and the movie The Martian Chronicles. I also want to read the book. For a teenager in high school who doesn't like to read, I'm hooked!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I taught \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" as the example of a dsytopian novel in my Science Fiction class, although it is certainly one of the most atypical of that particular type of narrative discourse. Compared to such heavyweight examples as George Orwell's \\"1984,\\" Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World,\\" Yevgeny Zamiatin's \\"We,\\" Ray Bradbury's imaginative meditation on censorship seems like light reading. But the delicious irony of a world in which firemen start fires remains postent and the idea of people memorizing books so they will be preserved for future generations is compelling. Of course, there have been more documented cases of \\"book burning,\\" albeit in less literal forms, since \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was first published in 1953, so an argument can be made that while all the public debate was over how close we were the Orwellian future envisioned in \\"1984,\\" it is Bradbury's little parable that may well be more realistic (especially in terms of the effects of television).The novel is based on a short story, \\"The Fireman,\\" that Bradbury published in \\"Galaxy Science Fiction\\" in 1951 and then expanded into \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" two years later. However, those who have studied Bradbury's writings caw trace key elements back to a 1948 story \\"Pillar of Fire\\" and the \\"Usher II\\" story from his 1950 work \\"The Martian Chronicles.\\" Beyond that, there is the historical record of the Nazis burning books in 1933. The story is of a future world in which everyone understands that books are for burning, along with the houses in which they were hidden. Guy Montage is a fireman who has been happy in his work for ten years, but suddenly finds himself asking questions when he meets a teenage girl and an old professor.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not only about censorship, but also about the inherent tension in advanced societies between knowledge and ignorance. Reading this novel again I am reminded about Pat Paulsen's editorial on the old \\"Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour\\" (a series well acquainted with the perils of censorship) about how we might enjoy freedom of speech in this country but we do not enjoy freedom of hearing because \\"there is always the danger of something being said.\\" Censorship, in practical terms, is the effort of those who do not want others to hear what they find offensive, for whatever reasons, basically because it leads to people thinking thoughts they do not want them to be thinking. Through the rambling diatribes of Captain Beatty, Bradbury makes this point quite clear to his readers.Even though this is essentially a novella, Bradbury's work retains the charm of a short story. The recurring use of animal imagery throughout the story, the use of the mythic ideas of the salamander and the phoenix, make \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" more poetic than any other dystopian work. Even if it is predominantly a one note argument regarding censorship, it is impossible to deny that Bradbury makes a clear and convincing case for his position. Besides, there is something to be said for any work that insures that beyond the point at which water freezes the only other recognizable number on the Fahrenheit scale is the point at which book paper starts to burn."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought about the rating of this book (for my taste personally) overnight. I really liked this book, but I felt cheated. Why isn't there more? I wished Ray Bradbury would have kept going with this book. The reason why I wanted more was because I wanted to know what else would happen with Montag when he returned to the ruined city.Ray Bradbury ushered many feelings when I read this book. I was scared of that Hound. I was angry at Millie's friends and Millie. I was kind of impatient with Clarisse. I was confused whenever Beatty was speaking. When it came to Montag, I thought he was not only &quot;foolish&quot;, but smart, too.This futuristic look of the world is quite imaginative, but it could be real. Fire fighters starting fires instead of putting them out. No one able to read without losing their livelihood. Living in the fear of war and dying without knowing a real reason why. Being caught in the world of visual entertainment that entails walls as televisions, and the weirdest part, people caring more about the television &quot;family&quot; more so than their own flesh and blood. It is a possible future, but one man's vision is not necessarily the truth of this world.I liked this book, but I just wished there was more.Joy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed many things while reading the novel Fahrenheit 451. I especially liked how the society that Ray Bradbury created was an exaggeration but this exaggeration was not so distorted that it seemed unrealistic. In the novel Bradbury states that its cars go normally 100 miles per hour, an every day thing for woman is to have an abortion, inside the peoples' homes there are television walls and he also describes other futuristic ways of life.There also were not really any emotions in the book, which was another part about the novel that I enjoyed. For instance, the way Guy felt about Clarisse. You knew throughout the entire novel the effects she had on him and she is thought about, but never really talked about. I liked how even though this novel was written about fifty years ago, you can see it the events that Mr. Bradford described happening to our society. It hits you right at home and Ray Bradbury does a good job of warning us what the future might possibly be like.Another thing I also enjoyed about the book was how fire was constantly used and how it was always used as destruction and bad thing until the end. Whenever Bradbury describes the camp fire that was warming and welcoming because the Montag escaped the society and met up with other people that wanted to bring books back. These people were around that campfire and it was not threatening or anything.There were very many good parts to this book, however there were also some parts of the novel that I did not particularly like. In the beginning of the novel, I think Ray Bradbury goes into too much detail with the description about Guy's pleasurable experiences while on the job. I do not feel that it is relevant to the novel for him to include such information. I think that it started out very slow. During the slow beginning, there was a lot of symbolism and allusions to literature in the novel. I was not very familiar with these uses of symbolism and allusions so I did not pick up on that particular part of the novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In Montag's world, firemen start fires rather than putting them out. The people in this society do not read books, enjoy nature, spend time by themselves, think independently, or have meaningful conversations. Instead, they drive very fast, watch excessive amounts of television on wall-size sets, and listen to the radio on &quot;Seashell Radio&quot; sets attached to their ears.Montag encounters a gentle seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan , who opens his eyes to the emptiness of his life with her innocently penetrating questions and her unusual love of people and nature. Over the next few days, Montag experiences a series of disturbing events. First, his wife, Mildred, attempts suicide by swallowing a bottle of sleeping pills. Then, when he responds to an alarm that an old woman has a stash of hidden literatur. The woman shocks him by choosing to be burned alive along with her books. A few days later, he hears that a speeding car has killed Clarisse.Montag's dissatisfaction with his life increases, and he begins to search for a solution in a stash of books that he has stolen from his own fires and hidden inside an air-conditioning vent. When Montag fails to show up for work, his fire chief, Beatty, pays a visit to his house. Beatty explains that it's normal for a fireman to go through a phase of wondering what books have to offer, and he delivers a dizzying monologue explaining how books came to be banned in the first place.According to Beatty, special-interest groups and other &quot;minorities&quot; objected to books that offended them. Soon, books all began to look the same, as writers tried to avoid offending anybody. This was not enough, however, and society, as a whole, decided to simply burn books rather than permit a conflicting opinion."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hello People,I thought that Fahrenheit 451 was a good book. I wouldn't say that it was the best book in the world but it was definetly a good book and you should read it. It isn't your average book that you're used to, it's a little diffrent. Bradbury writes really well and you can follow the story, but sometimes he would just say something and you would have no clue what he's talking about. So then you have to go back and read a couple pages just to figure out whats going on. But above all I would say that it is a good book and even though it's a little diffrent, it's good to give diffrent things a try. :)Peace-out and enjoy the book!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book Ray Bradbury, one of my favorite authors, did not become Nostradamus. His story did not account for the internet. Therefore, many of the political ideas simply won't appeal to the internet generation, where information is only a fingertip away.On the other hand there are valid points regarding the \\"opiates\\" of life. Unfortunately, when you are young you look at it and say \\"look at what they are doing to us\\", which is what our protagonist does. As you become wiser you begin to see that the statement is really \\"look at what we have done to ourselves\\", which is what he finally discovers when he joins the band of scholars.This is an all time classic, but the reverse is happening in our society. There is too much information and no filters/censorship. So we need to be more alert for misinformation and propaganda, than we have ever needed to before.Own the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a quality book. At the beginning of the book it was kind of boring but when it got close to the climax I couldn't put it down. It kept me on the edge of my seat. The story goes something like this. Guy Montage was a fireman and so was his dad, and his dad and so on. One day he met a 17 year old girl and talked to her about everything and that is when he started questioning himself and what he did. He burnt books for a living. Books that told our past and what we have learned. If we burn our past we will kept making the same mistakes we've already made. One day he took a book from the house they were burning down. Once he read it he felt that all the books should be saved and he revealed that he had about 20 books hide in the cieling. The government made it illegal to read and own books. Montage wanted to let the world know what was in the books and share the knowlege they possesed. He was going to get help from an old man who's books they have already burnt. His name was Faber. One day at the fire house they got a call in that a house had books in it. When they got there it was Montag's house and his wife was leaving him. They made him burn all his own books and possesions. When he was done he went and burned his boss and other work members with the fire torch. The fire department had a machanical dog that chased him. The dog had a neddle in its mouth and bit him in the leg but not enough that he couldn't get away and burn the dog as well. He ran around back and got his books that he had hide in the garden and ran to Fabers house. There he got some clothes and watched the pursuit on tv. They got a new dog and started tracking him down. He told Faber to burn everything he touched and spray down the side walk to get rid of his sent. He headed for the river and then jumped in and threw off the tracking team and the dog. They ended up putting the crime on some innocent guy that was just walking down the street. Montage got onto the bank and walked into the woods where he met some other outlaws like him- self. I realy liked the book toward the end and I thought that it was probably one of the best books I've ever read. The tension is unbearable and the catch phrases are great. If any body likes a good book that won't bore you this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In perhaps the bleakest outlook of what the future would be like, Ray Bradbury tells the world how the thinks the future will be. This is a very bleak book, with wars all to common, firemen burn books, not put out fires, and the world is in a horrible state of turmoil. There are no teachers in schools, children go to schools for days at a time, and parents don't care at all, and an accquaintence to the main charachter had her father arrested for being a pedestrian. Guy Montag (main charachter), a fireman for awhile, realizes something all to true when Clarrise, the accquaintance, asks him a simple question: &quot;Are you happy?&quot; Montag looks at the question as a joke, but soon realized the bleak truth that he is not happy at all, and his wife, Mildred, obviously doesn't even like him at all. After a woman decides to burn with her books with Montag watching, even lighting the match herself, Montag thinks that books must have something true to offer Through all the experiences he has in these events, he begins to read, which in this book is a punishable offense. The books truly do open his life up to newer situations and great works, until one day his boss finds out Montag's secret.In great sense of irony, Ray Bradbury actually made some true predictions, even the microwave oven. Most of this book, however, is inaccurate with the future. Too bad, because other countries sadly do hate us. Wars, however, are far less common than this book has predicted. Other than that, this book is just too real, and recommended to both teenagers and adults."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. Bradbury's prose is direct but beautiful, full of sylistic twists that enhance the reading experience greatly. The story moves quickly, and the brisk pacing is expertly handled, never leaving the reader minutely bored. At under 200 pages, the length is perfect for the story, yet delivers its haunting message about censorship, superficiality, and the dumbing down of America with force without ever becoming preachy. Truly a magnificent accomplishment and should be required reading for everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a disappointing book for a reader who is not an avid science fiction lover. This book is very difficult to read. The correctors a sometimes very confusing to understand. The setting is also very hard to have a visual picture. Although the plot is very good the way that it is described is hard to understand. I think if you are a science fiction lover that you would like this book. But if you sometimes like to read science fiction you will not like this because you have to be a huge science fiction lover to like this. I also think you need to be above the 6th grade or a very advanced reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is about a time so far ahead in history that humans have decided that books are evil. and they are banned. people live very superficial lives. the book, as i remember, i read it like years ago, follows this one guy who starts to think that maybe all this anti-book is wrong. he finds a group of people that had all the classics memorized, each book one person. i was amazed to see how the author had chosen to protect the written world, he brought it back to spoken stories. this book was great. it really brings you to a time where everything u believe in is thought to be wrong. strange thought huh? :) i enjoyed this book a lot. happy reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Throughout \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" I had a mixture of feelings running through my head. For the most part, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone that enjoys futuristic novels. However, there were a few parts that I disliked and would like to tell anyone about before they read it.The beginning of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" starts very suddenly. The author sticks you right in the middle of the story it seems. I very much disliked how the book started for this reason and this reason only. I felt as if I started reading the book in the middle and missed the introduction of what was going on and whom everyone was. The only positive side of this abrupt start to the book is that it definitely doesn't start out slow. This made the book a pretty easy read.The only other parts that I didn't like so much were the ending, and the character Mildred, Montag's wife. I didn't like Mildred very much because she just seemed like a shady character. When the book started off by her trying to commit suicide, that event turned my sympathy for her away. I just think that there should have been more background or more to the story line that had to do with her seeing as how she was the main character's wife. Then, there was the ending. I really didn't like how this ended because, like in the beginning, I felt like it just ended. The story, to me, had not quite been finished yet.Finally, the main parts that I enjoyed throughout the book! The main reason this book interested me was because I had heard such great things about it. My favorite part was the way the setting was created. Originally written as a futuristic novel, Ray Bradbury was putting his ideas of how the future, or what is now present day, would be like. I also liked how easy it was to read. I love it when books get more interesting the further in you read, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is definitely one of them. I also enjoyed seeing where Montag's plan would lead him next or what it would cause him to do."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 five years ago, having bought it as an introduction to a book club, and to this day I can't remember any of the other books I bought with Fahrenheit 451, only this one magical book. Ray Bradbury is well-known as a sci-fi author, and even as a legend in literature, and I'm a believer that 451 is his best. It's subtitle describes perfectly the premise of the story: \\"The tempature at which book paper catches fire and burns...\\"It is a haunting book, filled with strange machinery that you realize during your reading you'd hate to see invented. For those of you who love books like me or even the American Constitution, this book will have extra meaning, as it's about censorship to the extreme. In fact, Fahrenheit 451 would be one of the books burned first had it been in this book. Another aspect of this novel is its description of a human's need to preserve our freedoms, and the drastic ways in which this is done. Imagine, human books.This book is relavent to today's world, as some censorship is slowly leaking into our society. A very important read indeed, and I'd recommend it not only as a sci-fi classic but also as an American classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent read, thrilling and provocative. Bradbury has a gift for descriptions, and he makes a wonderful story even better through his use of language. A future civilization has banned books, and it's the firemen's job to burn any books people have hidden, and the houses in which they are concealed. Guy Montag is a fireman who has done his job for ten years, never questioning the pleasure of seeing books burned and consumed by flames. Then he meets a girl who shows him that life is not all burning and speeding. She shows him that if you take the time, life has a deeper meaning. He begins to question the burning of all the books he never had time to read and understand. He is driven by a madness to find out what the books say. Unfortunately, he'll have to break a few laws and give up the life which he's lived for so long. He has to make a choice between the illegal life he never knew and the ignorant life as a fireman."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having first heard of Bradbury after reading The Martian Chronicles, I immediately fell in love with his writing and was itching to read Fahrenheit since I had heard so many good things about it.The brilliant novel was better than I thought. What took me the most was the sheer realism of such a strange world. I could feel the pain and fear the characters endured throughout the story as the infamous \\"burning of books\\" took lives and houses. I really got the sense that books were as taboo (let alone illegal) as narcotics are today.The edition I read included an afterward by Bradbury reflecting upon his own story after about 20 years. I was impressed that he felt that he wouldn't have changed much if he had the chance. This was but another bulletpoint in my list of reasons to have such high respect for this acclaimed author. Fahrenheit 451 was a fantastic read and I encourage everyone to read it, especially sci-fi fans and librarians :)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a book I had always meant to read - so when a 16 yr old I know had to read it for class I read it too.

While this author has some problems with his interpretation of our society as seen from his point of view 50 years ago, his language, full of metaphors, couldn't be more beautiful.

Consequently, Ray Bradbury is my favorite author. His style of writing is so captivating. I would, however, say that this book seems to me to be an acquired taste. I LOVE it, but a few of my friends don't like it at all. I think you need to have a certain maturity to read it. When my stepdad first introduced it to me, I was probably still in middle school. I gave up on it after reading the first 20 or so pages--I just didn't get it. A few years later, I picked it up again, understood every word and idea, and loved it!I recommend this book to friends and many of them say, \\"Oh, that book? It's so weird.\\" But you'd be surprised; when you read it, it's almost like looking into a mirror of our world's future. It really makes you think--is this where we're headed?Buy it. I can't guarantee you'll like it the first time you read it, but give it a chance. If you want great literature, this is it! And check out some other Ray Bradbury books and short stories too; I highly recommend them!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a must-read book in many ways. Written in 1953, the author was able to predict (in some fashion) the coming of Cable TV, personal music devices, and non-stop urban violence. Bradbury was a prophet.The object of Bradbury's wrath is intellectual sloth, which, left unchecked, results in censorship and a barbarous society where everyone acts on impulse. The author does not merely elevate the importance of books while trashing the influence of media: he elevates the importance of ideas, of thought. Bradbury condemns careless reading as easily as he condemns mindless television. Nor does he find electronic media to be useless: Bradbury's Professor Faber admits that film, music and television can make important contributions to society, when the individual films, songs and programs convey coherant ideas. The Clarisse character further emphasizes the importance of ideas by exploring the arts of conversation and observation.This is an excellent book which defines education, and shows the consequences of an uneducated society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a 190 page, high action novel, written by Ray Bradbury. The plot is about a man named Guy Montag, who is a Fireman. Only in his days, firemen aren't the same as they are now. This book is set in the future, and Montag didn't fight fires, he started them. He lives in days where books are prohibited. The government and the media control everything and everybody. People aren't allowed to read so that they can't be smart and don't know reality. Everybody in his society owns a parlor. A parlor is a huge TV that covers an entire wall of a house. Montag has a wife named Mildred, who lets the parlor get the best of her. At first, Montag loved his job and actually got joy out of watching books burn. His job takes a big turn after watching an elderly woman burn in her house for her books. He also took a book from her house and asks an old friend to help him come up with a plan to eliminate the firemen. I would recommend this book to anybody that likes action, and likes a little challenge in his or her reading.Ray Bradbury has great characterization for each character. Montag is definitely the protagonist is this story because he understands what is wrong, and he wants to fix it so that nobody else is hurt from these firemen. The antagonists are the firemen and the government. The government is what created this illiterate, controlled society, and the firemen are what keep it like this. The great characterization helps the reader a lot, because when new names are mentioned, you're not clueless on whom they are. You know a little background on everybody and their relationship to the main character, Montag.I think the theme of the book is: \\" Even if it's just you against the world, always fight for what is right.\\" This is the theme because others are afraid to stand up to authority, but Montag isn't because he knows his good cause. He realized he was wrong for so long, and he then chose the right side; and he' willing to fight for the people that are scared to.The language is very understandable. The author does use figurative language so the story is more intriguing. He uses great imagery to explain different settings people, and things. The author's language and style are very effective because while reading, you can actually visualize everything going on. The author's style is unique because his descriptions are like no other. His words allow the reader to actually experience what Montag does, which is what makes the story so rich.The point of view changes from time to time. At times it is told in third person with dialogue, and at others, it is in first person. It's great to have different point of views because you get different perspectives on situations. When told in first person, advantages are you know Montag's feelings and thoughts. When it is in third person, you get a full overview. The tone also changes. It can be emotional or very action filled. When Montag expresses himself the tone gets emotional and calmer, but when there's lots of commotion it gets more hectic and dramatic.The story's conflict is with Montag and his surroundings. The type of conflict is person vs. society. The plot definitely thoroughly explains the conflict with background on how it started, and possible resolutions.Fahrenheit 451 is a great novel to read. It teaches us how lucky we are to have freedom in what we want to do. It also shows people that are very kept to themselves, to rise and let their voices be heard. It also helps us appreciate books more and embrace our intelligence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"of the future (and, boy, is it *not* pretty!).For all Americans' talk about how they don't trust anything they see on TV, they sure do parrot what they see as fact time and again: They talk about characters in soap operas as if they were real family members (like the \\"families\\" of the parlor walls in the book), they trust what Fox News throws out as fact every day of the week (shades of the book, again), and things have improved so much in this country that years ago there had to be an entire cable channel created to accomodate the insatiable appetite for 24/7 celebrity news.Oh, how Ray Bradbury was a visionary way back in 1953.Upon television's advent in the late-1940's and increasing popularity in the 1950's, it was often referred to as the \\"boob tube\\" and that would be a vast understatement nowadays. I think it's pretty much safe to say that the tube's executives have run out of fresh, original ideas, hence the bombardment of mindless \\"reality\\" TV shows (where everything is, surprise, scripted). Americans also think it's perfectly fine for these televangelists to scream about what a bunch of losers we are but if we fork up thousands of dollars to them, we'll be saved. (That's gotten so out of control that there are a few cable channels devoted to that junk.)And now we're back to mindless soap operas such as \\"Desperate Housewives.\\" The cycle of mindlessness just goes on and on.I read the 50th anniversary edition of Fahrenheit 451 and at the very end of the book, someone conducted an interview with Bradbury who said that there are no forms of censorship in this country because, \\"We have too many groups for censorship to be possible.\\"The reality is the exact opposite.The majority of these \\"groups\\" actively encourage censorship when what's being said either affects their agenda or when they just plain don't like the statement. Too bad the interviewer didn't ask Ray to explain the recent record/cd crushings (today's answer to burning) of Sinead O'Connor or the Dixie Chicks (these happening in the past 15 years alone), when they made statements that certain groups didn't like.The worst example of censorship is happening everyday right in front of our faces with the Iraq \\"war,\\" where the puppets in the US media say whatever the Pentagon instructs them to say. Want to get the truth about what's going on over there? You'll have to tune in to international news outlets. But do that before Bush appoints his right-wing friends on the board of PBS to stop the BBC World News and other international news from being shown over here.Finally, there are a few things that were written way back in 1953 but which have turned into proof-positive fact in America 2005. Coming from the character of Fire Chief Beatty:Page 60: \\"The home environment can undo a lot you try to do at school. That's why we've lowered the kindergarten age year after year until now we're almost snatching them from the cradle.\\" Translation: A child is to be incorporated into a mass consumer from birth, not because the country's power structure want your children to be smarter.Page 61: \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs or the names of state capitals or how much corn Iowa grew last year. Cram them full of noncombustible data, chock them so damned full of 'facts' they feel stuffed, but absolutely 'brilliant' with information. Then they'll feel they're thinking, they'll get a *sense* of motion without moving. And they'll be happy, because facts of that sort don't change. Don't give them any slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy.\\"Hey, Beatty, you forgot political science."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book it self is ok but sometimes in gets a bit weird, ray bradbury did a good job at predicting &quot;hearing seashells&quot; when he wrote this book in 1950's"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm in the process of re-reading 451.

So much more than a cry against censorship, this book is a rallying cry for us to wake up and see what is happening all around us. From the video walls to the relationships of children and parents, Bradbury is eerily prophetic in his predictions. I can see why some readers today would feel uncomfortable with this book; the truth not only hurts, but sometimes it can be downright damning.P.S. This is not a young adult book. The levels of symbolism and prophecy make this a read much more appropriate to an older, more mature audence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Anyone who thinks that this book is boring and has no value, should simply watch TV. Bradbury wonderfully paints the picture of a utopian society, in which the cosmopolitan population is &quot;protected&quot; from books which may spawn independent thought.

Easily one of the best science fiction novels of all time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recently read this remarkable novel and felt that the other commentaries were correct in stating that regardless of cowardly, bitchy, and psyco immigrants we should not censor ANYTHING just because they are offended.

As you read the book many similarities can be seen today, such as large billboards, people not talking to each other, a society dependent on drugs and entertainment and reality TV shows and of course the rushing around in a rat race.Whats amazing is that Ray Bradbury wrote this book in 1953 some 50 plus years ago and unlike the book 1984 written by George Orwell this book is ignored by the media and pessimists of todays society and our future.For those you like science fiction with a large dose of reality please read this book before you die from drinking the Kool-Aid."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was very much looking forward to reading this book, a good friend has been recommending it for some time. I must say that it took me a little longer than I thought it would to read. The language for me was little hard to follow at times. Some of it was so chopped up that I would have to go back and reread the page over to try and understand the message of that page.I thought that the themes themselves were very prevalent to our day. I am finding that more and more that children are unwilling to read and want to play video games or go on the internet. The idea of how books are slowing being eradicated is spot on in current events. I really liked the message of how knowledge will set you free, and the good, and bad that can come from it. (As the snake said to eve, you will be like a God.) I also liked his idea of the TV walls and how it clouds the mind with loud noises and bright colors. I found that to be very interesting, especially with the outburst of 42\\" TVs and all the crave for the latest gadgets. I find it very ironic that Amazon is out with their new product Kindle. No offense to them but I do not support that item.One thing that I did notice was that as I was reading it reminded me a lot of \\"The Giver\\" by Louis Lowery. I know that The Giver was written afterword but I actually liked that book more that his. I also understand that it was more meant for children, but think that the ideas presented in her book, almost paralleling Bradbury's book, were very well written and thought out. I also thought that her book was simply just a little more easy to read.Either way, this still was an excellent book, with a lot of different issues that I think have a love of prevalence in our current status. If you liked Bradbury's book, I would greatly recommend The Giver."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Good read!The most amazing part of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is that it was first written in 1950.

Some of the writing in the book, I found to be difficult to grasp. Alot of intense dialogue between the main characters, several times, I wasn't quite sure who was talking to who.Overall, a very good book, I look forward to reading some of Ray Bradbury's other classics!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451. 451 is the temperature at which paper burns. How did we find this out? Learning, and with learning comes books, and according to this story with books comes burning. This story follows one man, one guy actually. Guy Montag is a fireman. However not the definition of fireman of which you think. This is a world where the past is burnt and all is forgotten and minorities are eliminated. Books are for burning and your family is all on a T.V. wall. People die and nobody cares. Nothing matters as long as people are happy. Houses are fireproof and books are the exact opposite. I really liked this book. Bradbury's book shows our own flaws as well as those to come. Montag's fire captain, Beatty, tells him how the firemen got started, \\"\`Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to popular songs [1] or the name of state capitals [2] or how much corn Iowa grew last year [3].'\\" We have all of the game shows. 1. Don't forget the lyrics. 2. Are you Smarter than a 5th Grader. 3. Jeopardy. This book was written in the 50's. Over 50 years later (almost 60), this is beginning to form. I hope that this does not happen. For if it does, who knows what we will lose next. Will it be our real families? Our front porches? Our books? Our identity? This book is very controversial. It's ironic that every one in this book is anti controversial and don't ask questions and yet this book brings up so many questions. It also makes you question yourself and what you think. With all of this technology being brought into our world, we're not against it but we don't hate it. With all of the new innovations by the time we buy something it's already obsolete. When you buy a computer in a few weeks they all ready have an updated version. Sometime its just nice to stop and smell the roses.

Did it freak you out?\\" And yet, is the \\"Farenheit 451\\" of our cultural stereotype all that accurate? Yes, Bradbury's world is a distressing one, but the story itself is, in the end, about perserverance, about the human love of knowledge, and about how a group of people lives to fight against a world that doesn't want to know. As Montag, or \\"Ecclesiastes,\\" discovers, there are still things worth fighting for. And while we may cringe every time a Chesterton slides into the incinerator, the true meaning of the book lies in Montag's determination to save some knowledge from that incinerator.Is it a distressing setting? Yes, of course. As some of the other reviewers have said, that often is because it's far closer to the truth than we would like. But, of course, that's the reason Bradbury wrote the book. But under all that is a story of hope; a story that, if we dig just deep enough, can empower us to face the danger and the distress and to let us prevent \\"Farenheit 451\\" from being a nonfiction book.So the one thing you should know if you're not sure you want to read \\"451\\" is that it's not \\"A Clockwork Orange.\\" Not by a long shot. In the end--and with Bradbury's writing, you will get there fast--it is a distressing world, but a heartwarming story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I chose to read Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" for a High School Book Report. I thought the fact that so many of the ideas portrayed in the book by Bradbury are still very relevant today was fascinating. The book was published in the 1950's, yet Bradbury's ideas about the influence of of media and its effect on society are evident today. Society as a whole has had its general thought process effected (to some extent at least) by the media with ideas portrayed in ad campaigns or television shows, which make decisions for you instead of letting you develop some of these ideas on your own.Another theme that the book does well is representing the effect of censorship on society. The protagonist of the story, Guy Montag, begins the book oblivious of his own ignorance towards the world around him, not changing until a thoughtful teenage girl (Clarisse) causes him to question why everything is the way it is. These questions lead Montag down a path to enlightenment in which Montag discovers the reality of an unaware society. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" does a superb job of displaying the harmful effects censorship can cause: a society of robotic citizens who find ignorance more attractive than actually exploring life.Another reason I enjoyed reading this book was the fact it was very thoughtful and left a lot of different ideas open for interpretation. The book did seem a little bit dry at times, but it was not a bad transition because it allowed for time to interpret a few of the many ideas presented in the novel. I thought that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was an excellent read and I would happily recommend it to anybody who enjoys something more meaningful and thoughtful than an average novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is another author, like George Orwell who has the ability to see the a possible future and present it in a way that appears to be a time in the life of an individual character, as well as surrounding characters who are experiencing the same world.

In this futuristic, dystopian universe houses are fireproof and firefighters burn books. Books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable facts, however most people are too caught up with their wall-to-wall TVs and fast cars for the thought of reading to even cross their minds. Montag loves to burn and thinks he is happy with his life until he meets a girl who thinks about the world in her own way and a professor who remembers when books were treasured rather than banned. The story follows Montag as he slowly comes to realize how he really feels about the world he lives in.Fahrenheit 451 explores deep ideas about human nature, censorship, and the balance between knowledge and comfort. The most disturbing thing about this book is how close Bradbury was to our life today. Almost 50 years ago, he imagined things similar to cell phone earpieces, big screen TVs, and super highways. Other things are exactly like today: constant advertising, mindless entertainment, an endless war that most people forget about, and political correctness restricting peoples' speech. In the world of Fahrenheit 451, books have been banned because they make people think uncomfortable thoughts.This compelling book is a quick, but by no means light, read. Bold, artistic language and a fast-paced storyline makes Farhenheit 451 seem less like a vehicle for a sermon, and more like a window through which one can view a different but eerily similar world. His word choice and use of imagery creates a surreal feeling throughout the book, forcing the reader toAs good as Bradbury is at description and ideas, I felt that many of the characters were fairly one-sided and seemed to only exist to spew out speeches about differing points of view. I found it hard to relate to them, and didn't sympathize with them at all. However, part of Bradbury's point is that in this world human relationships aren't valued. Perhaps the character under-development was done on purpose to force the reader more into the mindset of the time.Overall, this book was thought-provoking and beautifully written. Its overarching message of individuality vs. comfort is just applicable to today's world as it was 50 years ago when the book was written. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to think more critically about the world in which we live in."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Farenheit 451' is rightly deserved to considered a classic much on the order of the works by George Orwell. Written almost sixty years ago, 'Farenheit 451' brilliantly and concisely captures the overall demise of society through the \\"dumbing down\\" of people by the media and socialist-leaning government. People become automatons, unwilling to think or feel pain. Books become the enemy because they speak of reality and pain. So in 'Farenheit 451' the government outlaws all books, and \\"firemen\\" become government backed literary arsonists. However the author brings us hope in the form of the lead character, a fireman himself, who begins to think for himself and crosses over to another world (figuratively speaking :-)). His life rapidly unravels and transforms.I suppose my only quibble with 'Farenheit 451' is that it somewhat overloads the story with a sub-story of a world war about to begin. I'm not sure why the author introduces such a distraction other than to tell the reader \\"hey, none of the citizens care about the war because they are too brainwashed from the government and media\\". I think \\"Farenheit 451\\" could have been just a little better without such silliness.Bottom line: a near perfect read. Strongly recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book tells an intriguing and dystopic anecdote about.....books. It is thought provoking, and evocative. Every person should read this book, and think not of the absurdity of premise, but of the unfortunate parallels one sees."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It'd been a couple decades since I last read this book when I picked it up again recently. It has held up well over this time span. This is a fable, a warning of an era where free thought is squashed.The world of Farenheit 451 is an unpleasant place. Although nominally a democracy, the people elect only who they are told to; war is a constant threat and the general populace is kept in a state of blissful ignorance. The only books that remain are dry manuals and rulebooks.Guy Montag, the principal character, slowly becomes aware that there is more to existence than the narrow life that he has lived. As he awakens to this new world, other cracks in the old regime become evident, most obviously with the number of suicides that are taking place. Even if this dictatorship is weakening, it is far from dead, and as Guy begins to explore the world of books and free thought, he puts his life in danger.Although written in the 1950s when television was just beginning, this novel seems to predict an era when TV has essentially replaced reading; fortunately, despite the dominance of television in today's world, books are far from out of fashion. Although not an altogether happy novel, this book is generally optimistic in that it shows how difficult it is to truly contain the human spirit. If it is not 100% realistic, it need not be; as stated before, this is a fable, and a classic in not only science fiction, but literature in general."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to believe this little book by the famed Ray Bradbury has been around for about fifty years. I remember kids talking about this book just a few years ago when I was in high school and remember thinking it was some great new work of sci-fi. With all the changes in our society and culture the past few years (from the Internet to digital television), FAHRENHEIT 451 is more significant today than it was forty years ago.The plot of the story is simple. Guy Montag is a fireman. However, in the future, instead of putting out fires, fireman start them. Guy burns books and he enjoys doing it. Books are illegal to own and most people spend their free time (and they have lots of it) driving their cars (at speeds of over 120 mph) or listening to the wall-sized televisions that have become their family. One day Guy meets a strange girl who sets a fancy to his heart. His meeting with her allows him to open up and begin to see the truth.The story is simple, but it is what the story says about our society that is so significant. We are told by the story's antagonist that things changed because the country became divided by factions of every sort and people no longer cared about the knowledge books contained. Reading forces people to think and thinking is bad because it forces you to consider others and when you only care about yourself, how can you think about someone else? In our modern American society where many people label themselves with as many hypens as possible, where lives are literally being played out on television, and where violence is becoming more and more the norm; the issues raised in FAHRENHEIT 451 need to be discussed more than ever."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury's frightening vision of the future, firemen don't put fires out; they start them to burn books. In Bradbury's fictional world, it is better not to know or find out anything because if you know too much, you could be in danger. This book is closely related to the book 1984 by George Orwell because you can be put to death for simple things like writing in a diary. In Fahrenheit 451, you can have your house burned down and go to jail for the rest of your life if you are caught with books because reading for pleasure is against the law. The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who burns books for a living. He sees his wife sit at home everday with the \\"family\\" who is actually just a television that surrounds the walls, when he starts to question his life. Why are books burned? Why are they so destructive to society? He makes the decision to change his life, risk everything he's worked for and discover what it is that books contain. Montag starts secretly hiding books in his house and reading them at any opportunity he gets. He learns that there is a whole world inside of books that he never knew existed. He tries to tell his wife about this and how books are so important but instead of agreeing, she turns him in to the police. After this incident, Montag's house is burned down and he is confronted by the police chief, Captain Beatty, and has to decide what he is going to do. Although this book was published back in 1953, the idea of firemen getting paid for burning books seems very real. These ideas make you think that maybe someday this could happen. Fahrenheit 451 is a book for ages 13 and up. The incredible descriptions of books burning,along with houses and the mechanical dog are very realistic. I thought this book was good because of the descriptions, you felt like a part of the book and it made you want to keep reading. I would recommene this book to any and everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This wonderfully written science Fiction book is a thought provoking and has two very good qualities. First of all, with Fahrenheit 451 you must read between the lines to find out what Bradbury is really saying. Not only is Bradbury writing a wonderfully twisted novel, but, to me, he is also saying that people are afraid of new or interesting ideas and, since books are full of them, these people will burn the books to put an end to ideas that may cause trouble for \\"society.\\" Of course, as with all of Bradbury's books, it is open to interpretation because of its weird and different look at life and some of life's hard facts. Bradbury's characters have been created with a depth that creates a realistic quality. This depth makes you want to know them, yet, in a way, you feel that you already do. We follow Guy Montag through his insanity knowing he is not insane, it's the rest of his world that is nuts. We grieve when his friend Clarisse McClellan dies because she is more in touch with reality than anyone else is. In all, this great book wraps you up in its story of everyday life in the future, with all its twists and turns. In other words, don't burn this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Depending on who you are, there are different messages provided in this book. To a reader in the 50's, this book may just seem like a chilling, futuristic novel. More can be seen by the modern reader because the actual science fiction portion of the book is less distracting. All of the devices described in the book we either already have, or now know are impossible to create within this new century. For example, the interactive &quot;family&quot; Millie was so involved in could be around any day now to consume our loved ones. The mechanical hound, on the other hand, won't be. When the creativity and dazzling ideas of the &quot;future&quot; are lost, the morals and messages become more defined. Bradbury was probably more accurate than he would have ever thought, as we move towards a more lazy America. Some of these messages seem more religious then anything else. They inspire to take advantage of the moment, and be thankful for what we have been provided. No matter how advanced we become, nothing will replace picnics and family values. Although these things have deteriorated over time thanks to technology, they should always be practiced if only for tradition"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Firemen no longer save lives. Instead they burn books and the people who harbor them. Censorship is the way of life in the science fiction world of Fahrenheit 451. Conforming with government, destroying individuality, and asking no questions are the rules of Guy Montag's world. Set in the twenty-first century, Ray Bradbury's novel tells the tale of the fireman who begins to question the rights and wrongs of his life. In this world books promote thinking and wondering and acting. Compliance is necessary for the government to ignore its people and watch over its \\"thirty-second\\" wars. The government wants assimilation and ignorance of differences. So modern technology produces television that is interactive and family rooms are replaced with television parlors - four walls of larger than life TV screens. The firemen hunt out owners of books and burn them, their homes and their books to the ground. \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" is the opening line of the story. In the beginning burning books is a source of joy, an excitement programmed into Montag by his world. Then he meets a girl whose family raised her with an encouragement of challenging what she is told. Montag is amazed, almost scared of the idea of questioning life. She begins to question him too. \\"'Do you ever read any of the books you burn?' \`Is it true that long ago firemen put out fires instead of going to start them?' and the worst of all, \`Are you happy?'\\" And there begins Montag's conflict with the government and with himself. When he reads a line of a book he realizes that there is no turning back. He can't be who he was before. And maybe he doesn't want to be. The book is set up as a narrative of one man's experience in trying to rebel against a world that has almost complete control. It is written partly as a typical novel and partly as a sequence of Montag's thoughts. The plot is hard to follow in places and often confusing but the idea behind the story is important enough to make reading the book worthwhile. Bradbury attempts to warn us of what the future may hold that we might prevent the beginning of a world of tyranny. He tells us to remember and cherish the attributes that make us who we are. He teaches us to be an individual and challenge the world around us. Although I did not enjoy the novel, because of the confusion, its message is very important if I want a world where what I think and say is important. A world in where I am a person with rights and opinions that are as valued as any other person's. I do want that world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is a crime that the literary world views SF as nothing more than a second class citizen. This book is, without a doubt, one of the greatest works of fiction of the 20th Century. Because, however, it is also a classic of SF it is not considered to be noteworthy in that regard. Bradbury's prose can be compared to a surrealist painting. While the plot may seem straight forward, there is so much else to be seen and to know within the story. Definately, this is a book that any self respecting SF fan should be able to say that they have read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book can be summed up in one word: Magnanimous, in other words: Great! Everyone needs to read this novel, it's an essay about war, *censorship*, love, and philosophy. It will test your mind with tribunal, dysitopic, epic thoughts that will not leave you for your entire life. Now, I will address different readers to how they will like the book. For the devoted sci-fi fan (who for some reason hasn't read this book...): This book contains scenes which are inummerable and subjective to your thoughts, images which are astounding considering the day in age written. Mechanical hounds, massive bombers, wall size televisions, nuclear war, all of it is contained here.For the Owellian/Huxley dystopian fan: This book contains issues of censorhip that these days are beginning to ring true. Poems are regarded as sad thoughts that make people angry. Your spirit will be lifted as the protaganist, Guy Montag, views a woman commit suicide after seeing her books burn. You get to feel for the characters and their actions, and you will love the ending.For the cheap sci-fi fan who just wants wanton acion and adventure: Sorry pal, don't look to this book for action. There is some, but not too much, however, go ahead and do yourself a favor, read the book.For the non sci-fi reader: I don't know how you came across this book, probably through recommendation or assignent. However daftly you view this spectacular book, be prepared to enjoy it. This is a book that will stay in your mind.To anyone: Take heed this book, times might become too true for comfort someday...."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When in 8th grade I had to read this for school, the first thought that came to mind was &quot;Oh boy, another dull, uninteresting novel to add on to all the rest.&quot; Little did I know that Farenheit 451 would come to become one of my favorite books ever. I didn't even need a teacher to tell me what Bradbury was trying to say. That is the strength of his message. When we finished discussing the book in class, I even went out and bought it. Not only is this book exciting, but it is thought provoking as well. If I had my way, I would have this novel, 1984 by Orwell, and Brave New World by Huxley stressed in school far more than the meaningless stories that children have to read. A better understanding of these novels could change the world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is perhaps among the greatest books on censorship ever written. At times, it may seem heavyhanded in its approach, and the action, as some reviewers have pointed out may seem a little farfetched. Indeed, who can imagine firemen dousing homes in kerosene and setting them ablaze? But this is not where the value of the book lies. Its value lies in the warning about the type of society we may become, and perhaps already have. A society where serious thought, questioning, and insight are little valued for fear of causing societal unhappiness and where people coast along in life fed by a constant stream of meaningless and useless information via television, unchallenged in their concepts of life by thoughts that may trouble them.We have now in our society a movement - political correctness - that is dominant on college campuses, a movement that seeks as its ultimate goal the suppression of any thought or idea that may in the least be offensive to another individual or group. In Fahrenheit 451 Fire Captain Beatty explains how Bradbury's society of the future came to burn books. Minorities of every stripe complained about how they were portrayed in this book or that book, tearing out page by page those sections that were offensive until the day when the &quot;libraries were shut and minds closed forever.&quot;There are further fewer active readers in American society today than 50 years ago. The great majority of Americans now have their worldview filtered to them through television, and children are raised on the offerings of mass entertainment from Disney and MTV. It is entertaining sometimes, but it is not the stuff of life. Fahrenheit 451 is indeed a prescient and frightening warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 tells about a future United States. Keep in mind, this was written some 40 years ago, but his predictions can be alarmingly accurate. Montag's society's obsession with t.v. is frighteningly prophetic, as is the obsession with dieting. Also, has anyone ever thought of the similarities between the recently popular laser-light shows and the White Clown show? I must say that the most frightening part of this novel is how everything begins to move faster and the thoughts of the individual are lost - something I see happening in today's society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first it takes a while for one to understand the setting, but once it gets going this book just doesn't stop! An action-packed novel with a beautiful ending. Quite possibly Ray Bradbury's greatest piece of Literatue! Hands down this is one of the best books ever written. I think siskel and ebert said it best when they said, &quot;Two Thumbs Up!&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"OK... I absolutely love Ray Bradbury and every single one of his books! I read &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; and &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; and thoroughly enjoyed them both. &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; only bolsters my love for his books. First of all, his writing is CLEAR! It's none of this wordy, incomprehensible Charles Dickens or wimpy, disgustingly melodramatic James Herriot. Bradbury gets straight to the point without dilly-dallying and remains extremely entertaining throughout. When I say he's entertaining, I don't mean that this book is a comedy. Far from it. The censorship issues brought up by the book-burning is a very serious topic. However, Bradbury's masterful words make it truly enjoyable to read. I couldn't put it down until I was done. A must-read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading all these reviews it seems as though many people, and I dont mean to offend anyone, have become too preoccupied with the need for every book that is part of the sci-fi genre to adhere to some sort of science base and to have a plot that could conceivably happen. Literature and sci-fi in particular should be the exploration of ideas, encouraging some form of though amongst its readers. The situation create in the novel is perhaps not plausible, but it is merely an exagerrated form of our world today and what it may become more like. To think it ever could become so bare is indeed unlikely, but the need to be aware of the trend is there, hence the book is there.The plot too may be lacking, and I sometimes found the writers prose clunky and disjointed. This can be explained by the short period of time in which the book was written and the fact that in general it is written as such to convey the turmoil the central charcter is feeling when his entire world suddenly seems to lack any meaning or purpose.I would recommend this bok to anyone who can be bothered to think about a book as they read it. It is not the easily accesible thrillers that fill the bestseller lists, John Grisham et al, but it is abook that is both chilling in its prediction and thought provoking.The only criticism would be that the story may have worked better as a short-story and Ray Bradbury's proseis better suited to the shorter form.ps Anyone who found the book boring and the setting devoid of life and colour. Could that not have been deliberate. What if the world was really like that. How boring."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for a history class to get and idea of what world war II was like.

That's why I had trouble understanding the plot. All of Ray Bradbury's books do that to me. And even though I'm only 13, I love to read. I read Watership Down in 1 day, and loved it. There's just something about Mr. Bradbury's writing style that makes his books hard to read. It's the language that confuses me. This book could have been good if the language had more clarity. It has an inventive, thought-provoking storyline. TV might actually be taking over our lives.

The technology used in the the book is amazing, considering that Bradbury wrote it in 1953. Yet I wonder why he didn't use computers in the story. . . If anyone has any ideas, please e-mail me. Anyway, at first I hated the fact that nothing had a definite conclusion. Also, you never know if the &quot;book people's&quot; goal was successful. What happens? Even before the book begins, there are several questions that remain unanswered. At first I hated this, but I enjoy the lack of conclusion now because of the oppurtunity to imagine.Overall, it was a great book, even for a 10th grader who hates most science fiction!P.S.--When exactly did it take place?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Faranheit 451 is a frightening version of the future . we now live in a time which reflects on the past and considers the future , 2000&lt; . bradburys novel is a bible that will see us through a time when books may be illegal and firemen will be the burners . alltogether a book that must be read even if forced , this book is the safety manuel!!!!!!!!! recommended to free thinkers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book should be on everyones bookshelves and should be required reading for every middle school student. Instead we force rot our children's brains with Harry Potter nonsense along with other books of fluff and non substance. Farenheit 451 might be science fiction but I believe it to also be an insight into things to come.It is hard for me to imagine that someone with a phd supposedly would give this book a 1 for review, but at least even that sheds a bit of hope on our civilization. At least for the time being we can all still have our differences. I do question though if it was actually read instead of some form of protest over a required reading.This is a well thought out short book (approximately 180 pages), no sex scenes, a few curse words (the typical) and even the violent scenes do not dwell on the blood and gut portions of death, therefore making this an acceptable book for any level of reading. I my opinion this should probably be the first science fiction book anyone picks up to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When my youngest son read Bradbury's classic Fahrenheit 451 for his honors English class, he was amazed that I had never read it - so much so that he went out and purchased a copy for me. It's easy to see why this book has become standard reading in High Schools and Universities. Bradbury is obviously an accomplished writer, and he focuses on the timeless topics of freedom of information, government control and war. Written nearly 55 years ago, he could have never realized how close to the mark he was going to hit regarding the central role virtual relationships would play in our world today. A quick and worthy read that you need to squeeze into your schedule."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I can't believe that some people could read this book and not understand why it is important. This book is a classic for a reason. Underneath the dystopian surface are truths- and frightening resemblances to our own society. When I read this for the first time, I was shocked and pleased to hear that there is someone else who thinks like me. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for turning a critical eye on your future, peices of our present (the books is frighteningly prophetic) and writing your anthem for all of us who choose to think and not just follow."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury wrote an absolute classic on the subject of human freedom and censorship. The outstanding characteristic of this little book (I was done in 2 days) is that it does not rely on an opposive state (as does 1984), but rather on a society that chooses to distance itself from books.The basic irony in the story is that, after houses were made fireproof sometime in the future, there was no more job for the firemen. As society sought to occupy such spare capacity, it chose to eliminate books, as they constituted a hazard. To me, the most outstading part of the book is Bradbury's description of how man turned away from knowledge, starting with minorities feeling oppressed by those who \\"knew more\\". In order to achieve happiness, society had to eliminate the feeling of inferiority some people had, and such inferiority was largely linked to books.The most interesting point, however, is that this book was not rendered false by time; the future depicted is quite similar to one we see today in the world and in the U.S. We have people who are not knowledgeable about an ongoing war, despite being aware of it; there are people outside the country who hate us, but we don't really know why (remind you of anything?); there is a growing sense that we are not free to express our views in fear of offending someone; and lastly, TV and instant gratification is suplanting the need to know and deeply understand the world and who we are.In the book, it took a young girl and an old professor to awaken our hero, Guy Montag. Though we are not yet burning books, it seems like the general direction was correct. I highly recommend this book; to me, the best test is the fact that, after reading it, I really wished I had written it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to waste a lot of time describing _Fahrenheit 451_. There's over 1,000 reviews on Amazon alone. I'm sure most people know that it tells of a dystopian future in which books have been banned, and how firemen are employed to start fires instead of fighting them. Even some of those who have not read the book have at least that superficial idea.What makes _Fahrenheit 451_ so nightmarish is how this society came to be. This was not the result of a totalitarian dictator or government, it was the will of the people. Somewhere along the way, people tired of being challenged, both intellectually and morally, by books. Bland, inoffensive, and mind-numbing forms of recreation dominated the cultural landscape. Commentators on the ailments of the human condition became enemies of the state, while the true disease itself went unchecked. There are quite a few out there who think something like this can't happen in these \\"enlightened\\" times.It's already happening. The cirriculum throughout the American school system is being dumbed down far below the capabilities of the average student. Public libraries are being underfunded, and in many cases, closed down completely. Authors and intellectuals are given far less reverence than celebrities who hold on to their fame through idiotic publicity stunts rather than through talent and hard work.So, I might not have told you anything you don't know already. I won't be offended if you choose to brush off everything I mentioned previous to the point I'm about to make. Read _Fahrenheit 451_. Take a good look at the cultural and intellectual climate of society today. Ask yourself if this is what you want our future to be.Me neither."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazon.com recommended Fahrenheit 451 to my list a long time ago and I just now got around to reading it, somewhat skeptical at first because the description on the back of the book seemed, at best, cheesy. The publisher might want to rethink the blurb. But, I read it anyway, and am thoroughly impressed not only with the style of writing, but also with the complexity of the situation presented. In a novel where books are banned because they cause too much 'free thinking' and 'confusion' for those who fail to understand them or don't want to read them, there are a lot of fairly frightening similarities to the way society is progressing today. Granted, I don't believe we will ever burn all the books of the world, but it is a cruel reminder how many people are ignorant to the importance of books, whether fiction or non-fiction. It also reminded me how much I enjoy cracking open a new book with its characteristic smell and feel, and how much I, as a reader, would miss that privilege."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very hmm how can I say this? Well, there are acutally no words at all to describe the great masterpiece that Mr.Bradubry conjured up over 50 years ago. Many of the kids nowadays ( I am a freshman in high school!) are saying &quot;This book sucks, etc etc.&quot; Well, don't you see it? The kids of today are ALREADY turning into the Mildreds and Firemen of tommorow! They are putting this book down because THEY are the firemen and Mildreds of today.....This book shows a prfound truth in today's culture and generation, our generation. Mr.Bradbury has showed us a future, no not a future, but of a PRESENT to us that if we stand around idly this future will occur. Remember Faber'sline......&quot;I saw the way things were going, a long time back. I said nothing. I'm one of the innocents who could have spoken up and out when no one would listen to the 'guilty,' but i did not speak and thus became guilty myself.&quot; I believe this is one of the most moving and truthful and insightful lines in this book, for it shows what will happen in our tommorow.This is a plea for help, if anyone is reading this, do all you can to proclaim this book to the masses. If we do not spread this around, we will crumble. All of the freethinkers and people that think &quot;Outside the box&quot; will be crushed by the fiery hand and ax of tommorow's society. We are a dying race, the rebels, the freethinkers, all of us. Do not give in. If they burn our houses, burn with them. Do not cave in to pop-culture's ideals and guildlines we must follow. Is America truly &quot;A land of the Free?&quot; I think not. We are slowly simmering in this melting pot and we will slowly begin to melt away....For example, the other day at lunch, my friend and i were talking, and i asked him,&quot;Josh, if a new machine was invented would you ask, 'How it works?' or, 'What's its purpose'. He replied 'How?'. I asked him a myriad of questions like this and i realized what our world is coming to. Yes, like Josh, all of the smart ones of the world are becoming mechanical, ruled under the constraints of society, sub-conciously. All of our intellects are starting to perish. Our smarts will be used for inventing Seashell radio's and TV walls and the Robot Dogs of the future. No more will we be appreciated for our philosophies, thoughts, our ideas, insights; No, but we will be appreciated for how happy we can make the masses and how happy we are will be our number one priority. Please, if you have children, please please do not let them be swayed by commercial jingles or catch phrases or tunes. I am a kid, only one kid, but if this message gets accross to another, i will have succeeded in spreading this message of a scary new world. I believe this new world is an apocalypse to freethinkers, and we must unite before anything happens, we must not sit idly, as Faber's costly mistaken took its toll. Mr.Bradbury's best book ever, a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's hard to describe what a powerful charge this slender little book carries. You read it and wonder how Bradbury was able to make a prediction so spot-on accurate way back in the 1950s when he wrote this. There are scenes and lines that are etched in my mind permanently: the Mechanical Hound and its procaine snout; Mildred crying when Montag reads &quot;Dover Beach&quot; to her but not understanding why; Beatty's chilly monologues on sedating the masses by stuffing them with useless facts; 17-year-old Clarisse tasting the rain on her tongue. I once read a book on meditation that described ideas as having sound, structure and weight. The ideas in Farenheit 451 seem to have those properties, so vividly does Bradbury present them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll admit it, in the interest of full disclosure: I don't like Ray Bradbury. Not so much his work, but him. His quasi-luddite persona that distrusts ATMs but dreams of flying cars, his palpable (and occasionally justified) pretentiousness that allowed him to transcend pulp sci-fi in the 50s while still pandering to that crowd. That out of the way...Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for a high school sophomore/junior about the dangers of anti-intellectualism and censorship. It is a bracing look at what such policy might lead to. It's fairly well-reasoned and it remains gripping throughout. On the other hand, however, it lacks the sort of over-arching philosophy that can be found in other dystopias. Although it's a great way to get into the subgenre, it's by no means the only or best word upon the subject. It happens to be oversimplified and narrow in focus.It is also, though, excessively didactic. There's very little nuance here, and it's none too subtle about getting across its message. It doesn't quite match up to 1984 and Brave New World, both of which ponder higher philosophical questions and give us plausible scenarios in which the human spirit is broken. In fact, 1984 is now only really significant in its portrait of humanity, since the state it depicts is no longer achievable (I guess Orwell never thought that it would be companies and individuals and not the government who would develop computer technology). Brave New World is the most prophetic of all, largely because it depicts the final showdown of the human spirit and the wheels of society not as a bang, but a whimper, with people so preoccupied with sex and drugs that they just push out thoughts when they come.In fact, Fahrenheit 451 is not all that prophetic. As a warning sign, sure, it retains currency, but it was written before the sexual revolution and the civil rights movement, in Eisenhower's America, where paranoia over Red invasion and Soviet spies like the Rosenbergs and Alger Hiss made such private invasion seem inevitable in the name of preserving liberty. In fact, restrictions on expression have been almost infinitely eased since 1954. The Supreme Court under Earl Warren began to strike down state obscenity laws prohibiting mostly porn, but also avant-garde films, to the point now where they're all gone. I'm not about to argue that the arts now are more vital and important than they ever have been, but it helps when the most popular show on TV is The Sopranos when it used to be All in the Family. Now, much more than ever, we live in a society where the minority is free to say what they wish, thanks to the Internet, the great equalizer. That these voices don't all make it into the mainstream is the fault of the media corporations and the anti-intellectual public, not moral queasiness by the majority. In fact, looking at the 50's, with the Hollywood Ten who went to prison for refusing to answer questions about Communists, where being a Communist and speaking out against the government (in some circumstances) were crimes, and Joe McCarthy decrying such people as Arthur Miller and Defense Secretary George C. Marshall as Communists, it is difficult to argue that censorship has worsened. In every measureable respect, things have gotten much better. That's not to say that tomorrow it might go the other way, but it hasn't and it probably won't.In spite of the recent Ray Bradbury renaissance, we need to put all of his work into context. The outwardly-happy-inwardly-freaked-out 1950s led to many great artistic works, like On The Waterfront and film noir, as well as great popular works, like The Twilight Zone, all of which had underneath them the peculiar paranoia of the time. Fahrenheit 451 is no different, and I would implore you to read it and take this into account. It is highly readable, but let's be honest about its impact and accuracy as prediction."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a young writer, Bradbury bubbles with ideas in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", and the end result is a nice little novel about the evils of censorship and government control. The protagonist, a book-burner named Guy Montang, turns a complete 180 during the beginning of the novel, falling into the lure of freethinking in a world of blarring propaganda and social norms, of repressed emotions and the fast-paced, dangerous city lifestyle.The book has faults. The actual writing is spotty at times, and the extremely circumstantial plot does not complement the thought-provoking concept presented in F451. This is not written as well as, say, Orwell's 1984, and likewise it is not as powerful or as captivating. Though the two books cannot be fairly compared, it proves as an example that the book is lacking something, that sustenance of style that makes a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book.

Now that I think about it I am glad I dont live in a world like Guy Montag's.This book has become on of my favorites and I highly recomend you read it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 came out over 50 years ago, first as a novella called The Fireman (1950), and finally in its full novel form (1953). In those days we were probably most concerned with censorship from the right. Now, the liberals who advocated free speech at Berkeley have taken up the cause to tell us what we can say, so as not to offend anyone. So the First Amendment risks assault from both ends. One way to solve the problem is for us all to develop thick skins. If somebody calls me a bad name, why should I spend my time complaining and give the impression that my ego is a basket case? (Now physical assault is another thing. No First Amendment protection there.)Ray Bradbury's Coda is at the end of newer editions of his book. This is a valuable addition that gives specifics on some of the problems mentioned above.But there is something lacking in the newer editions. When Ballantine published the first edition in 1953, they included two short stories at the end, &quot;The Playground&quot; and &quot;And The Rock Cried Out.&quot; These have since been excluded and are not easily found elsewhere. They are excellent stories, and I hope that someday Del Rey will consider reinstating them. For this reason, I now rate the book a 4 rather than its deserved 5."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book talked about important themes that changed my perspective on life. Guy Montag's world was nothing but bizarre rules that covered up the past. One important part of the story was the fear of change. The society was against him for his attempt to find out the truth. Killing his fellow firefighter, Beatty, caused him to see that he wanted to die. Quote: \\"...In the middle of the crying Montag knew it for the truth. Beatty had wanted to die. He had just stood there, not really trying to save himself, just stood there joking, needling, thought Montag, and the thought was enough to stifle his sobbing and let him pause for air.\\" He wanted to be free, instead of being confined within rules of the ordinary."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was a great book because it shows they world where you can not think on your own and decide on your own. Life would be different if there were no book and where the government thinks for you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main characters name is Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him, because his wife turned him in.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that Ray Bradbury did a fantastic job on this book. The detail and the wording was unlike anything I've read before. There were some phrases that were hard to follow, but most of them were amazing detail with some extravagant crosses nightmarish. I've read one other poem of Ray Bradbury's and that too was very nightmarish. Both though were incredible pieces of writing.The basic plot is that is the world is in a futuristic state where the cars go over 100's of mph, about everything is electronic, there are TV programs that you play a character in a soap, and firemen don't put out fires. Yes, that is right firemen don't put out fires they start them, and they start them by igniting books. The only way to describe what having books in the book is like if someone in our society was to murder someone. In the book if you have a book it is considered a felony and firemen come and burn books. Not only do they burn the books the person who is caught with them are sent to jail. The reason these books are being burnt is because they figure that the root cause of anger and prejudice so if there was a book that was controversial then bam it's gone, and eventually all the books were ruled against. Guy Montag a normal man for his job skin slightly burnt with black smudges, fairly large, with the fireman look. He had never questioned his jobs or what he was supposed to do. Until one day when he meets Clarisse McClellan a seventeen-year old girl; who tells him about what United States was before, and what the job of firemen were before the book burning era. Montag's life takes a dramatic change from the point when Clarisse enters. Clarisse talks about living a life and looking around and smelling flowers and opening you mouth and catching raindrops in your mouth. Montag first thought Clarisse was absurd and crazy to do all these things because doing these things were no accustom to this generation, it was fun to be with the \\"family\\" this family isn't the traditional family it's a soap opera where the person plays a part in it. Montag learns the truth of what firemen use to do before the book burning age. Montag thinks it's total nonsense but soon learns better. Clarisse disappears one day, and Montag can't find out why she is gone then his wife tells him that last week she had died, and her family had left. Montag then remembers the only other person he had ever met that was like Clarisse was Faber. Faber is a retired professor; there is no need for professors because there are no books. Faber is willing to help Montag, because Montag is the only one who recognizes that there is a problem, and the only one who wants to make a difference. Montag takes what Faber has called alternate brain and puts it in his ear and can hear Faber's voice. Montag headed to the station, Montag had just settled in when they got a call that would change his life forever.This was on of the most amazing books that I've ever read and all of the twists and great action kept me reading until the very end. I think it would be very interesting if someone would write a sequel to Fahrenheit 451 after the big ending it leaves some space to make a sequel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of Fahrenheit 451 is a complicated one that tries to explain the future in an odd way that is not often expressed. It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a student at a high school and I finished reading &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; in a week and a half. I was very much impressed by the story and how it gets better after the introduction I thought it would be boring book about a firemen but it's a story that takes turns all around. The characters are all taken very much into mind. He gives them all unique personalities, although it's a short story, each chapter is like a bio on one of the many characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very good story about a struggling public servant who is deeply confused by the twisted world that surrounds him. As a fireman in this backwards society, he is expected to burn books and the houses that contain them, but can no longer bring himself to do it as he once did. Books are outlawed and burned because they are the source of much confusion and varying points of view. The government could not bear it any longer, so it opted to simply destroy the books. Firemen are now employed to start fires instead of stopping them. The main character is Guy Montag, along with his wife Mildred and Fire Captain Beatty. Montag tries very hard to beat the system by hiding and reading books, but cannot contain his frustration. He is found out and flees to save his life.Guy Montag is my favorite character in this book. He goes through many changes and has quite an adventure. In the end, in order to escape and be free, he has to defeat his boss and kill the deadly Mechanical Hound, which is a machine used to track down fugitives.Fahrenheit 451 is also a story about the contradictory principle of censorship. Ray Bradbury shows what the effects of censorship are mental unrest and dissatisfaction with the quality of life. He writes about it hoping to get the attention and open the reader's eyes to face this evident threat that is in fact a reality.I can, in some way, relate to Montag. He was different from most people and managed to beat the system in the end. Although I have never killed any one or burned down houses like he did, but I do share the same spirit of dissatisfaction with the rules of society. There are many things wrong with this world that I am not happy with. Much of my unhappiness is towards hypocrisy. For example, how can the government mandate that an 18 year old male go and die for the US, yet he cannot be declared financially independent until he is 24? Or how can this same 18 year old male cast a vote to put a man into office and elect a president, but he cannot have a drop of alcohol until he is 21? Like Montag, I also struggle with society's rules and points of view. We may differ in cause, but the spirit is the same.I enjoyed reading this book. Mr. Bradbury knows how to tell a good story. I especially liked the climax, which was, of course, the best part of the book. The only thing that I do not like, perhaps due to my impatience, are the long and wordy monologues. But then again, these are essential to the storyline of the book. This is how Bradbury is able to explain confusing parts in the story. He uses them as a movie would use flashbacks. If it were up to me, I would just put a little more action in these parts.Of course, as would almost all readers of this story, I highly recommend this book. Students from grade level 9 and up will be able to truly appreciate it. Perhaps the misfits and outcasts in this society will enjoy it more, but in all, this is a good book for every one. Fahrenheit 451 will fit well in any literary collection, be it political or sci-fi or both."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"What can I say that has not already been said.

High authorities try to regulate life to make people happy. To achieve this happiness, firemen (which has been redefined) burn books to people don't know what the past was like. The city is a dystopia in a utopia.Guy Montag, firemen who finds out that he isn't happy once he has multiple conversations with a spontaneous adolescent girl named Clarisse. Clarisse doesn't thrive in the dystopia like everyone else. She does not accept that books are bad. She late affects the train of thought for Montag. Mildred, Montag's wife is happy with her life. She accepts the thought of books being bad. She agrees that destroying books brings happiness. She spends most of her time watching T.V. all day. Faber is an old man who enjoys books, but he is terrified of the firemen. He's a smart coward. Captain Beatty reads books from time to time, but he doesn't believe anything he reads.The common theme for the book the collective loss of memory, history, and the outside world in a society will result in an easy psychological manipulation of mankind by a government ultimately leading to dehumanization of the people. This is the theme because they are erasing history in an effort to achieve happiness. The common characteristics used in the book are relying on physical and somewhat psychological torture to maintain order. They threaten to burn books and houses if you're caught with books. The society the government runs thought to be an utopia but is far from it, the government basically runs and controls everything.Fahrenheit 451 really unfolds when Montag begins to take books for himself. His wife is terrified that he wants to keep the books. She is afraid that her house will be burned by the firemen, but Montag is a fireman, but does this make him able to read books?

Set in a future time, it is illegal to read or own books. Farenheit 451 is the temperature it takes for a page in a book to catch fire.One night, walking home from work, Montag meets his new neighbor, a 17 year old girl named Clarisse McClellan. Clarisse is a free thinking spirit, who surprises him with her genuine curiosity about life, she questions things instead of just accepting blind answers. She and Montag become friends and she talks to him about the past, when firefighters actually fought fires instead of burning books.When Montag goes home that night, he finds his wife, Mildred, has overdosed on sleeping pills. He calls the medics and Mildred is saved. But Montag begins to begins to question his own way of life and his happiness.One night while on call, Montag arrives at a womans house to burn her books. The woman refuses to leave, and instead dies that night in her burning home. Montag is greatly distressed over this and begins to have second thoughts about his way of life. While he was at the womans home, he grabbed a book to sneak out with him. It turns out Montag has been collecting and hiding books in his house for some time. He tells his wife this and shows her his collection, but she is so brainwashed that she doesn't care about the books and wants him to burn them too. So he decides to look up a retired English professor who he knows has books stashed in his house, a man named Faber. He hopes Faber can answer some of his questions.I read Farenheit 451 without knowing anything about it, I just knew that Ray Bradbury wrote it and that it is considered a modern classic. So when I went to my local library and stumbled upon this book, I grabbed it off the shelf and figured i'd give it a go. I am so glad I did, it is a great read. I was hooked from page one. The storyline was really good, I found it to be creepy the way society was brainwashed and how they lived in an oppressed world without books. I liked Montag very much. It's almost like he was sleeping all that time, then finally woke up and snapped out of it.Mildred creeped me out, especially the way she spoke, it was very disjointed, she makes offhand remarks, almost like she's drugged.I think most off all, I enjoyed this one so much because I like books that are about books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 written in the 1950's describes a future to which we still may be on our way.

His struggle for survival begins as the war does and he flees the city.Bradbury puts so much, into a quick read. This novel talking about censorship, defiance, and self thought is woven beautifully into the pages. The twists and turns with misleading plots and the underlying meanings makes you read things once or twice before the true meaning is found.

One of those amazing stories that you see reflected in so many other stories today. My only complaint is that the writing style to me felt like I was reading one long runon sentence. Amazing read none the less. :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this directly after1984, and thus Bradbury's vision of the future seemed positively quaint by comparison. Later, I learned that crafting an unimaginable dystopia was not Bradbury's intent: instead of offering a forecast of runaway state power, Bradbury's book was about the corrupting influence of television and its deleterious affects on the population's literacy. The fire chief actually explains this to the protagonist, but I took it not as exposition (as it was intended), but as a red herring... I guess I was giving Bradbury too much credit. The book is not about censorship at all; not about the horrors of the omnipotent state, even as most readers interpret it as such.In this way, Fahrenheit 451 can be viewed as a failure: the message the author intended to convey is not appreciated by the bulk of the book's audience. But that is not to say the book is no good. It is an insightful and entertaining read; stylistically superb, exceedingly well written, with plenty of memorable characters and potent imagery. But the actual theme is less poignant than the one imagined by most readers, which is why I think it failed to really satisfy me as a profound piece of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While a good read with strong themes, I struggle to grasp why this book is considered such a \\"classic\\" by so many. I'll admit - I am no one to judge what a \\"classic\\" is, but it would be nice if someone could explain it to me - as there are other books out there that drive at similar points but are considered far less noteworthy.That being said, there were some strong themes running through this book that seem very prophetic - the book was written in the 1950s, and I caught myself more than once drawing on Bradbury's \\"exaggerations\\" (at the time) to current society. Such as the mass media (or propaganda) and mind control - crippling people's ability to think for themselves - and in fact doing the \\"thinking\\" for them. This is a central theme and one of the reasons behind the burning of books - as books make you think and loosen one's ability to control. And similarly, the (television) media's creation of short attention spans (immediately looking for the climax of a story - otherwise attention drifts) - creating a society that shallowly drifts from one climax to another, without every really grabbing a hold of anything. Senses have been dulled to the point where no one actually sees anything - to the point that it's suggested that society wouldn't know what grass or flowers were - only if you showed them a green blur would the recognize grass (as they are so busy driving fast to get to their next \\"climax\\" they don't see anything else). Both of these create a mindless society that lacks anything beneath the surface. Bradbury displays the deterioration this causes with the Mildred character - Montag's numb wife whose only satisfaction is her television \\"family\\", and who presents a shallow faade of happiness - but who in reality is miserable (poignantly displayed when she attempts to kill herself towards the beginning of the novel). I think she represents society in general - what Montag is \\"supposed\\" to be but is breaking free from.Although interpreted to be exaggerations at the time - one can link these ideas to current society (in the 2000s). The ever shrinking attention span as technology develops new and newer media outlets (television, video games, Internet, iPods - all moving us further away from books). The mindless shows and distractions we watch to help us escape from our own lives (I don't mean to sound like I'm on a high horse here - I do the same thing); the mind control of masses by spin networks and political twisting. One reviewer mentioned the absurdity of intellectuals being banished to the far forest outside the city (in the book) - but what angle do you think \\"political strategists\\" are playing when they label President Obama an elitist, or rave about the liberal academia? The tension between knowledge and ignorance was one of the main reasons for the banishment of books in the book. I'm not suggesting that book burning is around the corner - only that the seeds that seem to have created Bradbury's fictional society are the same seeds that are present today.Overall - as mentioned a good book - and one that continues to grow on me (perhaps it is a classic after all?)."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of the best I've read.

Never before had I read a book about the banning of books and using &quot;firemen&quot; to get rid of them. At times there were some lulls and some confusing parts, but overall Bradbury's unique style is what made the book worthwhile for me to read. I believe that Montag was at times a flat character that could use a little spice, but his growth throughout the novel seemed to counteract the deterioration within his own surrounding society. To think that one day our own society could be like Montag's; burning books and stifling creativity; is absolutely frightening to me and this book does not try to supress that notion. It actually amplifies it, but it can be used as a reference for our future generations so they would never reach that low point that Montag's society reached."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Farenheit 451 is a wonderful book, though slow at times.

I sincerely believe that TV and movies will become obsolete to holograms and VR. Holograms and VR will become obsolete to somatic input devices. Nevertheless books will always be read. Why?

The story is of a young man, a &quot;fireman&quot;, in a future where information and knowledge come from television. Books are banned, and owning a book is punishable by death. The fireman becomes fascinated with why people would be willing to risk death in order to own something the state says is bad for them. He steals a book and reads it. Then he steals another book and another and another. Eventually he becomes exactly what he has been trained to eradicate. Finally he is turned in, by his wife, who doesn't understand his change in attitude and must answer a call to come to his own house...where his stolen collection of books are burned. He runs away and goes into hiding, until he eventually comes upon a group of people living outside the city without luxury of television. The people in this group have solved the problem of not being allowed to own books. Each person selects a book and then commits it to memory...in effect they become the book. If they are searched, they have no books and cannot be punished. They have become the receptacles for all the world's great literature and for their own future; a future that someday may permit books. This is a brilliant story, which has many parallels to America today, and not just Nazi Germany in the 30's. Less than 50% of Americans read newspapers; the idea of functional illiteracy has become commonplace; and an entire generation doesn't know anything that didn't come out of the television.

Upset, I wrote a &quot;scorching&quot; essay to the local paper about how we should just burn our books if we refuse to fund the library.Writing the essay allowed me to appreciate just how brilliant this book is. It is dubbed a &quot;classic&quot; for a reason - the residue will remain with you long after you have read it. It has been about five years since I read this book, but I still recall many details, themes and characters in the novel with great clarity.A book to make you passionate about reading books! Self-serving, maybe, but what wonderful treasures they are. And to find a book that so opens the mind and stirs the soul is priceless. If you haven't read this book (why not?!?) it is without a doubt worth your time - and you, fair reader, deserve the enjoyment it will bring you.

I hope you do the same."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Everyone who reads this book (but especially Americans) should be outraged. Bradbury takes an ugly stick and beats the present day American philosophy down with it. We are a society based on instant gratification. Our slogan is &quot;Right here, Right now. It's your Right!&quot; (How many magazines about fashion, cars, and the ever expanding number of ways to cook chicken can we read before our curiousity is deadened?). This is the type of thinking that Bradbury criticized. What especially frightened me was the concept of MAKING everyone equal. Paradoxally, this is the dumbing down of America, so that no one could be made to feel dumb. It is in settling for society's values without critical judgement that we give up our freedom. Thank you, Mr. Bradbury, for putting it much more eloquently and forcefully than I ever could. Now everyone out there reading this ... BUY the book, READ the book, then tell me if you aren't outraged at the lack of neuron firings in the heads of our society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is amazing. Fahrenheit 451 is an amazing book. So amazing in fact that I did my senior research paper on it. The plot is about Guy Montag (protagonist) learning about censorship and the death that accompanies it. The symbolism is very deep in this book. For example, the story mentions burning books, which is linked to destroying knowledge. Through intricately woven twists, it becomes apparent that Bradbury wants us to realize that knowledge and individuality are the keys to being alive and that when those are lost, regardless of our medical condition, we are dead.The obvious theme is of course censorship, but if you're willing to read it carefully and give some serious thought as to what's being said, you can see a much deeper message. This book should be required for admittance to society. Read it. You won't be disappointed.And don't pay any attention to those negative reviews - they are the people that this book talks about: the morons in our society who don't see the folly of ignorance."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury expounds a firghtening message in Farenheit 451. The book details life where firefighters burn the corpus of many well known authors such as Faulkner and Shakespeare. The book shows the importance of an outlet where people can express their ideas.This message is increasingly important as we near the horrific society portrayed in bradbury's novel. Like the society in F451 we are becoming dependent on television. Books are in a period of quiesence.The book sends it's theme, but it sends it with a hammer. If my memory serves, the book is no larger than 170 pp. Bradbury innundates every paragraph towards the end with his theme. The book is overly sententious, and I wish it was longer. The end seemed rushed and out of a cheesy b movie.Despite this flaw, Bradbury's prose is to die for. In simple, specific words Bradbury manages to convey a convoluted theme. This will remain a classic for years to come, that is if we still have books. Hopefully, F451 will recrudese book's in the future. One can only hope that our grand children will giggle over Wodehouse or marvel at F451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As 1984 becomes less relevant as a work, this novel becomes annually scarier and scarier. Everyone remembers that they burn books in this novel-- what they forget is why. Bradbury's world is one where-- --anything that might offend any special group is repressed --anything that might require people to think is repressed --people sit and stare endlessly at wall-sized tv's --suicide is rampant and unremarkable --people lead life at breakneck speed to avoid thinking or feeling In short, Bradbury has created a world which is frighteningly close to the one in which we live. Even if you THINK you remember this work, it is time to reread it. Book burning is by far the least scary prediction Bradbury has made here."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The classic novel, &quot; Fahrenheit 451,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, takes a journey into the future. The novel is about a fire fighter named Guy Montag whose job is to actually start fires. In the society of the future, no one asks questions or thinks for themselves. Montag and his fire starting colleagues are paid to light books on fire and watch them burn. Montag meets a seventeen-year old girl who tells him about times when people treasured books and when a fireman's job was to extinguish fires. Filled with curiosity about the past, Montag starts hiding books in his home and reading them. His wife reveals his secret to his co-workers and Montag is forced to burn his own stash. Montag then meets philosophers who have stored the contents of books in their heads so that when people need and want the knowledge, it is there.Bradbury brings out a statement of theme that is not revealed without careful analysis of the story. The theme that Bradbury presents is that even the simplest things are important and make up a culture and society as we know it. One man realizes this and finds in himself that he was allowed to appreciate and"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"While sometimes hard to follow, Ray Bradbury's science fiction classic is still intense and searing when at its best and bears many frightening resemblences to our own world. This futuristic civilization regards cursory items such as magazines as better than books; the television has pretty much taken over; there's even a mention of kids frequently killing each other. Pretty amazing stuff, considering Bradbury wrote this way back in 1953.

It also probes at human values and is almost existential in Guy's conflict over the wrong he feels is being committed in the burning of the books.

An essential for anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To you reviewers who had to read this book for school and hated it: I too was forced to read it when I was in 8th grade, and felt the same way about it that you do. I thought it was the dumbest most boring book I'd ever read.I'm telling you now: wait 5 or 6 years, and pick this book up again. I promise you will enjoy it. It's a story of an oppressed society and a man with the courage to try and break free. Please, give Farenheit 451 another chance. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Now I did not have to read this for school like most people who wrote these reviews so that may have allowed me to enjoy the book for it's enternainment while still being taught immensely rather than forcing myself to look for the knowledge within and miss the entertainment. School would be so much fun (english &amp; history) if I could read everything as if I were doing it to entertain myself and not because I have to. My state of mind may have been the factor that made this one of the most exciting and meaninful books I have ever read.Every politician should this to learn what democracy is not. Not that I think such a regime could take over in the near future with the freedom of speech on devices such as the internet and the continous poplularity of books. But by not giving his tale a date shows that such a world could come into being any time without warning if people simply forget. The theme of the book is the answer to anyone who asks what the purpose is of learning history. Montag is forced to watch his wife and the rest of a doomed society as it repeats history and mindlessly involves itself in war. The book is not so much about the importance of books but the importance of knowledge. Bradbury shows that a civilized society must always remember and cannot always be happy.The second half reads like an action story without straying from the theme and it is made obvious where Steven King was influenced to write the unrecognized but I think great book The Running Man."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Can't remember how many times i read this novel.

I immediately fell in love with the book. In the almost 10 years since I fist read the book, I have read it over and over again. While in college, I wrote a paper for a Lit class showing the how Bradbury's science fiction is slowly becoming science fact (i.e. seashells= walkman. Its scary to see how a book written in 1953, as a work of fiction, is becoming reality. If you want to know what I mean, then read &quot;Farenheit 451&quot; and see for yourself.

In the years since that, I have grown to love this book and become swept up in the character quirks and bleak yet wonderful portrayl of the future. One point that is eluded to in the book and seems to be a prophecy that could very well come true is that of the society's need for friends(see Montag's wife's urgency around her &quot;friends&quot;) but the reality being that it is shallow company. For them, real entertainment is provided by the television, and friendship is a hollow term for the company that we so desperately desire. This is part of what makes Clarisse such a compelling charecter; she has rejected this notion of friendship for family and conversation. She sees that the hollow pleasures enjoyed by so many are just an excuse to keep the mind idle. Clarisse was a visionary, a free thinker, but most of all an enjoyer of books, a love she paid for with her life. This is only one aspect of the book that makes it such a masterpiece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A very scary book. Reading in these times ought to scare anyone into throwing away their TV. It's truly amazing how smack dab on Bradbury was, and how poorly we listened to him. The only minus to the book is in not examining the side of the mindless public too indepth. Reality can be very scary, that's why we all sometimes hide from it. His vision of what it's like when we all take that extended leap into the world of virtual reality (TV, internet, movies etc...) ought to be more frightening than reality itself. I just hope we're not all too far gone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think this book is one of the most important books written this century because it teaches the reader a lesson: take away anything (not just books) that enriches peoples minds, and they become, well, stupid. Talking to people all day like Montag's wife did not help her to any degree; it only made her less intelligent (scary thought, as she already had little to lose). Also, to those who say this book doesn't make sense: it is a SATIRE! It is not inteneded to be 100% logical, plausible, or whatever. Mr. Bradbury wanted to teach a lesson, and Fahrenheit 451 does it well."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first read this book in high school I did not give it much consideration, but re-reading it today I can see how Bradbury was so prophetic when he wrote this masterpiece in 1950.For example:F451-Montag's wife uses three wall-TVs to interact with vapid strangers and act out some ridiculous made up family play day in and out.Today-consider all the social networking websites and chat rooms being used for the same purposes.F451-They use a Thimble Bumble-Bee device to personally listen to music day and night making the person oblivious to what is going on around them.Today-There is the iPod (or any MP3 device for that matter) that has drones of people walking around not acknowledging their surroundings.F451-Robotic teller machines manning the bank 24hrs a day.Today-ATMsF451-There is a list of books that the firemen do not burn because they are acceptable (to keep the populace docile and complacent).Today-Oprah's Book of the Month Club."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoy visions of the future whether it's in films or books. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982) depicted a society where the majority of people had settled on distant planets, while Marco Brambilla's Demolition Man (1993) was a peaceful world where human contact was not allowed and crime was almost non-existent. In literature, George Orwell's 1984 (1949) and Aldous Huxley's Brave New World (1932) both depicted a bleak future for mankind, loveless societies with technology at the fore and the freedom of the individual vastly reduced through fear and manipulation. Reading Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 for the first time I was fascinated about how it would compare to the great dystopian novels I'd already had the pleasure of reading.Set in an unspecified future Fahrenheit 451 follows the story of Guy Montag, a fireman who goes through life without asking questions and abiding by the rules. Firemen in Bradbury's future are not the fire fighters we are accustomed to but fire starters! In this society it is illegal to own or read books and anyone caught doing so must hand them over to the fire service or suffer the consequences. The title of the book refers to the temperature at which the books burn, and as can be expected fire plays a big part in the novel. Guy Montag's life is turned upside down by an encounter with his free-spirited neighbour, Clarisse McClellan, whose outlook on life is in direct contrast to Montag as she dares to ask why in a society that is not to be questioned or reasoned with. From meeting McClellan, Montag begins to question his own existence, his relationship with his wife, Mildred, his work as a fireman and whether books really should be forbidden. The book follows the change in Montag's life and the consequences it has.As with other dystopian novels, Fahrenheit 451 is often frightening when you consider such a reality in our own world. The idea that books are forbidden for the thoughts and stories they convey and are simply not to be harboured by the population is difficult to understand. By robbing the world of books Bradbury's characters are almost lifeless. Montag's wife, Mildred, is addicted to TV walls, constantly discussing the images with her friends and hounding her husband for a fourth TV wall. This form of entertainment has become the staple of society and is much preferred for the images projected ensure the viewer doesn't need to use their imagination or think. A stark contrast to books.The penalty for hording books is best reflected when Montag and his fellow firemen are called to a house where an old woman has many books stashed. After refusing to destroy her precious collection the old woman waits until the firemen have their backs turned before starting a blaze of her own, destroying both her house and her books, and taking her own life in the process. The event rocks Montag severely as does the disappearance of Clarisse McClellan who we do not see again but Montag is assured she is dead. These changes force Montag not only to question the morality of society but to begin keeping books himself and reading them! The change in Montag is wonderfully crafted, the idea that he has no life prior to the meeting with Clarisse McClellan but in discovering the beneficial elements of books he feels more alive than ever, though his transgressions leave him a wanted man.When Clarisse McClellan is out of the picture, Montag has to turn to an English professor, Faber, who begins teaching him about the significance of books to human history and how they should still be relevant in the present. While Montag begins to learn about books he has to deal with his wife, Mildred, who is reluctant to have books in her house but also with his boss, Beatty, who suspects Montag's wavering stance but proceeds to spare him punishment by assuring him possession of a book by a fireman for 24 hours is acceptable so long as the said book is then destroyed. Montag's brief meetings with Clarisse McClellan and his new found need for independence and the ability to choose means he eventually has to leave the society that has been his whole life or have his existence cut terribly short.When Montag is on the run the novel gathers pace as he first fends off firemen and then the relentless mechanical hounds. After eluding capture Montag has helicopters to contend with and these scenes reflect the stranglehold of the society over its subjects. One man steps out of line by reading and keeping books, and all of a sudden firemen, mechanical hounds and helicopters are all devoted to his capture. Montag's decision to defy society costs him everything he ever knew and if that's not enough of a problem, he also has to face up to the onset of war!Fahrenheit 451 can sit proudly amongst the other dystopian novels of the 21st century. Working round the theme of book burning, Bradbury expertly fashions a world where the individual is a mindless minion and helps add weight to the argument of the importance of books. Bradbury's novel may not predict the Internet but it does suggest books will be obsolete in favour of technology. Prior to the Harry Potter novels there was a growing fear that children's love of books was decreasing fast but now their enthusiasm has been somewhat restored. It's unlikely a future like Fahrenheit 451 will come to be but the book should stand as a warning of a way of living we simply couldn't allow to happen."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book way back in high school, but after Mr. Bradbury's recent demise (and the youtube channel vlogbrother's choice of this for their summer read) I decided to pick it up again. Once again, reading a book that I either didn't like or didn't understand in school has blown me away later in life. For those of you who are encountering this classic for the first time, Fahrenheit 451, in a nutshell, is a book about a future society that, for a combination of different reasons, has decided to ban all books and the main character, Guy Montag, is a content fireman (i.e. book-burner) who has a crisis of conscience over his job. What Mr. Bradbury seems to be saying, to me at least, is that a life that is devoid of critical thought, which is something that books easily facilitate, is no life at all. Nearly all the characters who have turned their backs on books are seemingly dead and alive at the same time, just like many of the mechanical devices that populate the book like the electric hound and the one-eyed snake. It also feels like a a caution against both anti-intellectualism and intellectualism as embodied in the character and antagonist Fire Chief Beatty. Beatty relishes burning books and has clearly turned his back on them, but uses quotes and arguments from books to try to manipulate Montag back into the field. I only give it four stars though because Fahrenheit 451 has this strange habit of moving along really fast at times (not uncommon in a book that is less than 200 pages), but can also feel really slow too. It is easy to miss crucial details, especially in part 2. But don't let this criticism fool you. This has now easily worked it's way onto my favorites shelf and is a great introduction for readers interested in dystopian future novels like1984 ( Signet Classics (Paperback) ) [ 1984 ( SIGNET CLASSICS (PAPERBACK) ) ] by Orwell, George ( Author) on Jul, 01, 1950 Mass Market Paperbound."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My older sister had to read this book for school way back when I was maybe 12 years old.

My love of reading can be traced back to this book. His recent death triggered me to think about how much he meant to me as a boy growing into a young man, and I thought I'd pick up something as a sort of memorial to him. I hadn't read anything of his in probably 35 years, and to be honest I felt like maybe it wouldn't be that good going back to re-read them. I mean, could they actually live up to my memories? Wow, and then some! His writing is poetry, magic and a sincere look at the human condition. It is as timely today as it was when he wrote it, maybe more so.

It shows how the incineration of books, symbols for intelligence and wisdom, lead to nothing but ignorance and collectivist states of society that will eventually destroy mankind. The protagonist, Montag, is however an individualist in this futuristic society who stands for his own beliefs and does not conform to his destructive surroundings. This is a very powerful novel, however Ray Bradbury may have been inspired by other writers with the original idea of literature devoted to individualism. It was written in 1951, around the same time that George Orwell's 1984 was written. However the genius with this original and very revolutionary idea of incorporating individualism into literature is Ayn Rand, who wrote the classic novelette, Anthem, in 1937. Anyone who enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 will enjoy Anthem even more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have enjoyed reading this book. everyone will enjoy it after the first reading.

Go Montag!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;Fahrenheit 451,&quot; by Ray Bradbury, shows the theme of men and women not thinking for themselves, but letting others make decisions for them. Many want a perfect world, where everything goes right, but when people gain knowledge of something it causes segregation of beliefs resulting in problems. Bradbury acknowledges this, but tries to convey the message that, with knowledge of the past, we can understand the reason for mistakes made and prevent them from happening again. Another message that is presented is that the people are afraid of knowing things: thinking scares them. They let others think for them, in this case the government.&quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is full of metaphors that, when understood, compliment the theme. One metaphor is the mechanical hound. It is a computerized animal used as the government's way of punishing its enemies. The hound shows the power dictatorship has the power the government has to enforce. The seashells which people listen to are used to promote the policies of the government. The seashells can be thought as to help, &quot;drift these people off to sea,&quot; as seashells would drift out to sea. Finally fire is used often as a subject of metaphors. Burning the books is a way to make them non-existent. The government doesn't want the books because the knowledge in the books contradicts the governmental policy. They burn them, like one would burn a piece of trash if they didn't want it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Part of the appeal of this sort of book, books like '1984' or 'Brave New World' is that we can look at them retrospectively. Written mostly in the earlier part of the last century, they predicted just what sort of messes we would have created for ourselves in the next. The ideas their authors came up with were always just possible; in many cases some of the things the authors dreamed up came true, or almost so. It's chilling to consider that these books were written as 'worst case scenarios' of the time in which we now live.So it is with Fahrenheit 451 - much of the appeal of this book is it's consideration of just how far the TV craze would go, and how dumbed down the western world would become. The book is set not very far into our future, possibly this decade - how close are we to the sort of censorship Bradbury imagined? How much has our sense of community disappeared? How dumb are we?The interest for me, lay in these questions. I wouldn't consider 'Fahrenheit 451' great literature. I didn't think the writing was particularly skillful, or the plot incredibly suspensful. But the ideas Bradbury writes about make this book great. It really is one of those modern classics you should bother to read, especially if you enjoy Dystopian fiction like 'The Handmaid's Tale, 'Brave New world', or '1984)' or science fiction of any sort. Another one that, although it may seem like light reading or pulp as you are reading it, will stay with you for a good few days after you've put it aside and moved onto the next book....."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It was another great work by Bradbury.

He never questions the laws of this society until he meets a seventeen year old girl. She places all of these wierd thoughts and ideas into his head. From then on he questions everything.

I admit, it was a difficult read...it was very slow paced...but the story had a frightening realism to it. It depicts a society where books are burned and knowledge is, in essence, controlled by a government out of control. The premise was very interesting, but the paistagging detail in which everything was described left me fairly bored with it. It has a nice moral...if you can stick out the bordom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I think that the vision of Fahreneit 451 of the future is too pessimistic, but it can be an exaggeration of the present. The people are not interested anymore in reading books, but they prefer to watch movies. The books during these last years have lost a lot of importance, and the tecnologies have been more important for the human beings. I don\`t think that our future is the same as the one in the book, but it can be a warning for everybody who loves the smell of books, touching their pages, holding them. The author I think tried to tell us that we are not going to miss the books until we have lost them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This books is interesting. It's about a man named Montag who is a fireman but instead of putting out the fire, he starts them by burning the books he finds in other people's houses. In my own opinion I think this book is about reality, because even though we are no burning books a lot of people are losing interest in reading them. Peolpe would rather watch T.V.,play Nintendo,get on the computer and do everything from there than going through a book. So you will probably like to read this book.You will understand the importance of books and you will appreciate them more."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I LOVED this book. For me, it gave a jolt of fear on the possibility of a world like that one, though ours is not too far away. I've read two other books of Bradbury's but I'd have to say this is my favorite. I would recommend it to anyone who has a passion for books and reading, for it caters to them. I would read it just for Beatty's dream about his quoting battle with Montag, but I guess you'll have to read it..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This has become probably my favorite book. The language that Bradbury uses in this novel is odd but very well used. It is like stream of conciousness, flitting from one thing to the next. It works because that's how thoughts (mine at least) tend to run through the mind. I doubt the future described in this book will ever be fully realized, but mindless generations now being raised, that haven't enough imagination for reading, may lead us in that direction. I love this book, I recommend it to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Seriously, it is. I could never imagine a world without books. That is like a world without oxygen. Okay maybe not that bad. However, the story line of this book is excellent. It is also fast paced and short. It is the ultimate book on censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an interesting novel filled with lots of hidden meaning and excellent in depth characters. The story takes place in a futuristic American city where censorship runs wild. Books are banned and firemen no longer put out fires, in this city they start the fires. Burning books is a way to control the population and stop people from having original thoughts of their own. With an overwhelming entertainment industry controlling every aspect of people's lives, the people feel content being ignorant and have a false sense of happiness. Guy Montag is the main character in the story. He is a fireman by trade and burns books to stop people from questioning their surroundings and to \\"keep everybody happy.\\" He never questions his job or his marriage until he meets Clarisse McClellan. She is a young girl of seventeen and is different from the rest of the people. She questions the world and book burning and this is what starts to sway Montag into questioning his world. Soon Montag realizes his wife Mildred Montag is just a hollow shell that does not love him, actually she loves nobody and cares only for a family that only exists on television.With this realization Mantag sets out to change things if not on a large scale maybe just for himself. Meeting professor Faber teaches Montag about the meaning and purpose books. Montag decides to no longer burn books, instead he decides to preserve them. He does this with the help of some hobo's he meets outside the city after fleeing from prosecution for protecting the written word.Clarisse is a character I can definitely relate to. Her outlook on life and the small quirks that make us wise and happy are the things she notices instead of the mass entertainment that envelops us all. By accepting the role of an outcast and continuing her intellectual quest to better the world, she displays her huge will power. With such will power the majority of the people could find peace in whom they are, instead of always conforming.I enjoyed the meaning of this book but found that the author used far too much symbolism. The imagery hid the plot and story line of the book. I thoroughly enjoyed the parts where he rebelled against the system, especially the part in which he recites poetry to the hollow beings on television destroying their happiness by shattering what keeps them happy and content. He used a type of a \\"mirror\\" to show them their terrible faults. After hearing the poem they realized that their actions have been unforgivable and become consumed by guilt and tears. If I could, I would increase the action of the story by making Montag act in defiance of the system in more places in the book. This would give his actions a sense of great accomplishment instead of just another try at what had been tried and failed so many times.This is a good book to teach the value and wealth of knowledge contained in books and arts. Without literature and the arts we can't record the feeling or motives of the present and the future cannot benefit from the great trials and tribulations that the human spirit endures every second of every day."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I originally picked up Farenheit 451 for a summer reading book but in being touched deeply by this book and the realization that the book wasn't on my summer reading list I realized it was much more than just a quick read. I love reading but this book really made me think about how some of my friends despise reading. Now, it doesn't seem like much, but in Guy Montag's society, the main character, reading and just owning books was a crime. I started thinking about how much knowledge can be attained through books, and this book made me think about what books offer. That is because this book offers so much to the reader. The only thing I didn't like about this book was that it had no closing to the story. I personally like closings but some people like to imagine the end and it always works for teachers to have a finish the book kind of project. But anyway, this is a truly great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury writes in 1951 of a future America that is somewhat of a caricature of present day America, where shallowness prevails. In this America book reading is both unpopular and forbidden - and a house containing books is burnt down.Bradbury writes out of love for knowledge and human potential, and out of total disdain for shallowness and mediocracy. Writing in 1951, his ideas leave out the important achievements of non-White civilizations, but this does not take away from the power of his message.I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and found it very stimulating. The language is not merely used to convey ideas ot events - it has a life and beauty of its own.I recommend it to anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 is a great Sci-Fi written by Ray Bradbury .that is about censorship. It is revolves around a man named guy Montag he is a firemen. In that time books are illegal they are against the law to own book and more so to read them. Firemen don't stop fires they start them by burning the books that people have illegally. Liked doing his job until one day a women killed her self for the books she owned. After that Montag plays seesaw from being a fireman or a rebel reading books.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the greatest sci-fi novels I read so far. Ray Bradbury did excellent in this book. His writing is so good that you can see what he is thinking about the pitcher is so vivid that it is like watching a real movie. He also had a great scene of the future he explained every thing well he didn't leave you guessing how the stuff worked. He is truly the greatest book that he is written .The best part of the book is how much information he gives about his character. You can image how Montag would be if he was real.An excellent part of the book is the ending it lives you guessing what is going to happen to him. I think that the author did this so the reader makes the ending whatever you wanted to be. Over the entire book are five stars. This is the best science fiction book I ever read.Fahrenheit is great for the kids that say that books never have anything good in them. It is also good for science fiction readers, it is a great sci-fi book. This is also good for people that believe that the government is controlling us. Or the people that don't like censorship."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of my favorite books. It's a great tale about utopia, censorship, and decline of our collective culture into a mass of visual goo. It's Bradbury at his best. He kind of cheats a little with the ending, but the overall quality and message of the book makes it one of the finest pieces of literature out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel Fahrenheit 451 tells us about a time in the future in which books are illegal to read or posses, and firemen aren't employed to save houses (because they are virtually fire resistant), but to burn books. Guy Montag, a fireman, and the story's main character, enjoys the destruction and burning of the books and he is constantly soaked in the smell of kerosene. Montag had a weird feeling about things, but wasn't quite sure what it was. He was like all the other people, in that he would just keep going ahead to where he was going, not looking at what he was walking past or paying much attention to things. Except one night he stopped and met a girl who told him of the past where people were allowed to think, to read, and to have original ideas for themselves, and the ability to write them down and share them with others.As the story goes on, it deals with his drug-abusing wife and her weird friends. Also there are crews of people that are out to save people that try to committee suicide due to the high suicide rate. The reader discovers the ways that the society works, about how people are not unique, not knowing their own neighbors, and how the television thinks for everyone so that they don't have to.This book shows a future where it is nearly impossible to be a freethinking individual. Ray Bradbury's descriptive writing makes the story easy to read and hard to put down. The story thickens, twists, and curves with every page as Montag is forced to go on the run from a mechanical hound whose only mission is to destroy Montag. It is a book that everyone should try to read. It really makes the reader think about how our future may turn out like this someday."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"this was the first bradbury that i have tackled, so i am not entirely sure if bradbury's style is always so greyfor this book however, the splashing about in the language was a good thing, and fit the material.rather scary how closely the world here resmebles our own, with the mass of the public simply too enveloped in their own ignorance, and happy about it.fairly quick read, and worthwhile."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a future where books are illegal, and the purpose of firemen isn't to put out fires, but to start them. The main character is one such fireman, his job to burn books(from where the book gets it's title---fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which paper burns), and doesn't think twice about it. But gradually, he meets people he finds perplexing, a girl who talks about rain tasting like wine, a woman who stays with her books until she is burned alive. His life is transformed when he hides a book, and opens it...Very engaging, but at times, so deep it makes your head spin."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is very intriguing both in what its theme is and also in how much the main character changes throughout the course of the story. It has great discriptions even if they are abstract and also a great development of characters within an action plot. I would have to say that my favorite character in the entire book was Clarisse. She seemed so soft, so fresh, so new, and so likeable, especially compared with some of the other characters in the book. She was so full of life and the joys she could find in it that I really enjoyed her character and I was very sad when she dies. This book always kept me interested with its implications and its deep meanings and because of that it always kept me thinking. I would have to stop for a few minutes to think about what I had just read but that is a good thing and it made me feel like I became more familiar with the book becuase of it. Overall I think that it is a very well written book in every aspect. The main character though not very likeable in the beginning becomes someone you can and want to cheer for as the book progresses. I really enjoyed reading this book and am glad that I did pick this book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I keep coming back to science fiction written in the 50's and 60's. This novel is a perfect example of why I do this.I've read this a few times now, and it's always a pleasure to do so. It may not be the best written, but since it was one of Bradbury's first novels, I'm prepared to be tolerant of the writing style.The ideas presented here are still fresh and relevant today, and most certainly set the ground work for many of those which followed. It's influence can be seen in King's 'Running Man'(the original Bachman book, not the screenplay), and Ira Levin's 'This Perfect Day'.The central theme of the state imposing what the masses may/may not have access to, and that above all &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot;, can be seen in today's society to some extent.This is undoubtedly a single-sitting novel. Whenever I pick it up to read it, I find that it's easier to read to the end than attempt to put it down and come back to it later when I'm half way through. It is easy to read, and the story flows beautifully from beginning to end. A perfect book for a wet sunday afternoon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 the main character is a fireman named Guy Montag. Guy is a fireman that burns books and sets houses on fire instead of the normal fireman that puts out the flames. During the course of the book Montag goes through many different phases. The most important phase is where he starts wondering about books. Since all his life he has been taught that books are bad and only to burn them, he is curious what books are about. During the time that he is going through his mysterious phases he meets a girl named Clarisse McClellan, who opens her eyes to the emptiness of his life. Montag met this girl one night when he was taking a walk at about midnight. Montag also meets a very important character named Faber. Faber is an old English professor that likes books and knows a lot about them. Over the story Montag has Faber set him up with a retired publisher, to help publish books. At the time that Montag is trying to publish books the fireman are chasing him.Guy Montag is a fireman who suddenly realizes the emptiness of his life and starts to search for meaning in the books he is supposed to be burning. He quickly forms unusually strong bonds with anyone who seems to have true friendship with him. His biggest regret in life is not having a better relationship with his wife. And because he didn't have a very good relationship with his wife that is why she turned him in to the fireman and got there house burned.The way that Ray Bradbury makes this book seem is incredible. He has a special talent that lets him really involve and capture the reader's attention. while I read this book I felt as if I was a silent observer that stood next to Guy Montag every where he went. I loved this book, and would definitely recommend this book to anybody who loves a great adventure and thrill."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":".... this is definitively one of the most philisophically and emotionally charged short novels I have ever read. Bradbury's paints a perfect picture of a future in which we are consumed by mass media. Yet more now than ever it rings true with our consuming obsession with TV and Internet (not that I'm a luddite, but I am constantly torn between the path we're careening off of, and exciting future ahead of us), which is probably one of the most terrifying aspects of the book. The only thing I could possibly think about complaining about is Bradbury's writing style; it's not confusing, but it definitely keeps you on your toes, and can be very unforgiving if you're full attention isn't devoted to it; nonetheless I found myself re-reading some parts, not to better comprehend it but rather to simply admire the deep and insightful observations and allegories Bradbury has created. My father and my step-dad both read this when they were in high school, and I get the impression it's either hit-or-miss, because they are split on whether it was confusing and boring, or if it was absolutely brilliant. I know I dissed Ray's writing style, and it is very spartan and may not suit some, but I also found it had a poetic flowing quality to it (not Dante or anything, but it is still very beautiful). My view is htat it is unquestionably a great work of philosophy, a far cut above most Grishams or novel you pick up ...; so put down that copy of Republic for a moment, and take a little time to read this masterpiece of a novella."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I thought this book was ok. The book is about a firefighter who has to make a decision that could possibly change his life. The firemen have to burn all the books because it is illegal to read.

He is just going through the motions, as he is a puppet. One day a girl named Clarisse opens his eyes and lifts the dark cover from is head and shows him that he is not really happy even though he appears to be as content as can be. He is also not living his own life as an individual but is living like the government wants him to.Fahrenheit 451 takes place sometime in the future in England. After Montag's eyes are opened he decides to do something about it. He sees how corrupt the government is and how it controls the people. Montag's given job, given to him by the government, is to burn books. He thought that that is how life has always been with firefighters burning books instead of putting out fires.All this time is a quest for Montag to find out how to be happy and to make life better for himself and everyone else. I think that the novel was an excellent reading experience. The words spoken really made you think about life now and how the book applies to yourself. \\"Ten minutes after death a man's a speck of black dust.\\" This is an example of the how deep the novel is.I recommend this novel to people who are over 14 years of age. Anybody who is younger might not be able to grasp the meaning of the deeper points and may not appreciate the novel as a whole. Also I recommend this book to people who like to read about the future and \\"what if\\" type of books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's novel Fahrenheit 451, Guy Montag, the main character is a fireman that instead of putting out fires, he starts them because reading and owning books is against the law. The book is set in the future, but we don't know when. We learn that Montag has a stash of books that he has been stealing from houses he had burned that are hidden in his air-conditioning vent. Beatty, his fire chief, tells him he has one day to decide if books are any good then bring the book to work to be burned. Montag had met a retired English professor named Faber at a park a year ago. He reads poetry to Mildred and two of her friends; they get scared and go home. Montag goes to work and hands over one of his books, then the alarm sounds, when they get to the house they realize that it is Montag's house. His wife and her friends had called in the report. Beatty forces him to burn down his own house then places him under arrest, then he turns the flame-thrower on Beatty and knocks down the other firemen. The Mechanical Hound that Beatty had set against Montag injects some anesthetic into his leg. He walks off the numbness and goes to Faber's house. Faber gives Montag some of his clothes and tells him to run out of the city. He follows an abandoned railroad until he finds a group of \\"Book People\\" that have memorized the great works of literature and philosophy.In my opinion, Fahrenheit 451 is hard to understand and enjoy if you don't like futuristic fiction. The plot seemed like it happened too quickly and it doesn't seem realistic. This would probably never happen because people enjoy books too much. The characters don't seem disturbed about the fact that books aren't part of their lives. All they do is sit in their \\"parlors\\" watching TV on huge screens. This book is made more for people that are interested in futuristic novels and censorship. The characters are only used to not having books as a part of their lives, the government controled everything that was printed until society decided that they didn't want books anymore, as to not offend anyone. The people of this society don't think freely or spend time by themselves."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story of &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is a story about censorship in the future. The character of Guy Montag is a firefighter, but his job is to set the fire rather than put it out. The firefighters aren&#65533;t burning the building down, they&#65533;re burning what is inside, books. The government in this time has ruled that a certain list of books must be destroyed. People don&#65533;t think too much in this era, and books make you think, therefore giving people a problem. They all just want to be happy, watching television and listening to the radio. Nobody really cares about anything but their own happiness, so the children are left on their own and sometimes kill each other. There has also been a nuclear war happening for quit some time. One day Montag meets his next-door neighbor, a young girl named Clarisse. She was an exception to the rest of society. She always talked about nature and how beautiful things were. Stuff that Montag (and everyone else) had never even stopped to think about for a second. Claresse&#65533;s thoughts, and the way she talked about things, made her an outcast from this futuristic nightmare. She was considered antisocial because she talked too much. Her radical thoughts greatly opened Montag&#65533;s mind. When he would go to a house to burn the books, he&#65533;d take a book or two and hide them in his house. Montag&#65533;s wife, Mildred, was just like everyone else. She didn&#65533;t talk or think very much. She would just watch T.V. or overdose on sleeping pills. So when she found out about the books she called the fire department to burn them. Montag was astonished to pull up to his own house and have to burn his stolen books. Luckily he hid them in his yard earlier. The fire captain, Beatty, instructed him to burn the house, and Montag did willingly because he had nothing to loose. After he burned the house, he set Beatty on fire, and then he skipped town. He followed the train tracks into the countryside where he met a group of ex-college professors. They all felt the same way about books. Each one of them had a book that they memorized and were one day going to write them down again. Their mission was to put things back the way they used to be decades ago.I can relate to Montag and the ex-college professors because they kept doing something even though it was a crime. They were standing up for what they believed in and were willing to die for their cause. It&#65533;s self-realization, knowing what you believe in and not letting anyone tell you different. If people didn&#65533;t stand up for what they believe, than we probably wouldn&#65533;t have cars or even electricity. New ideas and free thinkers are what made our lives so easy today.I liked this book because it is so much like our society today. The way that people drive fast, the way people use drugs, and people are lazy and hardly go outside anymore. Also the way the government controls and limits our freedoms. They tell us how we can and can&#65533;t express ourselves. New ideas are becoming scary to the average person, and we can&#65533;t do anything without offending someone. It&#65533;s really freaky how much it compares to today considering this book was made in the 50&#65533;s.I think people should read this book if they want to open their eyes a little bit. I think what happened in &#65533;Fahrenheit 451&#65533; is happening to our world, and it is kind of scary because it is all too possible. But it won&#65533;t happen if people get involved in their politics and tell the government what they want, rather than letting congress do what they think is necessary to make the people happy. So think a little more, and we won&#65533;t be horribly destroyed by a vicious nuclear weapon."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his reading list.

I read Fahrenheit 451 for class, and I enjoyed it, though it's somewhat disturbing. In a futuristic world, firemen don't put out fires, the set fires, and burn books. Guy Montag is a fireman, who has always been satisfied with his job, until he meets Clarisse, a seventeen year old who changes how he thinks about everything...Ray Bradbury has a very distinctive writing style, which I noticed in Dandelion Wine, which I read a while ago. I would say Fahrenheit 451 is a much better book; the writing is better and the subject matter more interesting. The society depicted in the book is really scary. Mildred, Montag's wife, is always watching her three-wall television (she wants a four wall). It's interactive too, so she can take part in the shows. She's almost always watching it or listening to her Seashell (earphones).Clarisse and Faber are both really interesting characters. I think I would probably get along with Clarisse. Now, books being really important to me, I found this book super disturbing, and not altogether unrealistic. Though written in the 50's, it bears a certain resemblance to the increasing consumerism of today. Bradbury builds suspense and dread with his foreshadowing (for example, the Hound not liking Montag).I've been planning to read The Martian Chronicles for a while now, and Fahrenheit 451 motivated me to do so. I would highly recommend this excellent Ray Bradbury novel. Update: Not going to read The Martian Chronicles. I don't like scary science fiction. That scene where the Martians pretend to be the astronauts' relatives and kill them is really creepy.[...]"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to buy the book right away, My son need for school. it was late at night. so just click it from amazon it is great to have that power"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Short book, wondering why the author didn't make it longer, and i wish this book had a little more action."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was not assigned to read it in school, so I wanted to know why it was such big choice of school districts.

Ray Bradbury'sFahrenheit 451: A Novelis the tale of a future where books are deemed to be too dangerous for public utilization, and therefore illegal. In this future world, firemen no longer extinguish flames, but rather they douse piles of parchment and binding in kerosene before setting them ablaze, effectively exterminating not only the physical objects themselves, but also the potentially subversive ideas contained therein. Published in 1953, but as fresh today as it has ever been, it follows the plight of fireman Montag as he discovers the power of the words he has been unquestioningly eradicating. Armed with that knowledge, he gets drawn into a resistance movement.Half a century before they became realities, this visionary work predicted the rise and widespread deployment of security cameras, flat-screen televisions that cover a whole wall, and interactive reality TV. Bradbury's imagination and heart were boundless and on display nowhere more than inFahrenheit 451: A Novel- his best-known and best work. Let it be a primer for a further exploration of this prolific writer's work."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this out loud with my high school student. It was her assigned summer reading. I remembered reading this a long time ago or watching the movie. One remarkable thing about the book is how Bradbury describes the future where we are locked in houses and tied to a community of media devices. Because it was written at the dawn of television, I find it facinating that Bradbury would predict a world so similar to life now.The language in the book is very dynamic. It is a great book to read out loud. There is wonderful tension in the plot as the fireman turned rebel tries to escape the nazi-like government.This is the book about book burning. I was in Split, Croatia last summer and our guide pointed out where the Nazis burned the books in the town square. It sent shivers up my spine. You will feel that when you read this book, a book that cautions us about totalitarianism and social isolation."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury is my favorite sci fi author. The book is full of poetic imagery, and thoughtful commentary of the direction he saw society heading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is important because the readers need to know what happens when the government seizes upon cultural rot to take control of all information in a society. That Montag has no understanding of what is happening around him, but that he becomes curious is the catalyst for the events that happen.Even his own wife and loved ones turn on him, when the government decided to withhold its television based nightmare. Socially, I think this novel is one that all people can grasp today. What would happen today if the NFL or Baseball or College Football were interrupted? That is why presidents, and not just Obama, use those things as stages for their political events.Why is the government so intent on perpetuating things like political correctness in our society? That is because if you control the information, you control the people. If there are only a few actually curious people, then the government can marginalize them and destroy them. A whole society of curious people is not what the power brokers want. They don't want to answer questions, and they sure don't want people to insist on personal freedom as a point of personal identity.Fahrenheit 451 deals with all these. From the mysterious death of Clarisse McKenzie, to Montag's ironic job. And the punishment in the hyper-managed society is reserved for those who want to seek out knowledge. The metaphor put forward by Faber is also salient to our current time, by the time we meet him we find that the class of intellectuals will be bullied out of existence. Our constitutional republic cannot be saved by looking to the educated professors to save us, as they are all cowards. It is the people, the populace at large who needs to be educated. And remember, the country will keep itself ignorant because that is what the government class wants. They know, you don't need to. \\"Trust Us.\\" is what they will say. It should make us recoil. The most dangerous words in the world: \\"I'm from the government and I'm here to help.\\" They never do. And the people still sit by and let them destroy our nation.We need to teach this novel to all children. They need to know that their freedom depends not on the guarantee by the government but on their own initiative and their complete skepticism every time a government agent tells them they will take care of it. That includes teachers and school administrators. How far down the road to being Mildreds are we? I'd say farther than anyone would like to think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I bought this book after Ray Bradbury died because the obituaries said that this was his best work. I did not know what to expect.The book is about a future in which [almost] everyone live vicariously through the lives of others delivered via technology. The system prohibits independent thinking or feeling and actually used the fire department to burn up anyone that is a 'problem'.As I see more people (myself included) using their cell phones, social media, and on-line entertainment, I see our society moving in this direction. It is amazing to me that Bradbury created this dystopian vision many years in advance of the current technology that almost makes it possible today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a must-read in the sci-fi genre. I've read it a few times now and the more I read it the more I enjoy it. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Read this book slowly and with a highlighter! There are so many wonderful gems and meaningful quotes. Fahrenheit 451 is a must read as it has been very influential on our modern culture. The irony is I own the Kindle version of this book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazingly relevant for our times. Story is a little odd and wordy, but it is an excellently crafted piece that will go down in history as a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book many years ago and enjoyed it then and having re read it was suprised that it was better than I remembered."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I just finished Fahrenheit 451 and feel like I did when someone gave me a shareware version of a video game. I learned the moves, became someone addicted, cleared the third level and found that I needed a code to get the rest of the game. Only Ray didn't give away the code to 451!This is clearly a fantastic story, horribly well written. I have wish listed several more of his books for future reading. Unfortunately 451 is long enough that you suspend some of the caveats used when reading short stories. With a book this long, I want developed characters to be resolved. Several characters just go away, which left me lacking at the end. Sometimes this is intended, and strong. In this case, it seemed thoughtless and abrubt.Don't miss the afterword and coda at the end. Very nice additions."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It truly is. Ray Bradbury's masturfully told story of censorship in the future show us what we may become: A civilization of mindless people who are so bent on being PC and &quot;happy&quot; that they end up burning all books. While that is a rough description, I don't wish to give too much away. Bradbury's characters all act realistically (something im a stickler for) and I love the way he writes, using metaphors constantly he achieves an amazing level of description while still leaving some things for the reader to figure out. People have told me that the beginning is confusing; while I don't feel that is true, if you do kepp reading because the last 100 pages (out of only around 200) will rivet your eyes to the pages. Personally, I love Ray Bradbury and feel that this is his greatest work, or one of them. But you don't have to like Bradbury to like this novel; if you want a great book that will truly make you think, and just a great read, by all means pick this one up. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the finest books I have ever read, and certainly high in my ranking of Bradbury's novels. Bradbury paints a picture, in his very colorful way, of a completely governmentally-controlled society in which books are outlawed and television reigns over all. Guy Montag, a fireman (whose job description now involves burning illegal books), finds himself stuck in this mixed-up world, and eventually make a decision between what he knows and what he believes in, illustrating Bradbury's almost universal theme of conflict versus change. This novel is very applicable in today's society, even though it was written nearly fifty years ago, dealing with topics that are still active in the present. Bradbury provides a moral of sorts within this novel which conveys many of his deep-set beliefs, such disdain for television, hatred for censorship, and Bradbury's undeterrable love for books and the printed word. Very enlightening, reading this book will definitely cause one to think twice about many of today's common practices. A very thought-provoking and well-written novel; this book should be read by any fan of science fiction, if not everyone!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Could we end up like this in our future? What would the world be like without books?? This story gives us some insight into what it might be like... and it's pretty scary. It is definitely food for thought regarding censorship.The book paints a dim and scary picture of a future society where all books have been banned. Firemen no longer fight fires, the set them to destroy houses found to have books. With the removal of books, people have turned their attentions to TV and as a result the general population is unable to think for themselves and their minds have turned to mush. The main character begins to challenge these concepts of censorship after meeting a young teen-ager who stirs his curiousity. The more he thinks about and challenges the 'norms' of society his world is turned upside down.This book really makes you think about censorship and where it can lead. The book is very relevant to the debate going on about censoring today's music (as well as books, tv and movies). You can't put limits on creativity and self expression without limiting the society as a whole."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The amazing thing about this book, is that it was written so long ago, yet it predicted many technological things that have happened recently. What makes it ironic is, is that the plot is basically about book burning, and banning and the absurdity of it all. YET it is a banned book itself. Could it have predicted this? Maybe. But, basically, this book has a great story and plot, on whatever level you read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Amazingly, I just read this book for the first time, although I've heard about it for years. While reading, I found myself constantly rechecking the copyright page to verify that Ray Bradbury did indeed write this book in 1953, almost 50 years ago. Back then he somehow knew what was coming; so much of what he writes in the book is actually happening to us today. We want things faster and faster, and fewer and fewer people are reading. I often talk with my students about reading; many say they just don't have the time, while others would rather see the movie. Bradbury even predicted the increase in violence in our schools.While reading the book, I shared the story with my ten-year-old. He was intrigued with the story of Guy Montag, the renegade fireman. So intrigued that he is going to have his literature circle at school read the book. I think this book should be required reading for everyone. There is so much we can learn from it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 wan an enjoyable read. It started out a little slow, but came to a tension filled climax. The tension of the ending was well worth the slow reading in the beginning. In the beginning we get to find out the life of the main character (Montag). We are given an understanding of what his every day goings on in the future are. We are told what his job entails and how important it is for the society that he lives in. The middle and end of this book is when the story gets good. We learn how unneccessary books are and why they are seen as evil. We see Montag go from anti-books to pro-books with the help of a freind (Faber). We watch as Montag comes up with a plan to try to make books a part of society again. Fahrenheit 451 is the degree at which paper burns. This is a good title because the whole story is about how books are as illegal or even more illegal as present day drugs. Books are to be incenerated. They are worthless in the future. All in all Fahrenheit 451 is a good science fiction book. Once the reader gets past the slow beginning, they are in for an enjoyable treat. The reader will be swept away into a future where reading is considered useless because nothing will be gained except confusion. This is not true about this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As I looked up this book after reading it, I saw it had an average rating of only four stars. What was wrong with it? People claim they don't understand it, but it's very simple and clear. And what is wrong with it? This book is classic, and is one of the most perfect foretellings of the future ever. Read it and ignore the two star reviewers."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is a great way to explore what might happen in the near future if the public decides to allow technology do everything for them. It shows the power of popular thought, and also shows its distructiveness. I would not say this novel is science fiction, even though it has some qualities of that. I would call this book a classic, and wonderful. Bradbury really grabs the reader with the way he discribes everything. It is almost like reading a collection of poems that are in sequence. I highly recommend this wonderful master piece."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book blew me away, but to appreciate it, you must understand how technology has affected us and how we already act. Plus, you must understand, that this book was written in the 50s where they thought we would be even further in the future.In the time of Guy Montag, no book-readers were free. they were behind bars, or running from the law; and he was one of the people who put them there.this book is so moving and compelling i could only grasp the rhythm of Bradbury and his magnificent language that lets you know the fear and hatred of Montag.Before you start, you need to know that this book will be weird and confusing. You must appreciate philosophy and know how strange this world is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I know it's criminal not to like a classic book....but different strokes right? The concept is a communistic approach, and is an amazing concept. I just found it tough to read, slow, tough to get into, and not ground breaking, or profound at all. I was pretty disappointed in this book, found it a litte boring, and while it's very pointed it just wasn't for me. I prefer Animal Farm to this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm sorry seeing as everyone considers this book a &quot;classic&quot;, I hate to disappoint you , but it is not that wonderful of a book. I did not particularly enjoy this book. I was forced to read it for my 8th Grade AP English class and wasn't very thrilled about it. Bradbury goes on for pages of poetic nonsense that many don't and wouldn't want to understand. The book has a wonderful message and I am disappointed in Bradbury for this horrible representation of such a wonderful theme. Too many questions left unanswered for the mind to ponder. I mean who doesn't like thinking about a book?? Well I certainly do but there are just too many loose ends. And the characters aren't elaborated on enough. They are almost all left as flat charachters which doesn't make for a most enjoyable book. Many have read and many have been disappointed. Bradbury has many other works, I highly reccomend reading one of those instead of this book which lacks good plot or character development. It also has very little plot action and isn't very interesting. So take my advice and DO NOT READ THIS BOOK."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was suggested to me to read over the summer. We had read some of Ray Bradbury's other books in school and I hadn't liked them, but i thought i might like this one. I didn't. Even though it is suggested for students older than me I think I still understood it enough to have reasons for not liking it. First of all, I didn't find any certain plot to it. You could understand that the main character was not happy, but nothing told you why clearly. I found it very boring because of the way they went from one event to another without really tying them together. Also,the way the author compared the characters thoughts to real life examples most of the time didn't make very much sense and sometimes you couldn't tell the difference between something really happening or if it was all in their mind. From the start it did not seem to be going anywhere. I would not suggest this book to anyone of my age or anyone interested in adventure books, because this isn't. The only thing i can say i liked about this book is the character Clarisse McClellan, she seemed intersting and I think she should have played a more active role in the story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book in my sophomore Honors English class. Basically, it is about book-burning and the importance of books. BUT IF YOU WANT TO IMPART TO YOUR STUDENTS THE IMPORTANCE OF READING, LET THEM READ SOMETHING THAT IS AT LEAST INTERESTING! Instead of having your students read Fahrenheit 451, let them read DUNE (and don't say it's bad because the movies were!), or HARLAN ELLISON, or PHILIP K. DICK. NOT this pocket-protector, suit and tie business writer, Bradbury. I've tried reading some of his other stuff. He's not that good. This book was okay, but nothing great and certainly nothing I would spend money on or read again. Have you ever heard of &quot;show, don't tell&quot;? This book only TELLS why books are important. But let the student read a good book and that will SHOW them why books are important. This is one of many rotten books that I have read in High School.

There were two books our teacher made us read that I hate with a passion this is one of them. I could not stand the way Bradbury writes most authors would say the pit pat of rain he would say the pit pat pit pat pit pat and so on for half a page it was royally annoying and as far as what the guy said about it being about individuality and conformity if you want to read about that read Ayn Rand's Anthem. It is much better, and deserves its status as a classic unlike this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is the story of a man who rediscovers his humanity in a future where there is no genuine thought, no intimitate contact, no passionate emotion. His premise is interesting enough, especially in light of the present state of our culture, however his execution is embarrassingly bad.The plot is predictable and hoaky, the characters are boringly flat, and the dialogue--perhaps the biggest drawback of the book--is wooden and unrealistic. Interspersed throughout all of this soap opera melodrama are dreary, quodlibetic references to Shakespeare, Bacon, Milton...you get the picture.It dawned on me as I was nearing the end of this book that Bradbury could easily have been the child of Ayn Rand and Jacques Barzun. Hamfisted, cardboard fiction from mommy, and tired pedantry from daddy. To be fair, there are a few well-penned lines, and he definitely has a point. But if you're interested in nightmarish visions of a futuristic dystopia, check out Orwell or Huxley. Bradbury basically took their stories and mashed them together anyway.Again, I can't stress enough the importance of this book's message. Nevertheless, this book, as vehicle for that message, definitely has a flat tire."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are looking for a story about a dystopian society in which the government censors people's entire lives to the point where citizens aren't even allowed to read, then Fahrenheit 451 the perfect book for you. In the book, Guy Montag is a fireman who burns down houses with books hidden within them. He starts out really dedicated to the job, but then he meets a girl one night walking home from the fire station that really gets him thinking about how he is living his life. Guy begins to rethink everything he does and decides to fight the system. The idea of the story is fantastic; however the writing is not the greatest. The way Ray Bradbury writes is highly confusing. He uses metaphors, symbolism and similes like there is no tomorrow. He also has a tendency to jump from one topic to the next, one time to the next and one mood to the next. When he is talking about the Salamander when going out on a call to look for, and burn books, he describes the Salamander in great detail and then just switches to talking about the house, at which they have just arrived, without saying anything about the house until after the explanation of the house. So while the reader thinks Bradbury is still describing the Salamander he has actually gone into talking about a house instead. All in all, the book had a great point being that if someone challenges you; challenge them in return for what you believe to be right and just. However the style of writing just didn't agree with the way my mind thinks. But if you are someone who enjoys metaphors and jumpy writing, this would be a good choice for you to look in to reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In my humble opinion, I find it is riduculous that eBooks cost more than books printed with ink and paper."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hi!I guess I didn't look too carefully and missed that text to speech was not enabled.Is there a way to get the publisher to change their mind?Thanks,per"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This summer we read this book. I hated this book for several reasons. First of all, the story was way too jumpy. It started slow, and then randomly got fast. It had absolutly no suspense to it. I found myself forcing myself to read! I couldn't relate to any of the characters! For instance, some of the characters were too boring. Maybe if I read this book in this book in ten years I would have a different opinion. Another reason why I didn't like this book, is because the characters weren't seen enough. They were all just thrown in at different times. You didn't feel like you got to know them very well and I hate that. I would not recommend this book. I think that Ray Bradbury needs to rethink his book ideas! I do not want to be critical of Ray Bradbury, but really I couldn't stand this book. It had no meaning to me. It also, had a poor plot and setting. For instance, it was plotted in the future yet it was no different than today. I don't plan on reading anymore or Ray Bradbury's books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Heyyyy I had to read this book for school and it was the worst thing I ever read.

The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the worst book I have ever read in my whole life. I was forced to read it in school, and I disguised the book starting at the first page. There is absolutely nothing good in the book. It makes no sense, and I personally don't think the world will become to be, as predicted in this book. I also find this book very offensive to my religious beliefs. How can a book that takes the name of the Lord in vain, in almost every page, be used as a class novel. Everyone knows that taking the Lord's name in vain is breaking one of God's commandments, and is a sin. I have never read a book that was as bad as Fahrenheit 451 in language. I don't understand how the school boards can justify such a book, and use it for classes. Anyone who hasn't read this book, don't waste your time!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Confusing, disturbing, and stupid are some of the few words to use when describing this book.

Don't waste your time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book had some very good qualities. The novel leaves your mind provoked into hypothetical situations like the ones in the book.

While reading this book you will learn about censorship and how important it is in socity today.

The concept of this story originates from the time of WWII in which Hitler's Regime was burning libraries across Europe in an attempt to prevent the distribution of knowledge and other negative ideas that could affect his rise to power. This book is an exciting tale about a world in which firemen no longer extinguish fires, but instead start them. The firemen in this world burn all books and the houses in which they are contained.We feel that this story, despite its dark tone, is a well-written modern day classic that makes the reader better respect books and not take them for granted. I highly recommend this book to anyone that wishes to read a thought-provoking story that provides insight into our future. An interesting aspect of this novel is how well it connects with our world today. Our society is becoming more and more reliant on technology and is becoming less interested in education, which sadly enough, is the same story in Fahrenheit 451. Could this be a reality for our world in the near future?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is wonderful.

Bradbury is one of my favorite authors, I've read all of his works. I see that others may not have liked this book, but I suggest that you try it. Bradbury typically bases his books around the unwinding of human civilization, the villian is the technology we have created. In 451, he revisits the theme, and does a fantastic job. I love this book, and if you like try his others. If you've read and loved 1984, you will love the excitement of Fahrenheit 451. In short, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book hearing that it was &quot;pretty good.&quot; What I was expecting was a traditional science fiction novel of good vs. bad and a weird plot. But Fahrenheit 451 was so REAL, it left me in tears. On the surface, it's entertaining, and a person with little patience will definitely find it boring but this story carries an important concept: Is censorship REALLY ok? I know very well that this book was written nearly 50 years ago, and describes a dark vision of the future. But this so-called &quot;vision&quot; is terrifyingly similiar to our own society and its present situation. Are we truly headed for the same fate described in the end of this literary masterpiece?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was a great book, definitely something you can discuss in a group setting.

Great read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an excellent book for someone who is into pondering the meaning of life and stuff like that. However, it's not the light, entertaining book that some may be looking for. Most of the book is a metaphor, and if the reader is willing to think about what is represented so much can come from this book. The idea of the book is fascinating and Bradbury's demonstrates his point perfectly with his amazing word choice. There are so many themes and life changing lessons that can be pulled out of this book. If the reader dives beneath the surface of this book, they will get a whole lot more from this book than they would from a cheesy love story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury did an excellent job writing Fahrenheit 451. Set in a future time period, Guy Montag is a fireman but he doesn't stop fires, he usually creates them. Most of the time he burns books, one of the many things that are censored from the society in Fahrenheit 451.Ray Bradbury is great at writing descriptions. On the first page he describes Montag burning books buy saying, \\"It was a special pleasure to see things eaten, to see things blackened and changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history.\\" The whole book is full of descriptions like this. Most of the time this is a good thing because it kept me interested but sometimes descriptions seem a little too long and are just dragged out.The story instantly captures you within the first ten pages or so. The book is generally an easy read and was interesting all through out and made me want to keep reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury is a very smart man. Reading this book alone is not good enough to experience it's full greatness. This was one of the few books i enjoyed analyzing, because when you analyze Bradbury you catch on to a lot of little easter eggs that you would never catch while your just reading it through for fun. This book will definantly make you look twice at the people around you and how they think. If you're interested in psychology i think you would enjoy this book. I read it in a bout a week and the diction is some of the best i've ever read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fire is one of the kindest, cruelest, most beautiful, grotesque forces that nature has mothered into this world. It has the ability to take down and to cleanse at the same time and to allow for new things to grow or start over. The fire that burns inside Montag, the protagonist of Ray Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the burning desire to know the value that books truly have in the world and why society is so against them.The darkness of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is evident because of its modern texture and present day technology (such as the T.V.) and the stranglehold that it has on even today's society. You'd be hard pressed to find a home without a television and even more hard-pressed to find a home that truly values books above all else. Ray Bradbury's futuristic society is full of self-inflicted censorship and ignorance, which is a little discomforting because it is so modern. One is tempted to ask, \\"Why would a society bring about its own ignorance and censorship regulations?\\" The answer is simple: people fear those who are intellectually superior to them and also envy the brains that they were blessed with. Compare this phenomena to a competitive sport: when you compete you do the best you can and you think that you are doing a really good job then, out of nowhere, some one else comes out who does a far better job than you did not because he worked harder then you but because he was just more talented. Further more, in a fast moving society who really has time for books anymore when its so much easier to sit in front of the boob tube and receive a much more stimulating experience without the need to really think?\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a bundle of motifs and symbols. One of these motifs is the recurring quotes referring to nature. \\"The sun burnt every day. It burnt Time . . . Time was busy burning the years and the people anyway, without any help from him. So if he burnt things with the firemen and the sun burnt Time, that meant that everything burnt!\\" This quote is said when Montag realizes that he must never burn again. He realizes that the sun burns because it has to and seeing as it won't stop burning, he and the fireman must never burn again.Ray Bradbury was very against censoring in any form whether it was censoring out words in books or songs, or the news keeping people from knowing what is really going on in the world. The result of his views are cultivated in this book and overall \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a fluid, well designed book that utters to us the warnings of the unforeseen effects of censorship: when we bring about our own constrained views upon a part of culture that has been around for such a long time, we will have a society that will begin to eat itself away and we will be forced to start all over again, and have nothing to work with but scraps of a lost world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love this book.

Having read it now, I can see what the benefit of reading it school would have been. Books read in school are discussed and examined in detail. This book would lend itself well to that type of in depth analysis.I am glad that I at least read this book, although I found it only okay. I think in a school setting I would have enjoyed it much more. I just didn't find it as captivating or emotional as other books I've read.I have the 50th anniversary edition, which contains an interview with Ray Bradbury about the 50th anniversary, and how he feels about the success of the book. It was quite insightful and interesting to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wow, what a great book about a dystopian society, censorship, and the need of the state to keep the masses blind, deaf, and dumb.

It is now one of my favorites!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Got the book for my son's English Honors class and as he read it I actually enjoyed it. It was very interesting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is by the conventions of literature is not a great book, and Ray Bradbury himself admits so. It is far too melodramatic, and the protagonist Guy Montag uninteresting and merely a plot device. The writing is harried and convoluted, and the plot both unbelievable and shoddy. In many ways, it's a pale imitation of George Orwell's much darker and sinister \\"1984.\\" But it's a prophetic and haunting book that has predicted all too well the decline of a mass capitalistic society into a hedonistic lifestyle obsessed with instantaneous gratification.Even today, it's a compelling and frightening read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I began reading the book Fahrenheit 451 I did not enjoy it very much. But after I put more time into reading this book I started to like it more and more. One of the reasons I liked the book so much was because of the great detail, but it still leaves room for you to think about what is going on. Ray Bradbury's vision of the future does not seem to far fetch for me. With how our society is, and the love for television I could see how the banning of books can occur. This has already happened in history before.This story is about a fireman Guy Montag and his life. His job is to burn books and the houses they are in. He is happy with this until his young neighbor Clarisse Mcclellan. She shows him how horrible the society the live in really is and changes his views in several ways. All of the symbolism in this book was so amazing once you understood it. Light and dark, symbolizing good and bad, was used often in Fahrenheit 451. I also enjoy how rolls reverse in this book, like in our society and in the future society. In the book the fireman are completely the opposite of what ours are today, also in the future society you can not drive under the speed minimum or you get a ticket. This shows how the government doesn't want people to take there time because they could have time to think about new and interesting thins. One thing I didn't like about the book was that throughout it the author goes into less detail about how the society in which they live in is ran and more detail on how he goes about living in it. But I think the author did this to get focus on the problem at hand. I enjoyed how the author makes you find the under lying meaning in the book and that is a good aspect in my opinion. I also like how the book can be compared to Hitler and what he was doing when he was in control of the German government. The way the society does not like having freethinkers and having open minds is almost exactly like what Hitler was trying to do to the people of Germany. I think it is great how it shows how far ahead of his time the author was. I think his interpretation of the future could be accurate.My overall opinion of the book is it is a good read. It can become boring at times but it can also be extremely exciting at points too. I would recommend this book to anyone that likes the thought of futuristic societies and what can happen to the world after we leave. I think it is a very well written book but doesn't define some of its characters as well as it should. But that isn't a reason to not read the book. I think anyone could enjoy reading this book. It makes you think and has so many metaphors and similes that at some points are too much. But it is a great book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My initial thought of the book, after reading the back cover, was this is going to be very corny. After putting much time into reading the story, I was surprised when it turned out to be one of the best books I have ever read.One of the key ingredients for my much love for the book was the sufficient detail, but still leaving room for you to interpret it in your own way. The glimpse of the future does not seem so far fetched. With the new interest in television over a book, and the \\"un-colorblind\\" society, book burning would seem like a good answer.I enjoyed the book, it was a fun read, and portrayed what may happen later in our time. The story is about Guy Montags life as a \\"fireman\\", one who destroys books by burning them. He is challenged by a younger girl, his neighbor, and notices the horror of his times. One thing I did notice with the story, however, was some parts in the book were very well described, and others I wish had more explanation. For example, more details on how the society is run, and set up would have been nice. I think the author may of done this to keep the focus on the point of the story, but I felt I was missing things when \\"painting my picture\\". During my period of reading the book, I couldn't help but compare the story to that of incidents of book burnings during the Second World War. The government in Fahrenheit 451can be compared to Hitler, and his drive too uneducated the people of his generation, and erase all evidence of their past.This book requires you to read between the lines, to get the under lying meaning, which is a great aspect in my opinion. It stupefies me on how a writer so long ago, could accurately portray what exactly is happening in our society, for this reason I alone I read the book cover to cover, and made special note of other areas of prediction. I read other reviews before reading the story myself; I noticed that many of the reviewers felt there were too many metaphors. I don't think this should be a reason not to read this book.I enjoyed this book very much, and would recommend it to any one that asked. It is a must read classic. Bradbury's interpretation of the future is none but awe inspiring."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a very intresting and mind boggling book. It made me realize how important books are in society, and just how much books really do influence your reality. In F451 the government was afraid to let the people have their own ideas. They wanted the community to think what they wanted them to think. The people were so caught up on their material items, that they even forgot about thinking of humans as real human beings. Most people in this particular community did not \\"talk\\" with one another, they would rather sit in front of the T.Vs. After a while the community wasn't even people anymore, they were robots. They did what the government wanted them to do, when it wanted them to do it. They lost all sense of individuality and idealism.

This book made me think about where our society could be heading. It made me realize how important books are and how awful it would be if it was illegal to read! The only bad thing about this book is that there were many metaphores. Becuase there were so many metaphores I didn't always know if certain things were really happening or if he was just using figurative language. Despite this, the book was very good and made me think very hard about how important books really are."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In L.A. our class read this book. At first I did not like this book because it was not exciting. When I got to the second chapter the story was getting more interesting because Guy Montag started to go against the government rules about reading books. Guy's captain, Beatty, starts catching on to Guy about bringing books to his house. Towards the end I really started to enjoy it because Guy burns Beatty and runs away. Guy meets these other firemen who also started to read books and ran away. It was a good book.

I hope that in the future this will never happen in our society, talking to the TV, come on people! We need books!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I personally enjoyed Fahrenheit 451 very much. I do think that Bradbury's writing style is unique and packs a lot into a small amount of space, but I disagree that the aesthetic qualities are the highlight of his writing. I think that the ideas behind the story are what makes the book so compelling.I also disagree that the book is lacking due to a missing thick plot. I think that the lack of petty details about how exactly the society is set up or functions helps both the author and the reader to remain focused on the ideas. I think that there is a clear enough explanation for the way in which the society went from not being interested in books to burning them. As time passed more advanced forms of technology replaced reading as the mainstream form of entertainment, and people were less attached to books. Then the government that is in place at the time the story is told takes over, and decides to have all books burned. Not all people in the novel burn books, only the firefighters, and the whole thing is very regulated by the government. The government makes this decision to get rid of the possibility of people gaining knowledge pertaining to ideas about revolutions, and better ways of life. This way the people will blindly accept the government, and be content even though their lives lack any real relationships.The story is an exaggeration of problems Bradbury sees in society and of fears of what could happen in the future. It forces the reader to think about how we spend our time, how much we really know or don't know, and how much is within our control."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this book i found it very interesting how the book just progresses through every thing in an instant im a matter of a snap of the fingers and nothing else in the story matters but Guy Montag himself. For example there would be a girl and she would just com into play but then the auther just kills her off and the ending i found was just a stop to leave you wonder what would happen if the auther finished it off. Overall this book was very good as the story goes on you get into it and why write a book about burnning books? :)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury combines controversy with a touch of suspense in his novel Fahrenheit 451. In the future where &quot;firemen&quot; burn books and the houses they are in, the conflict between rescuing the past and burning it comes to life. Guy Montag, a &quot;fireman,&quot; struggles with his everyday life of burning books, and the life that the next-door neighbor, seventeen-year-old Clarisse, introduces into his mind. Captain Beatty, the fire chief, tries to convince Montag that the life of burning books is the only way to go, that is until Montag meets another &quot;book saver&quot;, a retired college professor, who helps him decide what is right. Bradbury's conflicts between wrong and right are those that have been handed down over generations and will be for generations to come. Morals take over in this battle of instinct and actuality, as Montag joins a group to try and save the books of the world. From adventurous chases to confidential meetings, this book will keep you on the edge of your seat until the very last page."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury takes place far in the future in the suburbs of a big city. The name of the main character is Guy Montag and he is a fireman, but instead of putting out fires he lights them. In his society books are banned. If anyone is found to be keeping these illegal objects, their houses are burned down. Montag meets a girl named Clarisse, and she makes him question what he does every day. The main conflict begins when Montag begins to steal books and hide them in his house. He realizes how important they are and what the government is hiding from its people. He is immediately motivated to do something about this. He seeks the help of Faber, a book-keeper who Montag knows about but never reported. Faber is not at all hopeful, but he agrees to help Montag preserve books. Together they read books and store the words in their minds, saving the information for later.In Fahrenheit 451, Ray Bradbury describes things by gshowingh instead of gtellingh. On page 75, Bradbury describes being inside the virtual parlor, which is surrounded by video screens. gHe was a victim of concussion. When it was all over he felt like a man who had been thrown from a cliff, whirled in a centrifuge and spat out over a waterfall that fell and fell into emptiness and emptiness and never-quite-touched-bottom-no-never-never-quite touched bottom. The thunder faded. The music died.h This is a very interesting book, but most of it is fairly depressing. It is all about the government controlling what people think. gfWhatfs going on?f Montag had rarely seen that many house lights. eOh, just my mother and father and uncle sitting around, talking. Itfs like being a pedestrian, only rarer. My uncle was arrested another timedid I tell you?for being a pedestrian. Oh, wefre most peculiar.f eBut what do you talk about?fh This quote shows how deprived the society is of anything that actually means something. This book was written on experiences that Ray Bradbury had like actually being stopped by the police for walking. The one thing that makes this book different from other science fiction is that the plot of Fahrenheit 451 is so believable that it seems like we are in danger of it happening.Fahrenheit 451 carries some valuable lessons. The largest message in the book is that we should not let books become obsolete. Even if we use the Internet and watch TV more and more, we should still read books and value them because, as Faber says, gBooks donft tell things, they tell the meaning of things.h He also says that books are not important, but that they are just a receptacle for things we are afraid we might forget. This is a reoccurring theme that appears throughout this excellent book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is an important book for every person to read. It shows us the importance of books and the role they play in society. I enjoyed this book when I read it in high school. As a writer and lover of books, this novel only made me love literature even more. We are quite privileged to have books in our society. If there is ever a time when books are banned or burned, society will be in deep trouble. Freedom to read whatever we choose is one of the blessings of being educated people. Fahrenheit 451 should be read by anyone who is even capable of reading.Zachary B. MedinaAuthor of Decador"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's 2011 and I have just finished reading the book for my first time. I am currently attending college and due to the amount of reading I have had in past years it was hard for me to bring myself to reading other books as well; related to laziness / lack of motivation.This year, however, has brought a new change upon me. I have made it my goal to read at least 1 - 2 different books each week which are not related whatsoever to school material -- and let me tell you, I am happy I have. Textbooks are boring, dry, and repetitive. Books such as Fahrenheit 451 and others I have purchased open your mind and make you think in different ways.Anyways, I have a few friends who suggested this book to me which lead me to purchasing it. I knew \\"book-burning\\" was going to play a factor before I even opened it. But, while reading this short novel I have noticed that Fahrenheit 451 plays a much bigger concept. It's hard to believe that this book was wrote in the 50's for how prophetic and how much it can relate to our currect society and perhaps the society to come.There is no doubt TV (Bradbury comparison to the 'Walls') has killed free thinking. I have read numerous works on Media Control, Propaganda, and how TV controls minds. Think about it. What do Americans buy? The item they see on TV advertised by their favorite 'celebrity'. Who do young girls wish to be like? Models on TV, Actresses, others they see in magazines. How can you gain support for a war? Mass propaganda on TV about WMD's. How can you get your President elected? Spend the most money on advertising for the campaign. You can broadcast anything you like, if you have the money, to sway public opinion one way or another and it proves that TV controls Americans.I'm 21 - I find it hilarious the amount of TV watched by people my age and defintely younger. Some of my friends can sit their whole Saturday and Sundays infront of their HDTV's watching College Football and the NFL. Kids under my age are absorbed by TV shows on MTV, nothing ever meaningful to expand your mind; you could make the claim that watching shows such as Jersey Shore may even make you less intelligent, that's for another time though haha.To close, the book shows great implications where society is heading and how society is today. In the book, Clarisse, explains how people drive fast and how they don't acknowledge the world around them. I took this in a sense that Americans work, work, work, constantly, to provide for the family / themselves. We are always in a rush. We rarely stop to observe the world around us or take a look at what really is going on and enjoy being on Earth. We are tied to working to survive. Life is too short not to admire the beauty that may be around you; if you take the time to look, that is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Enjoyed it thoroughly - I had never read it - am not usually a sci-fi fan, but it's truly a classic"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I didn't think I'd like this book as much as I did.

Early in the book he meets a young girl who causes him to change his thoughts on everything that has been existing in his life forever. The book follows his journey through the world.SettingThe book was originally written in 1953, and the time frame for the book was set in the 90's or early 2000's. Anyway, the idea for the setting is that books are outlawed from society. The government has a firm grip on it's control of information and very little is given to the populace as a whole that isn't controlled by the government. In this way it's very similar to George Orwell's 1984.PlotThe book begins with Montag at work, burning someone's house down because they were reported to have books in their possession. Coming as no surprise, the book quickly forces Montag to question just how right it is to continue to hold back the knowledge of the past from the people.EnjoymentThe book has a very interesting premise, and the author's message of the importance of information and being able to think for yourself instead of allowing others to think for you is clear. I'm not quite sure what I think about the ending, it's not that it comes from nowhere, but I think it almost stretches out a bit too long.Overall GradeI enjoyed the book, it has a lot of interesting ideas. However, I'd seen most of the ideas from reading 1984 (which was written a few years before Fahrenheit 451). Either way, they are still good ideas that merit reading multiple times.6/10All of my reviews are also located on my blog, check out me profile for the link to my blog."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The best reviews here have already covered it.

The book is truly stupendous and *meant* to be stark. I only hope that the disgruntled readers hang on to their initial reviews written here for a few years so that when and/or if they're ready to try it again, they'll realize their folly.And to those who burned the book, all I can say is I hope you enjoy asking, 'Do you want fries with that?' for the rest of your days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A cynical, yet prophetic view of the world as it is today.

Also realistically presented was the cause of the forced demise of books, through minorities. i am personally very apprehensive of various minority groups compaining about anything that is not what they desire to hear. i personally support equal rights, but many of today's minorities seem to think that equality is not reached until their rights surpass those of everyone else. if any &quot;questionable&quot; material is released that disagrees with their views, the government must do something to maintain that minority's felicity. for more on this topic, i suggest reading Bradbury's &quot;Coda&quot;. however, it remains somewhat inferior to Huxley and Orwell's dystopias because of the tendency of the book to remain at times too superficial. I understand that the author only spent about a week on the novel, so it is understandable that it would rank in just below these paramount paradigms of the dystopic future of mankind. the massive, forlorn, wretched world of hate created by Orwell is just more in-depth and depicts more intense scenes of the injustices that humans face. Huxley's world, as well, allows for the reader to get more acquainted with the main characters, and thus the readers are more shocked when Winston is torn apart emotionally by the man he once thought he could trust as a fellow usurper of the power of Big Brother.if only Bradbury had gone in-depth, such more could have been reached by the book.however, it remains a classic nonetheless, for the accurate prophecies portrayed and the fears of dehumanization and antidisestablishmentarianism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you want a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat with action and plot twists, then read a comic book. This is one of the slowest books I have ever read. It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is truely chilling, how close this book mimics reality. Free speach may not be outlawed here, but when the news media is outraged at someone who is prolife.. or when a TV show has to have either sex, violence, or very rude humor to get good ratings.. or when the most improtant thing on the new is the presidents love life.. it really makes you think about just how close we are to the world F451.

Not as good as '1984,' nor as overrated as 'Brave New World,' F451 is a pleasing mix of warning, cynicism, and pure future paranoia. Very nice.You'll note, 9 out of 10 bed reviews of this book on Amazon come from disgruntled high school students who found Bradbury's phrasings too unwieldy or the story to be too &quot;slow.&quot; (i.e., not action-packed enough) Rather ironic, when looked at from a certain point of view...these narrow-minded, ignorant little children would live quite well in Bradbury's fictional future, no?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's novel is about censorship and how a single thought can change your whole life. The main character, Guy Montag is a fireman of the future--paid to set books ablaze. In the beginning, he finds comfort in this. Then he begins to question authority and the sensless laws set forth by a faceless government. From beginning to end, this story is a thrill ride, cover to cover. Mr. Bradbury has you guessing. His characters are so unique, and at the same time, truly everyday people. This book is truly enjoyable. Younger readers will not get the symbolism; however, older readers will see just how close we probably are to this virtual insanity of lies and deception. In the end I was left wondering, &quot;Who saw that books were so harmful?&quot; Was it one man or the whole nation, slowly evolving from our current lawsuit happy world, to this insane world of deception? I just have to wonder. I would recommend this to teachers. For the student's sake, it is a fairly short story but there is a lot that can be done with it.

With each new reading of this novel, I discover new aspects and facets which mirrors our society in this country and throughout the world. Analyze the novel while looking deep into the problems of our country alone and a reader cannot help but be moved.This book isn't crying to save all books. It goes far beyond that. It examines the power that people have in shaping their culture, their future and their history. What is freedom and at what price do we preserve every single person's individual rights? Is the power in the society, or the individual?Thank you Mr. Bradbury for providing us with such a wonderful tale."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love to read, always have, and this book has shown me why. The slow build-up Bradbury uses to show the awakening of a numbed mind is almost brutal. Reading along as Guy forces himself through the ashes of ignorance and blind faith which cover his artificial life, and into the stiff wind of knowledge and understanding, I understood. He begins to possess an amazingly powerful tool: the ability to use his mind to understand his world and why it, and we, are the way we are. Farhenheit 451 is an incredible book that, like the Handmaids Tale, is there to remind us (those of us who care) that the world may one day go wrong. I was very sorry to read some of the negative reviews though, like the others that loved the book, I noticed they came mainly from those who were forced to read the book in school. The book requires a certain mindset and understanding of what people are capable of doing. Students still in grade school or even high school are not ready to understand and see what the implications are if censorship is allowed. Ray Bradbury did a marvelous job in bringing home the importance of reading, and the resposibility that comes with it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not a person who likes to read alot.

He has written the future's worst and gratest moments. Guy Montag has enjoyed being a fireman for mostly all of his life. He has been brought up learning that books would lead to rebellion and that the television would lead to the future. He has been enjoying the fun of burning books. He also has burned up the houses that held the books inside, but this is until he meets a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan. She tells him about a past when fireman had actually had stopped fires. The next thing Montag hears from a professor is of a future in which people are able to have their own differences and be able to think of themselves. This novel was fascinating. Ray Bradbury frightens his readers in telling a story of a possible future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury struck bullseye with this novel. It seems almost ridiculous to have firemen to burn down houses because the obtain books in them. But is it really? Today's American Society has already started the burning of books and persecution of those who own them. There are already banned book lists that are preventing the youth of today from expanding their minds. It is a travesty that this is happening, but the fact remains that it is. By preventing High School students from reading &quot;Huckleberry Finn&quot; because it uses a derogatory term towards African-Americans is ridiculous. We are forgetting what the word &quot;satire&quot; means. To ban Vonnegut's works because they are different is insane. We may not have begun to burn down houses, but we are not helping books to survive. We are too locked into computer screens and televisions to remember what it is to be human. The human-experience can never come from a computer or a television. We must protect what keeps us human. Forget being politically correct, forget Jehovah, Allah, and any other diety... BE HUMAN...READ BOOKS."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"One of the best books I have ever read! Guy Montag is the epitome of courage. The reality of much of Bradbury's fiction is horrifyingly consistent with today's society. The future's view of books is accurate with that of a variety of people today. A great book for high school students (if you can get them to read it) to think about thinking and conformity. Make a loved one read it today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a great book. I loved it because it was so confuseing. I bet that is hard to believe, but I love confuseing books alot.

It shows what could happen if people refuse to think and let the goverment think for them. It shows that if let one person tell you what to do, read, or even watch t.v. that the censorship can grow and eventually you won't even br allowed to think for yourself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I believe this book to be one of the very best I have ever read.

It scared the crap out of me. American society is'nt that far from this. The people who gave this book bad reviews prove it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is amazing, whether you are forced to read it or not. The only people who don't like this book, are the fools who don't understand what's happening around them. Chances are, if you give this book anything less than a 9 out of 10, then you are just too uneducated to appreciate this work of art. Remember, your personal lives and interpretations bring meaning to a book, and the book is therefore as good as you understand it. Bottom line: Excellent book.

I read the description and such, and understood it to be a pretty big book, dimension wise. I got it in, and the dimensions of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" were a lot smaller than what I had expected. Overall, great product, great service, and it's the same book that the rest of my class has, regardless of size. Good story, I have enjoyed it so far."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I remember reading this in high school, pretty much because I read everything back then, and my chief impression then was...hmmmmm, ok. It was an ok book. I appreciated what it had to say about censorship, about the power and value of books, about the sad distance between people. And it was a fast-paced and readable novel. It paled compared to Something Wicked This Way Comes, but overall, it was fine. I was glad that I could say I read it, even if it failed to provoke a strong reaction from me.So, it's now been about a dozen years since that first reading, and I found myself needing to reread it because some of my students are reading it. So, I started it one evening and had it done by the next. Normally, I don't get anything read that quickly, what with work to go to and papers to grade, etc. But this time, Fahrenheit 451 was something that I could more than appreciate. It hooked me. I both enjoyed it and appreciate it more deeply than I did a decade ago.What stuck out to me Bradbury's fury at the fast-paced, mind-numbing, loud, hateful, drunken, addled culture that we keep making worse and worse. A culture that abstracts us from the earth, from our neighbors, from our history, that hinders us from the contemplation of deep questions that makes us human. I think that working where I work (with cell phone and tv obsessed students) and living where I live (near DFW) Bradbury's vision hit me hard and with urgency. I fear that what Bradbury has to say in Fahrenheit 451 may be more important and relevant now than it was when he wrote it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At first it seemed like a stretch, but the more I read, the more I realized that this book is telling the truth about society. People dictate the way we think using the media. In the past, everything reflected truth and reality. Now, everything goes deeper and deeper into nonsense to the point that the truth is not a value at all. This book helped me to realize that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Come on - a classic. Montag is iconic and impervious to criticism; c'mon, he hates burning books and he's a 'fireman.' Bradbury has created one his best stories in this tale of the near future, which tragically, is beginning to mirror our own. How many young people to I hear say 'I don't like to read, not my thing.' Are we so far away from Fahrenheit 451? Five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of the top classic sci-fi novels. This heavily influenced me as a teenager.The main character struggles with himself, as he begins to balance his livelihood -- burning books -- with his realization that maybe free thought is a good thing.In this dystopian future, books are burned to keep people from thinking too much. This is the ultimate form of propaganda, as ALL information is limited to what the government distributes.Like 1984 and other dystopian literature, Fahrenheit 451 serves as a warning to prevent the very society it predicts."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a true classic. The story remains relevant today...and I would think should enjoy a resurgence during the current craze for the dystopian.Bradbury imagines a future that seems imminently plausible. But, more than creating an interesting world, Bradbury captures your heart and soul. You become emotionally involved in this story. You eagerly look forward to the next sentence. You wish there was more when you're done.Readalbe. Entertaining. Thought provoking. Everything you could ask for in a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was surprised by this book. I knew of it but did not know what it was a about. Firefighters now take away books from the people who love them and the knowledge they bring but in this world knowledge is considered something bad they want people not think for themselves.I also feel like there is more to this book that i am not saying. It is a book that I think if you read over and over again you will understand more of the world. Sometimes that is what I have to do with Shakespeare's books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Love the book. It turns out as noone expects it. I got the book just on time and I had much fun reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A must read! This book is great,bought this for school, but ended up loving it.

If you buy this book, brunt the hardship; it gets incredible later!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book just sweeps into the world of so called happiness.I think the book is warning us about the dangers of technology.I love the way he portrays life in the future and how liberal and lazy the people have become.I especially love Captain Beatty's personality, he can burn books but yet he knows quite alot about them.Captain Beatty's name is kind of ironic in how it incorporates the word beatific, which means to show extreme joy or bliss,when in the book they all are trying to stay happy when really they're not.They are not happy in my opinion because they always have to be doing something they can't just think or have a conversation with a human being.This book is very interesting and I recomend it to teens so they can learn more about life itself."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is scary when you read it.

Bradbury may have written this around mid-century, but he is closer to predicting the future than any author I have read works by."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book, as many of Bradbury's, is incredibly interesting. With symbolism and strangeness Bradbury depicts the future as it would be without books. Not only is this novel an amazing tale the first time it is read, but it contains the same excitement and wonder many times thereafter."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Wow! I just finished this book for my 8th grade reading class two days ago. It was the wierdest book I've ever read, yet in an awesome way. The things Bradbury talks about in this book that should come as a shock are almost prophetic. I'm not suggesting that our world will come to the point of men burning books for a living any time soon, but it's kindof scary to think about the glimpses of some of these things (ex. TV &quot;families&quot;) that we are already beginning to see. I think that we should take this book as a warning not to let ourselves be so worried about being happy that we let ourselves be trapped in the kind of world Bradbury illustrates. This was an awesome book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As a gifted student I deal with things relating to this book all the time. I have found that the school systems, in order to please everyone, find a way to mask stupidity and praise every child meaninglessly. In Farenheit 451 the lack of books is like the school system's mindless praise. There is nothing that displeases anyone. I find this classic novel a shockingly truthful account of the not-too-distant future. A must read book for anyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is really good because it offers a different perspective on life. Some of the things in the book are coming true already. For example as soon as my sister comes home from school she turns on the TV and watches talk shows and soap operas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was wonderful. Fahrenheit 451 is an great testiment to, not only the writing ability of Ray Bradbury, but also his ability to write in the future. It is an exemplary piece about the consequences of living without free speech and free thought. It's a creepy book that easily mimics our future society if we are suppressed. Absolutely fascinating. A philosophical and an exciting read!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 in my English class, and the class is still reading it. I'm one of the few in my grade who understood it, but I'm not sure why. I thought it was a never-put-down novel, because Montag starts out loving to burn books, then a young girl (Clarisse, 17) sets him straight. He realizes all the work that has been done for the books to be written, so he starts working against the firemen, who burn the books. He gets caught with books, and his house is burnt. He is considered a fugitive, and at the end of the novel, there is a very exiting chase, to the death."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you are younger than 16 this book is much more enjoyable when read as a group and commented for any doubts.

It's one of those books that has a message and makes you see the similiarities between our world and Bradbury's fictional world of the future. It's short and to the point, if you have a few spare hours you should definitely read this book. It makes you THINK."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A remarkable tale of censurship and the decay of human knowledge.

A very poignant book, it's definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradybury proposed advertizing which is everywhere, kids who kill one another for no reason, people who no longer even bother to think for themselves because their thoughts are fed to them by TV.

This book was written by a person who had a great imagination, the best. And like Einstein said, &quot;Imagination is more important that knowledge.&quot; Which I thought was the moral of the book.

Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In this day and age, with the internet, and TV, the printed word is becoming endangered. Ray Bradbury takes this to the next level in his masterpice in which books are illegal, and original thinking is considered odd. This book showes what can happen to our society if we let go of the written word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Este libro de Bradbury tiene un fondo impresionate con una historia original, fresca y aterradora pero a la vez una naracion tan detallada y bien hecha que uno tiene que terminar de leer el libro tan pornto pasa las primeras dos paginas. Es un futuro aterrador el que plantea (imaginese vivir sin Amazon.com ni nada que se le paresca) pero su mente elavora muy bien la historia y no se mete en detalles tecnicos como, que a&ntilde;o es, como se monitorean las personas o comofuncionan los aparatatos. Toma toco cono un futuro ya establecido que no requiere mas explicaci&oacute;n que la indispensable para la historia. Una joya literaria para degustar con una lectura pasuada pero sin pausas."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Striking, scary, almost here. Yes, I think most people who love books, value free thought and expression, and worry about our personal freedoms being taken away one by one (which they are, folks) can identify with this story. Guy Montag wakes up one day to realize that all the material possessions of his life, indeed, his whole way of life is empty and meaningless. In Montag's world, the powers that be want everyone to be lulled into a state of false security. No one is allowed to stir the pot (remind anyone of the recent political conventions where anyone who protested anything was beaten and arrested?). Yes, anyone who can't see the symbolism so blatantly laid out before them is probably on a school board somewhere and wants to ban this book anyway. I read this book when I was about 12 years old, and I understood the implications at that young age. I think I read To Kill a Mokingbird the same year. When I moved to California in 1984, One of the North County School boards had banned To Kill a Mokingbird and it was quite a fight that took place. I re-read this book at that time, and every few years since. It's message is timeless, and if anyone has seen the advertisements for the Flat TVs that you hang on a wall, you may get a bit frightened by Bradbury's vision of the future. Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which books burn, by the way. This should be standard reading for everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is not a standard SF and it is not meant to be. The idea is VERY plausible. Written 50 years ago, the idea of TV being a national obsession was ludicrous. Who knew? The white clown is very similar to the extremely violent shows that we let be on TV. And the books. . .the censorship. This is what will happen if we let censorship go any farther. And the scene where the women are discussing their children, absolutly scary. Good book. Read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is almost uncanny that Bradbury depicted this as the exaggerated furture for books. Certainly this is not an action packed blood bath but it is excting. He shows all to well how books full of literary beauty will be removed from view in public schools, libraries, etc. If you want to read a classic book this is just what you are looking for. It is set in the future where media dominates the earth and reading is believed to be a rash on society. As you read through and discover how well he depicted what is happening you will be vastly impressed how right he is. This is a must read book for those who want a good read and for literary knowedge. Despite all this, the reason I didn't give it five stars is because I do like action and this lacks some of what it could have."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very good. It was about censorship of the future that the government has to keep people happy. People aren't allowed to read books it was forbidden to the law. Can you imagine the world without a book? The people will think the same things, and they won't have any things to talk about because even jokes come from books. When I was reading it I thought, 'The government is wrong they should let people read books. If some people aren't happy because they can't read books, then the government is making them unhappy.' I like the books very much and if it is our future I probably can't live the one moment of it. This book was hard to understand at the first time, so I read it again and enjoyed very much.

Thank you.)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This one of a kind novel by Ray Bradbury is an interesting story with many twists and turns from its almost boring beginnings to its dramatic and action-packed closing. As a soft science-fiction novel Mr. Bradbury made a powerful statement about what he thought the world was coming to with its ever evolving societies. Already some somewhat small groups of people are forbidding the reading of certain types of literature. In my personal opinion, I think that every person on the face of this Earth deserves to have a chance to read, Even if this book that a person decided to read went against all the morals that the society currently values."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like to read about the future, this is a great book to read! Fahrenheit451 is a great book on what are future could be like. Do you think that you could ever survive with out books? This society dose. What's a fireman to you?

I enjoyed very much!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Story of Guy Montag, a \\"fireman\\" in a repressive society, who repents his job of burning books and joins an underground society committed to memorizing the great works of literature. Bradbury's excessively florid, overwrought prose bothered me greatly. The futuristic society of book-burners never really seemed fully realized or plausible. Dealt with some questions of book burning and censorship intelligently, but still seemed a bit nave. Bradbury struggles with long-form fiction. Never felt the execution rose to the level of thematic ambition."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"a really great book. kinda short though, wouldve liked to have seen more suspense, but thats the only negative thing i can say about this book. its an awesome story and really throws you for a loop at the end. if you like this book and would like to read more like it, i recommend george orwell's &quot;1984.&quot; that one is a really great book also. whereas this book focuses on the extremes of censorship, 1984 focuses on the extremes of propaghanda and kind of circulates around censorship as well. again, only if you like books like this will you enjoy the message that 1984 delivers. it's kind of a mind f**k though. it really makes you think about whether or not you truly know whats happening in the news. read it and you'll understand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The writing was strange, as was the imagery.However, this book had a very good theme. Now, I know that everyone who reads this book will not see the same theme, but I thought that the theme was that life is better if you use your brain.It was also horryfing to see that nobody knew what they were missing by not being able to read books, they thought that their wonderful big picture TVs would lead them through happiness, and that they could ignore the nasty things about life. But that's not the way that life is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I recommend this novel for those who like to read interesting things. This novel is about how books cannot be read at all in society; it was against the law. Imagine just listening to the media all day and radio stations, where would they get all their facts and information on human nature, or nature itself? The firefighters in the story create the fire, rather then putting them out. Picture the future with just technology and no books? This book sort of gets you curious about what is gonna happen towards the ends because of all the killings and interesting talks a man Montag had with a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse. I don't usually like to read books but when I read this one, I wanted to know what happened next or why the people in the story were acting like that? It was easy for me to imagine. So for those who would like to read a short book about a hundred and seventy- three pages, I recommend this one. Below is a quote from the story and my commentary about it. So here and take a sneak peak:1.) \\" He gazed, shaken, at that white hand. He held it way out, as if he were farsighted. He held it close, as if he were blind. \`Montag!' He jerked about. \`Don't stand there, idiot!' The books lay like great mounds of fish left to dry. The men danced and slipped and fell over them. Titles glittered their golden eyes, falling, gone. \`Kerosene!' They pumped the cold fluid from the numerated 451 tanks strapped to their shoulders. They coated each book; they pumped rooms full of it. They hurried downstairs, Montag staggering after them in the kerosene fumes. \`Come on, women!' The women knelt among the books, touching the drenched leather and cardboard, reading the gilt titles with her fingers while her eyes accused Montag. \`You can't ever have my books,' she said. \`You know the law,' said Beatty. \`Where's your common sense? None of those books agree with each other. You've been locked up here for years with regular dammed Tower of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now...\\" (38)The problem here is that they are called to put fire to a woman and her house for having books. Montag hesitates and tries to encourage the women to leave while she. The women, Captain Beatty and Montag have an argument about books and set the house on fire.In this scene, it doesn't seem like Montag wanted to burn the lady and the books. He seemed hesitant by warning the woman to get out before it's too late. Books seem to be some people's most prized possession. In these books, there are problems, trials, death, and unrealistic acts. They feel that there is no purpose in reading these books because it will corrupt what the society runs now. When he states, \\"The people in those books never lived. Come on now,\\" they feel there is no purpose on how these stories will benefit you positively, but only negatively."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's amazing how a book that was written nearly half a century ago continues to captivate the interest of any reader, aand especially that of a fourteen-year-old like myself. Fahrenheit 451 has managed to do this. Now one of my favorite books, I can sit back and wonder &quot;what makes this such a good book?&quot; I feel the answer is that F. 451 is a slap in the face to Americans living in this day and age. The fact that it appears this is where America is headed - wars (war with Iraq, war with Afghanistan), censorship (parental advisories on cds, ratings on movies), and just a general air of disaffection to the world can be seen every day. America: read this book! We'll be better off for it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In an age of pervasive conformity and the overwhelming prevalence of worthless television such as American Idol, I find it refreshing and inspiring to read such a profoundly original work like Fahrenheit 451. If we allow our brains to wither away by watching wasteful drivel like Guy Montag's wife, Mildred, we surrender to the system, and hence, become nothing but another brick in the wall. Ray Bradbury writes as lucidly and fluently with as vital a message as any of the other infamous dystopian novels such as 1984 and Brave New World. Just as Orwell and Huxley champion the cogence of individuality over mere conformity, so too, does Bradbury.Although Guy Montag is the endearing protagonist and his Captain Beatty the intrepid, yet enigmatic antagonist, it is none other than the characters of Clarisse and Mildred that most intigue me. They emanate resoundly as complete foils for each other. Whereas Mildred woefully lacks even any remote semblance of vision, love, passion, or originality, Clarisse conversely possesses an abundant amount of vigor, vibrancy, ingenuity, and genuine zest for life. Guy undergoes an epiphany upon the inscrutable disappearance of Clarisse that, in turn, galvanizes from within his desire to live again. Not only does he begin to read books again, albeit surreptitiously, moreover he also embarks upon a journey to think for himself again, as it were. No longer allowing Captain Beatty or the Mechanical Hound to motivate his conformity through fear tactics, Guy Montag begins upon a new and unchartered path - one that will undoubtedly lead to happiness in the absence of conformity. Fahrenheit 451 is undeniably a timeless classic and should thus be treated as such. 5 HUGE STARS."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is pretty up to date, and reflects society, since the concept of different ideas and philosophies is ignored in favor of TV, and remembering the dull words of pop songs, and the dull and almost pointless existences of some people, reflected rather grimly in this book. It was very powerful, and a very remarkable book to say that least. Probably the most realistic and the least sci-fi influenced of all those 'utopian society' novels."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451, a thought-provoking book about censorship centered around book burning, seemed to get off to a slow start by following the life of the main character, Guy Montag, a firefighter who does not put out fires, but rather burns books for a living. Some of the descriptions given at the beginning of the book were confusing at first, like those of the parlor walls, which really turned out to be futuristic video screens, and the mechanical hound, a robot which is used to track and kill people by the chemical scents they leave behind. However, as I got into the book more, I felt that the almost boring way Bradbury wrote the introduction helps give the reader a sense of what Montag's life was normally like, and allows the reader to see the vastness of the changes he encounters in his lifestyle.I also felt that as the plot thickened, Bradbury did an excellent job of giving Guy human qualities, such as making him impulsive and sometimes hot-tempered, and showing how he strove to do what he thought was right. His interactions with other characters are very real, especially those with his boss, Beatty. When Montag starts to regret burning books, and starts to perceive that there is more to the books he burns for a living than he and most other people believe, Beatty senses Montag's change in emotion, and does his best to set him straight, telling him that books are only filled with useless thoughts and people and places created by writers that are long gone. This is the main conflict that leads to the rising action of the novel. Montag is told that books are bad, and thus by human nature becomes even more interested in them. However, the conflict is greater than this, as it is not just Montag versus Beatty. Besides also trying to get his ditsy wife interested in books, Montag faces an internal battle with himself. He has to weigh the consequences of getting caught with books with the rewards of what he could possibly gain by reading. I especially appreciated the effort Bradbury went through to bring the feelings and emotions Montag goes experiences to the reader by his word choice, and the way he showed the reader how Montag was playing a sort of tug-of-war in his mind.I think Bradbury did a good job surprising the reader whenever possible, such as with Montag's actions. Just when you begin to think that you might see how Guy will act in a situation, Bradbury twists the outcome, keeping you on the edge of your seat in some cases, or at least wondering what will happen next. Such is the case with Faber; a man Montag becomes friends with who also has interests in the forbidden world of books. Just as Bradbury leads the reader to believe that Faber will be somewhat in control of how Guy responds to the remarks of his boss Beatty, Montag leaves Faber in the dust, taking matters into his own hands and acting on impulse.Bradbury uses a serious tone throughout the novel, which helps to bring forth the importance of the subject at hand. I liked the serous way in which Bradbury presents the world Montag lives in, a world without books or leisure reading material. This made me question what I would do if I were in Montag's situation, even though in this day and age it is quite unlikely that books would suddenly be totally banned. It really got me thinking about censorship in general, and how at times in the past we made steps toward making Montag's world a reality by banning books from libraries and bookstores. On the other hand, in brought to light the fact that the bans placed on many books were lifted after such acts were declared unconstitutional, which somewhat renewed my faith in the ability of our government and society to recognize and correct some of its mistakes.The novel is still thought provoking, however, because no matter what kind of society we live in today, we can all imagine living in one that is totally different, one we do not feel comfortable in, one that we let our imaginations run wild in creating it, making it painful to think about let alone live in. I enjoyed how the novel made me realize how many freedoms we have nowadays, and how they can easily be taken away.Without spoiling the ending, I just want to say that I thought it was very fitting. As Granger says near the end of the novel, \\"You're not important. You're not anything.\\" Montag and his group would have appeared to be insignificant to any unsuspecting stranger, even though they were the keys to a vast world of knowledge, one they hope someday the world will get to experience again.Though I do think that Ray Bradbury did a very good job of writing Fahrenheit 451, I feel that it has a few weaknesses. First would have to be a shortness of description, especially at the beginning of the novel when the reader is trying to form an image of the world Montag lives in. His short initial description of things such as the parlor walls and the mechanical hound left me somewhat confused about what they really had to do with the novel. Another case of confusion occurred with the mechanical snake that was used to empty Montag's wife's stomach and change her blood while she was sleeping after Montag found out that his wife, Mildred, had swallowed some thirty sleeping pills. It is not so confusing how this event happens but rather why it happens, and it does not seem to be important later in the story.Despite some weaknesses, the main point of Fahrenheit 451 is clear, and makes the book a definite \\"must-read.\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel of the dangers of a world without books is extremely insightful. It follows the story of Guy Montag, a firefighter who starts fires. Burning books is his true joy until a young girl and a professor show him the true light. Althought it is a relatively easy read, it is though provoking and enjoyable. The tale warns of editing and being afraid of stepping on others toes. This book speaks out and is not one that can be kept silent. Its powerful words tend to remain even after the last lines have been read. This is a must read for all, and a novel that will be savored until the very last words."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Brilliant. If you have not read this book, read it.

It drasticly emphasizes ceonsorship and the devestating impact that can take place from it. Some people believe that censorship has advantages in that it prevents exposure of inappropriate media to the youths of society. Farenheit 451 offers a different view on the subject. The many wars that people gave their lives to could very well be considered in vain by the destruction of books in Farenheit 451. The characters played an important role in bringing across this point. I strongly believe that Clarisse McCleannan in the book was that of one who was living in the past in in a way much like our opinions would be towards the sitsuation. She spoke of the past in ways we would speak of our present. I believe that this is a message about the calamities of nesorship that the writer is striving to get across. Although a novel relating to sceince fiction you might consider the various conversations between Guy Montag and Clarisse McCleannan to be heated debates on censorship and what can take place from it. Once again I stand forth and strongy believe that Ray Bradbury, author of Farenheit 451, is not making a science fiction novel for his well being, but to try to put out a powerful message on censorship and the drastic effects it can have on ourselves and freedom."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a futuristic tale where reading books is illegal. The main character is a man named Montag, a fireman whose job it is to burn books. In this story Montag is secretly reading, even though the punishment for reading is either life in jail or death. In this world there are many technologies that control people's lives.I think that Ray Bradbury should have done made the plot more clear. At the beginning of this book I was confused about the world where the story took place, which meant I couldn't relate to Montag or the story. By the end of the book, I was still left wondering about what happened to certain characters or why certain things happened.There are many ways he could have made this story better. He could have added more conflict in the plot or action in Montag's life. I did not enjoy the sci-fi aspect of the story because the complex technology interfered with the lives of the characters. Bradbury may be a good writer to many people, but because he did not explain the story clearly, he isn't someone I would choose to read again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sorry to all of the people who loved this book: I didn't.The plot wasn't bad, I'll admit, (I won't get into what it is about here, enough people already have) but I didn't care for the writing style at all. It was far too emotional, with all of this stuff that didn't make a whole lot of sense. Besides, whatever happened to Clarisse? She was the only good character, and she was only in it for two chapters! By the end, I hate to say, I really couldn't have cared less what happened to Montag. Don't get me wrong, I don't want to burn books or anything: the plot was an excellent idea, but the story didn't pull me in at all. I was hoping I'd enjoy it, even though I don't like science fiction, but I didn't. It was better than I had expected in some ways, which is why I'm giving it two stars. It makes you think about important things, like censorship and where it will lead us in the future.So, read it if you must, and think about its ideas, but don't expect too much. The best thing about this book is that it's short."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book I read this quarter is called Fahrenheit 451. The author of the book is Ray Bradbury. The book takes place in the future. Some of the environments include: Montag's house, the fire house, and Faber's house. In my oponion, the city and the river were the most important sites in the book. The city is were Montag was chased, and the river is important because this is where Montag finally dodged the city officials. I think that Fahrenheit 451 would best be classified as a science fiction. It is this genre because it is set in the future. Also, it is make believe because firefighters don't burn books in our society. Ray Bradbury has written many short stories, novels, plays, and poems. At 12, he wrote his first short story. He has produced two of his own plays, made two musicals, and helped with an animated film. In 1962 Icarcs Mantgolfer was nomanated for an academy award. Ray Bradbury has had his own television show, named the Ray Bradbury Theater has won many different cable awards. The book is about a firefighter named Guy Montag. His job is not to put out fires, but to set books ablaze. As the story goes along he starts to question many things about his job and the books he burns. About this time Guy starts stealing books. He made many attempts to read them, but he didn't understand them. Guy then contacted Faber, a retired professor, to help him interpret the books. Then Beatty, the fire chief, suspected Guy of burning books. Because this was aganist the law, Bettay went to Guy's house to burn his books. At that time Bettay placed Montag under arrest. Fearing he might be killed, Guy flees from city officals. He finally loses them when he hides in the river. When Guy emerges he meets a group of retired professors and teachers. They helped Guy escape and they recite to him as they travel. That is where the book ended. . The main character of the book is Guy Montag. He is a firefighter. Montag was not very educated, but he was \\"programed\\" to set books on fire. Guy is important to the book because if he wasn't there then there would be no book. He is also important because he is the olny person with the drive needed to change the laws of owning books. He is married to Mildred Moontag. Another improtant character of the book is Faber. He is a retired professor who quit when the college where he taught closed. Faber, a very well educated man, had been illegally reading books very discreetly. Faber is improtant to the book because without Faber's help Montag never would have escaped. Faber is also the person who coached Montag whenever he was in trouble. I think the theme of the book is that we shouldn't take books forgranted. I think Farheniet 451 is saying that books are very important resources and that slowly with technology thay are becomming more and more obsolete. Overall I liked most of the book. There were many dead spots in the book that left me lost. At the begenning I really didn't catch on and understand the it. But, when it picked up, it was a very good and interesting book. This is why I would reccomend it to a friend."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read.

There have been some pretty horribly boring books than I have been forced to read but this one isn't that bad. In fact it is a somewhat exciting book. I would recommend this book to a student that is being made to read a book that is like this or if this book is on one of there book lists. This book was somewhat good. I am not really sure what I think about it. The book was very confusing and I found it hard to read. Now that I think about it this book was not very good.

I first read this book in 8th grade (not because I had to, but because I WANTED to), and it had a profound effect on my life. Guy Montag is an anticonformist at heart caught in a world where conformity is the only path to survival. I respect those who gave it 1 or 2 stars, though, because if you are forced to read any book in school that you don't want to, you are going to be inclined to dislike it. But, if you read it once, try it again. You will see the underlying tale about society in general.

I still remember the book and how I felt about it as a child reading it.

I have never really watched this program as it is primarily a childrens show but the advertisement caught my eye as I was flipping channels. It was showing a teacher getting arrested along with his students for merely reading this book. This is when I remembered my teacher saying something about its legality in some states. Is this Union such that we have to hide to read such works of art? I think this action is exactly what Bradbery was trying to prevent in society. He may have been trying to show people what the world would become if we tryed to enforce a sort of literature policy. Where would we be if Shakespeare's works had been baned? I believe this was an excellent book and every child should have the freedom to enjoy it.

It's an easy to read enjoyable story, but it also makes you think along the lines of &quot;What would life be like if . . ?&quot;Most books that take place in the future involve alien warfare and voyages through space. This futuristic story, however, takes you to future earth, where books are illegal to own.After reading this book I wanted to go out and read all the classics I could find. It has been about five years since I read the book, and every time I read a classic, I think about the characters in farenheit 451 who couldn't.I've always appreciated books, but after reading Farenheit 451, I cherish them. It's one of those books where after you turn the last page, you say &quot;Wow.&quot; And then you just sit there, contemplating how real this unreal story actually is.It's true that books are still legal, and hopefully always will be. But, I wonder, is it also true that in the age of e-mails, websites, and cell phones, can we lose interest in simple things like letter writing, non-email greeting cards, and books? I would say yes.

I'm not quite sure why kids don't like it; I read the book when I was 12, and I couldn't put the book down. I found that the author did an exelent job showing the emotions of the characters, and made me feel almost like I was one of them. I would recommend this book to absolutely anyone, but I will give one piece of advise: If you get to the second chapter, and don't like it, stop reading the book. Though it may seem like you have to finish it, if you think the first part is bad, you'll probably hate the book. Though some books have little action at the begining, then change, this book really doesn't change. There are a few parts with action, but only to a small extent. The first part may seem like it doesn't have any action, and it doesn't, but if you are waiting for the real story to start, you probably missed it. Though the entire book has little action, the author constantly adds very thought-provoking ideas, which makes the book intersting even when there is absolutley no action what so ever. One more thing, if the idea of firemen starting fires sounds like the most stupid idea ever, it won't matter. I definatly didn't start reading the book because of this concept. I thought it was a horrible idea, but it turns out, it works very well. So, read this book.

This story takes place in a place that is supposed to be in the future where books are restricted and illegal. Firemen did not go to set out fires, but to light books on fire. The main character of this story is Guy Montag, who is a fireman. He becomes friends with an odd girl named Clarisse. She changes his mind about his job and how life should really be. Television is more important than family in this story, and Montag's wife, Millie, refers to the people in the television as her \`family'. This book was very original and out of the blue and also creative. Ray Bradbury's writing style was very interesting. He used a lot of skilled vocabulary that was confusing, and the whole book was like a jumble of words that were hard to understand. Some of the ideas in the book did not really pertain to the book's plot. I would definitely not recommend this book to anyone below the seventh grade. I am a seventh grader in Massachusetts and I hated this book. I didn't like it because it was so boring and it goes really slow. Fahrenheit 451 is this kind of book that makes you feel like reading it was a whole waste of time because it was so boring and pointless.

Bradbury goes on and on for pages of nonsense, and his words leave you with no more enlightenment than you had 50 pages ago. He uses redundant adjectives, and pointless sentences. I was especially annoyed when he would go &quot;inside&quot; Mr. Montag's thoughts and repeat the same meaningless phrases over and over again.

I thought I would like this book, considering its subject matter. I was completely wrong. Those that compared this to the other two masterpieces, failed to note one thing: Whereas the other two are written in haunting, intense, breathlessly engaging style, this book is in comparison rather choppy in its language. If the language style was not so dry, maybe I would have enjoyed slightly more. Furthermore, the book lacks any suspense whatsoever. Instead of staying up all night by my bed to finish the book, I had to constantly skip pages because of its rather boring and dry writing. I also found the characters particularly unsympathetic and unable to identify with. Instead of drawing me in, I had to force myself to finish the book (after repeatedly skimming through some unbearably slow sections). For such a small book, it's not easy to turn off a reader so many times. In addition, the book feels distant and unrealistic. It misses the realism to resonate with today's society, but it also lacks the bleak prophecy of a warning. Instead, near the end of the book, the author gave a not very subtlely disguised lecture on censorship, which is fine, except for the face that it feels like the author had left the world of storytelling and abruptly intrude into his own stories. He could not get the point across by the story itself; he had to announce it out. I also found the ending a bit ridiculous and incredulous. If words were so easily preserved in memories, we would not need writing. If the brain were so indiscriminating in its selectivity, we would not have conflicting memories. And although this book was supposedly an anti-censorship novel, I did not walk away from this book feeling the horrow of censorship.

An example, Farenheit's big televisions on the walls in the houses. Remember Big Brother speaking from wallscreens in 1984?On the other side, Bradbury let us know that books are synonims of &quot;culture&quot;, and &quot;development of thinking&quot;, which in my opinion are arbitrary statements. There can also be non educative books as there are non educative tv programmes or popcorn movies.And the story changes its course abruptly at the end.

This story was changed to the 1966 film. \\"Coda\\" tells about publishing for high school readers. There are many groups that want to censor books. His publisher censored sections of this book. Bradbury says those who do not like his stories should write their own. [But its always easier to criticize than to create.] This book was written in the early 1950s when reaction was censoring books in libraries, and the spread of TV led to less book reading. Military jets would often streak across the sky to create sonic booms. Popular culture also avoided radio, which allows people to work or do things, unlike a TV or book. TV became an agent of mass psychology to influence people's thinking and buying (like the jingle in this book). Is TV watching a necessity like food, drink, and sleep for most people? Can you go for a week without watching TV? Even though much of it is of little value? The idea of a catastrophic war was a common theme in the 1950s. Burning books was popularized in 1930s Germany, so too an emphasis on sports. They didn't want people to think too much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A highly prophetic story about the voluntary dumbing down of society that in today's day-and-age hardly passes as fiction (it's not really about government censorship, as some seem to believe). This is a must-read with a great (and alarmingly urgent) message. The only annoyance for me was the writing style, which I felt was a bit on the tacky side, but the core message here is too important and otherwise well-stated to let that influence my rating. Everyone should read this at least once, and hopefully we'll all learn something from it before it's too late; though the thought seems somewhat optimistic at this point."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is one of my absolute favorite dystopian novels of all time. The book is exceptionally well written, is very fast paced and is filled it political and social commentary. The book follows the life of a fireman... in this dystopia a fireman does not put out fires but instead his job is to start fires in order to burn books and the houses of the people that they are found in, as literature is banned. As the book progresses the main charater starts to question the legitimacy of his job and finally has one experiance that pushes him over the edge. Finally, one action takes him beyond redemption where he is targeted by his own ruthless government. The end of the book is wonderful, and it reminds me of the Book of Eli.I definately recommend this book as it is a great, fast paced, exciting read. Once you start you will not put this book down for a second, and you will be done in 1-2 days. Additionally, this book is one that you will want to pick up and re-read over and over again as you always find something new. It should be noted that this book was considered so inflammatory that it was secretely censored by the published without Bradbury's knowledge. You can not go wrong with this book and you will not be disappointed. This is my favorite classic, and I garuntee you will love this one as much as I did! Go and buy it, this is a great book to add to your collection."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury wrote this futuristic tale of a dysfunctional society where literature is unappreciated and virtually gone from the society. Individuals become sloths in and disregard books as an important part in the development of a society. The protagonist, Guy Montag is a fireman that burns books for a living. A young girl named Clarisse opens his world to new perspectives. Montag experiences a break down that changes his thoughts and feelings about books. From there he seeks the help of professor Faber who assists him in understanding books. After lashing out at his wife, Montag becomes a fugitive and he joins a group of intellectuals called the Book People. This story highlights aspects that are now seen in today's society- books have been translated into electronic forms and more and more people watch television and laze around. To me, the only thing interesting about this story was the plot itself, the style of writing was utterly uninteresting.When I embarked on reading this book, I couldn't get past the first 30 pages; Bradbury's style was boring and could not fully retain the reader's attention. However, it's because of its reputation as one of a kind during his time, that people read it. The characters themselves did not have that much depth to their personality. Montag's wife, Mildred is a small minded individual that cannot grasp the simplest idea of the anything. Bradbury killed off possibly one of the possibly interesting characters, Clarisse. She was like the last hope in adding creativity and depth to the writing. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the idea of the story and the plot line but the way it was expressed was not good. Overall, despite the negative comments I made about the story itself, I would recommend this book to readers out there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Are you looking for a book that has the perfect mixture of real and make-believe? Written in the 1953, Bradbury wrote this book describing an altered society taken over by the media (sound familiar?), lacking freedom of speech and individuality. Today's world--especially the U.S. is highly consumed in the media and Americans are decreasingly reading books. So how did Bradbury predict this media phenomenon about fifty years ago? That is the genius behind it; he writes this novel with such intricate detail and creativity in regards to technology and societal thought, making it seem as if the happenings of today's and the future's society were happening at the time it was written.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman-- a fireman that starts fires, that is, in order to burn books. The government of this society has decided that all books should be banned, and burned. In other words, an extreme case of censorship. You can't help but think that this is like the censorship of today of government records or media that attacks the government. Books expose people to new ideas and provokes the mind to think outside its bounds. If people have this exposure then surely they will speak out against the system and create great controversy. If books are taken away along with people's freedom of speech and expression, then everyone will be alike, leaving no space for individuality. This is exactly what happens with the characters, especially Montag's wife who sits and watches meaningless soaps and advertisements all day--they have become like robots. In Montag's quest to find a specific book, he experiences great emotion which he is struggling to express, leaving you (the reader) attached to his struggle.The suspense and vivid descriptions Bradbury creates leaves you on the edge of your seat, anxious to know what will happen next. Maybe the surrealism Bradbury illustrates will turn into (if not already) realism. Bottom line is, it's an all time classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's clear why Ray Bradbury didn't care to have his novel compared to Orwell's 1984. Orwell's antagonist, the totalitarian state, was effectively one dimensional. Bradbury's protagonist, by the time the novel opens, is ourselves, infected by omnipresent fear. Early in the story, when Montag meets Clarisse, he finds her to be somehow uninfected. In modern parlance, she hasn't drunk the Cool Aid. \\"I'm anti-social, they say, I don't mix. I don't think it's social,\\" she says, \\"to get a bunch of people together and then not let them talk, do you? We never ask questions, they just run the answers at you, bing, bing, bing, and us sitting there for four more hours of film teacher. It's a lot of funnels and a lot of water poured down the spout and out the bottom and them telling us it's wine, when it's not.\\"Fahrenheit 451 is a very frightening book, and the reader is drawn in immediately. When Montag goes home, he faces the other end of the spectrum from Clarisse; he faces his wife, who has been thoroughly brainwashed into submission. The tension rises dramatically, reaching a climax when Montag is forced to torch his own home. When he turns the torch on his boss, Montag becomes a fugitive and eventually settles with the hobos along the railroad tracks, all of whom has memorized a book in order to preserve it after all the physical copies have been destroyed.At 50 thousand words it's what would today be called a novella, meaning no agent would touch it. And an editor would have problems with some of the more egregious loose ends, including the characters of Clarisse and Faber. But it has struck a chord with an American public which fears the encroachment of the government in our daily lives. And it is always fascinating to compare the futures envisioned by writers of science fiction with the way things ultimately turn out. Bradbury's inclusion of mural-sized TVs and people mesmerized by reality shows displayed remarkable foresight. And that, too, is terrifying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes place in the near future where firefighters no longer put out fires they start them.

A future where every person is a mindless automaton with no feeling. They go about their life wondering whats going to be on the screen next or what they're going to eat for dinner. Worst of all it is a future where there are no books. It is a future where firemen don't douse fires, it is a future where they start them. Their job is to rid the earth of books by burning them.Montag is a firefighter who is questioning what he is doing. Lately he has been stealing books from the secret libraries he burns for a living. He finally realizes that without books people are mindless automatons who's only purpose in life is not to think.This is a great book and it makes you think of what life would be like if our only purpose in life was to be happy. We wouldn't be able to think for ourselves, just like the characters in the book. I give &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; five big stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 takes a look into a world that is overloaded with censorship, has a lack of knowledge, and is full of ignorance. I was quickly captivated to read the book after the first chapter when I learned the main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who's job is to burn books. This makes the novel begin with a very unique twist since the world is accustomed to firefighters putting out fires instead of starting them.Bradbury takes us though Guy's experiences that change his opinion of book burning. Starting with his encounter with a young girl named Clarisse McClellan, Montag is intrigued with her love of people, nature, and her stories of people who were not afraid of books. She causes Guy to see how dissatisified he is with his life. I feel for Montag as he goes through several disturbing events (his wife attempts suicide, an old woman chooses to burn with her books in her house, and Clarisse was hit by a car) and I understand why his eyes are opened to the bland life he has because of how censored the world has become. I would feel the same too, if I lived in a superficial world were everything is based on fast cars, TV, and radio and didn't include time by yourself, time to enjoy nature, independent thinking, books, and meaningful conversations. Nothing would be left in the world. That's why this book almost frightens me because it shows where censorship can lead to. What if our society just decided to get rid of free thinking to stop conflicting opinions? This novel makes you respect freedom after you begin to wonder if world could one day become like Montag's.At least there was hope for Guy as made friends with a retired English professor (Faber) and decides that Faber can help him understand the books that he hid away from his own fires. The most emotional moment was late in the novel when the fire station gets a call. Montag realizes it's his own house and his wife turned him in. It's sickening how everyone turns against him because he wants to gain knowledge about the old world. This lead to an intense chase that makes you almost want to cheer outloud for Guy as he escapes the Mechanical Hound, Beatty, and other firemen.The final chapter left me somewhat satisfied. It's vagueness at the end makes me yearn for a sequel. That's about the only problem I had with the book. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who has an open mind and loves sci-fi."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is unique in its own way. What goes on in here is not what people usually want to hear. Burning of houses, burning of sacred classics, even burning people. What makes this book likeable is that it makes you step out of your comfort zone into reality. As if it was going to happen if we don't stop doing what we are now. I like this book because of the interesting technology and characters. Clarisse of course is my favorite character. She reminds me of the bright, young, smart, and clever people that live in this world.The main character in this book is of course Guy Montag. He is a fireman, that burns books. Unlike other firemen, Guy Montag is more friendlier. Even Clarisse said so herself. She said he made her forget about him being a fireman at all. Which sets apart Montag from the rest of his group. Which makes him special.What happens is that Montag is apart of the fireman group 451. Being tempted, Montag steals a book, and more and more with each job he does. His captain of course notices, since near the end he said every fireman does this one time in his career. But, soon enough Montag is caught. Therefore being caught, he is forced to be on the run constantly, in fear of the Mechanical Hound, the invention used to catch \\"criminals.\\" Yet, there is a surprise ending, and to see what it is, you'll just have to read and find out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This tale is far more than a simple scary novel about burning &quot;unacceptable&quot; books. It is a red flag warning about the ever-present encroachment of censorship in the world about us. It is not surprising that this book was indeed heavily &quot;edited&quot; when it was first published. The censors saw their own reflection! Fahrenheit 451 is a book, which sends a strong message we should all heed. &quot;Social criticism&quot; in the written form is all-important to improve our society and prevent our freedoms from being eroded. There are not many other books along this line, but I have found two very enjoyable books, which really do fit into the &quot;Fahrenheit 451 social critique/satire&quot; genre. They are both by the skilled author C.B. Don. One is entitled, &quot;MANAGEMENT BY VICE&quot;...it is a critical, hilarious satire on interactions of technical staff and managers in high-tech industry...and the other, &quot;ACCUSED BY FACET-EYES&quot;...is a fairytale-like science-fiction, which is heartwarming, yet with a sharp ecological message critical of our thoughtless polluting, human practices. Like the classical much recommended Fahrenheit 451, these two books are also our 21st Century must-reads, ideal for every student of satire/social critique! I enjoyed all three books and walked away thoroughly enlightened and with a new perspective on society and life!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's vision of a world without books is genius. However, I don't think he was able to convey all that he wanted to with this book. It could be that the almost-novella length left him without the option to fully develop the characters. I was vexed not knowing what happended to Clarisse, and I was intrigued by the idea of the literati outcasts who roamed the rails. I think that in and of itself would have made an interesting novel. I couldn't understand the reasoning behind the book burnings. Captain Beatty's explanations left me wondering if that was the full story? Humanity is flawed in the extreme,but this seems to suggest a reverse in evolution - human intelligence on a steady downward spiral. I hope that it would take a little more than the explanations given by Captain Beatty to inspire the world-wide destruction of books - especially in this manner. Wouldn't incinerators be much more effective at destroying books than torching houses and buildings? I realize that the book was written very quickly, and maybe Mr. Bradbury got caught up in the passion of writing it, at the expense of character development. But I rated this book 4 stars anyway, because I respect the brilliance of the idea, and Mr. Bradbury made a very bold statement by writing about a topic he felt strongly about. It makes you think, which is more than I can say about the vast majority of literature published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire.

I was so happy with it that yesterday I went out and bought another of Bradbury's books, The Martian Chronicles!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was short, and deep.

Given when it was written you must admit it has prophetic qualities, though the media people are addicted to these days are increasingly ones that Bradbury had not imagined. There are uncanny parallels between the 'family on the screen' in the book and the way many people relate to media like facebook. The reason why I don't give it a higher rating is because I personally think the style of writing feels a bit dated. The text contains many features that I myself would have edited away in my own writing. I wonder if a modern agent or publisher would have commented that the manuscript needs polishing before being publishable. It should be stressed that these are my private opinions and I am sure many don't agree with them. Read it and decide for yourself. This is a powerful story about being entertained to the point of loosing touch with everything that matters in life. Though our media landscape is not the product of an evil society there are many similarities between the way we and the characters in Bradbury's book live through the media."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a futuristic novel in which history of the past as contained in books is forbidden. Into this scene develops a convert from a man who was part of the team that burned discovered hoards of books to one who wanted to protect them for their beauty of ideas and important lessons contained within them. It is a story about an inner struggle and an outward struggle to survive.The ending is weak but in it there is some optimism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"To say that Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is about a society that burns book is putting it a bit simplistically. It's not simply the fact that books are burned that's dangerous, it's what's destroyed with the books. The people in Bradbury's dystopian world have been effectively trained to enjoy simple, mindless stimuli, such as television walls that feature characters who are your 'family' and your 'friends.' The rationale is that books are sources of a vast amount of ideas, many of them in conflict with one another, and this clash of ideas makes people unhappy. Burning books is one of many ways to reduce sorrow and confusion in the world, though more to the point it's a way to control people through blissful ignorance.Bradbury's concerns are still pertinent to society today, and in fact maybe even more pertinent. We are a culture obsessed with entertainment. We love TV shows, and some of them are incredibly mindless, though I don't think Bradbury would condemn all TV shows. Some certainly are thought-provoking. Advertisements permeate our culture in just about anything, from what we wear to the places we go, and they can be quite effective in making us feel hungry for a cheeseburger. Many of us have such busy lives that we hardly have time for friends and relatives, much less time to think. Our hectic, stressful lifestyles have certainly taken their toll. Suicides have become increasingly common. They are a way of saying that something needs to change.Fahrenheit 451 is a thought-provoking read. Some of the dialogue and the technology seems archaic today, but that adds to the charm. The mechanical Hound, with a syringe for injecting morphine into its victims, is particularly strange, but oh so devious. As archaic as some of his dialogue and his technology might seem to us now, the novel feels surprisingly contemporary, like it was written today and not 70 years ago. And that's what's frightening."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really wish this book had been written for a higher reading level. I loved the idea, but I felt like it was cut short. I felt like I really missed out on the entire picture, or like this a portion of a more elaborate novel. I loved it, but was definitely left wanting more. It would have been perfect if it were longer and had a little more detail!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am fascinated by the idea of this book. There is always debate in our society about the freedom of speech and I don't think that the prohibition of books is that different; especially since there are many occurrences each year of people demanding that certain books be banned from schools/libraries etc.I think that even though he's a complete jerk, Beatty is a genius; an evil genius of sorts. He moderates the book burning firefighters and strives to make sure that no one who is found with books goes unpunished.I'm not sure if Montag is a hero or a kind of anti-hero. He was a fire fighter but his curiosity about books is inspiring. I wonder about Beatty's true self. I am unsure about his knowledge of books; he could be using his knowledge as a two-faced approach to catching the rule breakers. But part of me wonders whether or not he's actually a closet intellectual who is torn by his passion and his civic duty.I love Beatty's insistence that the first fire fighter was Benjamin Franklin. It's the evil genius side of him that I kind of admire. (I mentioned this in a discussion of the book with the club mates). What made Franklin such a great diplomat was that he not only knew how to listen, but knew how to subtly sway people to his lines of thinking, but could also sway them to do has he wished in financial matters which is no small accomplishment. Those traits mirror Beatty, though Beatty is perhaps a bit more sinister.I love that the message of the book is a little open-ended, at least in my opinion. What I take away from the book is that prohibition or censorship may seem like it puts everyone on the same plane it also has the ability to cause a fair to significant amount of dissention. Bradbury leaves the question as to whether or not that is a fair compromise up to the reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Well, I consider myself really late in joining the wagon of Fahrenheit 451, considering it is written in 1953. Maybe it is because it is outshined by the other more well-known dystopia: 1984 and Brave New World. But again, better late than never.The book tells a story from a world without books, when you have a Gestapo-like-secret-police (which is played by fire fighters! believe it or not), which will burn all of your books if you are stashing them.The idea itself quite surprised me, especially since it was written before the era of TV and Internet like nowadays. Only a genius can write something like this, predicting the future decades ahead. The writer concerned about the decline of reading culture, taken over by audio-visual culture, such as TV and now, the Internet. When everything is about entertainment, politics, news, even crime scene and the advance of REALITY SHOW!. How close can it be to nowadays reality.His premise is quite believable. Even some publisher in my country are afraid to print books which are sensitive, afraid that it might offend certain group. Just months ago, the publisher burn the book because of the pressure of religious group, a book writer which are beaten because her ideas are blasphemous. If this continues, the days when publishers stop publishing books about ideas, because it might offend people, are closer than we think.This books are inline with Marshall McLuhan's The Medium is The Messageand Neil Postman'sAmusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. They are the prophets who shout in the middle of the desert, \\"Beware you commoners, thy world is bleak as long as you are stuck in front of your TV! Read books! Think for yourself.\\"This book remind me why I love sci-fi books. Because of its prophetic nature. The only cause I do not give a five star is because its rambling dialogue.

It's a short read. Short, poignant, and scarily accurate for today's world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the fourth time I've read this book, though the first time in over 15 years. It's a science fiction classic about firemen who burn books in a not too distant and far too dystopian future. Bradbury is a great storyteller and weaves an amazingly lyrical narrative. It first grabbed me in childhood as an exciting adventure with a very vivid portrayal of the life of Guy Montag, fireman turned rebel.One of the delightful things I discovered in this re-reading was the idea of the proper relationship to books. The government represented by the firemen sees books as a hazard that causes both inequality (reading books makes people think they're better than others) and rancor (people may disapprove of how they (as minorities) are depicted in books). The citizens have fallen away from reading and are constantly plugged in to their living rooms, which are now nothing other than parlors with wall-sized TVs on every wall. Montag's wife wants them to buy a fourth wall TV to complete the room. If she isn't watching TV, she's listening to audio programs on little seashell devices in her ears. Books don't even register as reality for her; when Montag brings them into the house she is filled with horror at what they mean. Not that they contain horrible ideas, but that their house will be burned down if they are discovered. It's as if the government had already won their point.On the other hand, Montag learns to appreciate books, first by meeting Clarisse. She's the seventeen-year old neighbor with the funny family (her uncle was once arrested for driving too slowly at 40 miles an hour). She is interested in nature and people. She has real conversations with Montag about things that matter. She is a catalyst for Montag to explore the forbidden fruit he has been roasting for so long.Like any amateur, he makes a bit of a mess in how he handles things. He tries to convince his wife's friends that they should listen to books but they all recoil in horror. He tries to play cat-and-mouse with his boss at the firehouse but he is not up to the challenge. He eventually has to flee for his life.He falls in with a group of people who have been memorizing books, to preserve them for the time when the culture is ready. Interestingly, they constantly tell themselves that they are not more important or better than others for what they are doing. They are keeping a trust for civilization. In one scene, Montag is talking to Faber, a former professor who has been keeping a low profile though is in touch with the book people. Faber explains the difference between four-wall TVs and books:.\\"..you can't argue with the four-wall televisor. Why? The televisor is 'real.' It is immediate, it has dimension. It tells you what to think and blasts it in. It must be right. It seems so right. It rushes you on so quickly to its own conclusions your mind hasn't time to protest, 'What nonsense!'\\"[Montag:]\\"Only the 'family' is 'people.'\\"\\"I beg pardon?\\"\\"My wife says books aren't 'real.'\\"\\"Thanks God for that. You can shut them, say, 'Hold on a moment.' You play God to it. But who has ever torn himself from the claw that encloses you when you drop a seed in a TV parlor? It grows you any shape it wishes! It is an environment as real as the world. It becomes and is truth. Books can be beaten down with reason. But with all my knowledge and skepticism, I have never been able to argue with a one-hundred-piece symphony orchestra, full color, three dimensions, and being in and part of those incredible parlors.\\"The difference is between what's engaging and what's overwhelming. Books are a help in understanding reality, not a substitute for it or a way to tune reality out (though certainly some have used books that way). They help the reader to understand other people, other times, other places. But they don't force you to agree with them. The proper attitude toward books is not one of hostility or fear or submission. It's of wonder and learning and growing.The book is definitely worth reading and worth re-reading. Bradbury's death a few months ago really is a great loss.Hear some better commentary on A Good Story is Hard to Find, which is what inspired me to re-read the book. And now I am finally starting Jane Eyre, which they discussed quite a while ago."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"&quot;There is more than one way to burn a book. And the world is full of people running about with lit matches.&quot; -Ray Bradbury (Coda, Fahrenheit 451)This book is outstanding! It is a book for people who love books. It is a testament to the power of books and the importance of the knowledge they hold.It reminded me a lot of 1984 and Brave New World. If you liked either of these two novels, you will like Fahrenheit 451. Guy Montag, the fireman turned fugitive, is a lot like Winston Smith in Orwell's 1984 because he is forced to hide from an organization that wishes to destroy him. He is also like John Savage in Huxley's Brave New World because they both come to see the importance of literature, art, and beauty in the world. All three men are trapped in societies that are all about a quick fix, the easy way out.Fahrenheit 451 offers everything: action, drama, suspense, inner struggle, inspiration, faith. There's isn't really any romance, but the connection between Montag and his young neighbor Clarisse McClellan, who opens his eyes to the world around him, is one of the best I've read.Bradbury makes it clear that this novel is anti-science science fiction. Technology is not important in the great scheme of things. Human interaction, knowledge, beauty, these are what life is all about."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was really good! It starts off a little odd, but that is only because how crazy the world is in the book, it's a little hard to comprehend. As you keep reading though, you can't put it down! The author keeps you wondering what will happen next, and why things are the way they are!!! The relationship between our world and the book's has teriffying similarities, that you tend to think twice about our lives today. Make sure you read this book!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"We were assigned to read this book in our English 9 class, and never before have I read something nearly as interesting as this. It was complex and never before thought of, written by an extraodinary author!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a great book. I read it in my Language Arts class. Fahrenheit 451 is my absolute favorite book of all time. It has twists and turns. A terrific book to read for people of all ages."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I liked how this book relates to the world we live in. The way it portrays the Government as an all powerful force that silences original thought through the burning of books and the voices of the authors. I pray that this fantasy never becomes a reality. But I fear that such a future isn't to far off !"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This classic dystopian novel must be read by anyone with a passion for literature. It reminds us in enormous sharp signs that books will only maintain an importance in our lives if we keep them actively alive by relating them to our present society. Montag is like many of us, going through every day life and responding to things in the correct way. When one day he receives a kind of wake up call. Revived to life he struggles with his moral sensibility over whether to abandon his home or remain in a life clustered in routine mindlessness. Clarisse is the beacon of hope in our lives. She is our belief that a common sense will prevail in the wake of senselessness. The depictions of our society as media-drenched placid reflections of ourselves is indeed accurate. In almost every creation Mr Bradbury made in this novel a direct parallel can be found in our society such as Montag's wife's television family where a popular computer game today is call The Sims where you create your own families. The statements he makes aren't much more complicated than that, but it is a powerful message indeed and a highly creative and entertaining story."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In a world where imagination and fantasy are shunned upon, there isn't much room for Clarisse McClellan...the young teenage neighbor of Guy Montag. Montag is a fireman unlike the ones today...his group is employed to burn the books the radicals conceal. Ray Bradbury's prediction of the future shows a world in which questions and ideas are damaging, and the only information you are given are minor details. The books are burned for this very reason, Fire Captain Beatty explains this best, \`...and the books say nothing! Nothing you can teach or believe. They're about nonexistent people, figments of imaginations, if they're fiction. And if they're nonfiction, its worse, one professor calling another an idiot...you come away lost.' Clarisse McClellan is Montag's guide to see the way life was. Enjoying the finer things we see and take for granted, like picking dandelions and skipping on the sidewalk. Simple pleasures have become insignificant, and Montag realizes he's part of the problem. After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag begins to hide books in his house, beginning to regain what he never knew he lost. At home he's not alone. In fact he's married and living with his wife Mildred. Mildred is a constant reminder of the pathetic not-so distant future that lies ahead. She spends most of her time with her \`television family', a collection of three large walls in which you interact with the sets. As Montag begins to learn about the past, Mildred gets suspicious and turns him in. The end may surprise you when Montag realizes what he's supposed to do... This book portrayed a hazy, gray picture of the future, much like the book 1984. Although, it did not emphasize key points of the books with any tension or suspense. Overall, this book laid an important lesson upon me, and that is to take this book not as a lesson, but a warning."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This masterful work of future prevention as Bradbury furvently declares it speaks volumes about the ease in which even a society such as our own (especially a society such as our own) can censor the voices of freedom that speak through books. Even though some of the material and references employed are a bit dated, as I said before, this was not intended as a prediction, only a warning. Are we wise enough to heed its message?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is an excelenent book about book censorship and its tale still fascinates the mind today as much as it did when it was written in the 1950's. This book however i should notice reads in some parts more like a poem then a novel, sacrificing plot and dialogue for poetic beauty.The characters in this book are very deep and realistic leaving a haunting feeling on you, however interestingly he doesn't actualy spend much time actualy describing them, but somehow from the story you can draw so much more than you would from a description, however short or indepth it may be. I suggest this book as a standard reading for all people who wish to understand what the world could (and inevittably is) comming to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'll spare you the summary (you can read that in many other reviews) and tell you that this story is very easy to read and understand. The main idea of the story is that censorship (especially concerning books) is very dangerous and damaging to society. Whether you know it or not, books (especially the classics) are everywhere. From nursery rhymes to mythological stories, they play an important part in our daily lives. They are referenced in tv shows, movies, and in our vernacular. Think of Shakespeare. How many times do we see the Romeo and Juliet story whether it be in movies or music, etc. Or Homer's Odyssey? Or the Bible? If we were to lose these gems, our lives lose that important element. You don't have to be a reader to not feel the magnitude of losing our greatest stories. What I got out of the book also was Mr. Bradbury seemed to be warning the reader that if society doesn't open their eyes and take notice of important issues, the rug is going to be pulled out from under us. If we keep burying our heads in the sand and hiding behind celebrity rags, video games, and sporting events, we'll lose touch with the world around us and become victims of something bigger. He's not saying that fun can't be had, but if our lives are simply filled with sloth and fluff, we are going to be no better than a lemming. It's our duty to educate ourselves in order to prevent things like censorship or war from happening. A very good read, indeed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have always meant to read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" but had never managed to get around to it. In a world where time is scarce, I neglected this classic work by Ray Bradbury. I regret this situation very much. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a modern classic that deserves to be read. The individual is poorer for not having done so.If the novel has any message, it is that censorship is a very great danger. In the extreme case, we have the official authorisation of book burning. Books contain evil thoughts and encourage individuals to think for themselves. If books are removed from society then the power to control the individual is that much greater.Although written more than fifty years ago, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" still resonates today. Yes, the evils of the Soviet Union and its satellites are no longer with us and the cold war has been left to the dustbin of history. However, whenever given the chance, governments of all colours just love to seek control through censorship. Even in the west, governments hanker for greater control as a means of stemming the growth of terrorism or whatever else they deem to be a danger to them. As citizens, we should always question any attempt to increase the power of government over what the population can read or watch or listen. We must always be vigilant.Ray Bradbury is a man of great prescience. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" can legitimately be compared with the master works of George Orwell. This is true praise as Orwell rests in the pantheon of the geniuses and Bradbury deserves his place in the sun just as much."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this book for school and, well, you know the routine. I thought, \\"Oh, great, assigned reading, this'll be so boring to read,\\" et cetera. Boy, was I ever wrong.Set in America's not-too-distant future, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman whose job is to set fire to houses where books are found. He loves his job, and never once doubts his happiness in life - that is, until he meets a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse. Clarisse tells Montag of a past when the censorship of books was nonexistent - and more importantly, of a past when everyone could truly be a unique individual.Thus begins a riveting (and frighteningly prophetic) tale as Montag finally begins to question things he never questioned before and sets out on a quest to find the truth. Not only will the author leave you contemplating the novel itself, but the unsettling possibility of this kind of censorship actually surfacing in the tomorrow of America."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am a high school teacher, and Fahrenheit 451 is one of my favorite books to teach. First of all, the students enjoy the story, the images, and the writing style. With an opening sentence of \\"It was a pleasure to burn,\\" even students who usually don't like reading \\"eat\\" up this novel. With Bradbury's eerie insight into today's society (the book was written in the 1950's) and the topics of censorship, the value of books, etc, I never run out of things to discuss with the students.The novel makes people think, question today's society, remember great pieces of literature, and explore controversial topics. Despite instances of mild language, the images of the book stick with the reader; the mechanical hound, the hearth and the salamander, the venom spitting python hose are just some of those fantastic images that permeate the book.I highly recommend the novel. It's worth a second read if you haven't picked it up in awhile, and if you've never read it, you are missing one fabulous novel."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and their own pleasure. He never questions why they burned books or the way society was, until he met a seventeen year old girl named Clarisse McClellan, who, with the help of an old professor helped him examine the past and what they have become in the present. Guy began to question society, and figure out what he had to do to change it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it was easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even as he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can change the bad one step and a time."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is over 50 years old now. Somehow, it just keeps becoming more and more accurate a look at American society. Yes, Bradbury nailed the American apathy and isolationism of his complacent 1950s world. That's still there. He also scores a bullseye on the eternal button earplug, always there to drown the real world with its soothing, private murmur. His video walls look increasingly familiar, as home theater becomes more common and as the 60\\" screens give way to 80\\" and 100\\". And, of course, the book-bannings. We have those in plenty, based on every ism in the catalog. Sexism, satanism, racism, to name a few, along with the anti-evolution nuts. Bradbury also foretold the decay of personal relationships, giving examples that sound bitterly like today's front pages.He got one wrong, though. Bradbury seemed to hope that nuclear war on US soil would cauterize the social wounds. We've seen a bit too vividly what a house of cards we live in, how sensitive the power, health, communication, and even emergency infrastructure are, how tiny outages cascade into national-level failures. The nuclear fallout would be bad enough, and Bradbury seemed to hold the \`50s idea of a winnable nuclear war. I just don't think he appreciated the enormity of the general collapse that would follow even one major city falling - but he didn't have our examples to learn from.Half a hundred years later, this book is painfully pertinent. And, in the blackest of ironies, Bradbury's warning against censorship and bowdlerism has itself been subject to censorship and bowdlerism. Read it to find out why. If you've read it, read it again.Who knows, your memory may be the one that keeps this book alive.//wiredweird"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"...Very few people see the obvious in this masterful work by Mr. Bradbury...It's not only a political commentary against anti-intellectualism ( President Bush...are you paying attention?!)...But this work is also a clever love story...There are enough admirers of Bradbury's work reading here that may have noted the old triangle Bradbury throws out about middle aged Guy Montague's married wanderlust with a much younger, teenaged girl...The old master doesn't carry this down the regular Valentine road though...He couches Montague's fondness and interest in the fetching young Clarisse around the subject and \\"love\\" of books...It is easy to see the sexual connection Bradbury draws via vivid descriptions on the smell and feel of books...Indeed, Bradbury makes the choice the characters in this most novel of novels must make between the constrained fidelity of 457's society of anti-intellectual constraints versus the uninhibited option of free love in not only one's thinking but in the individual's life and love as a decision a person must make with every bit of fervor and \\"love\\" that they have...Mr. Bradbury makes his choice for the latter in a most convincing, romantic, and egalitarian manner...His spectacular if somewhat cliche ending lets the reader know in no uncertain terms that Bradbury wishes the reader to make and promote the books point of being for knowledge or against it as the crucible of what to take away from this splendid tale...Enough so, that one may indeed wonder what beautiful depths and dimensions Bradbury might have added to this work by giving the character Clarisse more of a voice and part in the book...Certainly, the further fleshing out of the romantic attraction between Montague and Clarisse this reviewer doesn't believe would have detracted from the work, far from it, perhaps it would have added a dimension to the story that seems waiting to be told...Reading any of Bradbury's gorgeous work...\\"The Illustrated Man\\", \\"The Martian Chronicles\\", \\"Dandelion Wine\\", or any of his many short story compilations are absolute rapture for the true bibliophile...Sitting down with Bradbury is like being able to dream while you read...Both are things we don't have enough of in today's \\"Bush-whacked\\" culture...Pick up this one today and send a message to the Nascar set!..."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I WAS SITTING ON MY COUCH ONE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND I HAD NOTHING TO DO SO I PICKED UP THIS BOOK, FAHRENHEIT 451, BY RAY BRADBURY. I THOUGHT TO MY SELF, WHY ARE YOU READING WHEN YOU COULD GO OUTSIDE AND PLAY BASKETBALL OR GO SOMEWHERE...BUT LITTLE DID I KNOW I WOULD BE COMPLETELY INTRIGUED BY BRADBURY'S MASTERPIECE. IN THIS NOVEL, FIREMEN DO NOT EXTINGUISH FIRES BUT IGNITE THEM USING KEROSENE. THE ACT OF SEEKING KNOWLEDGE IS FROWNED UPON AND THOSE WHO INSIST UPON READING AND ARE CAUGHT WITH BOOKS HAVE THEIR LIVES BURNED TO ASHES. THE NOVEL FOLLOWS THE LIFE OF A FIREMAN NAMED GUY MONTAG WHO, BEFORE MEETING AN OPTIMISTIC SEVENTEEN-YEAR-OLD NAMED CLARISSE HAD NEVER ONCE DESIRED TO COLOR OUTSIDE THE LINES OR IN ANY OTHER COLOR THAN BLACK OR WHITE. WITH THE VIEWPOINTS OF CLARISSE, GUY IS ABLE TO SEE THAT THE \\"RIGHT\\" WAY OF LIVING WAS IN FACT THE COMPLETE OPPOSITE.

THE PLOT LATER THICKENS WHEN MONTAG TELLS HIS WIFE, MILDRED, OF HIS NEW FOUND VIEWS ON LIFE AND THE WAY THEY ARE LIVING. IN MY VIEWS BRADBURY WROTE THIS KNOWLEDGE BURNING NOVEL TO TRY AND EXPLAIN TO THE READERS OF WHAT WAS TO COME IN THEIR LIVES IF THINGS WERE NOT CHANGED SOON. MANY OF THE TONES USED AND THE WAY THE FIRE DEPARTMENT RAN THE CITY IS METAPHORICAL TO A DICTATORSHIP.

If you are interested in seeing what people from the seventies though about the future then this book is a good fit. Also, if you are interested in the future and sci-fi this is also a good book because their are some inventions not yet invented that are mentioned. I was required to read this book for my 9th grade year and I probably won't be reading it again because its just not one of those books.

This is by far the worst I have heard. I found it extremely difficult to follow the story which sounded like it was being read by my great grandfather!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Reading this book could be compared to watching a train being derailed while high on shrooms. The very definition of convolution, this book is confusing and ultimately pointless.Our hero, Guy Montag, hardly makes a compelling main character. We know him as little more than a book-burner who begins to have doubts about his task. That's it. Period. Beyond that, he's not developed at all in the ample page space provided. Any other characters have just bit parts and are painfully obviously killed off as soon as the author doesn't need them anymore. It seems Bradbury has misjudged his own timeline, however; many characters, especially Clarisse McClellan, could have been part of a great supporting cast if they hadn't been gotten rid of when he did.Getting back to that \\"pointless\\" bit - well, that's just it. I honestly did not take away a single thing from this book. It was completely and utterly uninformative, and the only way it made me think was to try and figure out where the characters where and what they were talking about. An issue in and of itself, the dialogue in Fahrenheit 451 is so heavily-laden with metaphors, and the parts of conversation passed so often between different characters, every time I discovered what they were talking about was a treasured moment. Anyway, the book doesn't tell me anything. Guy Montag has doubts about his job, and runs away. Ok. So? So what? Why do I care? This had great potential to be a commentary on the suppression of individuality, but like many other possible routes, that thought had been thrown away in favor of... well, whatever this book turned out to be.An exercise in idiocy, this book should not be read by anyone who values his or her time.

I was told to read this book in school, but was not forced, as i have a passion for reading. Anyone who now loves the name &quot;clarrise&quot; for the sole fact that she was a nice person in the novel is a wierdo.

Fahrenheit 451 was this month's choice. After plowing through Bradbury's self-aggrandizing Foreward AND Introduction, I was ready to be enthralled. No such luck. This had to be one of the most abysmal books of all time. I suspect there's a bit of The Emperor's New Clothes (a much better read, by the way) going on here. In other words, if you dare to criticize Bradbury, then you must be one of the mindless rubes who hate books and philosophy and creativity and yadda yadda yadda. Fine, whatever. To put it delicately, this book stunk like yesterday's diapers. I have nothing but sympathy for the poor students who are forced to read this drivel for class--at least I had the option of putting it down. I am a college English major and a Senior Editor at a major publishing house, as well as an avid reader. Bradbury's over-the-top vision of intellectuals being rebellious outsiders who are hunted down is hilariously vain. His celebration of intellect above all else excludes other virtues such as love, compassion, humor, etc.. Interesting how these themes are given such short shrift. Bradbury is an overheated, macho, pseudo-intellectual with a chip on his shoulder. After reading this, all I wanted to do was flip on the TV and watch Three's Company reruns in order the cleanse the palate."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of all the Distopia oriented books I have read this is my favorite. It's also the one that I think had the most probibility of actually happening. Not necessarily book-burning, but the whole complex of censoring things to make everyone happy. That sort of stuff is happening more and more everyday.Nothing else to say besides it's frightening and brilliant."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed this book to an extent. I disliked a lot of things about it also. This book is about a futuristic time where censorship has been taking too far. The idea that as we keep censoring different things to please different minorities we sometimes lose a lot that is good I found very appealing. It seems as if society today does seem to censor too much and is it fixed on appealing to everyone.In this book we find what would happen if we did try to appeal to everyone and not offend anyone. It shows the future without books as being filled with people that have no personalities. People pretty much become drones, each person exactly like the last. The main character, Guy Montag's wife is a perfect example of this. She has no life outside of watching television, which is how most people spend their time in this story. Montag is a fireman who in this day burns books rather than put out fires. He later meets characters who intrigue him and get him to start stealing some books to read and find out what they are about. He soon finds the problems with his society that he is a part of and understands the importance of books.Although this book did have some great points to the negative side of censorship I couldn't really enjoy how unrealistic it was. I just couldn't get over the fact that all people had banned books completely. It was just an unrealistic future in my eyes and I couldn't get over it. Overall, I would recommend this book to all readers even with my dissatisfaction of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For Guy Montag burning the books is a way of life. Never once did he give a second thought to the fact that there was a time, and could again be a time when firemen prevented fires instead of starting them, and book were meant, and allowed to be read, not burned.My favorite aspect of Fahrenheit 451 was how real it was. Although it is a fictional, futuristic novel, the sense that the senerio could happen is chilling to a society that prides itself on freedom of speech and equal liberties.I like Bradbury's writing style also. At first I had little faith that this book could keep my interest, but not too far into reading I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. The language kept you hanging onto every word. Not only was it catching, it was easy to understand and read, yet had a sense of maturity to it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you have ever heard the saying &quot;Don't judge a book by its cover&quot;, you'll notice how Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a perfect example of that. Since I was assigned this book to read by my mom after she read the reading list Mrs. Spehar gave us, I didn't get that enthusiastic with it at first, especially with that title. I thought it was going to be a book where I had to struggle to keep myself awake to read it. After reading the first 4 or 5 pages though, I was proven totally wrong. I became engulfed in this book and couldn't stop reading it. The story felt so real that I could picture it happening in our society without a doubt in my head.I enjoyed reading about how Guy Montag's character unfolded throughout the story and how he realized that just because something was the law didn't mean that it was exactly right. It is good how he followed his beliefs and didn't let anyone tell him that he was wrong. A downside to this book though is that my favorite character, Clarisse, was run over by a car. I believe that Bradbury just added that part to just take her away. I believe if Clarisse would have lived, she would have been at Montag's side and the overall story could have been so much better.Also, I believe that Bradbury could have changed the ending a little. That was the least exciting point of the book. The jets flying by overhead and the city being destroyed was very exciting, but after that, the overall excitement of the book just died off. I am not going to be stereotypical and say that all of Bradbury's books have a dull ending (because I haven't read any other one), but I will say that he should have fixed this one up a little.All in all, Bradbury has written a good book. Not perfect, but good. I think that this is a book that few should be without reading because it can actually knock some sense into them to not be fools and stand up for what they believe in. The book portrays a world that could possibly be our own in a few years. The fate of this world though, will rest upon our own hands."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Before I decided to read this novel, I knew one thing and one thing only about this book, and that was that it was about burning books for some reason. Now that I have read it, I am blown away by how this was written and how thought out it was.The novel starts out set in the future, the main character and the protagonist in this case is a man by the name of Guy Montag. Montag takes great pleasure in his profession, which is a fireman. I like how his job is not to put the fires out but to start them. The fires they start are the burning of contraband, which in this case are books. You aren't allowed to read in the future because reading causes people to think by making them curious and the government jams what they want you to think down your throat. Which isn't too different with today's society, with the video games and television, the reading of books is decreasing, causing people to become less educated. Now a day's television programs force feed you their biased opinions which I think isn't too different from what Bradbury describes. The reality they live in isn't a pretty one. Drivers instead of having a maximum speed limit, have a minimum one. This forces them to drive at blazing speeds and they actually run people over for fun and wars come and go numerously which is absolutely insane.Montag soon becomes bored with his job and his life in general. He steals a book from the collection he was supposed to burn as a means to lower his increasing uneasiness. This leads up to my absolute favorite part in the book. The owner of the books he stole which is an older woman refuses to leave her home, which is to be burned to the ground. Instead, the woman sets fire to her house herself, and stays there as her books and she are destroyed. It makes him realize that the written word is a very valuable thing and only the very enlightened know that.The next thing I liked was that, after hiding the books he had stolen, he was forced to burn his own house and all of his possessions which is a great turn of events. He then gets into a scuffle with his boss and he is warned that he will be dealt with severely. Montag then kills him and is soon perused by a Mechanical hound, which can track anyone down. He then kills that with a flamethrower and retrieves his books.This leads me to the part I disliked, the ending. Montag essentially meets up with a group of intellectuals and hides out until it is once again safe to print books. When bombs destroy the city, they sift through the rubble and begin a new society where man is free to learn and prosper. The reason I disliked this is because it really didn't describe what the new society would have been like. I really wish Bradbury went more in depth on what the new society would have been like.Lastly, although I loved this novel, it could have been way longer, perhaps by not ending the novel where he did and maybe going more into the future and explaining how everything ended up. All in all I am very happy I read this book, and I would recommend this to everyone. Not just the guys."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This story of shattering the oppression of American literature has raised many questions among readers of all walks of life. Guy Montag's expedition was one of self-realization and immense resolve. The inspirational journey involved self-discovery and social hardships. Fahrenheit 451, lets the reader into Guy Montag, a fireman who is slowly but surely seeing his warped world for what it is. The author, Ray Bradbury's clear and descript way of writing shows the reader what type of man Montag is. Bradbury also opens up a new world in describing the city and its citizen's beliefs.Being one of the most unique books of its kind, it's no surprise Fahrenheit 451 has been read and analyzed over and over. The story begins with Guy Montag happily burning books, but by the end of the story, his entire perspective of fire itself had changed completely. All in all, Guy Montag learned that burning the fire is the only way to cure his war-torn world."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman; he starts fires to burn the houses of people who keep books illegally. He enjoys his job and doesn't ask any questions, until a series of events open his eyes to the emptiness around him, forcing him to question everything about himself and the society in which he lives.The story that Bradbury wrote over fifty years ago is every bit as effective as the day it was published. The censorship he describes isn't simply the result of an overbearing government, it begins as a function of the masses, whose desire for political correctness and 'happiness' lead to the destruction of things that offend and stir emotions. The solution, along with burning the offending books, is to bombard the senses so as to eliminate the thought process entirely.In this age of political correctness and mass media, Bradbury's words ring more true than ever. His vision of a society where all men are not created equal, but made equal, is a stern warning against the elimination of individual thought and the idea that true happiness comes from being constantly entertained.I can't begin to do this book justice; nearly every page contains a thought-provoking passage. Bradbury wrote a classic whose truth is timeless and that everyone should read at least once."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is a great book to read. Just imagine living in a society where reading books is illegal. The way that Ray Bradbury wrote this book is magnificent. The reader can easily visualize the flames when he describes the burning books.Guy Montag is a fireman who never questioned his job. In this world, a fireman was not hired to put out fires but hired to burn books. When Guy Montag met a seventeen-year-old girl who tells him of a past where people read books to learn and to read for pleasure instead of burning them, he begins to doubt his chosen profession. What's wrong with owning books and wanting to read and learn about the past and read for pleasure? Why can't society be the way it used to be. Why do we live in a world in which the government feels that it must control every aspect of our lives? These are just a few of the questions Guy asks.Imagine Guy Montag's horror when his wife discovers a stash of his illegal books in her own home! He now must explain to her why he has done this. Just because it is illegal he doesn't feel it to be such a terrible thing. Mrs. Montag is not only saddened by her husband's deception, but totally frieghtened of the consequences.Fahrenheit 451 is a must read! It is a very imaginative and fascinating book. It grabs the reader's attention from the very first page to the last!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is a fast-paced science fiction novel about a futuristic society that has outlawed the reading of books.

Although sometimes confusing, 451 makes you think a lot about society today and how it could be in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury has written a book that made me feel as if I were Guy Montag. He uses situations of panic that seem unfair and confusing. This is a very useful writting trick that made the book better and slightly frightening for me. If there were 900 stars to award this book, I would still give it a five if the scale were the same. Ummm... I can't think of anything else to write. I was hoping Clarisse would come back towards the end of the book. She didn't. That's okay. I guess. She sounded hot. My lungs are failing, so I need a ham sandwich. Bye.

We may not literally make books illegal, but socially, they already are. In this tale, Guy Montag is a fireman whose job is to burn books, and the houses that contain them. Then a \\"17 year old and crazy\\" girl puts some questions into his mind. Then he meets an old professor who brings on more questions. These characters make Montag question the society, and as a result, his life gets turned upside down.This book was published way back in 1953, when society was just starting down the road that leads where it is today. Many things foretold in this book have come true in one form or another. Most people have become mentally stagnant. TV and video games have replaced books and creative thinking. I knew very few people in high school who enjoyed reading anything besides web-pages and TV guides. This book is worth reading just to get a kick in the stomach at how closely the book's society mirrors our own.Many people have complained of the confusing writing style the Bradbury uses. I agree that it is a little difficult to follow at first, but you get use to it rather quickly. The only time that I had excessive trouble understanding what was happening, was the last couple of pages. I found the ending to be confusing. But, I just read it again and found some cliff-notes online, and now I understand what happened perfectly. Personally, I like the writing style because it is somewhat confusing. It makes you think for yourself in order to understand what is happening.So, if you are looking for a great book, this is one of the best I have read. I highly recomend Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 to anyone. Please read it so you can understand where our society is headed. Please read this book and aide in avoiding this very probable future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit 451* over 50 years ago; it's theme of the 'Big Brother' autocratic society, has often had it compared to Orwell's 1984.Before I read this book I knew absolutely nothing of the story or its draconian motif. So finding out the altered definition of 'fireman' that this book refers to was a revelation, to say the least.The story: *SPOILER*This is the tale of Guy Montag, a 'fireman' within this repressed society; a society in which 'happiness' is permitted and even encouraged, but free thinking is frowned upon in the strongest terms. And what is the most obvious example of free thinking...why books of course. Thus we discover that Montag is a 'fireman' and his job is to burn books; burn books, so that no one in the future will every get a sense of history or get any ideas about changing the present regieme into a free thinking society. Montag's problem is that he begins to wonder if what he's doing is right; thus his personal revolt begins, and not surprisingly he finds friends and enemies in unexpected places.I liked the style in which Bradbury developed Montag; Everyone in this society is suppose to be happy, but Montag is increasingly unhappy. He is constantly talking to himself, always doubting himself and his new, 'radical' thoughts. It's not difficult to feel empathy towards Montag as he becomes increasingly uncomfortable with his position and he begins to question his thinking and his own sanity. His wife (and her friends), his job and his desire to read books all contribute in ways to reduce his ability to handle his increasingly difficult situation.Subjectively, I liked the first 2/3s of the book better than the latter; not knowing anything about this tale added to the intrigue and mystery at the beginning, making it hard to put the book down. I didn't find the latter 1/3 quite as 'believable' and that compelling sense of urgency that defined the first part seemed to disappear, and for this I took off 1/2 Star.Conclusion:A great book, much different than I'd expected. Well written, with a wonderfully developed hero; giving us many glimpses of a distressed and complex personality who is in an ongoing battle with his own inner demons, and a waffling conscience that's unsure of it's moral obligations as it fights to maintain his sanity.Interesting to see that some of Bradbury's thoughts of the future are not all that far off in certain parts of the world today; some maybe closer to home that we'd like to believe.* 451 deg. Fahrenheit, is the temperature at which paper begins to scorch and crumple."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"When I first encountered this book at the age of 13, I was more accustomed to 'choose your own adventure' books or pulp science fiction. I'd never heard of Bradbury, but realized as I fought through the first few chapters that I was in over my head. I stuck it out however, and when I was done, my life had changed forever. Since then I have read this book many times, and it is always with a particular fondness because this is the book that taught me to read. To read as more than someone who desires nothing more than to be entrained.That is not to say that Bradbury isn't entertaining. I've always found him to be one of the most successfully entertaining science fiction writers of all time. FAHRENHEIT 451 is on of his best. Conceptually simple (books are outlawed and the world has become a dreary, dystopian place where cheap thrills and wars fought with disease bombs are the norm) but wise and deep in substance, Bradbury successfully weaves characters and plot into a profound statement about the essential nature of human kind and how the best of our writing can, if used (read) properly, even save us from ourselves.There are few accolades that I can give this book that have not been already said more eloquently elsewhere. This is book filled with profound truth, a book that inspires, and a book that illustrates the best and worst of what men are capable of. Ultimately about the hope we have in the sum of human knowledge, few other books will make you treasure the act of reading and the privilege of owning books like this one will."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was a journey through the future of what our world turned in to. Guy Montag was a firefighter, but instead of putting out fires, they started them. In their world books were illegal and anyone who had them in their home would be removed and their house would be burned. Montag has burned many houses, but this one burning really struck him and he took a good look at reality. He never noticed the importance of books and goes through many, many adventures you'll just have to read for yourself.I personally don't like science fiction, but this book really grabbed my attention. At the beginning it was a little difficult to understand what was going on and it was hard getting into the story, but as you read on everything starts to fall into place and make sense. The thing about this book that I found the most interesting was I read it and almost felt as if things in that book were true. It seemed like our world would end up like that in their century, this book was very believable and made me want to read more. Everyone should read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" at least once in their life because it is very well written and a truly wonderful book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Ray Bradbury's classic, Farenheit 451, he describes a terrifying but all-too-real world of sensory overload and thought-depravity. Guy Montag is a fireman, but this fire brigade doesn't put out fires (for houses are fire proofed with plastic coatings), but instead starts them, burning houses (and often people) where books are found. And people, for the most part, don't question the way of things; in fact, most people simply contributed to them, reading less and less, being less and less interested in dissenting views and complex views of reality. Instead people opt for graphic novels filled with sex, and talking \\"parlors,\\" living rooms with televisions on three (and sometimes four) walls that surround the viewer in a virtual reality that becomes family, friends, entertainment, and knowledge. There is no taking walks, no late evening chats on the front porch; in short, little or no thought. But Guy slowly emerges from the haze of this contrived reality, as he first encounters a strange girl who doesn't seem to be charmed by the way things are, and then comes to see his own duties as a fireman as brutal and senseless. Didn't firemen used to actually put out fires? he wonders.Montag, now repulsed by his occupation, starts looking for a way out. And on the way, he begins slipping books into his coat as he is burning houses, one here, one there, until he's got his own little library. But soon his captain, Beatty, is on to him, and the mechanical hound, the instrument of doom and seeker of people and books, finds him out. Montag is left with the choice, burn his own house or admit guilt. He starts his house ablaze, but then turns the flame thrower on Beatty and on the mechanical hound and makes a break for it. He is now a man on the run, but a free man for the first time. He finds himself among a group of run-aways along a deserted railroad track, and discovers they are former professors and preachers, and each one holds inside him a chapter or a book. One is Thoreau, one is Marcus Aurelius, one is Plato's Repulic, and so on. Montag is the book of Ecclesiastes. And as their civilization seems to be spiraling toward an end in a huge and destructive war, the wisdom of that great book, that everything has a time and a season, seems a pointer to the possibility of a new reality, a fresh start.Bradbury's Farenheit 451 is a prophetic novel that bears freightening resemblance to our world today. Our culture resembles the reality he paints in its obsession with virtual reality (think \\"reality TV\\" and our obsession with this fictive family or friend network, as just one examle), media saturation, and shallowness. Our politics are driven by sound bites and media experts more than they are driven by policy positions and reasoned debates. Marketing is more important than product quality. And this is just the beginning. Reading Bradbury's classic is like a wake-up call to appreciate the wisdom of the ages, the beauty of friendships, the value of family, and the wonder that is a quiet walk in the woods. It is truly a treasure trove of reality, all tinged with the hope redemption."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was first published in 1953. It is one of those books that for some reason I was never required to read in high school or college. For that reason, I am trying to read a few of these classics each year. I was not sure what to expect as I am really not into futuristic books, however this book blew me away with its accuracy of predictions some 55+ years after it was first published.Fahrenheit 451 details the eternal war between censorship and freedom of thought and continues to be relevant today more than ever. In Bradbury's future, books are illegal and happily so--citizens are too busy watching their wall-sized televisions and listening to their in-ear \\"seashell\\" radios to care about the loss of good literature. Guy Montag begins the novel as a fireman who enforces the temperature of the title--that at which books burn--but then transforms and tries to show his society the mistake of censorship. It's a treat to hear Bradbury read his own work, almost as if a wise elder were sharing a cautionary tale. Sometimes the slower pace seems awkward for a novel of such action, but overall the reading does justice to the timeless classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was the first novel to describe what would happen if people couldn't think. It is an interesting story that you don't find much. The world it draws up has no basis. This is because people can't think. In Fahrenheit 451, people are not allowed to have books because the government is afraid of an educated society. This book is very distressing because censorship could happen today. If there was censorship, the world would become dull and disturbing, as nothing would happen. There would be no great events, and this would cause no one to realize anything. This is the reason that it is still popular today. It is because of how controversial it is, in the fact of the world it portrays."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a masterful speculation of what the world would look like if events continued to unfold in its destructive progression.

Do we care about our neighbours, or even our own families? A great book, and a must read!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A science fiction thriller. A true masterpiece that will blow you away. Although it's a science fiction book, it has some frighening resemblances to our own world. I could easily see this world turning onto the thoughtless \\"utopia\\" described by Ray Bradbury.The government tries to keep everyone happy in the process of no self thought and the burning of things that would cause debate and conflict, such as books. Now that houses are completely fireproof, the firemen no longer need to stop fires. Instead, the have a new job: to burn books.I liked this book because it kept me wanting it to keep reading and reading to the end. It was even hard for me to go to sleep some nights I was reading it.

Fahrenheit 451 is perfect! The author presents us with a world where books and anything \\"upsetting\\" are illegal. Things like creativity and thinking are nonexistent, and life revolves around being entertained, mostly by giant television screens... The main character of the story eventually changes, but I won't say too much more about that. I will say though that is one interesting book to read, especially with all the similarities it has with the current times.

What I really liked is how the main character realized that he could no longer keep people from having their knowlege and turned around to protect the books. The people who would memorize their books and keep the knowledge was also a very cool concept. Great story!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is so relevant to today that it is scary. It has really opened my eyes. This book is a must read and is definitely one of my favorite books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Update: The initial photo shows the anniversary paperback version. The NEW amazon listing for hardcover is to be avoided at all cost. Another reviewer added a photo of the hardcover version (the darker cover with orange border). It is a tiny little book (3x5 I think) with minuscule font and cheap, see-through low grade recycled paper. I returned my copy, and I recommend you do the same. The paperback is of better quality. I would never spend $10+ on such a shoddy hardcover. I expect this from unscrupulous 3rd party sellers, but not from amazon.com's actual listing.-----------------------For those who have not read this novel, or not have read it since school (as in my case); it deserves a thorough read. Many of the concepts that Bradbury wrote about were alien to me in my teens. Now, barely over 30, I find that my life experiences as well as influence from other literature and film have helped me to develop a better responsiveness to this work.The novel is quite short and even reading it carefully and thoroughly took me a couple of visits to my local coffee shop. The book does contain some grammatical and spelling errors, but remember that Bradbury wrote this at a very young age (as a series of short stories first), and without a formal composition or literature degree.The message is one that surely hits home in these times: people are often in such a rush nowadays. Literature is being overlooked by many, television is the most utilized media, advertising is rampant in the society, and people have a million little 'diversions' such as twitter and facebook and video games to occupy their free time.I believe that the most unsettling aspect of the novel as applied to todays society is thus: people never officially banned books to begin; instead they just forgot about them and pursued other interests.For any true book lover this is a must read. Again, it has it's problems, but it is an entertaining, mind opening novel deserving of another (or a first) read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury takes its name from the temperature at which books burn. The story takes place in the future and it follows the life of a fireman called Montag. Fireman in our current time have the job of putting out fires. In the time period that Montag lives, fireman make fires, burning collections of books since reading books in that time has been outlawed.Ray Bradbury's book is a welcomed defense of book reading that is still relevant considering that many young people only read books because their English teacher assigned them for class. The novel \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also champions the free press. At one point in the novel, it is explained to Montag by his boss Beatty that the opinions argued in books led to more arguments and that it was best to not allow people to read in order to avoid arguments.As the book progresses Montag becomes more and more disenchanted with his job as a book burning fireman. On top of a defense of literature, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" also makes a fulfilled prediction that people in the future will sit around with earphones listening to music all the time (in the novel the earphones are made of seashells). Sound familiar."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book seemed to be a very interesting. It showed me a picture of the future if the government would not be controlled by the people and books would be banned from reading which would make the people be equal. This would be a problem because there would be bad leaders and people would not be very happy about it. I liked how Montag was standing up for the people which were connected with the books to help them out because he could not believe how the world was run by people who wanted to control the people and rule the country until they die. I learned from Montag that you need to do some courageous things to make this go better and live on a side to spread the word of books which might be passed on and on until the people understand that reading is good for people and people should be smarter in order to have strong leaders not leaders that want everyone to be equal and not allow to do things they want and whenever they want. The books would allow the people to show their emotion and to get over stuff that was difficult to deal with and they also teach us new stuff and expand our knowledge. The literature was banned in the society in which Montag lived because the leaders wanted them equal."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book was recieved in a really well condition. I will order from them again if I need another book!! Although the book is not your everyday entertainment its still good for school assignments."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Very little in the way of review is required for this classic novel, given that its content and themes are so well known. I will, however, attempt to give a response to this monumental work.Fahrenheit 451 addresses the subject of censorship by depicting a society in which books are forbidden. The destruction (by fire) of any books discovered represents a form of social control which is, essentially, a distortion of utilitarian ethics. The fire chief, Captain Beatty, explains to the novel's primary character, Montag, that the work of a \\"fireman\\" is to assure happiness for the many. Utilitarianism, of the kind promoted by John Stewart Mill and Jeremy Bentham, judges the ethical correctness of any action according to whether or not it produces the greatest happiness for the greatest number of people. The character of Beatty argues that books have a disruptive influence on society: \\"[W]e can't have our minorities upset and stirred. Ask yourself, what do we want in this country, above all? People want to be happy, isn't that right?\\" Happiness for the majority is encouraged by \\"the parlor\\" (a form of television) which entertains and generates contentment by avoiding material which could stimulate independent thought and, therefore, anxiety.Montag, however, becomes increasingly dissatisfied with this stagnant social situation, and curiously (given his lack of exposure to books) he expresses his disquiet through an apparent reference to Plato's Republic: \\"Maybe books can get us out of the cave.\\" While this may seem an unlikely observation, it neatly signifies the growing enlightenment in Montag and his desire for further enlightenment - both for himself and for his society. It also draws attention to a somewhat ironic parallel. In matters related to education, Plato was very selective about which works of literature should be used, just as only a few books (mostly technical manuals) are permitted in the society imagined here by Ray Bradbury.But books aren't really the issue for Bradbury; what matters is the freedom of ideas they represent. Books themselves are mere receptacles. Bradbury's interest clearly lies in the censorship of ideas, not the medium that carries them.Fahrenheit 451 deserves its status as a classic. It beautifully conveys the power (and the fear) of ideas, and the conflict between the conservative and pioneering tendencies in human consciousness. It easily earns five stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" by Ray Bradbury a long while ago, but then I've read it again and watched the movie I couldn't say how many times. It's one of those stories you can read, or view, over again. The story is placed in a futuristic society where books are banned and firemen set fire to them wherever they're found. What brings this story back to prominence, for me anyway, is the gradual cessation of printing that has begun as a result of the evolution of electronics. And many schools are also no longer teaching children script. Where might it all end. I remarked to a friend recently about just this situation and she responded with: \\"I'd create a suitable place within my basement to keep books safe\\". That is exactly the sense that one develops while reading \\"Fahrenheit 451\\". The movie follows the book, however, I'd read the story first. And one idea Mr. Bradbury had which has always provided me wonder is the memorizing of book contents. An idea that was copied in the movie \\"The Book of Eli\\". Mr. Bradbury has always been a favorite of mine as has \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"For my book project in school, I chose to Fahrenheit 451; I was quite impressed by his writing in The Illustrated Man and The Martian Chrnicles.I simply loved the novel. Its theme of censorship and knowledge vs. ignorance reminded to be aware of the future.Since almost everyone has explained the plot of this book, I won't bother to do this."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Love stories are about the heat of the moment and there can be 451 degrees of heat between a person and their love for books. In the well-known novel Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury. The story takes place in the near future at a town were the fire fighters don't put out the fires they start them. The fire fighters have five rules that they need to stick to 1) answer the alarm quickly 2) start the fire swiftly 3) burn every thing 4) report back to fire house immediately 5) stand alert for other alarms. So when the fire fighters hear the siren it means that someone in town has been caught with a book in their house. It is the fire fighters job to race down to the house and light it on fire whether the person living there is in or out of the house. Guy Montag, one of the fire fighters that takes pleasure in burning books is confronted one day by one of his new neighbors Clarisse McClellan a seventeen year old, she meets up with Guy a few times, but in their short time period's together Guy's world is thrown upside down. Clarisse questions him and tackles him about his job. She asks him what's the point and why does he do it. What's so wrong with book? His reply is that books are illegal. After all of the questions Guy became curious and takes books away from the burning pile. Little by little he starts wondering what was wrong with books, so he asked a professor to teach him.Ray Bradbury born in Waukegan, Illinois, on August 22, 1920. Ray wrote Fahrenheit 451 when he was 22 and has won many awards for his writing such as the O. Henry Memorial Award, the Benjamin Franklin Award (1954), and the Aviation-Space Writer's Association Award for Best Space Article in an American Magazine (1967), the World Fantasy Award for Lifetime Achievement, and the Grand Master Award from the Science Fiction Writers of America. His work was also included in the Best American Short Stories collections for 1946, 1948 and 1952.He has won all of these awards because he writes with a breathtaking style. This book has a fabulous plot that makes you think about what might happen in the future years if people keep watching more and more television and reading fewer and fewer books."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved reading Fahrenheit 451, it was very enjoyable. I can see why it is considered a classic by many people. Also, it deals with issues that are more vibrant in our country today than when the book was originally published. The scary thing is, the society in the book has many striking similarities to our own today, especially now that Bush is in office again. Anyway, I reccomend this wonderful book to everyone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is about the future and what censorship can do to society and the importance of our free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree with them or not. First off it's about a fireman, Guy Montag, whose job is not to fight fire and put it out but to start the fires. At this time books are forbidden from people unless they were government writings. That is how the government controlled them: by not letting them learn. Although one day he can't help but read a line from one of the books he is about to burn. Of course he becomes curious and steals some books so that he can read them for himself. After starting to read the books he goes to an old professor to see if they can reprint some of these books. One night he came to an old woman's house where they are to burn her collection. The fire captain drowns her books in kerosene except the old woman lights herself on fire along with her books. After seeing this Montag becomes disgusted and decides not to be a fireman any longer. Montag decides to go to work for just one more day and surprisingly they get a call to go to his house where he is the one to light his house on fire. Instead of lighting a match he kills the other men and goes on the run eventually meeting up with a group of old college professors in the woods and eventually becoming one of them.I disliked this book for a few reasons. The first one is because it is a futuristic book it is hard to follow in some places and the author describes some things in a way that is very difficult to understand.The reasons I liked this book is the fact that you have to create what you think the author is trying to make the future look like; and because Bradbury is a very descriptive writer he helps you create a picture of what you are reading. Another reason I liked this book is because I can relate to it. The people in our society are reading less and enjoying television and radios more than they should be."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having read this novel a few years ago when I was younger, I was hoping now that I would have developed an appreciation for this futuristic experience in words, but I did not. I shall reference specific aspects for my review and explain why this science fiction story still does not appeal to my personal reading preferences.The overall plot includes a fireman named Guy Montag who burns books because they are considered evil now since they make people think and question. The people in this weird society do not read books or think independently. They all watch an overabundance of television on wall size sets and listen to \\"Seashell Radio\\" sets attached to their ears. Montag enlists the help of a retired English professor, Faber, to help him understand the value of books, and why they are in a world with no reminders of history.The \\"normal\\" character in the novel is Clarisse McClellan. If it is assumed that Guy Montag is the protagonist, she is the antithesis of anyone he has met before. She talks with him about the world's beauty and meaning topics which make her an outcast from this society. She makes him curious about the contents of the books he burns. Guy's wife, Mildred, is obsessed with the interactive television programs. She is a shell of a human being without substance whose \\"family\\" attachment is in a soap opera she watches constantly. She is a morbid, complex person who eventually betrays him. The antagonist in this novel seems to be society in general, but also Montag's boss, Captain Beatty. He calls books \\"treacherous weapons,\\" but he clearly uses his knowledge from reading to manipulate Montag without feelings or pity.Guy Montag is a fireman, who burns books and starts fires, rather than put them out, a far stretch of my imagination. After his encounter with Clarisse, he begins to question his empty life, his profession and society. In his intense and reckless pursuit to envision his life and direction, he often blunders and is easily swayed and manipulated by others. The violence and killings throughout the story were not to my liking and interest. The use of the Mechanical Hounds seemed silly and not necessary. In the end, when he joins the \\"Book People,\\" a final war begins, with bombs falling upon the city. This seems to me to be a great start for another novel, one that would appeal to my reading taste."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The plot of this book is based on the future and it's difference from the past. Perhaps the greatest difference is books and how people see them. Guy Montag is a fireman who realizes the significance of books. The twist is however; his occupation involves burning books because people are afraid of them.This novel has very interesting significance because it uses symbolism to give important lesson in knowledge. Books and knowledge. Books and knowledge are what gives us freedom.Learning that we take thoughts for granted is what makes Ray Bradbury such a great author. He managed to give a plot with a sudden turn into the jaw dropping conclusion of Fahrenheit 451. Using symbolic words and quotes of characters, he gets his message out loud and clear.After reading Fahrenheit 451 and learning about how much freedom every person has, Ray Bradbury's words are descriptive and share an important moral about life that the decisions we make can affect everyone else."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I am not a science fiction fan in the least, but this is such a classic - how can you NOT like it? It speaks volumes on the way things are today even. I so respect the author's views and thoughts on life and censorship. I think it should make us all pause and consider our own lives and if we're living them to the fullest and grabbing it by the horns!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Just finished Fahrenheit 451 this past week after reading it well over 5 years ago in 7th grade. Back then I thought it was a nice little book to read but unfortunately missed all of the key messages that Ray Bradbury was addressing in our society today.5 years later, I picked this book up again and was blown away again by the story itself and what I missed years ago.Guy Montag is a fire fighter in the non-traditional sense. The setting is an age where houses have been fireproofed not against house fires but against their own fire departments.Books are banned in this society , an atomic war is looming over the heads of the city, and above all of this is the agony that Guy Montag must face as he makes a decision on questioning the same job he has faithfully executed year after year.This novel is both fascinating and unnerving with the same turn of a page. A future where movies and television (parlors) block out all of our problems instead of addressing them could very well happen one day. A future where books are no longer useful in a society dominated by the entertainment value of Hollywood.A fine read if you ever get the chance to pick up this novelTravis S"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ok, I saw the movie \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" and I thought it was well-made (even though I didn't agree with most of the content). So, the next day I hear that Ray Bradbury (the author of this novel) is furious at Michael Moore for stealing his title. The name sounded really catchy and this dispute sounded like it could brew into a controversy between Moore and Bradbury. Also, I wanted to see what the whole thing was about since they label it a classic.So, I picked up the book and I was blown away. This book is really short yet it is so intriguing. It's basically about this guy who is in a futuristic time where the government does not allow people to read books. If you are caught with them, they have a special crew of \\"firefighters\\" who go and torch your books (hence Fahrenheit 451: The temperature at which paper burns). Kinda weird, eh? Well, it gets better. This society basically doesn't think on it's own. The reason that books are not allowed is because that they influence people to think and it does not fit well into this new society.Then the protagonist (who is a \\"firefighter\\") wonders what is so powerful about books after witnessing a lady willingly being torched to death with her books. He is very unhappy with his life and figures that maybe the content that books contain (which he has never read before) might be the key to livening up his useless life.I'll stop there and let you figure the rest out for yourself because this is one book that you would want to read without much knowledge of it. It's quick, yet thought provoking about how society even today could change into something similar to that. Excellent read. Make this a definite addition to your potential reading list."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was a Ray Brudbury fan for a long time before I finally picked up this book. I have to say, while it is a brilliant piece of utopian literature and should be required reading, the fact that Bradbury threw it together on a pay typewriter in a public library shows. The underlying point of the book comes across sharp and clear, but at the expense of much of what is quintessential Bradbury. His deep probings of character and deep pools of thought are whisked away to make room for a fast-paced story that in my own opinion could have been at least twice as long. Anyhow, let Farenheit 451 be your door into Bradbury's world, and when you're done pick up Something Wicked or Dandelion Wine, find your way to the Illustrated Man or the October country and you'll find Bradbury's real treasure"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Possessing books is illegal, for which your house may burn. Guy Montag is a man in living in the near future and his occupation is a fireman, whose job it is to burn books. He grows sick of his the society and decides to see what is all about the books he burns. He sees another man in the city who enjoys books as well and they plan to bring them back into society. But after being forced to burn his own house, he commits murder and runs away. He flees to the outskirts of the city where there are retired philosophers and literaturists who help Montag. They watch as an atomic bomb destroy the city, then go and put their book knowledge to use. This book is excellent and very unique and is recommended to all readers.The plot and flow of this story is also interesting. It begins with Montag first meeting Clarisse who strikes him as an odd person. He then comes home to find his wife unconscious and overdosed on sleeping pills. He burns a lady and her house, and begins to read the books he steals from the homes. After seeking help from a retired professor, Montag is forced to burn his own house. There he commits murder, which sends him on the run from the city. Outside the city, he witnesses it being destroyed by an atomic bomb.Fahrenheit 451 is a very interesting story because of the unique setting. It is set in the near future in a modern city, but with a much different type of society. Thought they do not realize it, everyone seems to be depressed, compared to real modern society. The setting is also interesting because of the censorship at full extent. With houses being fireproof, firemen's new job is too set them ablaze. With no books, the true facts a completely unknown to the public, with false facts like Benjamin Franklin began the Firehouse and that houses have always been fireproof.The characters are also interesting. Guy Montag is the lone person he knows who reads books, though he burns them and makes no sense of them. Beatty is an ironic man. Though he is big on burning books and how useless they are, it is obvious he reads them as well because he is a rather cunning intellectual and is able to manipulate almost anybody effortlessly. Another unique person is Clarisse McClellan. She is what one in their society might call an antisocial figure because of her odd habits and strange curiosityThis book is a must read, with such realistic settings and people. It almost seems like a real event, which took place in the past. This book is indeed unique and the best among all the novels.I.Leung(Vin)"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This great novel is still just as relevant today, if not so more then when first written. With all the issues regarding schooling and censorship and whatnot. And the story is greata must read!!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Although not as profound as George Orwell's \\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" still stands as a prophetic warning against the evils of censorship, and controlling the masses through ignorance.The little lost in profundity by comparison to \\"1984\\" is more than made up in readability. Whereas \\"1984\\" took me two days to complete, I read through \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" in an afternoon. Additionally \\"1984\\" ends with an feeling of hopelessness, whereas 451 ends with some degree of optimism for the future.Overall, 451 still stands out as one of a limited number of dystopian stories whose message remains as vital today as when it was published."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story overall was great. The setting however may be confusing at first. The symbolism is very interesting but again, hard to understand."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a book that is set in the futuristic time of the 24th century. Ray Bradbury, the author of the book, tells his vision of the future which is definitly technology enhanced.The main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman who loves fire. In this time it is firemens job to start fire to a house of those who have disobeyed the law, like possesing a book. The people of this society are to think the same and to know of no different. Guy Montag is of course one of these people. However this soon changes when he meets a young girl names Clarisse who is quick to change Montags beliefs.Montag begins to realize that that book burning is wrong and the thing that he loves burning is the very thing that spreads knowledge and opinion. After he realizes this he is tempted to steal one of his own. He does this and the plot begins to unfold. He tells his wife of his secret and that he actually has stolen many more. His wife disagrees with him that this is the right thing to do and turns him in. Guy Montag meets new people along the way that have the same opinion about this stuff and they help him. Montag tries to rebuild his society with new freedoms after it is destroyed in war.I enjoyed this book becase Bradbury's descriptions and vocabulary usages are amazing. I liked how he showed that the things we think so little of are really very important to the life and freedoms that we have today. He also shows that sometimes inventions can get out of control and we forget how to do the simple things becase the machines do it for us. The author creates a world that is threatening and exotic but at the same time is is familiar enough to seem real. I enjoyed this book even though at times it could get confusing and complicated it is definitly one of the better thought-provoking books I have read yet."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most disturbing books I have ever read. In Fahrenheit 451 the way that Ray Bradbury uses his imagination to visualize the future is great. His future had shells for head phones and walls for screens, that is so cool. Except for the fact that everyone has lost there mind the story is extremely interesting.The way that Mr. Bradbury depicts the future is almost real in the sense that what if we really do forget what books are used for. The way that Montag gets interested in the books and has to try to hide it from every one he knows.The detail that Bradbury goes in to about Montag keeping his secret is great describing him sweating out every second. Mildred At all times being half drugged half awake. The society to wear no one can die unless you have books then you are burned. I believe that Bradbury succeeded in is book although I believe it is increasingly weird.It gives brilliant depiction into his mind and his imagination. Mr. Bradbury I believe has a way of striking to the core of a person. A way of showing a side of a thought that no one has ever thought about. I personally have never thought that our inventions could be bad. This shows that what if change is really bad."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a gem, the best book that I've ever read. I didn't have the opportunity to read it in school and decided to check it out. I now have a little paper in my wallet that I carry with me everywhere. This paper has quotes for the novel. My personal favorite. While most of these quotes are disturbing, because they're just so close to the truth, they are brilliant. Mr. Bradbury's descriptions and vocabualry usages are amazing.He wrote this book 50 years ago (52) yet he still managed to get so close to the truth. Back then, TV was a new thing and Mr. Bradbury sensed that there was something wrong with it. His future has TV as a replacement for books, books being outlawed and firemen starting fires instead of putting them out to destroy books. Mr. Bradbury probably feared that something like this might happen and decided to put his thoughts down first.While books still exist now and aren't outlawed, much more people would prefer watching Wheel of Fortune or going to see a useless movie at the theatre like Mr and Mrs. Smith. One thing that struck me was that there are over 5 million copies of this book in print. A lot, right? Not really if you think about it. While this book has been out for over 50 yrs, movies make 200 million dollars in 3 or 4 months getting a huge amount of US's population attending them.Mr. Bradbury makes TV something that everyone has in his future, like it is now. He has the TV's taking up an entire wall and certain characters are begging for another wall. Picture it, a giant wall, a TV screen. Now, how far is that from the truth? Now we have those giant plasma TVs and the ones litteraly attached to the wall. How sad.In his future, the U.S. is the big dog, starting wars with other countries because they can.This future is full of violence and hostility, but one man will stand up to it. The last 40-50 pages of the book are pure genius with some of the most memeorable lines ever.Mr. Bradbury has made a classic, my personal favortite book, a wrok fiction that could easily be mistaken for a work of non fiction. So tonight, instead of watching Mr. and Mrs. Smith, why don't you pick this gem out. I'm sure that everyone in the U.S ahs heard of it, but I bet that a much fewer number has read it...if they hadn't been forced to at least."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is an interesting thing to review an american classic, and furthermore to review a book by an literary legend. That being said, it is apparent to anyone who has read the novel of why exactly it is a classic. Bradbury is among those authors from the golden age of science fiction writing. The early to mid 20th century saw a surge of scifi writers, the most prominent standing out from among the crowd to bestow upon us today's required readings. No sarcasm there, infact moreso enthusiasm. Huxley, Orwell, and Bradbury (and the even earlier Wells) have all produced standing classics which are used by many facilities to teach. It is truly a wonderful thing.Bradbury's book begins with a recount of the passion and the draw to burning. As a foreshadow, thiese paragraphs seek to write about a fireman in a futuristic dystopian society (dystopian in the quality of mental freedom). The society has, over time, allowed provisions to be made that completely cut out freedom of thought. However, the frightening thing deals with how they do this. Instead of just restricting books and other forms of published media, they have distracted the general public by means of electronic trickery. An advanced and much more frightening form of brainwash, the citizens are too caught up with \\"their family\\" (the referred is actually those on the television, whom they've become so ingrained with that they spend most of the day watching) to care about much else. This works for most, but not all, as humannature dictates. There are those behind the scenes, taking care of the dirty work.Enter Guy Montag, a fireman with the local fire department. Unlike modern convention, firemen in this futuristic nightmare are set out to burn the aformentioned media. They carry bottle of kerosene, the adversary to their predecessors, and threaten to burn anyone who posesses printed literature. However, Montag dissents when he reads a book that he swiped and he begins to slowly support those who he has hunted for the past years. His captain, Beatty, is a fierce man with a sharp wit. He completely understands Montag's position, as he has lived it, however he sides strongly with the belief that books are the root of all evil and that by destroying them, the government is doing the people a favor. He twists the situation of brainwash into sounding almost appeasing.Bradbury wrote the book in an amazing fashion. Taken from the life of \\"he who burns the books\\" (or the character who's job creates the actual problem), the story follows Montag into his general dissent and being hunted by those he previously worked for. Bradbury uses an amalgam of characters to shape our perception of this world, everything from the foundation upon his societal institution was based to the hidden war that is being waged. Without giving away too much information, it is sufficient to say that the conflict is resolves in a satisfying manner. One would suspect that such an occurence would happen during the upstart of such a ruled society, and I was pleased to see it concluded in that manner."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"An excellent read, thrilling and provocative. Ray Bradbury is one of my favorite authors because of his superior ability to convey detail. I began this book thinking it wasn't all that good but to my surprise I loved it and it is now one of my favorite books. It was a good book because the writing was engrossing and there was alot of action, he made the characters come alive and you could imagine them in your head as you were reading and play a sort of movie in your mind. The way Ray Bradbury views his future from 50 years ago is not that far off and is a bit frightening. Even though it was a great book I only wished it could have lasted longer. After the city was blown up it ended right there and left you wanting more. I also enjoyed reading about the futuristic gadgets and devices they used such as the Mechanical Hound, Seashell Radios and the Parlor. Overall I would suggest this book to anyone despite their taste I strongly feel no matter what kind of books you like this will appeal to you."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this book one day on a long bus ride. At first it was just something to do, but soon it became more. It is a very fascinating novel, especially when considering that it was written 50 years ago. Bradbury's view of the future is actually not that far off, in my opinion. The book is very thought-provoking and it makes you think. I also appreciate that it is written in a deeper matter, a characteristic of a true classic. I can understand that perhaps the fact of this being required to read at many schools might turn many students off to the book, but personally, I enjoyed reading it for pleasure."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like science fiction books Farenheit 451 is a must have, at most points it is a page turner. I rated this book 4 stars because it is a great book that really gets the reader involved.To describe the book, I would say think of todays world and completly flip it around! This book is a twisted version of life as we know it. It is set in the future where firemen no longer are called to put fires out, but, to start them. There hoses dont spray water, but, they spray kerosene. Now that all houses and buildings are fire proof regular firemen are no longer needed. Instead they are called apon when some one has broken the law and has posetion of a book. Then these people are called apon to burn them and punish the owners. A typical room in a house in this time setting would be walls lined with T.V.'s and at the fire stations they have robotic dogs that kill people. Guy Montag was a firemen who played by the rules and never questioned why he did what he di until one night he met a young girl named Clarisse and she told him about a world in the past where people uses to read books and firemen uses to put out fires instead of starting them. After hearing this Guy Montag stars rebelling and he starts questioning the theory behind his job and he starts taking some of the books.I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an exciting book that will push your mind to the limit.

It created a world where fireman started fires instead of putting them out. It was a time where houses were all made fireproof. It was a world where people didn't just sit and talk, and have educated conversations, there was actually very little exchange between people. Its quite on the contrary, it's a world where TV's lined whole walls, and if you pay extra they can even say your name! The fireman lived in firehouses, but had robotic dogs that were trained to attack and kill! The story is about a fireman, Guy Montage, who meets a young girl who tells him how life used to be, and about what can be found in books. Guy then steals books and reads them. In reading these books he has discovers the truth, he discovers the way life was and should be, he reads about philosophy and poetry, even the bible. His wife rats him out to the fireman and they come to burn down his house to destroy all the books kept inside. He then becomes a criminal running from everyone. His goal is to set up fireman across the world by planting books in their homes, therefore destroying all firemen and hopefully returning the world to the way it used to be like in the young girls stories.This was a very exciting book, and very colorful.

What happens when Guy gets away from all the noise and starts to THINK for himself?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a personification of the human spirit. In this story he is given a new insight by a young babbling teenage girl, Clarisse. With this sudden and mysterious revelation, Montag begins to see that the world around him is very synthetic, no can think about what they feel or feel what they are thinking - only the now exists and no concern for actions or consequences. Montag is centered and yet torn between two archetypes, Captain Beatty and Professor Faber. Beatty is an evil and heartless intellectual barbarian, a man possessing an illegal library in his home and claiming to not read a page of it. He is without a doubt a coward hiding behind brute force, whether it be by tongue or kerosene. Then there is Faber, a kind and fearful man who provides sanctuary for Montag. Bradbury puts you behind Montag's eyes and tells the story by letting you experience his life."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book pulled me in, and spoke to me. It's chilling how well Bradbury was able to make such an obvious stance, yet still write a beautiful, well rounded novel. This is a book that I hope everyone reads, it makes you a better person. It makes you want to do good in the world. I think Bradbury wants people to ignore things like television, and sit around with one another and talk, debate, discuss. Ironically, this is a book that forces the reader to do just that, perhaps Bradbury's greatest feat.Absolutely timeless novel, 5 stars."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an intelligent story filled with adventure and suspense. It takes you on a journey through the development of Guy Montag, a man who is fed up with a corrupt system. What I like most about this book is the writing style of the author. I find it incredible the way he can capture the way the characters are feeling. For example; \\"He saw himself in her eyes, suspended in two shining drops of bright water. Himself dark and tiny, in final detail, the lines about his mouth, everything there, as if her eyes were two miraculous bits of violet amber that might capture and hold him intact.\\" Page 7. It's almost as if Bradbury is writing poetry, but it is not to the extent that he is rambling on aimlessly.The theme of this book is rebellion. The story fallows Guy Montag through his path of change from being part of the system to a leader of a rebellion against it. Slowly but surely, Montag discovered more and more things that aid his transformation into an independent man. I fully agree with Montag's decision to rebel and I Truly look up to him for his bravery in doing what some thought to be impossible. His actions relate closely to my life because I as well, am not the kind of person who is willing to do what I am told to do unless I agree with it and find it worthwhile, so if someone tries to force me to do something against my beliefs, I will fight them to the fullest extent.I would defiantly recommend this book to anyone out there that is either; looking for a futuristic drama, into sci-fi, or simply just anyone looking for a good read. I recommend this book because at first, it did not look to appealing to me, but after about 45 pages into it I realized that the good characters, interesting story line, and a whole new way to look at the world and government. I know that if you give this book a chance, it will completely change the way you look at such things as limits by the government, literature, and relationships. Fahrenheit 451 is a well-rounded page-turner that pushes the limits of our minds and expands our knowledge of the cruelty of the world around us."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Everyone seems to think this book is about censorship. I don't really think this is the case. 451 is a book about what books should be about. Books should inspire us to think, to challenge ourselves. The best poetry should make us cry (so, too, should the worst but for other reasons.) Books should make us question our society and it's assumed intrinsic goodness.John Cheever said, in his Pulitzer acceptance speech, that books, maybe, could prevent nuclear war. Bradbury, too, makes this point in the speeches of the wandering academics Montag meets at the end of 451.If you're interested in reading a book with a purpose, with a meaning -- a book which strives to show us where we could go and the bad we could do -- read 451 and let yourself question the status quo."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not going to summarize the book. I'm not going to tell you how Guy Montag feels, how his wife feels, how those people on the screens that cover three walls feel. I'm just going to tell you how I feel. And the way I feel is this: awe. Mr. Bradbury wrote this book way back (well, way back for me) in the fifties, I believe, after a series of unsuccessful attempts. He wrote it half a century ago, yet the country depicted in it is strikingly like the US today.Let me put it this way, in a slightly more historical backround; we were talking about Confucius and the Legalists today in Social Studies, or History, whichever you prefer. The Legalists were like the US in this book. They suppressed opinions that did not agree with their own, they used military force, they even burned books. Only agriculture and medicinal books were allowed to be printed. The way the Legalists ruled ancient China during those fifteen years is like the way the government runs the US. Actually, I started a great discussion with the only other kid who read this, comparing that future world to this ancient one.But the scariest thing is that it's not really THAT far in the future. They've won two nuclear wars since 2070. The year 2070 is going to be in my lifetime unless I die very early. Freaky. Very, very scary to think of.The last thing I want to say in this oversized-review is that I absolutely NEVER give five stars. A book has to be really great to get the great \\"twelve-year-old stamp of approval\\", as my mommy calls it. I'd recommend it to anyone within the vicinity of my voice...in fact I think I have. (Before homeroom I tend to be a little tired, I mean it is as 7:40 in the morning, and I get \\"roudy\\". This means I tell the whole hall in general which books are good, which are bad, and it actually works. Because of my interesting antics I've gotten three fans of this book, and countless others of books for youngerpeople.)Ray Bradbury, if you are seeing this review, which you may in fact be, I've really got no idea whose looking at this, you have a Fonz' (ever seen Happy Days? I watch reruns on TV Land) quality thumbs up.\\"Hey!\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Since I don't want to give away all the details of the book I will try to be as descriptive as possible. The book open with humans, as a whole, not remembering the way life used to be. In a time when there were books, schools, and maybe most important of all, the freedom of speech. You first meet the main character Guy Montag after one of his work shifts. He is a fireman, but not the type of fireman that we would think of today. In this case, he is a fireman who starts fires. In the world in which he lives, owning books is a highly punishable offense. In this case, firemen arrive at reported libraries with tankers full of kerosene and light the books and the homes of the book owners on fire. This usually takes place at night to make a good show for those who enjoy to watch. The same people who owned the books will also be arrested. However, most of these so called &quot;radicals&quot; who own the books decide to be burned along with them. In any case, Guy enjoys his work and never seems to give the mass destruction too much thought. That all changes, however, when he meets a girl named Clarisse. She talks with him about the way the world used to be and it starts making him wonder about things. Eventually he begins sneaking books out of the fires. Of course this type of behavior is going to get noticed and he has to go on the run and ends up turning on his society and his role in it. He later finds a home in a wasteland outside of the city with other educated people who take him in and watch as the city is blown to bits in a techno-war that lasts only three minutes. In my view this was a pretty good book. It was entertaining and a short read. Some of the themes like drive by terrorism, the large amount of entertainment, and the fast vehicles make a point that not all technological progress is useful. On top of it all the story basically ends on a good note because all of the controlling ways of life are destroyed and the educated can now build a free world that once existed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you like books that you don't need a dictionary by your side, or it doesn't take three months to read then, fahrenheit 451 is a book for you.Guy Montag is a fireman who burns books in a futuristic American city. In this society fireman start fires instead of putting them out. The people in this society don't even read books they are consumed by tv and radio. There's one problem though Guy likes books.Throughout the story Guy's life is a plagued by disturbing events like his wife's attempted suicide, a crazy lady that would rather be burned alive than have her books burned, and to top it all off his friend Clarisse is hit by a speeding car and killed. This was devastating to Guy because she opened his eyes to the emptiness of his life. This is when Guy questioned the duties of his job.Other exciting events in the story are when Guy doesn't show up for work one day and his boss Beatty pays him a visit. Upon his arrival Beatty discovers that Guy has been hoarding books from the fires to read. Beatty tells him that he can keep the books for one night and after that he has to turn them in for burning. Guy begins one long night of reading. Overwhelmed by this task he turns to his wife for help, but she's more interested in tv. He pays a man Dr.Faber a visit, Faber agrees to help him.The next day Montag goes to the fire station and hands over one of his books to Beatty for incineration. Then the alarm sounds and they rush off for another book burning. When Montag gets there he realizes it's his own house. His wife betrayed him. Beatty forces him to burn down the house himself.Once he is done he turns the flamethrower on Beatty and kills him, then he manages to escape the other firemen and the big mechanical dogs.If you want to know what happens next you'll just have to read the book because a review shouldn't give away the ending. So if any of this sounded interesting I suggest you pick up a copy of fahrenheit 451 and read it, you won't be dissapointed.After reading this brief introduction to this book you would understand why I gave it a near perfect score, it's action packed with adventure, and it's easy to understand. What more could you ask for?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book could have easily been summed up in 30 pages! Not that I don't love attention to detail in stories, because I do, but F. 451 just dragged. It was a great concept and good plot but there was certain scenes where Bradbury overevaluated and overexplained everything! I'm never touching this book again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's 1953 novel Fahrenheit 451 is a science fiction classic that, somehow, I'd never read. With Bradbury's recent death, I decided it was time to remedy that. Unfortunately, I was severely underwhelmed by Fahrenheit 451, and found it lacking in many ways.Fahrenheit 451 is a dystopian novel that, despite prominently featuring book-burning, posits dystopia-by-entertainment, like Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, as opposed to dystopia-by-oppression, like George Orwell's 1984 or Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. The evil of the Fahrenheit 451 is not censorship, but television, which has made people so dumb and uninterested in the world that (almost) no one even cares that firemen now burn books, instead of putting out blazes.The main character is Guy Montag, one of these firemen, who, after a few chance conversations with a young girl next door, realizes he's doing bad things and that the world is a mess. This pushes him to start to consider reading the books he's supposed to be burning, and the novel moves on from there.Montag, and the other characters in the book, all seem flat. Part of this is that there's no real dialogue or conversations in the book. With the exception of Guy's horrid wife and her friends who basically say \\"Shut up, my shows are on!\\" all book, every time a character opens their mouth, it seems they launch into a diatribe - the protagonist and his allies for books, and the antagonists against them. There's no real debate of ideas, and the characters all seem like mouthpieces for Bradbury, either for his anti-technology position or straw men for the anti-book position.The idea of a dystopia brought on by entertaining the citizens into apathy is a perfectly good one, and Huxley did a fine job with it in Brave New World. However, I just couldn't buy Bradbury's take. As far as he's concerned, technology can only be used to placate the masses through their wall-sized TV's or proto-Walkmen. In Fahrenheit 451, the means of content creation still rest, as they did in the '50's, in the hands of the few. This fails to account for the way technology really played out. Sure, we all have huge HDTV's and smartphones with Bluetooth headphones, but we also use all this fantastic technology to connect with people around the world in ways never before possible, and we seek out alternate sources of information that could never have reached nearly as as many people. Sure, plenty of people just let TV rot their brains, but I'm not convinced that's any different today than the '50's, and the technology now has so many other fantastic and worthwhile uses Bradbury ignores or can't predict. Bradbury also ignores that a large percentage of books aren't any better than TV. Just because it's printed on a dead tree doesn't make it Plato or Dickens.Let me also say something about the end of the novel and the war background thread. All through the novel there's imminent threat of war, though - perhaps this is to reflect the characters' lack of concern - what the war is about, who it's with, or how it will be fought is never really addressed, until the end of the book. All of a sudden, it pops up in a major way, and then a page or two later the book's over. It's like Bradbury ran out of story and decided \\"Eh, I'll just toss in a mention or two of war earlier in the book, then let that take care of everything at the end.\\" Maybe this is related to the fact that Fahrenheit 451 started as a short story, was expanded to a novella, then expanded again to a novel. Maybe there just wasn't enough story to flesh the ideas out to that long a format. In any case, the war thread is a horrible deus ex machina (see 1984 for how to weave war into a dystopian story effectively), and the ending is almost a non-ending. I don't mind a grim or ambiguous ending, but Fahrenheit 451 can't even deliver in that way.The writing style also gave me problems. Bradbury goes on for paragraphs describing scenery in repetitive flowery language, then in a plain sentence or two you hardly notice, he slips in a major event with little emphasis. It's just uneven, tedious, and makes things hard to follow.I love golden age science fiction from Isaac Asimov and Robert Heinlein, so it's not that I don't enjoy the genre or the era. Yeah, 1950's science fiction has its issues these days, but I don't mind those too much, as writers like Asimov an Heinlein penned entertaining stories with lasting messages. I know Bradbury is looked at in a similar way, but from Fahrenheit 451, I just can't put him in the same class as Asimov or Heinlein.I listened to Harper Audio's 2001 production of Fahrenheit 451, ready by Ray Bradbury. I thought it would be interesting to hear the book as envisioned by the author. I was wrong. Bradbury was not an effective narrator. He has a single tone in which he reads. It can be hard to tell if he's narrating description or reading dialogue, or if he's reading dialogue, which character is speaking. Conversations (such as they are, see above) are horrible to try to follow. I just can't recommend anyone, even a hardcore Bradbury fan, listen to this production. There are other versions out there read by professional audio book readers. Get one of them. It has to be better. One other problem with the production are the track times. These are rarely worth mentioning for audio books, but in this case, they are. The tracks range from 1:37 to 28:37 in length, and for no apparent reason. Tracks aren't tied to chapters or anything else I could discern. They just vary wildly in how long they are, which makes it very hard to keep track of where in the book you are. There's no reason for this. The production includes a 2001 interview with Bradbury after the book itself. The entire production runs approximately 6 hours, and about an hour of that is the interview.I can't recommend Fahrenheit 451. Yes, it has an interesting premise, but Bradbury just isn't up to turning it into a compelling story. If you're looking for a good dystopian novel, you'd do better to read 1984, The Handmaid's Tale, or Brave New World. And if you still want to read Fahrenheit 451, do not under any circumstances listen to Bradbury's narration of it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is not Bradbury's best work. His forte is the science fiction short story. His novel is ponderous and slow moving--and will turn off more young people from sci-fi than it will attract. One wonders why so many high schools use it as a required reading in sci-fi when there is so much out there which is truly exciting and attractive to young people while being equal to or better than this particular piece in a literary sense. David Weber, Jack Campbell, Robert Jordan and a host of others come quickly to mind. Even Asimov, dated though he is, would be preferable as an introduction for young adults to sci-fi reading which offers rich literary content."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was surprised at how good of condition the book was in when i got it....I wouldnt mind ordering a few more from this vendor!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Honestly? It's not that great. I'm giving it four stars because it must have had some incredible super-meta-meaning back in the 1950's. I hate to dock it points due to poor translation to modern times.I read Farenheit 451 as a student, back in the 1970's. Afte all these years, I didn't remember the book too well, but I did remember thinking it was incredibly deep and insightful. I picked it up a few weeks ago, looking to re-engage with a classic. I found it interesting, but tedious. The book is both intriguingly written and poorly written. It is a somewhat impressionistic book, with awkward sentences that work much better after a few glasses of wine or other substance of choice. To the 1970s eye (including mine, at the time) the writing style seemed imaginative and inspired; to the 2011 eye, it seems tiring and perhaps self-indulgent.There's no doubt that Bradbury was a visionary who saw a lot of things coming before they actually came. That said, he nearly missed the point of it all. He saw a future of coerced conformity (in which people would be compelled to give up their books). The more advanced insight might've been that in a bleak future, people would happily give up their freedoms. They wouldn't need firemen to burn books, because they'd voluntarily participate in their own enslavement. The incentive would be, simply, comfort. There are other writers, both fiction and non-fiction, who came a lot closer to this realization. They'd just need an IV filled with state benefits and handouts, in return for which they'd acquiesce in their own serfdom.It deserves the four stars, simply for being a famous classic. Nevertheless, I was left wondering whether the distopia that Bradbury described fit the threats of the 20th century but not that of the 21st."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's a disturbingly prophetic reading and radical idea for its day and age. But the concept is old hat in this day where it's a regular affair. It's simply no longer the system shock it once was. I personally find the characterization a bit thin, but that was arguably the point in this sterile society. It's a classic for a good reason, but I don't know if I find the read entertaining these days."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was in great shape for a used book.

It brings you into the warped mind of a fireman, who burns books rather than puts fires out. This book proves to be very novel and is interesting at times, but at other points it just seems boring and outright ridiculous. When I read this novel it made me think of what the present day government might do behind our backs to censor certain materials, but the novel can be so confusing that it is hard to find the relationship. Despite these setbacks, it shows how a few wrong moves and decisions by humans today can end up in grave results in the future.In this story, the main character Montag begins to run into people that alter his mind and make him think about the ethics of his job, which of course is burning books. Montag used to live his life smelling of kerosene, ravaging people's houses, and setting books aflame, but he wants to know why he is doing these deeds in the first place. It is sort of difficult to see how books could be so horrible that they should be banned and burned. You learn later in the story, if you can read inbetween the lines of difficult language, that the government has put a ban on all books to prevent them from corrupting the minds of the people living at the time. Montag learns this and begins to live two lives; one as a fireman, and the other as a madman hiding books in the vents of his house. While this is happening a war is going on that is so hard to understand and so irrelevant that it should just be ignored. The book continues to become more confusing, and the end is just unimaginable and pointless.If you love books that are outdated and totally science fiction, then this is the novel for you. It is a great piece of work that was new and exciting when it was written, but to most people today it would just seem odd and nauseating at times. It is totally unbelievable, and it was difficult for me to sit down and read this story because it was so complex and involved. It takes a person with an extremely vivid imagination to read this novel. It was meant to show how people can not let the government get out of control because they will eventually corrupt and control the minds of every last person on the planet, but this point is lost somewhere amongst the many plots and twists. It tends to be very odd take on the subject, and I would not really recommend using your time to check it out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Basically, Fahrenheit 451 is a let down. The drop off ending cuts off the futuristic plot's potential. There is much colorful vocabulary, but some metaphors are so elaborate and sudden that one hardly knows whether something is actually happening or if it's just a figment of the character's imagination. It is more confusing that challenging to read. The main character, Montag, has a fairly interesting conflict. The only problem is that it is not resolved enough by the end of the book to leave the reader satisfied! Plus, the only moral or meaning from the book is given away early on, leaving nothing to motivate the reader. I recommend this book to nobody, because they will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Personally, I found the background idea of this book very smart and &quot;appetizing&quot;:a world where books were forbidden and the fire-eaters were actually fire-blowers fighting in the name of mind-globalization against the dangers of reading and building your own way to think and to face life. Unfortunately I reckon that the style is weak, words are just thrown without explanesions in the pages, sentences are chopped in a way that often made me feel totally extraneous to the plot. A heavy atmosphere floats in this book and I had to fight hard to keep on reading. In simple words, I'd mark it 4 out of 5 for the subjects but only 2 out of 5 for the style."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If you look at Farenheit 451 from the perspective of when it was written, you can be amazed at Bradbury's prophecy. I tried to keep that thought in mind when reading the book but I wasn't able to put myself into any type of Cold War paranoia mind frame and as a result, I kept coming back to my 2011 mindset and thinking, hey, we have bigger fish to fry, or bigger books to burn, nowadays.Anyway, that's just me.The idea of censorship and government control and general public apathy was interesting, and the idea of society possibly heading there, or already there if you want to think about the obsession with television, is frightening, but when I finished the book I'm sitting there thinking, That's it? That's all? So we suffer through all of this to find out that there's a group of people in the country who have memorized books? That's great, books and ideas and free thought live!, but then what in the world was the whole sense of Montag's story leading up to that great revelation?I thought Montag was a little wimpy and the whole chase at the end wasn't exciting. I found the writing a little difficult to read at times, very choppy and dull.

I'm sure there were many times in the past, history could have taken a wrong turn & many many books could have been lost. I am certainly glad that didn't really happen. I had an experience once in which I checked out a book titled \\"Paganism\\". I was just curious. All throught the book someone had written in pen that whoever reads the book is working w/the devil. I thought, \\"isn't that special\\". someone ruined a perfectly good book because of their religious beliefs. I showed the book to the librarian and she said she would use white out to fix it or order another book on Paganism."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I love a good dystopian novel, so I bought this book with great enthusiasm. Was I disappointed? Kinda. The novel didn't really feel organic, and I felt that there wasn't a very strong sense of urgency. It was a fun enough read, but I simply didn't feel it was on par with some other dystopian novels (Brave New World and 1984 for example)Everyone praises this book for its anti censorship message, but when you learn the history, Ray Bradbury was only doing two things when he wrote this 1)Telling the negative effects he thought television would have on our future (source: [...]/) and 2)Make money (Not criticizing him for that goal).Bottom Line: I didn't love it, but you might."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I finally got around to this classic young adult novel. I figured since I'm in the young adult literature class for my MLIS, I might as well catch up. I never read the book because I was dryly bored by all of Ray Bradbury's work. I just can't seem to feel any passion for science fiction.Not that Fahrenheit 451 is scifi. There is a strong presence of metaphor in this book; too heavy a presence for my reading delight, though the idea is cute. Firemen ignites fires to destroy knowledge aka power. 1984 with an arson's twist. But the conclusion was so obvious from the start that I thought, why read what's in between?Written during an era of Cold War fear, I can see the appeal of his plot. But I wish Bradbury had either revved up the scifi and gave me an all out apocalypse or gave up on the robotic dogs and let the political hounds do more communist hunting."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The author starts out with a very interesting approach to the problem of censorship, but eventually falls flat. What would have made for a nice magazine sized story, doesn't have the ability to fill out a novel. The book is is mercifully short, but the story is at times dull and pointless and full of dull and pointless characters. The only character of interest is killed off after a couple pages. Its not an entirely fair comparison, but 1984 and Brave New World were orders of magnitude better than 451. The ending is completely unsatisfying and the author's vision of the future, both hopes and fears, do not ring true.

He is a fireman who liked his job and never asked questions about the things that he did until he met seventeen-year-old Clarisse McClellan who was not afraid to ask questions. She along with a professor he meets helps him open his eyes to the truth. He knows now that he must turn against the very people he works for.I liked this book because it is very realistic of somthing that could happen in the near future.

There is not much more told about how this society evolved.It seems pretty far-fetched, but you can also see some similarities to today... fast, loud, shallow \\"reality\\" TV; hints that the rest of the world despises an arrogant, prosperous U.S.A; and Americans that are too distracted to pay much attention to a war they know little about...Another odd thing is that nobody is WRITING. The firemen are still tracking down stashes of old books, but there is no mention of anyone being caught writing anything new. With all the talk of how important books are, you would think some rebellious soul would want to create something new. On the other hand, characters who also happen to be writers can be such a clich&eacute;. Bradbury managed to write a book about books, and not include a single writer among the characters."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have Always preferred to hear an author read their own works because only they really know what was intended--until now. Mr. Bradbury has one tone and one tone only and that is carried out with a mush-mouth. It's just horrendous and painful to listen to. Go find another copy--trust me (I would quit but I'm trying to finish it for a book club). Mercifully @ 5 CDs it's pretty short.Amendment: So after finishing, I must say that the last CD is just an interview with the author and it's really very interesting. If you'd like to hear him talk about his life, the books genesis, etc., skip to the last CD. I did enjoy that and it's almost like a different person speaking. He's so much more gregarious when just talking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is a book I've been meaning to read, was on my list, but was only spurred on to pick up by Bradbury's death. I read The Martian Chronicles and Dandelion Wine ages and ages ago so it was with pleasure that I returned to rediscover Bradbury's brilliance.Guy Montag was a fireman whose job it was to start fires. And he enjoyed his job. He had been a fireman for ten years, and he had never questioned the pleasure of the midnight runs or the joy of watching pages consumed by flames, never questioned anything until he met a seventeen-year-old girl who told him of a past when people were not afraid. Then Guy met a professor who told him of a future in which people could think. And Guy Montag suddenly realized what he had to do...I did know going in that Fahrenheit 451 was set in a dystopian society in which firemen burned books. All books. To ashes. Which made it hard for me to breathe. That feeling persisted throughout the entirety of Fahrenheit 451. Thank goodness it was a quick read. To be honest I skimmed over some passages, much like I would a gory, overly graphic horror scene.\\"It was a pleasure to burn.\\"From this iconic first line on, Fahrenheit 451 moved at a fast, intense clip. It's refreshing to be reminded of how a great story doesn't need to be stretched out into two-three book series like so many books I come across nowadays. Bradbury's writing is economical and compact; despite the radical vision he's presenting, Fahrenheit 451 doesn't indulge in tedious info-dumping or an unnecessary scenes. Though the plot is full of shocking action, it also has many scenes that illustrate Montag's internal struggles.Reading Fahrenheit 451 was very disturbing. Not so much because of the horror of book burning, but because the alternate history that Bradbury painted stemming from censorship is possible, even in this day and age. The unquestioning, drugged-like state of the general population is frightening because it can happen and does happen to some degree today. Everyone is numbed by artificial, dumbed down entertainment. Instead of TVs, there are entire TV walls surrounding people. Seashell earbuds fill their heads with ceaseless, lulling noise. No one has face-to-face conversations anymore. People accidentally on purpose overdose on sleeping pills - yet they don't even know how unhappy they are. Everyone goes around in a haze of oblivion, so much so that no one knows there's even a war going on.The symbolic figure of this dead and deadened world is Guy Montag, a fireman who sets fire to books. In the beginning of Fahrenheit 451, he revels in the power and spectacle of burning these hated things. But in the course of meeting a girl and an old man, both of whom infect him with the idea that the world was once different, Guy suddenly finds himself having a massive crisis of the heart, mind, and soul. From then on, life as he knows it explodes.One thing that bothered me about Fahrenheit 451 was the kind of books that \\"rebels\\" held as worth saving at all costs, even their lives. First of all, no books by female authors. Secondly, the Bible plays a big role. Which is ironic to me since most censors and book banners cling to the Bible as their reason for banning books in the first place.\\"'Do you know why books such as this are so important? Because they have quality. And what does the word quality mean? To me it means texture. This book has pores. It has features. This book can go under the microscope. You'd find life under the glass, streaming past in infinite profusion. The more pores, the more truthfully recorded details of life per square inch you can get on a sheet of paper, the more \\"literary\\" you are. That's my definition, anyway. Telling detail. Fresh detail. The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies.'\\""},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Firemen setting fires because books represent ideas which don't contribute to peace and harmony. Or because they conflict with what the powers that be require you to believe. That was the way Bradbury envisioned the future in Fahrenheit 451. Orwells' 1984 is of the same genre as is Huxley's Brave New World and Leven's This Perfect Day. An excellent read by one of Sci Fi's best and not far from the reality some people have lived and still do today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradubury is definately the book to read. This novel takes place in a world that is vividly described by Bradbury. I rate Fahrenheit 451 five stars because of the adventure and curiosity. With events happening at every page, Bradbury keeps the readers on their toes! With the main character being Guy Montag, a fireman, whose job wasn't to stop fires, but to start them. He liked his job until he met a seventeen year old girl that tells him about the past, and a retired English professor telling him about the future. In this wondrous world where books were depressing and illegal, Montag finally knew what he was supposed to do a long time ago. This novel has events running by, rapidly, happening one after another, this novel is full of fun and excitement! This book always makes you want to read more, from the time you pick up the book and until you put it back down, you will never want to put it back down. Ray Bradbury leaves readers with suspense and tension at the end of each time you pick up the book, this is definitely, without a doubt, the best book to read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Like all great books that cause a stir, either because of their &quot;ideas&quot; or the fact that they're so shocking (think Rand's &quot;Atlas Shrugged,&quot; McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood,&quot; or &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;) &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; took its place long ago among the classics. But the scary thing about this book is, despite the fact that we were warned of this type of thing, situations like the one in 451 are still happening! This book is even more relevant today than it was years ago when it appeared as &quot;fiction.&quot; How sad that we haven't learned our lessons. F 451 is beyond the definition of a classic and beyond food for thought. It's a wake-up call that should not be ignored."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is the temperature at which book paper catches fire, and starts to burn... Why on earth would you want to know that? . Because that is extremely important in this book, due to the fact that its main character, Guy Montag, is a fireman. However, he is not a fireman in the way we now understand that word: a man that tries to stop fires. Here, firemen burn books.Bradbury tells us about a place where books are forbidden: nobody can read them, or have them, without committing a crime. The authorities consider that they are dangerous, and because of that they make firemen burn them, and the houses where they were.Everything changes for Montag due to two things. To begin with, he gets to know Clarisse, a young girl that makes him see life from another perspective. Secondly, one day the unexpected happens: he cannot help but read a line of a book he was burning. Of course, Montag gets curious, and as a result, he steals some books, and decides to read them.That causes him many problems, as he begins to put into question things he took for guaranteed before. With the help of Faber, and old former professor who still remembers how things were before books were forbidden, Montag starts to think about a way to change things... Will he be able to do that?. I don?t want to give away more about the book, so read it and you will know :)It is worthwhile to point out that &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; is a beautiful story, so wonderfully written that it is very easy to read. Notwithstanding that, I believe that the more important aspect of this book is that it is a good way to remember why we like books so much, and what a privilege it is to be able to have them.Thanks to Bradbury?s imaginary dystopia we realize once again that something that Heinrich Heine said is true: &quot;It is there, where they burn books, that eventually they burn people too&quot; (&quot;Dort, wo man Bucher Verbrennt, verbrennt man auch am, Ende Menschen&quot;). I think that the book?s message regarding the dangers of censorship and the importance of reading should remain with us...On the whole, I highly recommend &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; to you. Enjoy it :)Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I like books that teach me things. Fahrenheit 451 is similar to other books like 1984 and Brave New World, where humanity is just a shell of what it used to be. However, 451 presents a problem much more slippery and troubling than 1984 in my mind. How do you help someone who doesn't want to be helped?Bradbury's prose takes a little getting used to, but his message needs to be understood. It's a message that grows more important everyday, with classics being exchanged for cliff notes and books being banned because they offend someone (huck finn, uncle tom's cabin, catcher in the rye). This is the first step to Bradbury's nightmare, culminating in the thought 'Everyone must be equal - not like the Constitution states - but *made* equal'.Editorializing a bit here, 451 represents to me the ultimate victory of things like MTV, reality television and political correctness. Humanity is reduced to one plastic mold - through laziness or censorship - and everyone is loving it. These characters don't realize how empty their lives are; instead of working out problems everyone retreats into their own world. Instead of attempting to answer humanity's most profound question, the world of 451 pretends they don't exist.One last thing: Clarisse is a trip - her character really catches a living quality I don't see often in books. With Fahrenheit 451, I learned a lot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 is one of the most important and influential books of all time. In 1950, when it was written he didn't know he was going to predict today's society. Guy Montag, the protagonist, loved his work. There seemed to be nothing that he liked better than to spray kerosene on a pile of books and watch the pages curl and turn into ash. Until, one day he meets Clarisse, a 17-year-old girl who has been educated about the world. At one point in one of their conversation she asks if he is happy. Montag realizes that people should have the right to read books. He finds that books mean a lot to people when a woman chooses to burn herself with her books. Guy comes up with a plan to get revenge on other firemen in an effort to stop book banning.Montag's boss, Beatty tries to reason with Montag about the banishment of books saying \\"Give the people contests they win by remembering the words to more popular songs. Don't give them slippery stuff like philosophy or sociology to tie things up with. That way lies melancholy (61).\\" The people of Montag's society live under such a principle, even though at some times they may not know it.The turning point in the novel is when his wife, Mildred discovers what he is doing. She becomes scared. Eventually, she turns him in, and he is forced to burn his collection of books. This is the climax of the book because the reader is unsure what lies ahead. The adrenaline of the reader is at its highest, and ones mind is trying to think of all the possible outcomes.The censorship that is in Bradbury's novel comes from an inferior dictatorship. It is a culture that does not want its citizens to be lured into the meanings of books. Today, our culture is bombarded with advertisements. Everyday it seems as though we have less time to ourselves. Today we are not burning books and bookstores are popular, but we still seem to ban books for one reason or another. Fifty years later the book still remains relevant to our society.Fahrenheit 451 is a brilliant novel. In my opinion, it is as meaningful perhaps even more so than it was when it was written in 1950. The novel shows what censorship can do to a society, and the importance of free speech. People must learn to accept different views, whether they agree totally or not. We must always be open to new opportunities that arise and never except the norm. Everyone should read Fahrenheit 451, take what they learn from it and apply it to their everyday lives. Overall, I think that the novel has a good message and I am glad that I spent my time reading it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read Fahrenheit 451 years ago in highschool, and just reread it last month. It was the feature book in our town's One Book, One City program. What I found was that F451 doesn't lose it's impact all these years later. The ideas of censorship, of book burning, of reading in general come sharply into focus as the reader experiences Montag's journey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've read this book a couple of times and the truths of this book never cease to amaze me. Very similar to Orwell's 1984, this is the visionary look of what happens when government has too much power to control our lives and censure our media. In this story, books are the source of evil because they encourage free thinking and contain ideas that discourage the ideals of this government's philosophies. To control what people think, books are banned and burned by firemen. Firemen, as far as people believe (because books don't exist that disprove this), have always been around, burning books to protect the public from the evils they portray. This is the story of Guy Montag, who is a fireman.Guy Montag lives the life of any dedicated fireman. He does his job, pretends to be happy, and spends much of his income on TV walls so his wife can have more people in her \\"family\\" in which to converse with (and be controlled by).His life changes when he meets his seventeen year-old, free-thinking neighbor, Clarisse. Guy's eyes are open to a new world as he finds a new love for thinking for himself and discovering the wonders of books.This book has really appealed to me of late because of my own new-found love in books. If you don't appreciate having libraries in every town and an endless supply of books in which to enrich your imagination then you need to read this book so you can imagine what life would be like if books were banned along with your ability to think for yourself. Consider this a MUST READ."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A time honored classic, once a scary prophetic vision, and quite possibly, now a reality. Ray Bradbury's futuristic thriller, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; reads as both analogy and warning, and a dire one at that.This book has been on my &quot;let's read it in the near future&quot; list for some time. But it wasn't until the city of Portland, Oregon selected this book for their &quot;Everyone Reads&quot; campaign that I found the incentive to read it.This story spins a tale in the near future where reading is considered outlaw, that books are contraband, and any attempt of thinking outside the box is handled by extinguishing the threat. Guy Montag is a fireman, but not in the common sense; he starts fires instead of putting them out. He's &quot;married&quot; to Mildred, in a passionless marriage of convenience; Mildred who prefers to spend time in front of the television and listening to the radio in her life of hopelessness. Early on, he meets the fair Clarisse who boldly suggests to him that life is much more than starting fires. It is the tipping point of his decline, as his life begins to rush closer and closer to the incinerator itself.What impressed me about this book is that it was written in the early 1950's, and yet it reads as well as a modern novel. Bradbury would refute any attempts of suggesting he was forecasting the future, but so much of what he saw the future becoming has transpired. How many hours do our children spend in front of the television? And in these times, when our libraries are being threatened to track patron's records or monitor internet use, how far away are we from Bradbury's 451?It's both chilling and reflecting. As a dour warning for what might happen, we can take heed to this warning to ensure that we celebrate divergent thought and reading as a gift for our citizens and not something to fear. Whereas people would refute the claim that we would never burn books in America, why is it that this book so often has actually been banned from some libraries and schools across this country?We need to listen, and learn, lest we suffer the fate of Montag and start to live in a country and world so brilliantly premonitioned in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"'Fahrenheit 451' is a powerful story that imagines a future world where literature is burned and readers are imprisoned. Bradbury creates a whole dumbed-down society of people who are robbed of creative and independent thought, and where this deficit is enforced by law.I felt that the major shortcoming of the book was that the entire book smacks of '1984,' but it is not nearly as powerful as Orwell's story. 'Fahrenheit 451' focuses much more intently on the relatively narrower issue of censorship in our society, whereas '1984' looks at the complete robbery of free will. I thought all of the characters were a rip-off, from the young girl to the protagonist to the mean authority figure who tries to &quot;help&quot; the protagonist and turns on him in the end.This is a good book, and I like the metaphor, I just felt like the same idea was espoused in a much more gripping fashion in '1984.'"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't give very many things five stars.Bradbury's novel is simple, powerful, beautiful, and truly marvelous.A negative utopia along the lines of Brave New World or 1984, I like this book more than either of those because it is ultimately, utterly hopeful. Bradbury is in love with a messed up world and his message comes across with an urgency and honesty that is both startling and impressive.You know the plot -- they burn books because they're scared of ideas. Montag wonders about the ideas and becomes an outcast in a sterile society. This book makes me want to change the world. And so I want you to read it. And then maybe memorize it.A quick read, and a fairly easy read. Engrossing enough that you won't want to put it down, and once you finish it, you might be tempted to just start over and read it again. I recommend doing just that."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was very interesting.I read it in 11th grade English. We had many disscusions and look deep in to the concepts of the book. It had our class debating on topics that were'nt even mentioned in the book, but brought the ideas to our minds.This book makes me wonder about what our future will look like with all the advanced technology thats coming about. Will we soon become the victims of a world like this book describes.....? The people in this book become almost like a slave to technology instead of technology becoming a slave to them.Is that happening to us now, always wanting fast entertainment, not applying our Knowledge to problems or circumstances in our lives,or maybe not even taking the time out to sit down and read something. Makes you think and thats what Brandbury does throughout this book. So if you like to take the time out to read a book,think about what you've read and apply that knowledge to intances throughout your life then you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was standing in my local bookstore, which as usual didn't have what I was looking for, browsing the School Reading List shelves for a book I could get extra credit in English I for. I scanned over this book several times before I remembered a friend telling me that it was one of her favorite books. I also remembered a friend telling me not to waste my time. I decided to buy it to see what my opinion was. I was pretty sure I wouldn't like it because I am normally a fantasy reader and don't usually go for this kind of book. But when I got home with it I picked it up and it stayed permanently attached to my hand until I finished it. I was finished in two days (about two hours total reading time). I won't say I recommend this book for everybody. If you don't like to think, if you prefer to view everything as having a distinct happy ending, if you hate symbolism, if you are an extreme pacifist, or if you only read books that have absolutely no profanity in them, this is DEFINITELY not the book for you. Anyone else should read this book at least once. And I mean the whole book. Don't give up on the first ten pages. Oh, and just so you know, I am not some highly educated professor typing this from a computer in her office. I am an ordinary high school freshman."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read Fahrenheit 451 for class in eighth grade, and from the beginning, I knew this book would turn out be quite eloquent and philsosphical, but also extremely tedious. I almost fell asleep in some occasions. Bradbury does a good job describing sections in the story, but sometimes gets carried away and forgets about some mood. For example, when the city is bombed, there should be some line of chaos and the people inhabiting the city running for their lives. In conclusion, I struggled through the book and only read it out of coercion. I would never read this again."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At one point Firefighters put fires out, now they start fires. Books are illegal, when found with books in your house, your house is burnt down. The protaganist, Montag is a firefighter who never questioned his job until he met Clarisse. Clarisse makes him think about why books are so wrong. Montag decided to rebel from his job and read books. This is all fine until his plan backfires. His house is burnt down, he loses his friends and his wife leaves him. Now Montag is running from the law...One character that stands out in my mind is Clarisse. Clarisse is a seventeen year old who enjoy reading. She meets Montag and tells him that at one point books were legal. She explains to him why she reads and tries to convince Montag to read. She changes Montag's opinion on books.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in futuristic books. This book may get a little confusing at points but it makes you think.

But this is yet another book that came highly recommended, both by other 'day-to-day' readers and critics alike, that i just could not enjoy.Bradbury's tale of a world where books is banned has a powerful and interesting premise. But it does not seem to follow through for me. Which is a shame - here is a book that is about the importance of books in our lives, but it is so boring that rather than 'get something' out of it, you just come away thinking how boring it is.Or at least i did."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I've just finished reading this book and although the premise behind it is intriguing, the books feels unfinished and rushed...Also, Bradbury's elegant and descriptive style of writing feels like a shroud that covers the rather poor character development and lack of interesting characters. This book also needs a large section (that should basically precede the book as it stands now) dedicated towards describing the overall setting and government climate in order to set the proper mood.....Therefore I cannot recommend this title."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Now, don't get me wrong: I thought 'Fahrenheit 451' was a pretty good book, but I was very unimpressed by the number of mistakes found in the 165 pages. The name Montag was spelled wrong on several occasions, there are words oftentimes missing from dialogue--or the wrong ones all together--and quotes either missing or in the wrong places, making it oftentimes confusing to read. Editing was either skipped altogether or done by a blind man...one of the two.Overall, though, 'Fahrenheit 451' is an average book. I did not feel connected with any of the characters, and could've cared less what happened to Montag. Clarisse disappeared too early without much reason as to why--I assumed her being hit by a car was false, but apparently not--and the future looks bland to me. Luckily, though, I won't be around to see it.(Also, the &quot;war&quot; seemed tacked on without any real reason as to its existence in the story, save for maybe wiping out the human race so we could start over.)Not a great book.

Unless you are interested in science fiction or Ray Bradbury's work you probably wont like it. This book takes place in the future in a world where all books are banned.

For me, one such treasure is Fahrenheit 451. This is the novel that first awakened me to the possibility that science fiction could be about more than just action heroes, quick thrills and mindless drivel: that at its best, it honours a unique literary duty, allowing us to glimpse horrific futures that may actually come to pass if we leave the path of wisdom.Fahrenheit 451 is one of the finest examples of that sub genre of science fiction called dystopian fiction. Every science fiction writer of note has drawn from this well, but few as successfully as Bradbury. The only other authors to realise equal successes are Orwell with 1984 and Huxley with Brave New World. Some would add Gibson and Dick, but theirs are derivative works of a later generation. Of all such works, Bradbury&#65533;s is the most accessible. At his centre, Bradbury is an optimist while the others are not. Consequently, Fahrenheit 451 holds out the light of hope when the others leave us despairing.This book operates on countless levels. It can be read as a futuristic fable, a psychological drama, or a social commentary. It is a rich character study; a pounding plot-driven quest; an overwhelming thematic work, or a setting of sterile horror. In actuality, it is all of this and more. Rarely does one happen upon a work in which the parts fit together so exquisitely, and for this reason alone, it deserves its reputation as one of the greatest works in the genre.But it is the characters that make this book come alive. When the protagonist experiences the emptiness of a hollow life, the anguish of guilt, the glimmerings of a real love, the terror of blind panic or the despair of pursuit, it is as if these things are happening to us. Bradbury&#65533;s skill transforms science fiction into literature.This is not a book for juvenile minds. While it is written in tight, almost Spartan prose, and reads like a children&#65533;s novel, it is actually a highly philosophical work. In some ways palpable, but in more ways subtle, it focuses an unflinching light on those ugly aspects of our nature that impel us towards superficiality and mental sloth. It is no wonder that shallow readers and idle thinkers find this book unrewarding and depressing; even vaguely insulting. More thoughtful readers will be disturbed, but that will only be to Bradbury&#65533;s purpose.This work is really written for brave thinkers - those willing to confront unpleasantness and sweat for their rewards. Such readers, no matter what their age, will fall in love with this book. Bradbury exposes the failings of our natures with a perception and a depth of wisdom that few science fiction authors can reach. Most of all, his love for humanity shines through the darkness of his cautionary tale: and he has the literary courage to warn us against ourselves without the addition of artificial sweetener."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I enjoyed the book through-and through. I haven't read since high school and found the second time refreshing. Montag, the questionable fireman, discovers truth in the cave of reality while wife, Mildred, stares at walls of fiction. Beatty, the fireman, villified a brainless modern world with hopeless, while Clarisse fantasized about the future of tommorrow. Each character's desperate nature compelled me to read further. One taught who shouldn't, one inspired who knew better, one conspired who should have loved, one deceived who kinked the hose of knowedge, and one questioned everything who never did before.Bradbury's novel is one many can relate to in the modern world. His dystopian is filled with brillant biblical and philosophical allusions. His words are more poetry than prose. Like many of his novels he questions the heart and mind of the future in a world of new conveniences and conflicts.Bradbury's flaws are few. But like many books in the bible, with prophetic damnation there is also a promise. There is a glimpse of a new hope, but there is no second to this lonely motion. I would like him to push the plot onward. The baptism of Montag is just the end of an old life, but it's also the beginning of a new one.As I read Ray Bradbury's art work, I see a need for free thinkers, individuals who challenge daily. Many of the writers decorated in the text show this will to propell the individual past the barriers of social appropriateness. This is something I have always admired about his writing and will continue to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a futuristic parable that warns of the bleakness of a society in which political correctness has gone awry. The firemen in the story burn books (and the houses in which they are found) in an effort to save mankind from being offended by their contents. There are a couple of gripping passages in the middle of the story, amidst intense action sequences, in which the firemen's philosophy is expounded, and a history is given to explain the madness. In the words of the fire marshal (Beatty), &quot;Colored people don't like Little Black Sambo. Burn it. White people don't feel good about Uncle Tom's Cabin. Burn it. Someone's written a book on tobacco and cancer of the lungs? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book.&quot; And so on.The main character (and fireman) Montag evolves from someone who merely observes with a curious detachment the odd book-loving maverick around him, to an active participant in a quest to salvage what little is left by way of the written word. He is inspired by a little girl and an old man, both unconventional thinkers, and along the way, Montag's disdain grows for his conformist wife. [Curiously, and most prophetically, Montag's wife's love of interactive television (or its futuristic analog) ends up stripping her of any individuality or character, and causes Montag to tire of her more quickly.]A great read, all in all, with credible characters, creative and thought-provoking settings and devices (including a mechanical &quot;hound&quot; working for the fire department that tracks prey according to its hormonal makeup (or &quot;odor index&quot;), and dispatches it with a poison syringe), and a caustic tone that spares no one (the media, the government, religion, etc.). The story is totally conceivable, too (even today, despite its completion in 1953), which serves to scare the reader more than the most fantastic piece of fiction ever could. My edition had a riveting Afterward by Bradbury as well, circa 1979, in which the author inveighed against censorship and those who see fit to censor. In the author's own words, &quot;There is more than one way to burn a book.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine a place where fire alarms alert firemen of where books are being held, and the firemen start fires that destroy those books along with the house and sometimes the people living inside of it. It is a time of censorship against all books. Guy Montag is one of the firemen, but a few people have helped him realize that what he is doing is wrong. But with this knowledge comes the betrayal of his wife and co-workers. Guy must escape the world in which reading is illegal.This book offers a fascinating glimpse at what the world, or at least the country, may become if books continue to be censored. Bradbury keeps the reader interested by citing books that many of us have read, including the Bible. And his topic of censorship still rings true, possibly more so than when it was written, due to the growing list of books censored from libraries and school curriculums. I recommend this book to anyone who recognizes the power of books and what society would be without them, but also to those who don't realize the power. Overall a wonderful book, written in a way that spans lifetimes."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"As much a clich&eacute; as it is to say, I think this book is even more relevant today then when originally written. I think Montag's wife's obsession with the &quot;real people&quot; she watches is such an uncanny parallel to the reality based shows that are so popular now that it's almost creepy. The fact that it was written so long ago only adds to the impact. There is also the similarity of the viewing walls and the 56 inch high definition T.V.s of today. It's a little like a horoscope though, the reader can read more into it then is there. Ray Bradbury's past future is dreary and bleak and no one cares for anyone else. I tend to be more of an optimist, I think there are still enough people in the world that care to prevent the kind of events that happen in this book to occur any time in the near future.I don't believe the main focus of this book (as most people think) is censorship at all but rather a love letter to books and the joy of reading. Mr Bradbury writes about the joys of reading as though he were describing a flesh and blood lover. He clearly despises censorship and complacency but he gives more of his passion to the love of the written word. I think the &quot;not happy, but hopeful&quot; ending shows his faith in man.This is literally a classic piece of fiction and it's impressive how much Ray Bradbury says in such a short novel. It's easy to read on several different levels. There's almost no excuse not to read this book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Guy Montag is a fireman who's job requires him to efficiently burn books when a call enters the station. In the future, the government, in control of millions of people, decides to make reading books against the law, fearing that a literate society would destroy itself.Guy, through the vision of a young girl and an old English professor, discovers his own wonderment of his surroundings, triggered through great ideas found in books. Discovering this universal wonderment lies at the foundation of the author's main theme, highlighted brilliantly through his distorted and domineering society.With this futuristic society and a distortion of trends found in today's culture, Bradbury captures his reader's attention and makes them open their eyes, hearts, and mind to the true importance of independent intellectual enhancement through reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is a profound book indeed, and I don't know how I can hope to do it justice. I think in many ways, Ray Bradbury is after us to think about happiness, and when we are better off being unhappy. This comes up several times -- the twisted, tragically fallen Fire Captain Beatty calls his firemen &quot;The Happiness Boys&quot; because they make melancholy and thoughtfulness more difficult, by burning literature. Later, when the hero -- Montag, the book-burning fireman who begins to question his job -- confronts his wife's friends, he tries as hard as possible to make them UNhappy about their boring lives, in the hope that it will wake them up to the world around them... The very first sentence of the book states &quot;It was a pleasure to burn&quot;, referring to Montag before he begins to wake up, and become an unhappy, sympathetic human being... Bradbury is getting at some important things here, such as how we can be most peaceful inside when we are questioning, when we are not happy. Older readers might want to think about reading John Milton's &quot;L'Allegro&quot; and &quot;Il Penseroso&quot; to flesh out their own personal response to this book. I think younger readers, who could be reading this for school, might be interested in renting the movie &quot;Logan's Run&quot;. Both stories are about future societies, where order and happiness are maintained by weeding out anyone who seems capable of independent thought. In this story, that means burning all books. In &quot;Logan's Run&quot;, it means simply killing anyone who starts to get too old, who might start to have a little perspective. In both stories, the main character is a member of the elite, with a personal, professional stake in maintaining order, who suddenly begins to question the whole system, and ends up siding with his &quot;enemies&quot;, the thoughtful people. At any rate, this is really quite a tremendous book, and I hope a lot of people read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I read this story in 7th grade, and since then I have never been able to forget the amazing tale of Guy Montag and his job as a fireman. I will never forget the magic of Clarisse, who to this date is my favorite book character of all time. I loved this book immediately when I started reading it and I never put it down until I was finished.Guy Montag is a fireman. But it's not the kind of fireman that you and I know today. These firemen burn things. Books to be specific. It is said that books are not needed for the future, and are officially illegal. So when it is found out that people are in possession of books, the firemen come to the house or whatever hiding place, and burn the books, and sometimes also burn the house. Guy Montag meets a girl named Clarisse one night as he's walking home, and with that one conversation, his life makes a complete turn in his life, soon sheltering books in his own home.The story of Fahrenheit 451 is nothing but amazing. This book is unlike anything I have ever read, and to this date, is one of my favorite books of all time. Some people say that this book is &quot;dumb&quot; and &quot;wish it would burn&quot; but these people don't understand the mentality of the book. You need to read into it and understand it fully before you go bashing it.The book Fahrenheit 451 even reflects some of our ignorance today, seeing as most of my friends hate reading. If only more people could get into this book. I would recommend Fahrenheit 451 to anyone I knew, even those friends who don't like reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"451 degrees Fahrenheit is the temperature at which book paper catches fire and burns. If you have not read this book, now a cult classic, you wouldn't know that fact. Nor would you know that in Ray Bradbury's world of the future people don't say anything because they don't know anything. And they don't know anything because they don't have books. At first books were leveled down to a sort of pastepudding norm by cuts that made them shorter, producing condensations and digests. Classics were cut to fill a two-column single page, winding up at last as a ten-line summary. Then books were outlawed. Discipline relaxes. History becomes neglected. English is dropped. Life becomes immediate. Why learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting nuts and bolts? The amazing thing is that Bradbury predicted that censorship would start with the minorities objecting to the way they were depicted. Blacks, Baptists, Dog Lovers etc. waanted strict enforcement of anti-book laws and the burning of all books followed. Someone has written a book on tobacco and lung cancer? The cigarette people are weeping? Burn the book. The smokers are distressed? Burn the book. A book, any book creates problems. You don't have to face those problems. Just burn the book. The point is obvious. The world is full of people running about with lit matches. Every minority feels it has the will, the right, the duty, to douse the kerosene, like Montag, the protagonist of this novel, and light the fuse. But you know there are more ways than burning to destroy a book. Every dimwit editor could slenderize, starve, bluepencil, leech, and bleed white any book and make any author sound like Edgar Guest. Frightening in its implications, 451, this insane world, which bears many alarming reseemblances to our own, is required reading for all lovers of books. Incidentally, the proof that Bradbury's esthetic vision was not far off the mark was that he discovered, years after 451 was published, that cubby-hole editors at Ballantine, fearful of contaminating the young, had, bit by bit, censored some 75 separate sections from the novel. Alert students reading those editions told the author about this exquisite irony. The original story is now available thanks to Judy Lynn Del Rey."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I have read it twice now, and everytime I read it, I enjoy it more and more. This book was about one person and the changes he went through. Guy Montag was a firemen, who burned books for a living. Then he is enlightened to read a book, and is helped by Professor Faber. At the end, Montag is a rebel. He runs away and becomes I leader of other rebels to bring reading to the world they left. This book show how the technology is taking over and not even using books for education. I think it is a book that everyone should read."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 is a short and simple book that deals with some incredibly complex issues. Most people mistakenly believe that Bradbury wrote Fahrenheit about censorship. Although that shoe does fit this story, Bradbury actually wrote this book to highlight the possible consequences that our society may have to face if the trend of television and similar forms of entertainment began to overtake more imaginative forms of entertainment such as books. This theme seems even more relevent today than it would have when it was written in 1953. The fictional world of the future that Bradbury created is a depressing and generic place where people have forgotten how to think for themselves and are completely unable to form true bonds of family and friendship. The books that are burned by the firemen are against the law but the story points out very obviously that these laws began as a result of the citizens' own actions. Books were burned if any one group found them offensive so that everyone would be happy. Eventually, all books were considered offensive to someone and the government stepped in to take care of the problem of books once and for all. Unfortunately, this did nothing to REALLY fix the problem. It merely dumbed down society until people were unable to realize their true feelings. Suicide and murder is a normal and acceptable occurance. Everything is impersonal and generic as protagonist Guy Montag goes from \\"content\\" fireman to book-loving fugitive in the matter of a couple hundred pages.As a book lover, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Bradbury writes in a natural voice and it is extremely obvious that he himself if a great lover of books. It is a refreshing read while still disturbing the reader with it's eerie depictions of where we could be headed as a society."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I had to read this novel for a literature class in high school and while I thought it very good, I didn't feel it was as powerful as other similar dystopian novels like 1984. Well, I still don't feel it is quite as good as 1984 (which I think is maybe the greatest SF novel written) but I have revised my opinion on Fahrenheit 451. It is exceptional. It is somewhat eerie to read about Montag and his wife Millie and realize they could represent in many ways the society we are now becoming, one further and further detached from people and things and, of course, books, and even memories. With all our innovations and technological discoveries, we seem to be lagging behind in literacy and when I read 451 this time, I could not help but identify the metaphor book burning took on for me, where we are slowly being almost totally reliant on computers for everything, including entertainment for hours on end and reading seems an almost quaint and charming relic of the past."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Truth be told, I read this book in my high school days and probably didn't appreciate it as much as I could have. I remember thinking it was an above average read, but I didn't have a strong appreciation for the novel's depth. Bradbury's message didn't strike me until I recently picked up the book again years later. Reading this novel again, I was wowed and amazed about the events I had missed with my first reading. The underlying message about the dangers of losing one's self amid conformity came ringing forth, and the idea of fire burning as a metaphor for burning away existence stuck with me. Bradbury's work became a profound experience for me.Set in a dystopic world, Montag works as a firefighter whose job it is to burn books, as they are held as dangerous materials. When Montag meets his neighbor, Clarisse McClellan, she wakes him up to the world he exists in by asking him a simple question: \\"Are you happy?\\" Montag, as if in a trance before, begins wondering why books are thought to be such a deterrent to society, why he should be burning instead of reading, and why society runs the way it does. He identifies an uncomfortable unhappy feeling, and takes steps to try to get to the bottom of the vast emptiness he has lived with. Beatty, Montag's boss, begins to identify the guilt Montag feels about his job, as Montag at one point feigns being sick, and tries to philosophize about why the world exists the way it does. Beatty's basic premise is that books make people think, and bring about all sorts of \\"nastiness\\": emotion, tears, feeling, rebellion, and power. He states that the world is better conforming to systematic enjoyment and collective thought because it is, in his words, less dangerous. Montag has a life-changing moment when their fire crew is called out to burn down a woman's house; the woman refuses to go, and is burned up along with her books, and Montag feels responsible for this. Montag befriends a man named Faber, an ex English professor who he remembered from a year earlier hiding a book while at a park. Where Clarisse wakes up Montag to his life, Faber is the key to Montag's full reawaking, and taking action towards his new ideas. Faber gives him the tools to know that there are people out there who believe in reading and thinking. Montag vows to never burn again. Beatty eventually suspects that Montag may be collecting books on the side, and eventually the call comes for Montag to burn his own house down. From here, Montag has a dilemma about whether to follow his boss' orders, or try to escape somehow. Without giving too much away, Montag is on the run as a fugitive as the chase is being broadcasted live as police attempt to hunt him down. From here, we are left to try to find out whether he will escape the police, and, if so, where he is heading.Fahrenheit 451 is one of those rare books that becomes more powerful and poignant as time goes on. As much as the story is about dystopia and the ills of censorship, it goes beyond this. It is also a book about the pitfalls of society devoid of conscientiousness, individuality, reason, or uniqueness. When we get to the point where we lose our voice or our ability to think, our existence becomes empty and meaningless. Perhaps even more startling or tragic is the notion that citizens may not even realize that society has become this way, or that THEY have become this way, as is the case for the main character, Montag, who happily burns away house after house, book after book, and lives a rather systematic life as a fireman, with a wife who is more machine than spouse, a product of the times.Some compare this book to 1984, and with just cause, as both depict the isolation caused when individuals have little to no control in thought or living. However, Fahrenheit 451 feels less dark and gloomy than 1984, and seems to have an optimistic outlook, so I find it a little more enjoyable.Fantastic book! One that has deserved every bit of praise it has received."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the middle of the last century, a number of authors wrote novels describing the de-evolution of out Western culture:-Brave New World, by Aldous Huxley-A Clockwork Orange&-The Wanting Seed, by Anthony Burgess-1984, by George Orwell...And Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury!Set in a \\"near-future\\" which has somewhat already materialzed in our own time, the Fire Department has long ceased to be an emergency service. They have become a secret-police force, whose primary purpose is to incinerate \\"illegal printed material\\". Why? Long before Thomas Paine distributed \\"Common Sense\\" and \\"The Rights of Man\\", or Martin Luther nailed his Theses to the cathedral door, the printed word has proved most unsettling to all thug-ocracies.Montag, a disillusioned fireman, who just can't stop thinking for himself, soon finds himself under suspicion for his own secret literary curiosity.The future described by Bradbury, is a time and place defined by LOUD, ALL PERVASIVE, BOMBASTIC commercialization, and a truly vapid, soulless, and superficial popular culture. Does that sound familiar?Printed material has been banned, (and burned) because it \\"disturbs\\" peoples minds.Montag, a sensistive and introspective sort, finds himself profoundly alienated in this society, failing to find authenticity even from his own wife. He can not help but question the role he plays as a fireman, and finds that he must find out for himself as to why the books he burns are so \\"dangerous\\".Look at the contemporary \\"popular culture\\".Observe all the conforming artificial fools about you.See the overt lack of free-thinking on any given college-campus, (institutions that once exemplified the concept).The loud, obnoxious, all-pervasive and overly-commercialized popular \\"culture\\" is ALREADY HERE.

Someone wants you to STOP THINKING.There may not be a \\"fire-brigade\\" acting as the tool of an oppressive police-state, or even public book-burning events. Maybe books will become \\"passe\\", because we have \\"computers\\", and \\"electronic media\\".However the printed word becomes \\"obsolete\\" (and there are people working very hard to bring this about), be assured that your very civilization is circling the drain.

This story about burning books later transformed into what we know today as the classic Fahrenheit 451. This book is hailed as one of the best science fiction novels at the time, and is still very successful today.The book revolves around a character named Guy Montag, a fire fighter in an America where there is no order, or self control: Books that contemplate deep thought are outlawed and burned, with no sense of literature or compassion towards those who hang on to them; as the pages burn at a cozy 451 degrees. This America, maybe even this world focuses more on fake joy and illusion, than pressing world issues, such as the constant threat of nuclear war. In this world, or at least in this America; the citizens are rampant, and are brainwashed to think that they are happy, when in fact each and every one of them are just drones without a real queen. More people are killed in random car accidents than their last nuclear war, which America won. Guy, like almost everyone else in the nameless city, gives in the misapprehension of happiness until he meets someone. One day he meets Clarisse Mc Cellan, a young teenager who changes his perspective on his life, and life in general; from the smallest rain drop to whether he really loves Mildred or not. He begins to realize the sheer grievance of the world; from thinking putting new blood in a person is curing them, to thinking T.V families are your real families. (This is Mildred's problem until the very end). He at last questions his own occupation, which is probably the reason why his life is the way it is. He finally goes off the deep end and steals a book from a lady who burns her and her books before the firemen do. It is then revealed to Mildred (and the readers) that Montag has been keeping a stash of books hidden for a year, and has been trying to memorize them. Alas, the information always slips away; like \\"the sieve and the sand.\\" He then goes on a journey, both physically and mentally; as he must face himself, the Mechanical Hound, and even his own boss Captain. Beatty. He is very much Montag's opposite, and is the main antagonist.I would highly recommend this book to anyone who can create deep thought from reading a book. This book is action packed, epic, and is a striking realization on a path modern America might be heading for itself. The book itself is actually more relevant today than when it was first published in 1950. The fact is that the back story mentioned in the book on how America got this way is sounding more and more like our present. Basically, their past might be our definitive future. This book is classic for a reason, as the book is critically acclaimed by almost any person who reads it; of any demographic. The only real requirement is to be able to analyze the information in the book, as there are a few moments of symbolism in the book. Overall, I believe that there are a lot of bone- rattling moments that anyone with a brain should enjoy, but probably won't in the end. And for anyone who likes this book, I recommend The Martian Chronicles, and Dandelion Wine.\\" They are excellent examples of Bradbury's work. I also recommend The Last Book in the Universe; it is very similar to Fahrenheit 451 in plot. In all, I would give 5/5 to the classic that made us all think a little more.. --Christian C."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This is one of those books I've read and reread throughout my life, and it has proven itself as a true work of genius in that it had something new to say to me at each stage of my life. In my youth, I was led to believe that \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" was a novel about censorship - after all, the main characters are \\"firemen\\" who burn books. But with maturity, and a wider view of the world, I began to see the more potent message inside the book.In this supposedly futuristic world, society at large has been dumbed down gradually. Books have been reduced and summarized until readers can only stand brevity, then they are eliminated altogether. Special interests of all sorts have demanded censorship or destruction of anything deemed offensive. Advertising and marketing are everywhere. Mindless interactive entertainment consumes all available leisure time. Life is lived in a drugged stupor with a soundtrack delivered in a steady stream through earbuds. The threat of annihilation looms large, while most of the population carries on lives not worth living. Personal relationships are now so superficial that people regard television characters as their \\"family\\". Voices of dissent, when they appear, are silenced quickly.There's very little I can say about a classic novel that hasn't been said before. We may never see widespread elimination of books as Bradbury imagined, but it can't be denied that the views and attitudes that brought on the firemen are certainly part of our world.If you haven't read \\"Fahrenheit 451\\", read it now. If you've read it before, read it again.

I thought it was boring and completely implausible and I wanted to burn it as soon as the unit was over (I didn't).Fast forward 10 years. For some reason I decided that I should go back and re-read all of the books I was forced to read in high school English classes. And maybe it was because I chose to read it instead of being forced to, or maybe it had more to do with age and a knowledge of the world that I didn't have back then, but I found myself completely entranced with this book.The storyline is believable, especially in the context of real world attempts to ban books for various reasons over the years. The characters are three dimensional and sympathetic. The pacing is perfect. The book is so gripping that before you know it you'll realize that you've read the entire novel in one sitting.Fahrenheit 451 is still technically classified as science fiction, a label that can be a turn off to those who think of Star Trek or Stargate when they see it. I personally would categorize it as a classic suspense novel, or as literature, rather than calling it sci-fi.If you read the book when you were very young, whether you liked it or didn't, I highly recommend re-reading it as an adult. You will learn as much about yourself and how your perspective has changed over the years as you will about the possible future that Bradbury presents.And if you've never read it at all, read it now.

(451F is the temperature at which book pages burn.) His fireman protagonist, Guy Montag, has suddenly changed allegiances and become interested in preserving books rather than destroying them. The book is supposedly about censorship, but to me it seemed to be more about apathy. The book burning started after everyone had stopped reading anyway, and the liberal arts schools had mostly disappeared. Montag's professor friend Faber lists the three things that books provide: texture, leisure to absorb the information, and our response to what they teach us. The texture is the fabric of life that books describe, and the more densely woven the fabric, the better the quality of the book. Bradbury's writing style is not very fluid, but his take on the future is noteworthy at times. Not all of his predictions have come to pass, but the bug that Faber puts in Montag's ear made me think of people wearing their cell phones today. Also, the author mentions that the television is used as a babysitter, and he was spot-on about that. However, we don't have vicious mechanical hounds, at least not that I know of, nor do we all live in fireproof houses, unfortunately."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"There is a reason that Fahrenheit 451 is considered a classic.. it is one of those books that we can identify with during any era we have lived in, and our current era is no different. Less and less people are reading \\"real\\" books and more and more people reading and giving credence to trash magazines and internet blogs.I always felt that F451 and 1984 were set if not in the same universe, then maybe universes right next door to each other for they tell similar yet both separately important stories. This book is a cautionary read on society gone wrong, and is one I consider a must read for any reader."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Deep inside each of us is a Montag, a burner of books, a fireman who destroys rather than saves. And this is what makes Fahrenheit 451 the masterpiece that it is: it gets at the root of censorship, at its ultimate cause, at the fear of ideas that all of us must struggle with at one point or another. In our current age of political correctness from all ends (and sometimes the middle also), Bradbury's warning rings louder than ever: it is not books that we fear but what is inside of them, the fear that by reading something new we might find our precious ideas about life challenged. And rather than engage the ideas that make us uncomfortable, we try to isolate them, condemn them, and then destroy them.What struck me most about Fahrenheit 451 was how closely Bradbury's vision matches our current world, particularly in the west. Like Mildred, we are all too willing to lose ourselves in fantasy soap-opera worlds, finding ourselves more interested in the next American Idol than in the neighbor across the street. And here is Bradbury's real coup: it is not any particular idea that the government and we ourselves fear, but the very idea of ideas themselves. Montag and his fellow firemen are not discriminatory: they burn anything, because their employers know that whatever makes you think, whatever makes you question your shallow, empty life, whether it is pornography or Shakespeare or the Bible, is a danger to those who use ignorance to gain and hold power.Think about that the next time you get the urge to light the kerosene and destroy an idea."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I must say that this classic, by the master of Science Fiction, is one of the greatest Scifi books written. Ray Bradbury has proved to the literary elitist, that Science Fiction is not just about non-existing technology. No, this novel questions the self-censoring nature of man. It takes place in the future, 1990s, a future for the when the book was written, and tells a tale of a world devoid of books. The firemen, no longer put out fires, but start them. They burn books. Hence the title: the temperature of which paper burns. Though, I suppose the most interesting part of this story is that the policy to burn all books did not come about from the government. No, instead regular people began to democratically burn books themselves because books typically have that one element of life that common people usually do not want to deal with. Controversy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book deals with the still-controversial issue of government censorship-the worst case scenario. Not only does the government limit people's ability to think for themselves, but the entertainment and advertising industry picks up their slack. This possible universe contains 3-D televisions to live in, cars that travel more than 100 mph, and radios that can be plugged directly into the ear when there's nothing else to do. A society in which presidential elections and the declaration of war is no cause for concern, and certainly not more important than what's happening on the most popular television program.A world where the acquisition of knowledge isn't a goal and where there are no books. In fact, books are illegal, and when someone concealing them is found, their books are burned as well as their house. And if the person doesn't come out of the house...it's a shame, but nothing to lose sleep over.That is Guy Montag's job; to burn books and this is the world in which he has lived, and it is the only world he knows. Until his life is changed forever by a series of revelations, including a friendship with a young woman named Clarisse who tells him what living really means and shows him that his life has really been a ghost-life. After that realization, his life fell apart. He realized he was living an empty life with an immoral, mindless, violent job, a wife he doesn't know-and doesn't love-and no one he could truly call a friend except Clarisse.Confused and distraught, Guy fled to find guidance about books, the future, life, and-most of all-himself, from the one man he thinks can help: an old professor by chance.

I believed then, and believe now, that it was the most scarily bleak and mercilessly depressing book I had ever read. Even then, I felt the cushion between Bradbury's 24th century nightmare and what we call modern reality was thin and worn.Bradbury gave us until the 24th century to submerge ourselves in the dark, sedated, media-slaked night of \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" Looking around me, I have come to the conclusion that Bradbury was a pretty optimstic guy.Like Orwell's \\"1984\\" and Aldous Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is a dystopian vision, a glimpse into a future America that is frighteningly familiar and yet horribly wrong. It is a technologically advanced, subtle, sophisticated world, full of high-definition television screens that take up an entire wall and beam 24 hour programming to a vacant and eager television audience, 24-hour Reality programming that serves up a TV \\"Family\\" more engaging, more lifelike, more agreeable, than their own.This is a world where bored, vacuous housewives exchange barbs on the latest presidential contenders laced with observations on which candidate is the most handsome, and which has the most noticeable (to the Television Audience, naturally) facial bunion or boil. It is a world of 'seashells', tiny earphones designed to nest in the inner ear and breathe a sussurus of music into the mind of a medicated listener.Like his English counterparts Huxley and Orwell, Bradbury has served up a soft tyrannical state manned, not by the zealous, but by zombies. It is a world ruled by the media-addicted, the apathetic, the listless, the medicated, the overdosed, the sleeping. Books have been banned, and consigned to the Flame, not because of a despotic regime, but by the common, courteous consensus of a modern democracy desperately eager not to give offense to anyone.Sound familiar?Much like \\"1984\\", \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" works because it drills down on an unlikely protagonist. Guy Montag, at least when we meet him, sincerely loves his job. His fellow firemen are not zealots or fascists, but simply pragmatic working men who enjoy what they do. There are unpleasant aspects to the work, naturally---among them the incineration of an old eccentric woman who prefer to die with her beloved books---but like most of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\"'s society, Montag prefers not to think about it. Take a pill, or better still take two---and don't call me in the morning. For Montag, truly, it is a 'pleasure to burn'.Like most revolutionaries, though, Guy Montag is simmering from within; dissatisifed with his wife, whose stomach must be pumped on the very evening he returns from the euphoria of the Burn; dissatisifed with the apathetic society in which he lives; dissatisfied with a job which fails to give expression to the rebel soul that burns within, that impels him to challenge his wife's brazen, flippant friends.There are three catalysts that propel Montag to rebellion: the girl Clarisse, whom he befriends; the immolation of the old woman at the Fire; and his own clandestine book collection.\\"Fahrenheit 451\\" succeeds as both jeremiad and prophecy, true, but it also engages because Bradbury is a literary master: his spare, mechanical narrative of Montag's wife having her stomach pumped by two callous, dirty, jocular technicians practically breathes pure horror, and is one of the most soul-deadening passages I have ever read.But \\"451\\" also succeeds because it is a mirror of our own increasingly apathetic, violent, media-saturated world: is it so hard to see ourselves in Montag's trackless, cookie-cutter suburban landscape where bookish teenage girls are run down beneath the wheels of speeding pranksters, themselves bored and looking for the cheap thrill of ultra-violence? Is it so hard to see ourselves in the avidity of the Television Audience, watching the panicked, doomed, frantic rictus face of the condemned man stalked by the mechanical Hound, the images of his death broadcast back by the electronic antennaes on the monster's back? Isn't that merely COPS or \\"Survivor\\" with a bite?I've seen the Future, and it works. Because it is our world I see, our world upon us---for that reason, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is the most terrifying book I have ever read.JSG"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury does a great job of capturing the future of man, in his desire to reject thinking and embrace mindless leisure. The future world involves a backwards world where firemen start fires to rid the world of books, because that is in the best interest of good social order. But our hero is a fireman who develops a conscience, after meeting a spunky 17 year old who has dreams and challenges our man that the world may have been different in the past.The tension between our hero and his fire captain boss, as well as the tension with his mindless wife, are excellent. The whole story is an eye opener, full of compelling action and riviting philosophical discussion.I enjoyed the notes from Mr Bradbury in the 50th anniversary edition where he admits he subconsciously gave our protagonist the name of a paper company, and the name of his professor friend from a pencil company.This is a classic that will endure for centuries, despite whatever firemen exist in the future."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"At some point, Ray Bradbury states in his novel \`Fahrenheit 451': \`The good writers touch life often. The mediocre ones run a quick hand over her. The bad ones rape her and leave her for the flies'. Bearing this in mind, it is doubtless that Bradbury is included among the good writers. In his novel, he managed to create a parable about the intellectual wakening of a man and the dangers of censorship, in a society where people are not allowed to think.In an undefined future, the firemen job is to start fire. They are supposed to burn books, and the houses of people who keep published material. Guy Montag is a fireman who has never questioned the pleasures of burning, until one day when out of curiosity he takes a copy of a book home and together with his wife he tries to read. However, they have never read a book, and while they can read, they are not able to understand, to connect the sentences. This is just the awakening of Montag's mind. We know there is something about him, and that he won't be the same until we reach the last page.Rather than being far fetcher Bradbury created a timeless story. Things like those describes in the book have been happening for ages. We may not literally burn books, but books, newspapers and magazines are burnt everyday. Like he describes in the book it began with one minority ripping one paragraph, then another, then one more... until the day that it would be better to burn the whole book. We live in the age of minorities, and we should watch out some request.The present edition is followed by an \`Afterword' and a \`Coda' written by Bradbury in first person. In the first he tells specifically about this novel, the process of writing and once more give voice to his characters to talk about themselves and they world they --and us-- live. In the second part, the writer talks about how timeless his novel indeed is. These two last chapters are very clarifying and help a lot in the understanding of the book. My suggestion is: read this novel, think of it, and see how the world can be one day. And then do your part to avoid things in this book becoming real, because \`Fahrenheit 451' can be anything, but far fetched."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Of the people I know who have read this book, roughly three-fourths of them loved it and the other fourth hated it. I would be in the former group.Fahrenheit 451 tells of a not too distant future where all books are banned, and anyone caught with even one book has it, and the rest of their belongings, burned. It describes a future where human life means next to nothing and war is not uncommon. I won't go any further into the plot, as many other reviewers already have.Ray Bradbury has a mastery of the English language that requires the book to be read slowly in order to be fully understood, but it is ultimately very rewarding. For the type of book it is, it is the perfect length. It has just enough details to keep you interested, but not too many to bog down the enjoyment. And it is paced perfectly.I've seen this book getting quite a few comparisons to Orwell's 1984. I have read both books, and I don't think they really compare. 1984 is a slower, much more detailed look into a government, while Fahrenheit 451 is faster paced and focuses on one aspect of the government of the future.I've read the book no less than four times, and enjoy it more each time. It is now one of my favorite books.It does have to be read slowly due to Bradbury's metaphorical way of writing. I consider it Bradbury's masterpiece, and while all may not agree, you should at least give it a try, taking time to absorb exactly what it is Bradbury is saying."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have conflicting feelings for this book. I appreciate the disturbing, yet very real, idea brought to light in this story: what if books really were burned, and that was normal? What if the majority of society was just a slew of brain-washed followers? Those themes, among others, in this book are important to consider, in my opinion. I, for one, cherished books and the freedom to own them more after having read this book. Unfortuantely, I didn't really enjoy the actual reading of this novel. The writing seemed, if not flat, then more devoid of emotion than it ought to have been. I like writing to be descriptive and fulfilling, while still understandable. Bradbury's writing is, at times, flowery past my point of immediate comprehension, and at other times, not quite creative enough. There are certain lines in this book that didn't read quite right, and some ideas I didn't think were adequately explained. The mechanical dog- interesting idea, vague deliverance. The 'family' was interesting as well, though I don't think that Bradbury explored it enough. This novel's main flaw was, in the most extreme sense, flat writing. My opinion might be more biased because of a rather severe project I had to do on the book after having read it, which deflated my liking for it a bit, but I hope I've been as objective as possible. I'd recommend reading this book, as it is a fine piece of easy-to-read literature and a fascinating look into the future of books, though don't expect for a masterpiece on your hand. The writing could definately have been better filled out."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read Ray Bradbury in my literature book, in English class. I was instantly hooked. His writing has a simplicity to it, but at the same time, an amazing profoundness. I immediately went out to the bookstore and bought a book of his short stories--then another, and finally, I read Fahrenheit 451. His style is constant--his use of metaphors has more of an impact than any other author I've ever read. He has a rare ability to deviate from the regular stereotypes of the future, making the settings as believable as if they were set in the present time.I immensely enjoyed this. It really conveyed the image of what a world would be like without books--lacking substance and meaning; having pleasure at violence and taking for granted what they had. Mr. Bradbury never ceases to amaze me. The character, Montag, was a perfect balance of the influences society had impacted him, and his own emerging understanding of reality.I'm greatly inspired by this, and I hope to mature enough to write something of as much quality as Fahrenheit 451."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Sure the story of a nightmare world in which free speech is forbidden, as a parable for the directions our real-life society is going, has been done a million times - both before and after \\"Fahrenheit 451.\\" So why is Bradbury's book a classic? The key is his superior writing skills and offbeat social subversion. In Bradbury's world, free speech has not been suppressed through a fascist exercise in social control and forced conformity, as in Huxley's similar \\"Brave New World.\\" Instead, in this book free speech has been eliminated indirectly through what would now be called rampant political correctness. Every single piece of free speech might be offensive to someone somewhere, so all books and entertainment are eliminated so the masses can waste away in feel-good conformity. Ignorance is bliss in this world. This is a groundbreaking concept for a book written way back in the 50's. Bradbury must have been terrified by the PC hordes that broke out 30 or 40 years later. The one major problem with this book is the characters. The protagonist Montag is ultimately narrow and undefined, even though most of the story concerns his inner struggles. The other main characters - Beatty, Faber, and Granger - exist only as longwinded speechifiers for Bradbury's ideas. But the book is saved by the real sense of creeping dread and social agony lurking in the background, all highlighted by Bradbury's intriguing prose and curveball plot techniques.Be sure to read an edition of this book published after around 1980. Prior to that, editors had abridged the book without Bradbury's consent, removing some troubling passages for the sake of helpless schoolkids (or more likely, their holier-than-thou educators). This is the ultimate irony - censorship of a book about censorship! Be on the lookout for an edition containing Bradbury's \\"Coda\\" (or epilogue) - a blistering indictment of this issue in which Bradbury essentially tells all opponents to kiss his you-know-what, in a quite scathing way."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I guess I've always wanted to be an individual, to look deeper and find the rich goodness of life and freedom in being me. I have found this richness through books. When i discovered Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury, it was the book that defined my love of the me that I am. I think Faber said it best, when he told Montag &quot;I don't talk things, sir; I talk the meaning of things. I sit here and know I am alive.&quot; After I read this book I knew I wasn't the only one who craved a richer life through the great world of imagaination and books and knowledge. You see, I am alive and thinking."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"A pleaseant experience.

It really makes you think about where our society is headed. It was written in the 1940s I believe, and if we continue to live the way we our living, censoring everything, we will end up living in a Fahrenheit 451 world. We have to stop it before we're all a bunch of Mildreds that &quot;talk to the relatives&quot; instead of real people. Anyway...I'm done rambling. Just read the book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book is not a standard SF and it is not ment to be. The idea is VERY plausible. Written 50 years ago, the idea of TV being a national obsession was ludicrous. Who knew? The white clown is very similar to the extremely violent shows that we let be on TV. And the books. . .the censorship. This is what will happen if we let censorship go any farther. And the scene where the women are discussing their children, absolutly scary. Good book. Read it."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The story is good, it really makes you think just where exactly our society is headed. Though Bradbury's interpretation of this possible future is exaggerated, of course, the point is made clear enough. This visage of the future is actually kind of disturbing. I probably would have never read this book if it hadn't been required of me for my English class."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is outstanding!! It's living standards,i.e politics,intellect, socity, are so very close to that of our own. Mr. Bradbury is a true artist and one of my influences in my career as a student and young sci-fi writer."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"First off this is an excellent book. I'll not bother to say what it's about \`cos everyone else has already done that. What I will say is that this book was written for all of you out there who hated it and want to see it burned. This book tells what is today so very well, with the poetic pose that Bradbury alone can use. No wonder he's only the second person EVER to be printed in TIME, and virtually every major magazine. In one sceen Montag reads poetry to a room of guests, they all burst into tears. The reason for this? They have never heard anything like it before, and can't understand it. Step into any high school English class and you'll find the same thing, kids not understanding and hating the book. Many people hate this book, they don't understand it. It describes mode day perfectly. Look at any college library were they have books that have been banned for being \\"intororant\\" \\"Little House On The Prairie\\", \\"The Bible\\" books that offended. In the world described in this book all, books offend, nobody understand them and if one person doesn't get it WHOOSH! up in flames it goes. That's why student's today read dull gutless books by contemporaries, instead of books to make you think like something by Dante, or Milton. God forbid the poor kid not understand something. A 12-year-old wrote, \\"This book is supposed to be about the future, but talks it resembles today\\" NO KIDDING! This alone shows the greatness of this book, it was written 50 years ago, and tells us about ourselves. They also claimed they could \\"not relate to anyone in the book.\\" What a shock! Got news kid this was written for adults, of COURSE you couldn't relate, how could you? Unless you're abnormally intelligent they couldn't. The teacher who assigned this book to a class of 12-year-olds should have their head examined; they weren't going to get it. Some people say Bradbury has a negative outlook on the future. Anyone who was read a book by him knows that. The reason? Bradbury has a firm grasp on reality, and knows that humans are evil, and will ultimately destroy themselves. He has good cause to be pessimistic, he looks at the modern world and shakes his head, and then try's to do something about it by educating us. For those of you who want to be educated, and are bright enough to understand this book, and the truth it shows, buy it. For the rest of you. Buy a meaningless book by I know not who, and find why nobody knows who they are. And leave book meant for bright people with eyes in their heads alone."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I never really enjoyed science fiction, but something about this book caught my eye. The story revolves around one lone fireman, Guy Montag, who, oddly enough, sets fire to books instead of putting them out. He lives in a world that doesn't like to see unhappiness and the real truth, so they destroy books and all that causes unhappiness. When he meets a girl who, unlike all of the others, &quot;thinks,&quot; not only about life and the deeper meaning behind the events which happen in our daily lives, which we don't acknowledge because we are all so busy, he becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind those books and behind life. Along the way, he meets Faber, the elderly man who guides him on his journey. There is a certain tragedy in this book, and although the events in this book don't happen in life verbatim, it is remarkably similar to events which happen in everyday life. This appeared to have been a spiritual experience, not only for the characters, but for the author Ray Bradley. The characters are so tortured inside, caught between what they are expected to do and what they know is right. This book made me think more about what life really is about. And, as demonstrated in this book so many times, you never know when your life is going to end, so as it says in the book: &quot;Stuff your eyes with wonder. Live as if you'd drop dead in 10 seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories. Ask no guarantees, ask for no security, there never was such an animal. And if there were, it would be related to the great sloth which hangs upside down in a tree all day, every day, sleeping its life away.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"My daughter has received this for the second time now as required reading for school (summer reading requirement). &quot;Oh Mom this book is awful&quot; she said, now for the second time. She read me a paragraph of the book and sure enough, it does sound awful when you read small snippets of the book. This book is not an easy read at all, not because it is overly intellectual -- it's not written very well, sorry Mr. Bradbury -- the author wrote in the afterward, that he wrote it in his early days of writing in various rooms of his house, finally ended up sequestered in his garage. I imagine that if the book was written later in Mr. Bradbury's career, that it would have been written far better than it was -- this is no literary masterpiece, but the concept it contains is a timeless one.That said, my daughter gave it to me to read and I read it in one sitting, wondering what was going to happen to the main character and how this book would end. This book is about a future society where books are illegal. The government has built a society where simple pleasure is the main goal in life, not meaningful pleasure. People live their lives around TV that takes up entire walls of their homes, no truly educational programming is allowed for the same reason that no books are allowed. The TV in this book creates not just light programming for society, but a family in the wall/screens -- it is mind numbing for that society. People become puppets where they live their lives out in simple ignorance and if you dare question the way things are or attempt to hide any books you are persecuted for it. People are simple minded and unquestioning. Enter Clarissa, the sweet teenage next door neighbor who takes simple pleasure in taking walks, letting the rain fall on her tongue, staying up late in the night actually talking to her family, no TV walls active in her home -- people actually listen to each other. The government is suspicious of her family -- not because they are subversive or publicly questioning society, but because of the way they live and think. Though Clarisse is a character in the book for a very short time, she makes an impact on the main character, Guy the fireman, who envies that she and her family talk to each other, listen to each other, and care so much for each other in a society that only cares about keeping the status quo and not getting in trouble. He begins to question what he is doing, burning books -- not so much because of the book burning itself, but for the lives of the book lovers he wrecks in the process. He begins to wonder what is inside the pages of books that people are willing to die for them and steels one of the books from a home his is destroying. He adds this book to the huge stash of books he has already hidden in the air ducts of his home and actually begins to read them and thus begins his own persecution.Though this isn't a literary masterpiece, as I said earlier, it is engrossing and very disturbing. The future society created in the pages is a nightmare. The importance of education, reading, and simply caring about your fellow man are the concepts the reader walks away with. I suspect that's the reason it is tirelessly assigned to kids at school."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I first read F451 in high school... and was moved by it. This was a book that at once fueled my teenage-born desire to fight \\"the man\\" and inspired me to become a science fiction author myself.So why am I writing this review now, more that a decade (sadly, much more than a decade) after high school? Well, I just read F451 again. It is now April, 2004. I am amazed at just how accurate Bradbury's future is. If the \\"slaves to our TV's\\" accusation doesn't strike close enough to the bulls-eye, just look at the role of war in F451 and then turn on CNN and watch for 5 minutes.Bradbury has hit the nail on its proverbial head; in his verbose-yet-eloquent style he has painted a horrible and terrifying future where man fears and scorns knowledge and wisdom. It has gotten to the point where firemen no longer put out fires, but start them--to burn the books which embody everything that is dangerous to a society that fears free will.Reading this again, now, I couldn't help resurrecting a memory. I was at work in the high-tech field (before the crash)... I make a habit of either reading or writing during my lunch hour, and a coworker had made a comment along the lines of \\"why on Earth would you read a book when you can get all the entertainment you'd ever want online?\\". Reading F451, I remember this person, and imagine them in a \\"parlor\\" with their fabricated online \\"Tv walls\\" that cater to their egos and their banal desire for raw and stupid entertainment.My advice to those who don't typically read, those who have siblings or offspring who do not read, and those who think anything that isn't digital is unworthy of their attention: Read this book. The main story (sans afterword, etc.) is only about 160 pages long. There's no excuse. read it.Those who do read (and especially those who write): this is a classic for a reason, and Bradbury's poetic quality is very enjoyable. He creates only a few characters in this book, but from the start you have such depth in the lead man (montag) that you feel pity for him as his wife's stomach is pumped, and you understand why he is drawn to the spirit that is Clarisse. Because you will have the privilege of reading this far beyond the time in which it was written, you will both fear the \\"hound\\" and relate to it. You will also relate to the TV walls and (unless you live underground in isolation) you will begin to fear what the modern media has become.[edit - You shouldn't burn books.

The feature was Fahrenheit 451, the year was 1966, and I was amazed by the message in this movie, enough to go back every night for a week, and beg my mom for the book. Growing up, I often reflected on how I lost I would be without books, and vowed I would read voraciously through life, and never willingly be part of a society who believed in spoon feeding propaganda to people to make them complacent. Lo and behold, my America has crept in that direction. The message of the movie is not what Government can do to society, but what society allows those in power to do to control them. Reading is indeed the antidote to blind faith in bad leaders. This movie carries a timeless message, one I have shared with my children and grandchild, and everyone who I have lent it or given one to."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I'm not a fan of science fiction, and so when my book group chose this book as its monthly selection to read, I was dubious. But then I started reading this small, seemingly simple little book and I was hooked - completely. Yes, it's science fiction. Yes, it requires the reader to accept the reality of a world that is a figment of the author's imagination. Yes, it deals with censorship and book burning and the dangers of mindless feel-good entertainment. And yes, it has a great plot and tells the fast paced story in a mere 165 pages. But in this case, the total effect is much much more than the sum of its parts.There's the quality of the writing first of all. The words run across the page with searing intensity, pulling the reader into a world that feels real and creepy. It pulsates with its theme, which is of fire and firemen and the cruel act of destroying books. It's intelligent and literate and uses some direct quotes from revered thinkers. And then there are some parts that were so humorous that I laughed out loud. Every line resonates with tension. It is a wonderful tale. And, to top it all off, it is optimistic.One of the joys of reading this book is that we have the hindsight of understanding it was written in 1950. The author has that that hindsight as well, and there are an additional 23 pages in the paperback edition, written by the author more than 50 years later. These few pages add dimension to an already complete book and should not be missed. I have no doubt that Fahrenheit 451 is now seared in my mind as being one of the finest books I've every read. It gets my highest recommendation. Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is, in my opinion, Bradbury's absolute best. Bradbury's excellent prose allowed some of his novels to escape the \\"science fiction ghetto\\" and surely this is one book that made the jump over the barbed wire.The plot is simple but shocking; books are dangerous to a trivial and controlling culture--therefore, burn them. Without books, there can be no memory of how things were or should be. Montag is a fireman who's job is, of course, to start fires and create bonfires of contraband books. His wife is absolutely shallow and \\"normal\\"--she watches the daily soaps on TV, which in this futuristic society are full wall-sized plasma screens. She nags Montag to earn more so she can install a fourth screen and surround the room with the escape from reality. Even some part of her, however, senses the bleakness of the world, and witlessly tries to escape in an overdose of drugs.Montag is dedicated in his work, but perhaps his investigative nature leads him into the world of the contraband book-hoarders. What drives a man to leap upon a funeral pyre of his library? A shaken Montag must find out.Bradbury sketches the frightening world of a society with non-readers and non-thinkers, dumbed down by design. What did he see in the 50's that we are just realizing today? He was not only amazingly prescient in his description of wall-sized flatscreen TV, but in the trend to a world where education, reading, and reason are being made extinct, if not downright subversive. Read this novel and marvel at Bradbury's chilling insights."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book for a number of reasons: Enter the protagonist, Guy Montag. Montag has been a firefighter for 10 years and has always loved his job...as a fireman of the future, he sets fires to houses instead of putting them out. The reader learns from the back cover that Montag has never questioned his duties &amp; has always loved the thrill of a midnight run. However, a mere three or four pages into the book, Montag meets a free thinking seventeen year old girl who makes him realize that he has wasted the last ten years of his life. The reader never gets the sense that Montag was ever really serious about his job...we have to assume he was simply because the back cover says so. So, in a matter of about four days, this seventeen year old girl (Clarisse) has managed to turn ten years of Montag's beliefs upside down. This might not be so unrealistic if Montag &amp; Clarisse had become involved in a meaningful exchange of ideas but, as it stands, their longest conversation lasted only two minutes. A bit too far fetched for me. Then one day Clarisse disappears &amp; we never hear from her again. We get an &quot;explaination&quot; from Montag's wife, but it is just a theory...we never really know for sure what happened to her, leaving the reader to constantly wonder about her. No satisfactory answers are ever given. Nonetheless, she apparently had a profound impact on Montag because she fuels him throughout the rest of the novel. It's just a little hard for me to believe that 8 minutes of one-sided conversations from a 17 year old could change 10 years of beliefs.The book never gets any better. Montag goes on to meet an old English professor who just happens to share Clarisse's beliefs. What happens between them is, in my opinion, just as unbelievable as what happened between Montag &amp; Clarisse. I realize this is &quot;science fiction&quot; and a lot of it is supposed to be far-fetched, but very little of this book could actually be considered science fiction...perhaps the robotic dogs, wall to wall television and those little green ear bullets are science fiction, but not too much more. I found the characters to be more unrealistic than any of the fancy, technological advances of the future.But, I will say this about the book: I couldn't wait to finish it...not because it was an exciting page turner, but because it is a short book and I knew I would be through with it fairly quickly, even though the temptation to just stop reading it was there."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I give Fahrenheit 451 five stars because it is very interesting and pulls the reader into the life of Guy Montag, the main character and narrator. Ray Bradbury uses great imagery in this book so that the reader can picture exactly what Montag sees. Another thing that makes this book so great are the ideas that we take for granted such as thinking. In this book there are very few people who can think for themselves. It also makes you question things like, if there were no book would people still be able to think for on there own? This is a really great book.In this book you will read about a society that is very different from our own. This society takes place in the future. All the houses there are fire proof making firemen obsolete for their old job. There the firemen start fires instead of putting them out. Instead of using water they now use kerosene. Their job is to burn books and the houses they are in as soon as they are found. They follow strict rules which are1. Answer the alarm swiftly, 2. Start the fire swiftly, 3. Burn everything, 4. Report back to firehouse immediately, and 5. Stand alert for other alarms. According to them the first firehouse was built in 1790 to burn books. The first fireman was Benjamin Franklin. All books are banned from everyone. Being caught with a book is a punishable offense.This was Montag's job. He never questioned why he burned them or anything else in his life. Until he meet a girl named Clarisse McClellan who helped him start to think for himself. She asked him questions he never thought of before such as if he was happy and she pointed things out that he never noticed like how the billboards got longer because the cars got faster. All these new realizations helped Montag open his mind to start thinking and opened his eyes to what the government was doing.Clarisse spends her days outside exploring her environment and thinking about how strange the world is. She does not go to school because people think of her as anti-social when she just has a different idea of what being social is. Montag sees her doing some of the most peculiar things such as shaking a walnut tree or knitting a blue sweater. He saw her outside one day in the rain and she explained that she loved the way the rain tasted. Montag had never thought about how rain tasted and that day on the way to work he tilted his head back and opened his mouth to taste the rain. This was not the only time she told Montag something that got him thinking. One morning when they were talking and she told him she thinks dry leaves smell like cinnamon. Her odd revelations to him helped him think more and more.Montag starts to question all the people around him but mostly his wife, Mildred. She does nothing all day except watch her three-wall TV. He realizes he does not truly love her because he does not really know her at all. One night Mildred has two friends over to watch the three-wall TV. Montag listens to there conversation. They were talking about the up coming war and one woman said that her husband is in the army. She talked about how her husband might die but its okay because it's the third marriage for both of them and she won't have ant trouble getting over it. This shows Montag that people are incapable of feeling also. They can't think or feel they just live life and care only of themselves.Another person that helps Montag to start to think and question authority was an old professor called Faber. Montag had met Faber in a park a long time ago and Montag decides to call and then visit him. Faber tells him of a time when people read books and were not afraid of being caught with them. Faber lost his job as a professor when one year he came back to teach and only one student had signed up for the coarse. Faber thinks of himself as a coward because he loves book and believes that they should not be banned but he does not do anything to stop it. He was there when books were being banned and he said nothing because he was afraid. But Faber's compassion and wisdom give Montag courage. Faber stays in his house all the time and creates new inventions. One invention is a little speaker you put in your ear so you can talk to someone. Montag and Faber use this to there advantage.These characters help Montag a lot through out the book. If it were not for them Montag would have never started to realize what he has to do. He must change the society in some way but how? He is only one man. It all starts when he confronts his fire chief, Beatty. But to find out what happens read Fahrenheit 451. This book is a page-turner and you won't want to put it down."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It is ironic that Ray Bradbury's dystopian classic about the horrors of censorship has been on and off various \\"banned books\\" lists pretty much from the time it first appeared. That alone should be enough to pique one's interest. \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" tells the story of Guy Montag, a fireman. He doesn't fight fires - he starts them, in order to destroy books and any buildings that conceal them. He's happy with his job and always has been. But an unexpected series of events causes Montag to begin questioning the things he has hitherto accepted as undisputable. First he sees a woman burned alive in her home when she refuses to surrender her books. Then, Montag meets two people who expose him to ideas he has never before considered - one is a young girl, a new neighbor who proclaims herself \\"seventeen and crazy,\\" and the other is an aging professor with memories of a time before...When I first read the book over a year ago, I paid attention mostly to the plot alone, did not give the book as much thought as I should have, and therefore was not particularly struck by it. Re-reading it a few weeks prior to writing this, I concentrated more on the underlying themes of the book and gained a greater appreciation for Bradbury's creation. Originally written in 1950 as a short story entitled \\"The Fire Man\\" and taking it's final, full-length form in 1953, \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is just as relevant today as when Bradbury first composed it at the cost of a dime an hour in the basement typing room of the UCLA library. It takes a head-on look at the ways in which censorship dulls the mind and seeks to undermine independent thought.The form of censorship we encounter in \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" is not the same type of thought control found in books like \\"1984\\" by Orwell. In a way, it is even more insidious. There is no Big Brother figure trying to manipulate the minds of the people. Rather, books are taboo because the people themselves don't want them. The general public has lost all interest in reading. And no one wants that interest revived. Instead, people spend their days in front of enormous, wall-filling television screens. When Bradbury wrote the book, television culture was still in its earlier stages, so the novel shows great prescience when compared with the world of today. Now there are televisions in every home. Televisions are baby sitters, time fillers, background noise. When we're bored, we just turn on the TV and let the real world fade into the back of our minds.In \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" we see this overwhelming dependence on television highlighted as a form of escapism from the reality of the world. Montag's wife spends every waking moment watching \\"the family\\" on the walls of the parlor. If Montag suggests that she do anything else, or even turn the volume down, she becomes distraught. She is literally lost without the world on the screen. It provides an insulation to cushion her mind from facing the darker things that hover just beneath the surface. And Mildred's repeated sleeping pill overdoses are evidence that such darker, depressing thoughts really do await her if she ever stops to ponder the world in which she exists, and just how lacking in substance it has become. In fact, the frequent references to other citizens' suicide attempts give us a clue to the very widespread nature of the problem.These are all things well worth contemplating in today's world. Fewer and fewer people take the time to read nowadays. News can be obtained via television or, as is increasingy more common, via the Internet. Entertainment can be had in the form of movies, video games, and the like. And of those that still do read, simple throwaway novels are becoming keen competition for the classics and other books of real substance. The incidence of depression in our society is increasing rapidly. People are constantly looking for ways to escape the world and to avoid having to think about it.Bradbury's book addresses all these issues and forces the reader to consider where our culture may be headed. Additional insight into the author's thoughts about and struggles against censorship can be gained by reading the Coda and the Afterword at the end, appended to the novel in 1979 and 1982 respectively. In these short passages Bradbury reveals the processes that went into the creation of \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and the incidents that inspired and shaped it. He also gives us a heavy dose of irony by relating just how frequently others have sought to censor this very book. Admirably, he has turned down every such request, even at the cost of lost business, and \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" remains unaltered from it's original form. The story itself is short, simply written, and can be read quite quickly and easily. But it is worth considerable attention and thought, and deserves to be read by all."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"After reading this book several times, much is to be said. Fahrenheit 451 offers much more than a usual science fiction classic; it's incredible detail. Just by reading the first page, you will be captured. At points, I honestly could not put the book down, nor look away. The characters all differ so much, and a fine contrast is established between Montag and the Firemen within the first few chapters. Needless to say, Clarisse must be one of the most riveting, and unique characters of all time. This book is well worth the read. An easy 5 star."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The concept of burning books because they are outlawed is interesting. Bradbury presents a vivid picture of the reality his mind conjures. I enjoy reading this book a lot."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Hehehe. Oh you poor, poor liddle high schoolers who can't stand this book. I read it in 8th grade (last year) and I really liked it. Sure, it's a little hard to follow, but there's something there. Its insightful and intriguing. A real page turner. I think the only reason you guys are whining about it are cause you are being forced to read it and don't want to. Oh well, such is life. I read it cause I wanted to. You can whine and complain and trash on this book all you like, but I say its a very good peice of literature."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book showed the how people con come out of hand and that you should think for ourselvs. I like this book,but some people this story is not for."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I would say that this book deserves 5 stars. It certainly would be one of my favorite books. The way that Ray Bradbury describes all the gruesome details is suprisingly realistic, and I could easily paint a picture in my mind for every scene."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I loved this book. As a well-rounded citizen who has been subject to almost everything, I thought this book was well written and well thought out. Like most of the other readers of this book I had to read this in school, but I was immediately drawn in by Bradbury's estimations of what the future will be like (note this book was written in the early 1950's). His imagination and creativity were so real; some of the devices in the book have since been invented. What a cool thing for Bradbury to more-or-less guess what the future is going to be like and then have some of his guesses come true. I would deeply encourage all literate people to read this book; who knows how close Bradbury's other ideas of the future are?"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This novel is truly a work of art. It has mastered the art of allusion and metaphor. We had to read this book for College Prep. English (10th grade) and I was very disappointed at first. Then I went back and started over and read it slowly so I would understand it fully. As I read back through the pages, it seemed like a totally different book. I hung on the natural similies and metaphors, and couldn't believe how correct Bradbury was in placing our future. To those who &quot;just don't get it&quot; I say I'm dreadfully sorry. It's a pity that you wasted your time, not actually reading the best book ever written! I hope that you will give it another chance and that you will understand that this is a literary work of art!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 was definitely a decent novel. The loose ends left by Bradbury were overwhelmed by the extraordinary content and fascinating prophecies. While Bradbury wrote this novel in the early 50's, he was still able to capture the essence of what would seem to be our misfortune in the future. Although he could have spent more time developing the characters, Bradbury does a wonderful job of establishing the plot. It was not hard to picture the details and the setting in this story, as they seemed to come alive. The suspense in the book was tremendous and managed to keep you on your toes throughout the book. For all of these reasons, we believe that 451 is definitely worth reading and will stay a classroom favorite for years to come."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"trulely one of the most fantastic books ever written. it pulls you into the book like no other. i could not put it down.if you havent read any ray bradbury, start with this one. but read the others too."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Imagine what tomorrow will be like without books, a time when books are condidered extremely malevolent and a time when firemen's jobs are not to put down fire but to start fire. This is what Montag, our main character does.This book tells of Montag's gradual realization of the superficialness around him and encounters the very taboo that he was told to destroy. Montag soon realizes that books were not only not evil, but a precious thing that needed to be saved. We see Montag's progression in this book, from the girl he met on the street, who said that she was \\"tasting the rain\\" to his wife, whose only interests were watching TV and hangs out with other friends of hers. Montag came to conflict with his society as he finally rejects it altogether. Eventually he did something that no one would think of. And that something may just be the path to save knowledge."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book is a classic. I first read it over 30 years ago and the issues raised are just as pertinent today as they were then.The book was first published in the early 1950s, at a time when censorship and control were also topical issues. The world depicted by Bradbury is, to some extent, a reality for some. Not necessarily because of technology but because once people stop thinking, questioning and creating they have surrendered at least some sense of self.On one level, this book can be read as 'straight' science fiction. On another level, it can be read as social commentary.You decide.Highly recommended.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Ray Bradbury, one of the most celebrated authors of all time, paints a very frightening and vivid picture of what life would be like if we were not allowed to read books. In this futuristic society, firemen do not put out fires - they start them.Fahrenheit 451 has survived the test of time. Although written in 1953 about an advanced society that is threatened by the imagination and the knowledge that can be gained from reading, decades later this book still parallels some of the struggles that we must face in society every day. Fahrenheit 451 is a classic tale of censorship and the harm that it can cause when man is forced to take on his own battle between knowledge and ignorance.Guy Montag has been a fireman for 10 years and considers himself to be relatively happy with his career and the way he has chosen to live his life. He has never questioned the ritual burning of books, the constant television watching or the rules set by government and society.This all changes when Montag meets Clarisse - a 17-year-old girl who is fascinated with books and the sacred art of reading. She tells Montag of a time when books were not burned, and firemen were hired to save homes and lives from fire - not to start the fire themselves. Even though Montag knows that reading is illegal, he cannot help but be drawn to the passion that books bring to the people that read them secretly.After Clarisse mysteriously disappears, Montag takes a deep look at himself. He begins to question his actions, society and happiness. Struggling with following his own morals yet still obeying the laws, Montag finds himself caught in a web of confusion. His descent from society begins with hiding books in his home, but before long he is running away with a group of outlaws that have made it their mission to memorize books in order to prevent future generations from missing out on knowledge and the stories of mankind's journeys through time.Fahrenheit 451 is a must-read book - definitely one of the best Bradbury books that you will ever get your hands on. This tale of irony, censorship and societal constraints will follow generations for years to come until one day they too are faced with challenges not much different than this one."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In Farenheit 451 (the temperature at which paper burns, says the prologue), Guy Montag is a \\"fireman\\" whose job it is to burn books, and any building and/or people associated with the crime. After an old woman commits suicide by lighting her own house on fire instead of escaping and allowing her books to burn, Montag has a crisis of faith. He's always believed in the rightness of his cause, but now is not so sure. So he pockets a few books and takes them home. He tries to read poetry to his wife, to disasterous effect. Montag has to make a choice - the life he knew or a life (possibly very short) of scholarship where books supply the grist for the intellect.Although the story is putatively about book-burning, censorship, and propoganda, that is just the surface story. Bradbury paints an eerily prophetic picture of a land so in love with its own happines (and leisure) that no one wants to rock the boat. Deceased relative are not grieved. Whatever grief is present is drowned out by the cacophany of ever-present televisions, advertisements, and catchy tunes. Keep the plebes disctracted and they'll let you get away with anything! There is also some wicked social commentary on the lack of accountability in society, which is even more apparent today than when the book was written.Often, when one finally gets around to reading a modern classic like Farenheit 451, one is dissappointed. Not so with this book - the action is exciting, the resolution is satisfying (if dystopic), and the philosophical debates between the characters is interesting. At less than 250 pages, it is a quick read, but this is one classic that every science fiction fan will enjoy."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book Fahrenheit 451, by Ray Bradbury, is about a fireman named Guy Montag. In his world, firemen started fires to burn books-as both their job and for their own pleasure. He lived what he thought was a picture-perfect life, and never questioned why they burned books or the way society was. When he met a seventeen-year-old girl named Clarisse McClellan, his life changed forever. After she mysteriously disappears, Guy sought the assistance of an old professor named Faber, who helped him examine the past, and what their society has become in the present. He began to question society and the censorship of ideas that surrounded the world that he lived in. Guy had to decide what he needed to do to change all of it.When I originally began reading this book, I found it confusing and a little hard to follow because of its futuristic setting and characters. However, as I got farther into the book, it became easier to understand the story line and the plot. Even though he wrote it in 1953, Ray Bradbury makes outstanding points in his book about the messages that society and the media sends to us even today. No matter how convincing they may be, it is only the truth that matters. This book opened my eyes to many questions about the way we live today, and how we can move to modify the \\"Ignorance is bliss\\" idea in which many people live today."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury is an innovative and awesomely prescient look at the \`future,' which is for us now the past. As I read it, I could draw quite a few similarities between Montag's desensitized and ignorant society and our own, or at least the direction ours seems to be heading. As in Montag's world, we seek convenience above all things rather than overcoming our obstacles and learning from our mistakes. I would go so far as to say that today; literature is slowly dying out just as newspaper journalism is, because there are more convenient ways to get our entertainment and news. However, such practices bring us closer and closer to a world where citizens are merely cattle as long as they are entertained, like in Fahrenheit 451. I also thoroughly enjoy Bradbury's writing style, how he conveys Montag's loneliness as he is realizing the plight of humanity and cannot tell his wife, indeed he doesn't even know if he loves his wife, he can't remember where they met. Montag changes from complete bliss in ignorance, to a willingness to give everything to enlighten the rest of the people, as he was. Bradbury is not flowery with his descriptions, but I think he gets the feeling across which is the most important thing since no matter what the description, we are the ones forming the mental picture. The issue of censorship is addressed on an extreme scale by this book, but still one cannot help drawing comparisons to now, and how easily it is to see it progressing from here to there. This book is a classic, and unlike some with such lofty titles, it is most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Having met and seen Mr. Bradbury speak in person in the very location where he wrote this book out on type-writer, the Powell Library at UCLA, I have tremendous respect and admiration for the message this novel conveys. Serving as a warning to the intellectual and knowledge seekers, Guy Montage's search for information and logic is heroic considering the political repression present in his society. One of the pre-eminent beacons promoting freedom of speach and the free exchange of information, this novel continues to serve as a guideline and reminder of the importance of the open exchange of ideas. In a society where many governments and religious regimes seek to curtail information flow, this is a message of the necessary pro-activeness and vigilance necessary to preserve the Alexandria library of modern civilization, the printed word."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The reason that Fahrenheit 451 is such a great book can be a hard one to pin down, though the fact that it is goes without question.It is the story of a fireman, Guy Montag, who faces a crisis when he begins to question his whole way of life after a chance encounter with a young woman on his street. After this first, casual meeting, he begins to re-examine his relationship with his wife in contrast to the familiar, warm relationship that the girl has with her family- instead of this loving type of exchange, Guy finds that his closest relation, his wife, spends all day with the three-walled 'family' that barks constantly at her from a script, but that never bothers to actually say anything. From these estranged roots, Guy turns to look at the thing that he is destroying and that he has been taught to hate- books. This curiosity gets him into trouble quickly, forcing him out of the life that he knows and into one of panic, flight, and eventual banishment...though even this is a blessing in disguise.The novel works from the basis of a phenomenon that has occurred in literature in recent years- that of the utopia gone bad, something that Thomas Moore never could have imagined. In this growing canon of literature you will find such venerable titles as '1984', 'We', 'Anthem', and 'Brave New World'...what separates 451 from these is it's focus on the specific problem of entertainment as a venue to the masses. What happens when the government controls our books, our television, our inputs? What happens when we close our minds off to literature because it is going to offend someone, somewhere? What happens when we become so PC that we burn 'The Merchant of Venice' because it might offend Jews, 'Roots' because it might make whites look bad, and 'Huckleberry Finn' because it might make blacks uncomfortable?Bradbury attempts to answer this question, albeit indirectly- true, no one can be offended if these things are removed, but neither can anyone learn and grow. Life, civilization, everything- it all becomes stagnant, sliding slowly away to meaningless interactions that amount to nothing. Bradbury does not tell us that our point is to go around offending but rather that in order to function, we must push one another. Life, love, happiness...none of these happen without passion, fire, intensity...all of those emotions which flow might step on someone's toes, true, but they are necessary to be human.The novel tackles this with an unforgiving brutal bent to those who would censor and suppress anything that might make a person think. Captain Beatty is the epitome of the problem, though even in his final thoughts he seems to be full of a sort of self-loathing. This character, along with several others, leads the reader to examine the different sides of the issue at hand, trying to discern which approach is most appropriate.In doing this Bradbury achieves what the intent of the novel is- to make us think about and examine our own views on what art (specifically literature, but it can be generalized) is and what place it has in society. Should it be censored? Should it be controlled (as in Plato's \`Republic')?The fact that the novel encourages these questions in such a short span (a little over 100 pages) is a testament to Ray Bradbury's brilliance as a novelist...it is also the reason that you, the potential reader, should make sure to pick up a copy and tear through it (it can be finished in a single day, easily). By doing so, you will be facing what are still very relevant problems in our modern day and time.Bottom line: this book is considered a modern classic for good reason. It has all the elements- ideas, execution, style, substance- and should not be missed.-LP"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Bradbury's best; A non-stop look at the supreme ignorance that comes with totalitarian regimes. A dystopia like BNW and 1984, this dystopia is littered with awesome similes, startling paralles, and absurd contradictions such as firemen who light fires, instead of putting them out. Whether your of Liberal mentality (Michael Moore took his bush-bashing doc title from this book.) Or if your of a Conservative mentality, (this book gives a great account of what true conservatism is all about.) The story is prophetic, and will manifest itself in America now or later. Just like G.Orwell's Big Brother has now manifested itself through the Patriot Act. This book is a must read, and if you don't like it, well, you can always burn it!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"The book definitely has great ideas to revolve around, and ever since I've heard about the burning of books, I thought it was worthy of reading and I placed some expectations that were all met. I wanted it to be exciting, and it definitely was. I also found this book to have less boring scenes (there are boring scences to every book, and we can't deny that) than many other great books - this book is short, but it is to the point, which is one of the many reasons to love this book. While \\"1984\\" by George Orwell is a great book, it took more than a hundred pages to set up, which I found to be a drag.I cannot say what the biggest strength in the novel is - there are lots of strengths. I like how the author doesn't mention what city they are in; that way, everyone can relate to it a little more. He doesn't set it in Los Angeles or New York (though for all we know, it could be), because he wants to imply that every place is like this - in other words, it could be your city that they are living in. He does this to create a better microcosm of the world. Also, the idea of book burning is one of the greatest ever, as it shows how a society denies knowledge and chooses to go with ignorance instead. The biggest weaknesses in this novel is that it is hurried at times. I think Clarisse McClellan dies too fast, and it would have been better if they had had a bigger relationship. Also, the ending is abrupt. Then again, that is his style. In his short story \\"Frost and Fire\\" the ending is also abrupt. However, he has a great way of making people relate to his stories, even though they might be science fiction. In the future, I probably will read another one of his books.This is a great book, hands down. Go take it out of your library or purchase it and read it. It will only take you a matter of days (in fact you can even read it in one day). With a great theme dealing with censorship, along with everything else that is great about the book, this should be a \\"must read\\"."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Fahrenheit 451 thoughtfully portrays the need for knowledge in society.

Word of caution: if you don't get into it by the 100 or so page you won't be able to contemplate the whole book. Also, you have to hang in there cause the book doesn't start out quick, those with patience will prevail."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I m in page 56 of fahrenheit 451.

I'm really glad my teacher gave me this assinment!"},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"It's the temperature at which paper burns said the first page of the book and I knew it having read it earlier, and yet I chose this book to be re-read. It has only instilled my faith further in the power of words and what can they do. Writers such as Bradbury and Orwell who have written on the totalitarian society and how a group of people stand and fight it, may be somewhere at some point done the same and that is what which amazes me.I first read this novella (190 pages and yes I am aware that the technical definition would not allow it to be classified it as a novella, however I chose to call it that) when I was 16 and was enthralled by it. Guy Montag's transformation from a fireman who burns books and takes pleasure in it to the one who savors the written word and wants to save books and thereby his soul is brilliant. Bradbury did not dream the future when he wrote Fahrenheit 451, the future actually was here. Right now. Look around you. Aren't we burning books by banning them anyway? I am sure in certain parts of the world people are not at liberty to read (Afghanistan being one such place). I wonder how my life would be if someone were to barge in my house and burn down my books. I would either kill myself or the person in the bargain. It would be the latter in all probability.What I loved about the book this time, is that I understood the layers involved, which I hadn't earlier. It is not only about book censorship, it is about censorship period. The part in the book when Guy is raving mad at a bunch of women who think nothing beyond their husbands and \\"families\\" who can now be viewed on huge TV Screens and how he reads poetry to them and one of the women starts crying. I would like to believe that the tears were for a lost tradition amongst them. That of reading. The joy of thinking. The freedom to speak without editing a word.I can say one thing though - Books can never be extinct. Try as you might. Try hard if you will. Just try."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"[This review is for the paperback \\"50th Anniversary Edition\\" of the novel, which contains special additional essays and an interview which enrich the experience of reading the novel.]I'm not going to recount the plot details since this book should be a part of every book lover's lexicon. (If you have been off of the planet for the past half-century or so, this is a parable, set in the not-too-distant future, about book-burning. But the novel is really about what makes a person an individual. It postulates what people might be willing to give up in order to have \\"peace of mind,\\" and poses material enough for hours of stimulating debate about the real value of independent thought and its importance to society.)This review is simply a friendly nudge for those of you out there who have already read this book once, perhaps when you were quite young, and have not re-visited it. I urge you to do so as soon as possible.I just re-read this incredible novel for the first time in thirty years. I picked it up because my teenage daughter is reading it as an assignment for an English class. I read it in high school, too, and I recall that I enjoyed it. But for some reason I had never re-read it. Bad move on my part. I got so much more out of the book now that I am older and have been in the world for awhile. The novel has aged beautifully. Actually, its insights, in light of our computer age and the changes which are being wrought in publishing and in the education of our children, are astoundingly relevant. This is a novel so current in its political and social re-imaginings that it could have been published last year.I love Bradbury's books. He is a master story teller. HisThe Illustrated Mansits on my nightstand bookshelf right beside a copy of Ring Lardner's short stories,Ring Around the Bases: The Complete Baseball Stories of Ring Lardnerand a copy of F. Scott Fitzgerald's short storys,The Short Stories of F. Scott Fitzgerald-- just in case I need to re-read a wonderful short story or two before sleep comes.But as I said, I had not re-read this particular book in a long time. Not only did this futuristic masterpiece affect me completely differently when I read it again after such a long lapse of time, but I found so many nuances in the book which are just not present in the movieFahrenheit 451(wonderful as the movie is.) I had forgotten how mesmerizing Bradbury's prose is. I had also forgotten that this novel won the National Book Award. It's a treasure, and a novel to be savored periodically throughout one's life.I especially like this edition which mentions on the cover that it was released as the \\"50th Anniversary Edition.\\" Not only does it contain Bradbury's 1979 Coda and 1983 Afterword, but there is an illuminating interview with the author where he discusses his own views about how the book has held up to the passing of the years, his approach to writing in general, how he views the \\"future\\" we are now living which he imagined in the early 1950s, and even what he considers the weaknesses of the movie version of his book.This is great American literature. Please re-read early and often."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"In the book Fahrenheit 451 author Ray Bradbury shows his wisdom and our faults through a character called Guy Montag. The story takes place in the near future and shows a world where history is an unknown blur and books are a contraband that must be burned. The people in charge of burning these so-called \\"contraband items\\" are non other than the worlds firefighters. And of course, one of those brave book burners is Guy Montag.Guy has lived his entire life without questioning it, but all of that changes when Guy meets Clarisse McClean. Clarisse is pretty, young, and very curious. Guy has never met such a girl before. A girl that focuses on love, friendship, and the contents of books, the same books that Guy burns. Guy tries to ignore her but cannot, and when Clarisse dies in an automobile accident, he is left on his own, with his wife and his colleagues being very close-minded.One day on the job Guy is called in to an old grandma's house where she has been keeping books, illegally. Guy tries to convince the lady to get out of the house, before she burns down with it, but she refuses. Before Guy burns down the house he steals a book. Guy is aware that it is illegal but he cannot resist. Guy is determined to read that book. So, he tracks down his old English professor, Faber, who agrees to teach Guy how to read. What will happen to guy? Will he get arrested for holding contraband? Will he get burned? Will he die? Read the book to find out.This book is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It got me questioning my own life. And I started thinking; maybe this really could be the future. The phrase \\"curiosity killed the cat\\" takes on a whole new meaning in this book. It's great for people of all ages and any gender."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I won't quibble with the social importance of \\"Farenheit 451,\\" but I do think the book has limited value as literature. Quite simply, it's well-written only in parts. Some parts are almost laughably weak, in a literary sense.The book gives us a frightening vision of America about 500 years in the future. An unseen, unnamed, unaccountable government has extraordinary control over citizens' lives, and the government perpetuates its power by dulling people's ability to think, remember, and feel. Medical advances don't reduce suffering -- they dull our senses. People are drugged and then saved from their drug overdoses. Similarly, media is used to dull minds, rather than to enlighten. The urban environment where most people live is fast, violent, and dark; and most people have no contact with the natural world. It's our America, extended to extremes.Guy Montag, the main character of Farenheit, is a fireman: this means that he sets fire to books, because books have been banned. He's in an emotionless marriage, and his wife can't even remember when they met. When Montag has second thoughts about what he's doing and about his society, his wife and his boss fight him, and a crisis quickly emerges. Montag must flee in order to survive, and he joins other outcasts in the woods.These are powerful ideas. The problem is with the execution, in some parts. The book starts slowly, and the language of the first 20-30 pages probably tempts many people to put down the book. By the second section, the imagery improves, and the repetition of some themes (books as butterflies, the screaming entertainment walls, black beetles) starts to be powerful. But then, the chase scene in the third section and the meeting with outcasts are both rendered in pretty stiff language. I guess the best that can be said is that the author exercises restraint in his language.My other complaint arises from a few logical gaps. For example, if the government truly has the awesome technology it seems to possess, how could outcasts live in the woods that are just a few miles outside of town? Why would there be woods and farms a few miles outside of town in the first place? Also, what's the meaning of Beatty's ability to quote literature, apparently with gusto: Does he love literature and represent one way to fight against the oppressive society, or is he the fireman chief he seems to be on the surface?In sum, \\"Farenheit 451\\" is an important book. More than 40 years ago, it put into concise form the fears that many people had about the way modern society was heading. It created memorable images of book burnings and mindless, mechanical violence. But the language itself is rarely as evocative as the ideas it relates."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I have known aboutFahrenheit 451for many years, but never picked it up until recently when my daughter brought it home from the school library. She hadn't enjoyed it too much, she said, but some of her friends had. Bradbury, along with Isaac Asimov and a couple of other authors, is an icon of 20th century American science fiction, and this novel offers an excellent display of his prowess. The version I read, published by Ballantine Books, contains an interesting Afterword written by the author in 1982 (the book itself was written in 1953 at a UCLA typing room on typewriters 'which rented out at a dime a half hour'). In it, Bradbury describes the book's c. 1980 adaptation to the stage, in which he further developed certain key characters, namely Clarisse, the mysterious young girl who opens the main character's eyes, and Captain Beatty, the ironically well-read fire chief who is in charge of book burning. Bradbury also mentions changes added by Francois Truffaut, the Director of the film version (seeFahrenheit 451for the DVD). Appropriately enough for a book about an extreme form of censorship, Bradbury notes that he has avoided the temptation to censor his own young self by bringing some of these additions into a revised version of the novel: \\"I don't believe in tampering with any young writer's material, especially when that young writer was once myself.\\" A wise decision, judging from the excellence of the original product."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"Through each page, this book carried with it amazing perspectives that transcend time and generations. In terms of the story independent of everything else, it was not very compelling. However, as a piece of literature trying to paint a vision of what happens when communication is no longer valued either verbally or through the pen, it is a classic."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"This book blows my mind. It says so many things that I've been believing for years (and that's before I read it) about human nature: the tendency of the masses to follow and do what they're told; how easily humans waste their capacity for critical thinking; the difference between pleasure and true joy; the true meaning of freedom. Many people don't search for a deeper meaning to life than what tradition gives them, and that's okay; it's their choice. But when those people assume that everyone is that way, and they start restricting people's freedom because they think it will make everyone happy - well, that's when you get Fahrenheit 451. The character of Millie, especially, strikes me with her utter devotion to meaningless trivialities. We all know a Millie, or two or three. And this book is the story of how Montag discovers he really isn't like Millie at all, even though he thought he was, and how he fights the law and becomes a renegade, just to discover who he really is."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"If ever there is a formula for the perfect novel, 451 has the ingredients. It would be one part science fiction masked in a glaze of poetic impulse, settled on a bed of classic literature soaking up the juices of vast philosophical thought. The burning of books is a horror to any who love the written word and our freedom to dream. It would be our worst nightmare for society to regress to a state of anti-intellectualism so staunch that ideas themselves have become the enemy. Ray Bradbury not only captures our fears in this post nuclear world but also touches upon our often forgotten love for the stories that have captured our hearts. This is a must read for anyone who has ever loved a book."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"By my count, this'll be the 1,218th review for this book on amazon, so what could I possibly say that the other 1,217 haven't?But for those few who dare dig this deep to read: I loved the book. I've read numerous novels and thrillers for fun, and also dabbled in more serious, non-fiction as well (check my profile if you want), but this one book managed to bridge the two meta-genres. In Ray Bradbury's comments he mentions that he wrote the book on typewriters that charged a dime per hour in a university library, driven there by the distractions of two young daughters in his house; as a result (imho) the work comes fast and furious and makes no apologies for failing to artistically create a subtle and symbolic background.The characters are few and the scenes sparse but it is a book that almost says as much in what is left out as what is included. It is also a book that fully describes (even immerses) the reader in this distopian future which only slowly comes to mirror our own. The commentary, like many of the characters, is never explicit, left to the reader to draw their own conclusions. Rather than the spoonfeeding of Animal Farm or even 1984, true motivations and causes are hidden and the reader's own perception of civilization can guide them."},{"Title":"Fahrenheit 451","review":"I don't want to think how many years ago I first read Fahrenheit 451, but it must've been around the same time (1966) that Truffault came out with his horrible cinematic version of the novel. I know this because I remember being unimpressed with both versions (although the movie may've soured me on the book).Re-reading the novel now, I still don't think that it ranks up there with, say, Huxley's Brave New World. But it is an astoundingly prescient vision of the sort of society in which we live: one in which cultural memory and tradition is increasingly replaced by immediate kitsch, in which media is entertainment, reading is a dying practice, immediate gratification the norm, jadedness a perennial hazard, and never-ending war a reality. Social commentators such as Morris Berman and Susan Jacoby have argued for a kind of secular monkdom to try to preserve and pass on the tradition that's quickly sinking beneath the new dark age that's descending, and this isn't at all unlike the anonymous book-memorizing preservers in Fahrenheit 451's moribund society.What does it mean when a culture loses its depth, its memory, its lineage? What does it mean when an entire society is unable, as the character Granger recommends to Montag, to \\"stuff [its] eyes with wonder, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds\\" (p. 140) because it's far too occupied with commerce and kitsch? Bradbury's dystopia invites us to ask ourselves these sorts of questions. We ignore them at our peril."},{"Title":"The Story Of Our Country Every Child Can Read","review":"We are only 6 chapters into this book, but based on those chapters I recommend this book for grade school level children. It is a sweet, but good presentation of American History, although, definitesly NOT politically correct, being nearly a hundred years old. My children enjoy it, and are gaining a basic understanding of the founding of America.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that the author managed to write a chapter about the founding of the southern colonies without ever mentioning slavery, at all, or bound servitude in the north. Perhaps it is a little too sanitized, but that might not be all bad for the age it is aimed at."},{"Title":"The Story Of Our Country Every Child Can Read","review":"The book is a subtle way to introduce the kids to the history of our country.

As such these photos are some of the most tender presentations of small town folk in middle America.

We had someone to photograph us with our Kodak folding camera standing on the courthouse steps.

This is one of the most enjoyable paranormal erotic romances I have read in awhile. I think part of that is due to the characters. Angie is wild; foul-mouthed, funny, strong, crazy and just a terrifically fun lead character. Nik is charming; good-humored, laid-back, sexy, exasperated and an absolute opposite to Angie. The dynamics between Angie and her friends are a hoot! All three of the friends are crazy and vivid characters that you will enjoy reading about. Nik's family dynamics are just as wild, in a laid-back redneck fashion. And when Angie's friends and Nik's family get together, let me just say 'fireworks!' The plot is awesome, original and will have you turning the pages just to find out what happens next, both in regards to the background story and the romance. I will caution readers that the story contains explicit sex, graphic language and strong violence that would not be appropriate for readers under seventeen. Ms. Laurenston has a winner here and I will be hunting for more of this author's work!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I'll start off saying that \\"The Magnus Pack\\" wasn't my favorite series, I continued it cause of the price.I have never been so disappointed with a female lead ever. Her behavior was atrocious..... meeting every person and situation with pure hatred, and violence. If someone was nice to her.... she was a total bitch in return. There was nothing redeeming about her. When she wasn't being a crappy to people, she was being materialistic, shallow. At some point in the book, she made a comment that \\"she knew she had met some of the people at a party. BUT, they weren't interesting enough to remember their names\\" (friends of her supposed best friend). Not to mention the plot never really moved for me. I was pretty much bored through the whole thing, and the sex scenes weren't anything to write home about.So, in the words of our really bad female lead.... This was so NOT interesting enough to want to remember, I can't wait to forget this book, and maybe the whole series. The only reason I finished it was, I didn't have anything else to do while laying in bed with the flu."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Shelly Laurenston is a great author! Strong smart heroines (you don't want to smack upside the head) + Strong sexy alpha males = YUMMY! ALL of her books are great (including the dragon series) and I recommend them ALL!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Ms. Laurenston can certainly write a good story, but these characters are not likable. I disliked the book primarily because the heroine is violent, selfish, and a potty mouth. The author tried to substitute money for class and failed. Except for being good in bed and a fashion snob (if that counts), she has no redeeming qualities. And the hero? Eh, there was soo much potential, most of it unrealized. He really didn't DO anything, everyone else did things around him that he reacted to. He didn't do the kidnapping, he never stood up to the heroine but let her walk all over him, and he couldn't even rescue himself.The action and pace were really good, if a bit random, and really good sex scenes. But that wasn't enough to make me enjoy a story about a low class witch and her doormat hero."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"this is a great story and by far my favorite in the series. Shelly doesn't have any problems writing Nik, the Befuddled Siberian Tiger trying to deal with Angie Santiago. I loved the fact that she played with the whole \\"good old boy southerner\\", I could hear a rich southern drawl rolling off Nik's lips, and as someone who used to live in the south, that was great!Wonderful story and fast, funny dialogue. I highly recommend this to anyone. Go Fetch is also fantastic, although I wasn't to big on Pack Challenge. This author has a lot of talent."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This is the third book in the Magnus Pack series. I found this story to be as good as the other two in the series and for some very similar reasons.I will break this book out and reread it at any given time. It is a great story and has some outstanding characters in it. I thought the lead female was delightful in her \\"I-don't-take-crap-from-anyone\\" attitude and gave as good as she got. The male lead sounded oh so delicious as a big strong \\"hillbilly\\" (lead female's word) tiger shifter.The interactions between the two lead characters were entertaining and hot. I found the snarky sense of humor right up my ally and of course, the story continued the strong relationship between the three girlfriends.I you like a strong sexy female, a tall Texas tiger shifter, some fighting, some raunchy sex, and some dumb brothers? Then I think you would like this story very much. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This was the final book of the Magnus Pack trilliogy. It is necessary to read these books in order to understand the events that are taking place. The main story begins with Sara fighting a pack war that was started by her mother, and finding love in the Magnus Pack. The war comes to a head and climaxes in Here Kitty, Kitty as Angelina falls for a tiger shifter. I have enjoyed the characters through out this series. The women Sara, Miki, and Angelina are truly psychotic and crazy. They grew up together and have been best friends for life. They are flawed, funny and annoying (just like a crazy relative) but endearing. Thank goodness the men in this series have been more on the rational, calm side. This series is a fun light read involving wolf packs, lion prides, tigers and more interacting, fighting wars and finding love."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Nik is one scrumptious shapeshifter and Angie is one badass hottie that leaves him panting. Put them together in a room and the air literally sizzles. I can't remember when I've laughed so much reading a book. And Nik's hillbilly family is one you'll be wanting to adopt, they're that funny. And let me just say the love scenes can only be classed as blisteringly hot. Here Kitty, Kitty is one great way to pass a lazy afternoon."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This is the third (and, as far as I can tell, final) book in the Magnus Pack trilogy, and it centers on Angie and Nik. Nik, and his two brothers, are mesmerized by Angie when Nik (literally) bumps into Angie at the airport. That chance encounter is the basis for the book. When Angie is attacked by a pack of hyenas, Nik's brothers come to her rescue, bringing her all the way back to their home in North Carolina. Angie then has to stay there until her BFF Sara's wolf pack can come from California to get her. Angie stays at Nik's house, and the two drive each other crazy as they do their best to avoid falling in love despite an undeniable attraction.This was my favorite book out of the trilogy. It had some laugh out loud moments, especially Sara's retaliation against Nik for \\"kidnapping\\" Angie in the first place. I loved Nik's family, and I still can't decide who's my favorite hero between Nik and Conall (from Go Fetch, Magnus Pack book 2). As a couple, Angie and Nik were my favorite in this trilogy: two independent people who have to find their way together as a couple.The plot could have been stronger, though: the whole issue of an ongoing war between the wolf pack and the lion pride felt like a distraction, and it was never clear to me how the hyenas fit into the whole thing. It also was never clear to me why Sara was so angry with the tigers: they did save Angie from being killed by hyenas, so why seek revenge (although the revenge was definitely one of the funniest parts of the book). Also, the author should probably stick to writing about geographical areas she knows about (like the east coast and west coast, judging from her bio). Angie keeps talking about \\"the south\\" despite growing up in Texas. Um, Texas IS part of the south. As someone who lives in Atlanta (and has lived in North Carolina and Texas in the past), it felt more stereotypical of southerners than realistic.I loved the damaged yet fiesty characters that Shelly Laurenston created in the Magnus Pack trilogy: ultimately, that's what got me to read all three books, and I'm glad I did. However, the lack of a decent plot and the crudeness of the writing means I won't be reading any more of Laurenston's books, I'm afraid."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Oh My God.

Actually said tigers brothers have not only kidnaped her after saving her from hyenas and dumped her in North Carolina, but they rolled dice to see who would get her. I imagine Nik's brothers are quite the handful. I enjoyed Nik and Angelina's story. He works very hard to get under her skin and between her sheets. It makes for a great romance. I also enjoyed reading Nik's family. When I say Nik's family I am not talking about his Streak (yep tigers do streaks, not packs or prides) his parents and siblings have a large role in this book. I love the mix of humor, erotica, romance, shifters and corny animal jokes that this series gives to us readers. Laurenston has worked this mix very well!Here Kitty Kitty wraps up with all three of the crazy girls together again at Sara's North California home for a big party. I enjoyed reading where the characters from the previous two books have gone in their relationships. This book answers many questions about how the Pack and Pride feud started and who the key players were when it started. This story wraps up in a way that makes it seem like this is the last in the series. Yet it also left some room for more books in maybe a different direction. Nik's sister was mentioned heavily in this book."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"\\"Love this book so much that I have read it more than once.

The sexual tension between Angelina and Nikolai was way to hot."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"while i throughly ejoyed the entire series, this was my favorite. shelly keeps me laughimg out loud and looking forward to her next book."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"\`Here Kitty, Kitty' is the third and final book in Shelly Laurenston's uproariously erotic \`Magnus Pack' paranormal series.In this final instalment Angelina Santiago, best friend to the werewolf Magnus Pack Alpha bitch, is kidnapped and finds herself in the middle of Cat Nation peace negotiations.There has been bad blood between the werewolves and the lion shapeshifters, and when Angelina finds herself about to become kitty litter, some very kind southern shapeshifter gentlemen intervene.The Varislov brothers are tiger shapeshifters, and they can't stop themselves from helping out a pretty lady. . . even if it means kidnapping her across state-lines and possibly incurring the wrath of the Magnus Pack's mean female Alpha.It's up to the eldest Varislov brother, Nik, to smack some sense into his younger brothers. But by the time he learns of their stupid kidnapping scheme, he's already laid his eyes on the beautiful and leggy Angelina Santiago. . .I have loved reading Shelly Laurenston's \`Magnus Pack' trilogy. It's as funny as it is smutty and Laurenston delivers a perfect send-off in \`Here Kitty, Kitty.'Laurenston moves away from the wolf dynamic, and introduces tiger shapeshifters. This is a whole different breed of supernatural with entirely different rules. For one thing tiger males don't mate for life; they procreate as much as possible. Except that the Varislov family had a very unusual tiger upbringing. Their father, Boris, insisted that he only have tiger cubs to one female - his one true love, Natalia. While Natalia was never thrilled with Boris's territorial and abnormally romantic ways, Nik was even less so. . . considered outcasts by the cat community for their father's odd attachment to their mother, Nik has always felt \`defective' and freakish. He's never understood his father's desire to mate with only one female for life. . . until Angelina Santiago saunters into Nik's mansion.Nik can suddenly sympathize with his father's keen attachment for one woman, because Angelina ignites similarly territorial instincts in Nik (despite his previously womanizing ways).These two are hilariously adorable together. Never mind that Angelina is a ballsy female who doesn't enjoy being kidnapped (really, toilet appliances become deadly weapons in her hands!), but Nik is just the man to match her tit for tat.Nik and Angelina have some of the steamiest scenes of the entire \`Magnus Pack' trilogy, and they are deliciously smutty, to say the least.But my favourite aspect of this series has been, hands down, the friendship between Sara, Miki and Angelina. These are some funny females, right here. And in \`Here Kitty, Kitty' the bonds of their friendship is tested and tightened like never before.I have laughed, I have blushed and I have loved Shelly Laurenston's paranormal romance trilogy. She offers up just the right amount of over-the-top hilarity to be simmered with mouth-watering erotica. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I have to say when I first read pack challenge I didn't know what I was in for.

Control seems to be the main aspect of the book and sex. Angelina is in for a ride when she wakes up in North Carolina not wearing nothing and comes face to face with a Tiger that shifts into a man.

This book was fun and funny and sexy as hell!

I would use this dealer again and again!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"[Note: The following review refers to the digital edition of this work.]When we last left Shelly Laurenston's world of shape shifters, Angelina Santiago had just disappeared while on her way to visiting her friends Sara and Miki in California. Her purse, some blood, and a few torn-up hyena shifters had been found outside her shop in Texas, and her friends thought she was dead. Turns out she wasn't dead, just kidnapped by a pair of Siberian tiger shifters from North Carolina. Thinking they were saving her from the hyenas (not knowing Angie, they didn't realize she could hold her own in a fight), they brought her to their brother Nik's estate, where she woke up with a splitting headache, mad as hell.Nik Vorislav, one hunka-hunka Siberian tiger male, certainly didn't want her staying with him! After all, tigers were loners, like most cats, which is why they never associated with the wolf shape shifters, who lived in packs. Love \`em and leave \`em, Nik always said. Of course, this was difficult with human females, they were so clingy. But ... Angie was very decorative. Maybe she'd understand that they could have some fun, then go their separate ways? Maybe not...I think the thing that I like so much about Ms. Laurenston's work is that it is totally irreverent, and off the wall. As in Pack Challenge and Go Fetch!, the first two books in this shape shifter trilogy, the action is extremely physical. The hero and heroine brawl it out like Burton and Taylor in The Taming of the Shrew. In any other universe, Sara, Miki, and Angie would be arrested for assault and battery, but in Ms. Laurenston's shape shifter universe, they're just assertive females holding their own against the wicked hyenas. Although this story could stand alone, you will understand the action much better if you read the two other books first since it is one continuous story.I loved the juxtaposition of Angie's methods of self-defense, and her impeccable sense of style. And I loved the \\"hillbilly\\" family of Siberian tigers, and especially Nik. God, what a sexy, cuddly, mouth-watering man! A wide thread of humor runs through the plot, adding a fillip of laughter to the hot, hot, hot relationship of the hero and heroine. The many sex scenes are graphic, sexy, explicit, sexy, and inspiring - did I mention sexy? Even if you only like the book half as much as I did, you will love it! -- Jean, Fallen Angel Reviews (courtesy of Fallen Angel Reviews)"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This is the first review I have ever written, however, I enjoyed this book so much I wanted to pass along my endorsement. It's not necessary to read Magnus Heat before Here, Kitty, Kitty, but it will help in recognizing characters. There are laugh out loud funny happenings (Angelina as perfect ball-control pitcher)and more than enough steam heat for anyone. The characters are eminently likeable even if slightly twisted. I'm a sucker for the strong leading man who knows that the prickly independent woman just needs someone to love her."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I like the way Shelly Laurenston writes love scenes. She has the talent to make me sweat from the heat coming off the pages. The third Magnus Pack book, \\"Here Kitty, Kitty\\", is no different. My problem with this one is the heroine...I really, really disliked her.Angelina doesn't take crap from anybody; she hands it out instead. She's a mixed-descent American with attitude and the ability to kick butt...even when going up against non-humans. As the only full human left in her triad of friends, she's become something of a target for the hyenas looking to hurt the pack. So when she goes down in a fight and wakes up somewhere strange, she's only a little surprised to discover she's not in the 'lion's den'...this den is for tigers only!Nikolai knew he should never have shown interest in the mouthy broad from the airport. Of course, he never thought his brothers would kidnap her and bring her to his house either. He's knows she'll be trouble, and within 5 minutes of waking up she's knee'd him and cracked a toilet tank lid over his head...guess he was right about the trouble part. So if she's so much trouble, why is he so hot for her?Smoking hot sex alert. But also, nasty, witchy, heroine alert. She seemed to be nasty just because...and that put my back up (hey! at least I didn't say 'put my fur up', or 'rubbed me the wrong way') from the first. Her interactions were hostile to just about everyone in the book, including her friends! This was something I never got over. And Nikolai, hot as he was, wasn't a very intriguing hero for me either. For someone with animal instincts, it sure took him a long time to recognize his feelings for Angelina. He spent most of his time moaning about his family...just not very Alpha for me.So even though I disliked the heroine, and the hero too to a certain extent, I still gave this sucker three stars for the smoking hot sex. Because...it's my review and I can!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I'd like to state I'm not a fashionista, nor am I a purist when it comes to someone's vocabulary; personally I swear like a sailor when the situation warrants it. However, after finishing \\"Here Kitty, Kitty\\" these are the two glaring problems in this novel that drove me up a wall.We're constantly being told by the author that the heroine is an extremely fashionable, well-dressed woman who owns what I'm going to assume is a high-end boutique, even though we're never specifically told this. We're told how she dropped twenty thousand dollars on shoes, dresses, camisoles, skirts, etc. for her to wear while she was in NC and yet what does she stroll around in 90% of the time? Shorts and a t-shirt. And not just normal shorts...jean shorts.A) NO one who knows and wears the designers D&G;, Chanel, and Marc Jacobs would be caught DEAD in jean shorts. B) Jean shorts? Is the author stuck in the 90's?If you're going to spent a fair amount of paragraph space describing, in detail, how fashion-forward the heroine is, then don't immediately contradict yourself by putting her in jean shorts, and t-shirts. I'm pretty sure she also mentioned cut-off jean shorts at one point. Any woman who runs around dressed like that has no room to scoff at chain stores like Old Navy and the GAP, as our esteemed heroine does toward the end of the story.The second glaring error of this work is the language, specifically the over-abundance of swear words. Not only does the heroine drop the F-bomb with alarming regularity, but the hero refers to her at least 10 times as a \`piece of a**'-I'm sorry, but this was just too much. As I stated at the beginning of this review, I've got a bit of my own problem when it comes to swearing but holy-moly, this heroine does not stop. Ever. She actually thinks it's big and bad to run around swearing in nearly every single sentence she utters. If I had this novel in print and took a highlighter to every sentence she vocalized that didn't include f***, or b****, the color would be few and far between.Even better? Our esteemed hero seems to think it's ok! Uh, news flash to everyone who is NOT from the south and is a little unclear on southern hospitality and southern mores: any man who is a southern gentleman would take one look at this girl and think she was white-trash based on the trash spewing from her mouth non-stop. Southern ladies wouldn't say s***, even if they had a mouthful, and southern gentlemen are likewise as courteous. And have you ever noticed how ignorant and immature people sound when they curse non-stop like that? I started this book thinking the hero and heroine were competent business owners and ended it thinking they would be better suited to working at their local Piggly Wiggly...as food baggers.The only redeeming part of this novel was the epilogue. At least then we were able to see what happened with the characters from the first two novels in the series-where they ended up, that they had their HEAs, etc. I am thoroughly disappointed with this novel-the author had an opportunity to create a decent world with interesting characters and completely dropped the ball in the end.On a final note: I'm from North Carolina. \\"Ya'll\\" is plural, it's a conjugation of \`you' and \`all,' meaning-more than one person. There were NUMEROUS times the author used this word interchangeably in place of \`you all' and the appropriate singular use, \`you.' Get it right."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I have just joined this series with this book and it take out with a blast. Angelina Santiago had just disappeared and her friends think she has been killer by a pack of hyena shifters. Well she was attacked but is rescued by or more liked kidnapped by some Siberian tiger shifters from North Carolina. They take her to their brothers house for safe keeping. The problem is he doesn't know this and when he finds out and goes to explain the miss understanding to Angelina she attacked him with a head butt and a toilet seat. She actually breaks his nose.Nik Vorislav, Siberian tiger male, does not want her staying with him. Siberian tigers are loners and its hard enough to keep his family from constantley showing up let along now to have this toliet throwing mad women in his house. But he cant help but be turn on by this fiesty little human in her designer shoes. But the problem with humans are they are so clingy and he cant have that. he wont have that. And yet he cant seem to stop being attracted to her anyway.But now that he has her he has decided he does need to protect her someone is out to kill her and there is some kind of terf war going on in the shifters world. So even tho he doesnt really want to be involved. Involved he is."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I really like the three psycho, female characters in this series, the interaction between them is just so frighteningly, hilarious. The main focus of this book is Angie's kidnapping, her evolving relationship with Nick and the importance of family. I was satisfied with the pace of their relationship; Angie is defiantly her own person and doesn't do anything she doesn't want to. I loved how well Angie got on with Nick's close nit family, including his Grandma and how Nick understood Angie's relationship with her two best friends 'the crazy women'.Who knew a toilet could be used as a weapon?"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"What can be better than a shapeshifting Alpha Male Tiger, beyond loaded ($$) and that dresses to the nines?!? With manners??? I mean, I ask ya! Yummy hawt cheese! Come'n get it! Oh YEAH! Such a great premise for a story and so incredibly enjoyable. Full of humor that leaves ya laughing literally OUT LOUD...light humorous banter and situations. My only gripe is this 'lil sumpin' sumpin' from Texas (Prada wearing, baseball bat totin', Angelina Santiago)...this little cow belle having the audacity to call this shapeshifting Tiger a \\"hillbilly\\"...HAH! All because he's from N.Carolina??? Gimme a friggin' break...

I read the first three Magnus Pack series books in four days. I have yet to read the fourth one. I think series books are the absolute best. I like to get a glimpse of the previous characters. I also love a good love story and these were certainly that. You jump right into the story with no lag time. Ms. Laurenston contributes an added feature that other love/shapeshifter books don't always contain -- laughter. I laughed out loud on a number of scenes. These were three tough ladies dealing with three tough -- and loveable -- men. One scene in this third book caught be completely by surprise. I ride a vanpool to and from work. I was riding home while reading the third book from my Kindle. One of the characters can't dance worth beans and when she started to dance, to the shock of observers, the scene had me laughing until there were tears in my eyes. My fellow passengers didn't know what to make of me. Boy, did I enjoy these books. I wanted seven more of them with the same characters. Thank you, Ms. Laurenston for being able to combine a love story with humor. I'm lining up the rest of your books for an enjoyable read. I wouldn't be surprised if I reread these three within the next few months. Keep writing and I'll keep reading."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This is the third book in a series of books about three friends, and their lives with Shape shifters. Angelina disappeared in the last moments of the previous book (the two books leading up to this are Pack Challenge, and Go Fetch).

Meantime, Angelina's friends don't know what has happened to her and Angelina is wishing, well, for a short time, that maybe the Hyenas had got her after all.Laurensten does a great line in hilarious dialogue, but she is also pretty good on the other stuff.

Either that or go back to the Magnus Pack and place her BFFs in more danger. But she didn't count on the hillbillies making her actually care, nor that her BFFs would take matters into their own hands.Comments:- Paranormal (shape shifters) romance with explicit bedroom scenes.- 6122 kindle locations, 75,579 words (finishes around 96%).- m/f - explicit, reasonably frequent, caring.- The \\"Magnus Pack\\" trilogy has a loose multi-book story arc with the three friends (Sara, Miki and Angelina) getting shifter mates. The trilogy does not need to be read in order, but it is more fun if you do.- \\"Here Kitty, Kitty\\" picks up as Book 2 \\"Go Fetch\\" is completing. The prologue (as with the prologue of \\"Go Fetch\\") has Angelina and Nikolai meeting at the airport. 6 days later, the book proper begins, as Miki is returning to Sara and the Pack after the events in Seattle.- My e-version includes excerpts from \\"The Strength of the Pack\\" by Jorrie Spencer, \\"Half Moon Rising\\" by Margo Lukas, and \\"The Distressing Damsel\\" by Shelly Laurenston.Opinion:Angelina is a Royal B**, and doesn't give a fig who knows it. Her life has had hardships, her BFFs are mated to Wolves and getting on with their lives, and she's not allowed to date Rodeo Clowns (they're on The List). But she has incredible taste in clothes...Laurenston knows how to write a character. And dialogue. And hot sex. And interesting story lines. And Alpha Males who *care* and grow and love. I really love this book. Laurenston has toned the language down after Sara's overwhelming soap-inducing swearing from Book 1, which is a relief, but kept the characters real and enjoyable. It just works on so many levels. And as a reader you are cheering for a HEA, and smiling all the way to the end.The epilogue winds the trilogy up nicely, letting us visit with our friends and know they are getting their HEA. The trilogy itself sets up The World for the following series, with some vague references to future themes (Wolf v Cat v Hyena, for example), and future characters (Van Holtz). But mostly it is self-contained, and thoroughly enjoyable.A highly recommended book, in a recommended series. And to think Laurenston is just getting started!Magnus Pack seriesBook 1 \\"Pack Challenge\\" - Zach and SaraBook 2 \\"Go Fetch\\" - Miki and ConnalBook 3 \\"Here Kitty, Kitty\\" - Angelina and NikolaiBook 3.5 \\"Miss Congeniality\\" - Niles and Irena (in \\"When He Was Bad\\").-CR-"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I liked this story a lot. It is a good ending to the three best friends (Sara, Miki and Angelina).

Ferragamo this, Louis Vuitton that, Gucci on speed dial...gag me with a spoon. *rolls eyes*What I did like a lot was that hillbilly and his kin. They tickled my toes seriously. Between their \\"Naw\\"s and antics, they made this story very entertaining. (I like Southern boys, they make my Yankee heart melt!)Angelina...grew on me. But she wasn't so bad.

The heroine is a seriously strong willed self-motivated entrepreneurial type. She is also used to dealing with werewolves. The hero is an alpha were-tiger. They are both used to getting their own way! And they are both used to being the dominate partner is relationships! Needless to say the rock each others worlds. FUN"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"In the third entry of the Magnus Pack trilogy, Angelina - the fashionista who loves watching men fight over her - has been kidnapped by Siberian tiger shifters after being attacked by hyena shifters and dragged across several state lines, away from her friends (who are her family) AND her wardrobe. And she's not at all sure which of those piss her off more. The bumbling brothers who took her dump her off in the bed of their older brother who is not only the brains of the family outfit, but also the gorgeous hillbilly that sets Angelina's pulse to racing, Nikolai Vorislav.I've really enjoyed the Magnus Pack series and \\"Here Kitty, Kitty\\" doesn't disappoint. Laurenston's got a gift for writing uber-alpha males who are more than matched by uber-kick-ass females, and I have to admit, Angelina and Nik are my favorite pairing in the series. Angelina's not at all a nice girl, but then again, the philandering Nik isn't all that nice, either - together, though, they're fantastic. The fresh look into the cat shifter lifestyle is interesting and very different from the wolf pack we'd been introduced to in \\"Pack Challenge\\" and \\"Go Fetch!\\" on just about every front...as different, in fact, as cats and dogs. Go figure.Laurenston's writing is full of fun and sex and strong characters that make me laugh...and pant...in equal measures. There's not a huge underlying plot, really, and what IS there is a bit on the anemic side. The books are more light reads than in depth urban fantasy, but go in knowing that and enjoy the ride!"},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Warning: This Review contains possible Spoilers!!!This reviewer does not know whether the actual contents contains spoilers as spoilers are different for / to everyone!!! Therefore you have been WARNED!!!Previously at the beginning of \\"Go Fetch!\\" Angelina Santiago accompanies Miki Kendrick to the airport as Miki is finally going to visit Sarah Morrighan. While arguing on their way towards Miki's flight Angelina bumps into this extremely hot guy who seemed to forget about her after their accidental contact.Unfortunately for Angelina, this hot guy's two cute, but looney, brothers took her with them , or was it kidnapped, to North Carolina, when being attacked by hyenas after work. OOPS A Major 2 States crossing faux pas!!!Angelina's a bit unstable after waking up at a strange place, surrounded by hillbillies, retaliating by hitting with a toilet seat (or was it an actual toilet??), throwing baseballs at tigers and making a tiny dent in one's account by all that excess shopping. But hey they deserved it for making her family worry.But their sisters and female cousins need fashion advice and help, which thawed her a bit. Plus the father of Nikolai Vorislav is adorable.I like this book, its witty and funny lines, Angelina being wooed properly by Alek & Ban, Alek and Zach's sister's relationship, too much to mention. Everything's tied up nicely at the end, and if you have read \\"the pride stories\\" you will notice that this time it's the other way around with the tigers coming to visit and eating the wolves out of their house and home.Shelly Laurenston has created a fun world that you can just read about without thinking too much, most relaxing."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"I love Shelly Laurenston's books and first found out about these characters in the book - Go Fetch(book had both of the stories of her 2 best friends-Sara and Miki).Reading this book felt like catching up with the girls and seeing Angelina get a man of her own. I will admit that the 1st time I read the book I was not feeling the attitude of Angelina. She did not come off like this(total Hard Ass and evil) in Go Fetch. It took me some time to warm up to her and her tiger love Nik.I went back and read it again and enjoyed everyone's interaction more this time around. His family is a blast and I love the friendship between Sara,Angelina,and Miki. The bonus for me was seeing them all mature while being in love with their men. The bedroom action is HOT and does not disappoint. This book will have you laughing out loud."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"There is a slight overlap in Go Fetch and Here Kitty, Kitty where we get a 'glimpse' of who is slated for Angelina. This now becomes the full-blown novel HKK.Still as witty and funny as ever. Totally lovable characters old and new. The sense of family is very strong as past characters are brought back and , like comfortable old clothes, settle easily in our minds as we read about Angelina's and Nik's story.Sweet, memorable and another keeper of a book (and author).Save yourself the bother and just buy all three books at once (in hard copy or digital). It's hard to find them in Public Libraries to borrow and you will want to borrow them over and over if you don't get your own copies."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"Be sure and read them in order, enjoyed reading, has great and funny characters.

Angelina is easily as tough as Sara, but not as psycho as Miki. However, she is easily the most foul-mouthed of the three, and that is saying a lot!Laurenston does a good job with her male leads - they are all drop-dead gorgeous and very appealing. Southern tiger-shifter Nikolai Vorislav, aka Nik, is no different.I found it amusing that Angelina was apparently the owner of a successful high-end boutique. I'm not sure how she became successful with that mouth - few customers would frequent a store with an owner that used such language. I also found it amusing that someone who was such a fashionista spent most of her time in tee shirts and blue jean cut-off shorts - when Nik wasn't ripping them off of her, of course. On the other hand, I never understood why sweet, soft-spoken Nik didn't hold Angelina down and wash her mouth out with soap. Oh, yeah - I remember now! Any time he was holding her down, there was much... Well, I can't tell you what. Amazon doesn't allow that kind of language in its reviews - even if it is a direct quote from the book.I have to thank Ms. Laurenston for teaching me that erotica just isn't for me."},{"Title":"Here Kitty, Kitty!","review":"This another funny shifter tale.

It turns out that the travelers have more than their share of secrets. When an accidental death and a murder occur, Inspector Morse suspects that events in the pasts of some of these tourists and their guides are playing a part in present events. (We don't learn Morse's first name until the final book in this fine series.)Dexter's books have a sly, malicious sense of humor and much is said in a tongue in cheek fashion. Morse is a lot of fun for the reader. He's not a happy man, but he is a bright bachelor able to bounce back from adversity as long as he has his booze, his crossword puzzles, his classical music, and an infrequent roll in the hay. He is not willing to take any blame for swallowing all those red herrings put out for him and the reader.The final unraveling of the plot is very complicated, defies common sense and is more ingenious than credible and leaves you wondering if you haven't been taken for a bus ride yourself.As in the classic British mystery this book even has all the suspects gathered together in a meeting with the police inspector ticking off the facts of the case and pointing to the murderer. Readers will learn the title has two meanings. Inspector Morse is a brilliant detective whose bursts of insight sometimes send his investigations off in the wrong direction and sometimes lead to the arrests of innocents. Exculpatory evidence often turns up to prove that he's been too hasty. For these errors he is unapologetic and good at ignoring his mistakes. Sergeant Lewis in this Colin Dexter outing fawns over his boss a great deal and is all to ready to overlook his superior's miscues.The book provides an interesting overview of Oxford and some of its oddities. With this mystery in hand, just hop aboard the bus, have fun, and go along for the ride. You'll have fun as long as you don't object to a supposedly logical man's logic going off track at times."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Inspector Morse occupies the bar of the Randolph Hotel while he investigates the titillating Shelia Williams and the odd disappearance of a priceless jewel.

An excellent read."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Although I figured out why the murder was committed and by whom, I didn't work out how until the end of the book. As usual Morse was knocking back the beer, flirting in his subtle way and actually got a &quot;little&quot;!!! bit friendly with a suspect. A good read."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Dexter's mysteries are so well written, whatever I read next suffers in comparison. I love the word play. The chapter intro quotes are also very clever."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"\\"The Jewel That Was Ours\\" is a 1991 police procedural novel in the Inspector Morse series by Colin Dexter. The genesis of the novel began life as a TV script for the British tellie production of the Morse mysteries. The book is well written though characters are one dimensional. I concur with other reviewers that the book is printed in small type. Also, the letters included from suspects are very hard to read for Medicare age eyes! Dexter is a cut above many authors in the detective genre due to his wit and use of literary quotations throughout the novel.The Plot: A group of wealthy older Americans are on a tour of Great Britain. They visit Oxford University led by tour guide John Ashenden. While in Oxford, Laura Stratton, one of the tourist, is discovered dead of a coronary in her swank hotel room. Her husband Eddie is distraught as are all those in the tour party. In addition to the death of Mrs. Stratton, the famous Wolvercote Tongue is missing. The jewel was to be presented to the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford as a gift from Mrs. Stratton. Her first husband had donated the jewel to the musuem. She is to present it to Dr. Theodore Kemp a noted expert in the field.There follows a murder and a suicide of major characters. Inspector Morse and Sergeant Lewis face a challenging case rife with red herrings and false paths until the case is solved.The plot will move slowly for some readers but kept this reviewer's interest. Once you read a Morse book you will be hooked!Pleasant light reading!"},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"This is a bit of a slog because it really is a parody within a parody wrapped in a mystery with Inspector Morse checking in. The mystery is compelling, but little else is in this Dexter work."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"This review serves the simple purpose of alerting fans of the television series on the significant changes made by the author in the novel to the plot as seen on television. I refuse to give any of these changes away, nor any of the story details, as I detest most Amazon mystery reviewers(not all) as blabbermouthed nincompoops, who call to mind the asinine rabbi on Seinfeld who can't keep a confidence, but insists on blurting out personal information to everyone he meets. A mystery just isn't your average novel - imagine someone describing the ending of the Orient Express in a review? I've actually seen just that! Yet even small touches at the beginning of a great mystery can be spoiled by a clumsy review. With mystery reviews \\"Less definitely is more!\\" And To quote Ninotchka, \\"There will be fewer but better Russians,\\" - let the bodies pile up by themselves in their own good time. Respect not only the dead but the author's efforts at creating surprise! Let a reader enjoy discovering ALL the story.The Jewel That Was Ours trots out a regular steeplechase of suspects, with more various and far more complex interactives than anything possible within the confines of the time constraints the tv show faced. I prefer this version of the story, and disagree with the Kirkus reviewer who seems to find this rather stale beer, as Morse would put it.I also don't agree with complaints about lack of character development -there's certainly far more here when compared to the television version. Fans of highly complicated plots should have a field day here.In sum: quite different and far more complicated than the television version titled \\"The Wolvercote Tongue\\" - so there's no worry of 'already knowing how it turns out.'Note to author - as if he hasn't heard it a thousand times - The American battleship South Dakota was sold for scrap in 1962. Next time, Colin, consult Janes."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Easy reading, and easy for me to imagine since I have seen the Morse shows on PBS. I can see Morse and Lewis in my minds eye."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"This is a good mystery. The characters have real personalities and inter relate to one another in human ways. Morse and Lewis set the stage for interpreting behavior in a rational way, not without humor. It's hard to put down."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Typically wonderful Colin Dexter story. Complex plot line with a minimal number of red herrings. Well worth the read and investment of time."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Warning for Kindle readers: This book contains a long \\"hand-written\\" confession by one of the characters that is extremely small and difficult to read on a Kindle, since it is in the form of a graphic illustration, not text. I would suppose that in the printed book the graphic is larger, taking up about 3 pages. Since reading it is part of following the story, this is frustrating. I could have gotten a magnifying glass to read it, but, hey!The story itself is tedious and basically dull. I guessed the answer to the mystery at the beginning pretty much. Not the most enjoyable of the Inspector Morse books.Also, the portrayal of Americans/Californians is completely off---they are made to be British in their expressions and mannerisms, which makes me wonder if the author has met very many Americans or talked with them at length. The American characters' conversations and turns of phrases read British, not American, which I found irritating. Seems lazy on the part of the author, or at most, not acknowledging that his readers may not be all British."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"John Ashenden is a tour guide. He has a group of Americans from the West Coast. Laura Stratton, one of the guests on this rather expensive tour, dies in an Oxford Hotel. Lewis and Morse are called. The tourists are told about the Wolvercote Buckle, a significant artifact displayed at the Ashmolean. It seems that the dead woman carried a costly jewel with her that belongs with the Wolvercote Tongue. The theft of that jewel is a severe disappointment to a scholar, Theodore Kemp. The remaining plot could have been devised by a Shortz. It is intricate. The format is simple, but exciting."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"One of the best books, but I had a little problem keeping track of all the Americans. It was, however, nice, in a way, to read the case taking place in one area, more... Agatha Christie-like; Sort of confided to on place, instead of scattered all over the place.In closing: It's a good book! Definitely worth reading! Great characters, good ending! Read it!"},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"Featuring a large assortment of characters, most of them Americans on a tour of England, the ninth Inspector Morse mystery is heavy on details and complications and more difficult to follow than most other mysteries in this series. Laura Stratton is on the trip to donate the priceless, bejeweled Wolvercote Tongue to the Ashmolean Museum, which already has the ancient Wolvercote Buckle to which it belongs. Laura's death in her bathroom, the theft of the treasure, the subsequent murder of museum curator Dr. Theodore Kemp, a suicide, and a pedestrian accident in which a woman on the tour is run down by a car provide more than enough turmoil and mystery to keep Inspector Morse, his trusty Sgt. Lewis, and the local police force busy, full-time.Morse must decide whether these events are all related and, if they are, if one person is responsible for all the mayhem. Because of the large cast of characters, there is little opportunity for individual character development, making it more difficult than usual to keep track of the many characters. In addition, some of the tourists, tour agency employees, and Oxford lecturers are having relationships with each other, further complicating the stories. All the characters have alibis. Many will vouch for each other, and those who appear guilty of some parts of a crime could not possibly have committed other parts of the same crime.As Morse becomes frustrated by the complexities, many readers will also become frustrated--with the undeveloped characters, the red herrings, and lack of linear progression in the cases. In the conclusion, Morse draws the tour group together and outlines his case, step by step, telling them (and the reader)about what has happened, instead of showing the action while it is happening. Though Morse solves the case(s), the author keeps the reader at arm's length and prevents him/her from being part of the excitement as the mysteries are solved.Because the development of Morse's character and relationship with Lewis, usually a high point in these novels, is sacrificed to the complexities of the cases, readers new to the series will gain little understanding of these two men and how they work together and apart. One of the most complex novels in the Inspector Morse series, The Jewel That Was Ours is filled with a large number of seemingly interchangeable characters, all of whom have unlimited potential for evil in a plot overly filled with red herrings. n Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"In this book we see a death by natural causes, a suicide, a death by a road accident, and one death by murder. Morse and his wonderful Lewis are left to solve the puzzle which also includes a theft of a very valuable piece of jewellery. I can't stress enough how wonderful this series is! Dexter is a very gifted writer, and the puzzles that he sets are masterpieces. He is a master storyteller who sets a perfect pace and he crafts wonderful characters. I really enjoy seeing these done on film with John Thaw as Morse, but reading the books is really the way to really appreciate the intricacies of each of these books. I'm only sorry that I have only four left to read until the end of the series."},{"Title":"The Jewel That Was ours: An Inspector Morse Mystery","review":"If you like to be kept guessing this is the novel for you.

This book also was not only a good book, but told you about how hard life was in the colonial times. Next to all these things, this book created alot of suspence. At the begining of the book, Kit jumped into the water. It was suspenceful because it never told you if she could swim or not. It made you believe that there was a chance that she could drown.

I thought it was amazing (though my 9 year old only likes it so-so.) While at its heart an age-old story of feeling like you don't fit in and looking for love, The Witch of Blackbird Pond's setting is what made this book so extraordinary for me. It takes place in the late 1600s in the Connecticut Colony (one of the locations is just a few miles from where I grew up). The descriptions of Puritanical life are quite well drawn, and -- as a Native New Englander -- somewhat familiar. I can see how my view of the world has been shaped by my Puritanical New England ancestors. This characterization, more than anything, is probably what made the book so compelling for me (and not surprisingly, not obvious to my daughter).

This one beat them all! I never thought that she could write anything better than the Bronze Bow, but obviously, I was completely mistaken. In fact, this novel replaced my longstanding favorite book, Jane Eyre, as it slowly but surely crept its way up to number 1. I loved it; it's awesome; what else do I need to say?

Elizabeth George Speare's Newberry Award Winning Novel.Throughout popular literature, Historical Fiction is either a delight to some or a horror(quite literally) novel to some. Judging from my past experiences, I'd say I would easily fall into the second category, as most become drab and inconsistent mid-way or partially through. When I was assigned to read 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' for Summer Reading, I took the novel on almost as a challenge and a burden at the same time. Anyways, with its 1958 release, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' received heavy critical acclaim, and even received the prestigious John Newberry Award and an ALA Notable Book Award. So, was 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' a surprisingly good novel, or a hopelessly jumbled mix of words? Read on to find out!Plot-16-Year old Katherine Taylor, fondly known as Kit, has left her dreamy Caribbean home for the dreary Puritan life of rural Connecticut. After her beloved Grandfather's death, the only way she could get away from lustful men(of 50!) and debts was to stow away on the 'Dolphin' for a ride to her Aunt's humble abode. Upon her arrival, she clearly doesn't fit in, as she was accustomed to a laid-back lifestyle, yet once the family brings her in, day in and day out, she works still sundown, and by then she's supposed to listen to lengthy preachings on the Bible. Her new frustrating lifestyle slowly eats away at her, and after she's dismissed from her job as a Dame Teacher, she breaks down and flees to the Green Meadows, a secluded patch of beautiful crops and flowers. There a widowed Quaker named Hannah Tupper finds her and consoles her, and the two quickly become fast friends. As the Summer turns into Winter though, the townspeople quickly become ill, and Hannah Tupper and Kit are accused of bringing a plague into town, or inciting Witchcraft. Kit and Hannah must learn to survive among their Puritan neighbors and overcome adversity, while still being friends.Writing/Opinions/Etc.-Unlike the Amazon Review reads, I DO NOT recommend this novel to anyone under 11 or 12, as they may have a tough time getting through this novel. With that out of the way, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', while being Historical Fiction, actually lets the reader imagine a time and a place unlike ours at all, when Satin dresses were considered unorthedox and Jack-O-Laterns \\"of the devil\\". Speare effectively transports the reader back into the lifestyle and the mindset of the Late 1600's, and following Kit through her troubles is actually surprisingly entertaining and enthralling, and I was positively waiting for what would happen next. Speare, unlike fellow \\"classic\\" writers doesn't bog down her writing and plot with lengthy and unneeded descriptions, likewise focusing on the plot yet using colorful language at the same time. On the down side, the plot is incredibly predictable and (at times) repetitive, but I won't take away any points because I felt this was a great novel for Teens.Overall, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' easily bested my expectations for the novel, and I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed a Historical-Fiction novel. Speare is a good writer and storyteller, and I wouldn't mind reading another novel of hers in the future. Of five Summer Reading novels, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' has BY FAR been the best.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF DRAMA AND ADVENTURE. THIS NOVEL IS SUITABLE FOR ANY AGES(EVEN ADULTS!), BUT I RECOMMEND THE READER BE OVER 10 AS THE WRITING MAY CONFUSE THEM OR BORE THEM. HAPPY READING!Also Recommended-Fighting Ground- AVIHarry Potter And the Goblet of Fire- J.K.

Another sure to be award winner is film and television actress Mary Beth Hurt who presents an exemplary reading of this story of a courageous young girl facing down the prejudices of Puritan New England.An orphan, Kit Tyler has a sense of foreboding as she views the unforgiving shores of Connecticut Colony where she will make her new home. She does have physical shelter but she is very much alone, yearning for the Caribbean Islands where she once lived.Kit finds release in the meadows where she befriends and is befriended by an old Quaker woman known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond.However, Kit's amity with the woman stirs a cauldron of suspicion and recrimination - Kit is accused of witchcraft.This is a well told tale that documents a sad portion of our history.- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Kit Tyler was once a rich girl of Barbados, but upon her grandfather's death, she finds out with a shock that she is penniless. She goes aboard the ship, the Dolphin, heading for Connecticut Colony, and hopes for a better life at her aunt's house. While on the way, she befriends Nat Eaton, the captain's son; John Holbrook, a man planning on becoming a minister; and Prudence, a little girl. When she finally arrives at her destination, she tries hard to fit in with the Puritans, struggling to keep up with her lively cousin, Judith, and her gentle one, Mercy. After a fiasco of accidents in the household and outside, she finds becomes friends with an old Quaker that lives at Blackbird Pond, Hannah, who is said to be a witch. Kit does not believe this, and she keeps on being friends with the old woman. However, the villagers see Kit as a threat to the community, since they do not trust her as being a friend to their witch, and she goes on trial. Just as she thinks there is no hope, Nat Eaton and Prudence save her. However, Kit discovers that she will never fit in with the Puritans, and plan on going on the Dolphin the next time the ship came. Finally, the ship docks, and she goes on it, for what seems to be a much better future.The Witch of Blackbird Pond is an imaginative book. I like it for its originality, its spell bounding detail, and irresistible fantasies. Elizabeth George Speare did an excellent job in creating the characters. I have enjoyed Kit the most, for her difference in nature from the stuffy Puritans and her wild, untamed behavior. I have never really fit in with everyone else, for the same reasons as Kit. She dressed differently, her nature was unique, her feelings awkward to others. I have had those problems too, and I have also done things that others have not the courage to do. Although she lived in a different century, our feelings are uncannily the same.My favorite part of the book was where Kit goes on trial. I know it sounds cruel, but it is so interesting to hear how people react to their own problems and try to blame it on someone else. It's so ridiculous how people think of goats becoming sick and other small problems such as those, and turn them into major disasters performed by a witch. I like the part where Prudence comes in, and stuns her own parents by doing what they had never thought she would be able to do- reading the Bible and writing her own name. Often parents underestimate their children, and their children's power."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books, next to 'Jacob Have I Loved'. It is INCREDIBLY engrossing. The Puritan setting is done in such a believable manner that you are sucked into the story. You can easily imagine yourself to be right there with Kit and enjoy every minute of it. Kit, as a heroine is very likeable and authentic. She begins the story with pride that borders on conceit and ends with a mature and well-tempered strength. Throughout the novel I got a kick from her defiant attitude and spirit. The relationships between all the characters in the story are the heart of the novel. While the mystery and action elements of 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' are well-done and could stand alone (the plot moves along very nicely), it's really the relationship aspects of the novel that appealed to me. I also have to mention that there are moments of fine humor that make me laugh out loud. I can't say that about many other books I've read. I will probably re-read this book many, many times. I think it's unfortunate that students are forced to read this book before they are ready to enjoy it. If you had to read this book for school and found it hard to get through, I would strongly recommend that you give it another shot when you're older. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Elizabeth George Speare managed to make one of the drier, duller eras of American history come alive through the eyes of an independent young woman. \\"Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" is one of the better historical novels, and one that adults and kids alike can appreciate.Kit Tyler has lived a free and luxurious life in Barbados, with her kindly grandfather. When he dies, however, she finds herself essentially penniless and forced to head to New England to live with her aunt and her family. But Connecticut is very different from the sunny island the \\"tropical bird\\" left behind: Bleak, muddy, dreary, and filled with grim Puritans -- including her relatives. Her stern uncle disapproves of Kit's upbringing, her love of books, her flamboyant clothing, and her lack of experience in housework.Kit tries to fit in with the proud, beautiful Judith and quiet crippled Mercy, but she isn't a Puritan and it shows. Her only friend is the sardonic sailer Nat, who alternately irritates and interests her. Then Kit encounters Hannah, a sweet old Quaker woman who lives as an outcast because of her religious beliefs. When rumors of witchcraft start flying, Kit must try to save first Hannah -- and then herself -- from the witch hunters.Without actually time-travelling, nobody can know what it would be like to live among the Puritans. But Speare gives us an approximation -- Kit is smart, witty, tolerant, adventurous and serves as a doormat for no one. She's much closer to a modern teenage girl than to the Puritans, and so her conflicts with her unyielding uncle are very illustrative. Among these are the dislike of non-religious reading, insistence on continuous hard work with only a few interludes of fun, and one memorable scene where Kit tries to give her cousins some of her beautiful clothes -- only to have her uncle explode when he sees them. We also see some demonstrations of how often religious intolerance blinded these people to a person's true nature, giving them a scapegoat for their fear of the unknown. However, it is stressed that while the Puritans were intolerant and rigid, individuals were good underneath it -- such as when Kit's uncle defends her against the witch-hunters.There's a little romance in this book, including a love pentagon worthy of Shakespeare (fortunately matters sort themselves out), and this is one area where Speare stumbles. The love tangles seem a little too contrived. However, she includes a fair number of details on life in New England at that time, but never becomes too engrossed in them that she loses track of the plot. The pace is fairly slow until the witch trials; younger kids may be bored by this, but older ones will not mind so much.Kit is a great heroine -- flawed but always sympathetic, funny and strong, brave and intelligent. Fortunately Speare never falls into the trap of simply transporting a modern girl back in time. Judith, Nat and Hannah are also great supporting characters: Nat is great as the sarcastic but supportive love interest. Hannah is a sweet old woman who is content to live a simple life. And Judith will earn both irritation and liking for her pride and determination. Characters like Mercy and the aunt and uncle are a little less three-dimensional; Mercy never rises from the cliche of the gentle, sweet disabled girl, and the aunt and uncle are a doormat and a tyrant most of the time, although the uncle does rise up with some good moments. Extra love interests William and John are also pretty flat: William is a bit like a brainless puppy panting at Kit's feet, and John is a humorless Biblical scholar. The little girl Prudence and her hideous mother are very good, however, and provide the book with a villain and a young friend for Kit.Don't be put off by the title of \\"Witch\\"--this is an insightful, well-written historical novel with an excellent heroine and a tense storyline. One of the few books that deserved its Newbery."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"When Kit Tyler boarded the Dolphin, a ship that would take her from Barbados to New England, she had no idea what lay in store for her. In the strict puritan community of her relatives, Kit feels alone and out-of-place. Struggling to adapt to life with her Uncle, Aunt and cousins, she is constantly aware of how different she is and finds it difficult to fit in with the ways of the Puritans. Drawn to Blackbird Pond, Kit meets Hannah Tupper, an old woman widely believed to be a witch. Hannah is the only person who understands her, but by associating with her Kit places her own life in danger. In the intensely religious and prejudiced community, Kit is accused of witchcraft and sentenced to stand trial.\\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" is one of the best Young Adult books ever written. I have read it so many times I have lost count and yet it still remains, and always will, one of my all-time favourites. It provides a perfect mix of history, romance, drama and suspense and will keep the reader hooked throughout. The characters of Nat and Kit are brilliantly written, as their initial reserve deepens to friendship and finally something more. When reading this book I was torn between wanting it to last forever and desperation to discover how the story would finish. Beautifully written and filled with vivid characters, you want to The Witch of Blackbird Pond to go on and on and never end. This is an amazing, very unique book that I know I will treasure forever."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a historical fiction book by the great author Elizabeth George Speare, the author of Sign of the Beaver. It is probably one of my favorite historical fiction books. It takes you on a wild ride through 17th century New England. A girl from the tropics spends a year in a colonial puritan town. She is accused of witchcraft, because she associated with an old Quaker woman. Will she convince the judges or will what happened to 19 women and 1 man in Salem happen to her? I particularly liked how the main character, Kit, meets the Quaker woman in the meadow after a confrontation with her uncle, Matthew. At first, she's afraid because she's heard rumors about the Quaker woman being a witch. They become fast friends and together they teach another girl, whose mother thinks she is completely stupid. Reading this book allows you to really feel what it was like for Kit to want to do what was right, even when the people you love are going to be as hurt as you."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I am in the midst of reading this book for about the twelfth time.

When she makes a huge mistake in teaching a dame school, she seeks help in the meadow with the accused witch, Hannah Tupper. She befriends both Hannah and Prudence, an abused child. She teaches this overworked child to read, learn, and love. She falls in love with Nat Eaton, the captain's son. She is accused of being a witch and put to trial. These words can barely describe the brilliance and excitement of this novel, and I will never grow too old to read it!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Book The Witch of Blackbird Pond written by Elizabeth Speare is a wonderful novel. It teaches kids about the lifestyle of the colonisaal people and how one girl survives a major change of lifestyles, from the higher class life to a lower class. Also, I think the book reflects love, friendship, and courage. The book is about a young girl from Barbadoes, Kit, who moves in with her Aunt Rachel and Uncle Mathew in Conneticut. She has to adjust to changes and the lifestyle they live in Conneticut such as working around the house instead of servants doing all the work. Kit meets an old women named Hannah. Her and Hannah grow a strong realationship together, but one thing could break them apart. The town that the two ladies were living in thought Hannah was a witch! Kit was accused also of being a witch because she hung out with Hannah. Kit was sent to trial for this so called &quot;crime&quot; . She was locked up and only hoping that someone would come and save her. Maybe William would come and save her, Maybe Prudence,the girl she had helped to learn how to read and how to write, or nat, maybe even Aunt Rachel. Read the novel to find out what happens. I think this book reflects friendship because Hannah was a great friend to Kit. She was always there when Kit needed comforting of just when she needed to talk. It also reflects friendship when Kit and Prudence became good friends. Kit helped Prudence to learn how to read and how to write. They too where there for eachother when they needed a shoulder to cry on. This book also reflects courage. Kit had to stand up for herself in many places. For example, Kit had to stand up for herself at the witch trials. She had to convince them that she really wasn't a witch. SH ehad to be couragous also when she went to her Aunt Rachels and her Uncle Mathew's house. She had to expect that they would let her in and she couldn't back out after she had gotten on the boat.

Kit dislikes the life of the pilgrim; she finds refuge at the house of an old lady at Blackbird Pond. The book does a great job describing the history of this time period which is probably why it won the award.However, I was seriously disapointed with the story itself.One of the main problems being that there is no plot of which to speak. Kit goes the U.S., nothing else happens, FINALLY, at long last the story ends. Also, while I'm sure the author envisioned Kit as a strong willed character, they do not show it very well; also there really isn't any character development either, unless you count the last three pages.Wondering why I chose to read this if I hated it so much? I didn't choose, it was assigned for school reading.Oh yeah, there is no actual \\"witch\\" of Blackbird Pond (lady, but not witch).

The author, Elizabeth George Speare, could not get all the details in a way that could keep my attention, or my imagination running wild. Towards the middle the author made kit seem like a beauty queen, she had about three guys wanting to court her, John Holbrook liked her on the ship along with Nathaniel Eaton. When she finally got to Wethersfield there was a guy named William Ashby was courting her and came to her house after seeing her in the Meeting (church) and then William asked Kits uncle (Mathew Wood.) Although I do not like how magnificent and marvelous the author made Kit Tyler seem, I did like the two characters Prudence and Mercy. Prudence was a little girl that was not allowed to see or speak to Kit Tyler. Prudence's mother thought that Prudence was a child that was too thick or dense to go to school and learn. Mercy was Kit Tyler's cousin. She was crippled. Mercy was a sweet girl that taught small children how to read in her kitchen. I would not recommend this book.

Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England.

It is categorized as imaginary and it certainly is. There is no truth to it and does NOT represent the times it writes about. It is a pity that young people are being exposed to \\"historical fiction\\" like this.The Puritans were \\"strict\\" people but with loving hearts. They worked hard and had high moral ideals. Their high standards were Bible based. These two facts repulse people today. The Puritans were also well educated people. In fact they had better educations than kids have today! Puritans were \\"prejudiced\\" against sinful behavior as we should all be but we aren't in todays society. The oppposite of this is what is endorsed in our society today. Today what is right is wrong and what is wrong is right. You'll get more of the endorsement of what is wrong is right thourgh reading this book. In the near future, I expect authors like this to be writing about the \\"social justice\\" of Marxism and having kids and adults LOVE it!As an original source historian, it is clear that this author has no knowledge of the time she writes about and is giving kids and \\"adults\\" a false view of history. The book is slow and often boring. The plot is predictable once you realize that the author HATES any form of Christianity. The author is adamant in getting across her lowly opinion of Quakers and Puritans.I am also not surprised the academic LEFT loved it and awarded it the Yearling Newberry - it helps trash America's beginnings and makes them out of be irrational extremists. Unfortunately that is very much in vogue today. So if you have an axe to grind with Christianity, specifically Puritans and Quakers, you'll love this book! It will feed your hatred of those Christians. It was very disappointing and definitely very BIASED with UGLY inaccurate sterotypes.Homeschoolers - pass on this. It's a waste of time.

First of all, the characters are the most boring people in the world. The plot stinks. There barely is a plot. I like books where there is a lot of action and the story mountain has bumps along the way. This book, there is no mountain and they just go on flat ground (just to let you know I'm being metaphoric here) and then go up a little hill. The only reason I actually gave this book a star is because the witch trials and where Kit is running away is kind of suspenseful.

She scorns the virtue and work ethic that give her uncle's family the edge to survive in their harsh colonial environment, shirking her chores and remaining dispirited. Truly, Kit Tyler is a poor example for graciousness, duty, or manners.Time and again, we see Kit run away from her responsibilities, leaving the bulk of the hard work for her lame-in-one-leg cousin. She is too immature to understand the knife's edge her newfound community walks, trying to stave off famine. Only the pitched effort of every able-bodied person can ensure that the crops are planted and tended, the clothing is made and mended, the children are taught to read and write and cipher, the harvest is brought in before the frost. These villagers have no buffer; it is either work now or starve later. Their culture has sprung up as a way to reinforce the discipline and self-control that is needed. Kit is oblivious to these community norms; even the ones that are explained to her she shrugs off as ridiculous.But all is not lost, because there are outsiders in town, and Kit befriends THEM. The service she performs for Hannah and her patient teaching of Prudence make Kit almost likeable. Almost. The townspeople accuse Kit of witchcraft because of her inability to fit in, and finally she realizes the goodness and decency of her uncle's family as they try to shield her from the peril she has brought upon herself.Along the way, Kit gains insight into the beauty of simplicity and order. She feels the exhiliration of the seasonal changes in New England. We rejoice over the love she discovers.Happy ending to a silly book.

The wind, carrying the scent of mint from the fields nearby, would sway the branches, and send me away to the shores of Saybrook Harbor, Conneticut to a world where Kit visited Hannah and fell in love with Nat. It affected me to the point of naming my middle son Nate and also encouraging me to write historical fiction for children myself. How much influence does a writer have over children?

This book is beautiful and touching. You can read the plot synopsis above, but I wanted to add my opinions. I've read about these \\"witch hunts\\". No wonder they suspected Hannah Tupper. No, not because she had a broomstick or cast spells on people, but because she was a Quaker, and she wasn't like the Puritans. And different scares people. The lonely old woman lives by the swamp because she loves the Meadows. She doesn't go to \\"Meeting\\", so they make her pay fines. And then, one chilly night...but you'll have to find that out yourself."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This is a truly wonderful book that I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good story. It's one of those books that you just can't put down once you start reading it.Reading the book gives you a unique appreciation of the people who first came to live in the huge wilderness that would one day become the United States. The characters feel very real and it's easy to appreciate the different view points represented in the story, even the ones you might not agree with.The pacing of the story is perfect. Although there is a lot going on it never feels rushed, and it doesn't linger to get a point across. It's one of those rare books that I didn't feel like jumping to the end of in the middle of the story!Kit is young girl who has led a very priviledged life that to her is completely normal, much like most young people in the United States today. When she is forced to leave that life Kit goes to live with the only relatives she has, the Puritan family of her mother's sister. Their's is a life of hard work and no luxury. Even though Kit hates it at first she eventually comes to appreciate these people who are so different from herself and learns the value of the life they live. But there is also blind cruelty and hatred within the community and when Kit fights against it in her own small way she finds herself in more trouble than she ever imagined.It's just a great little story and I hope everyone who reads it enjoys it as much as I did."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This is definitly one of the best books I have read in a long time. It is the story of a young girl who is coming to America to live with her Aunt and Uncle in a Puritan community. The Girl, Kit, is so outgoing and dressy that the Puritans accuse her of being a witch. This Book has everythiong you could want in it, adventure, romance, history, etc. I give it 5 stars.

Sure, it was OK, but I have read books that are much better. It had parts that I liked to read, but the majority of the book was slow and hard to understand. It might have been better, had the author made less filer and more storyline. I got the key portions of the plot, but it was hard to understand most of the minor characters in the story. The main parts I understood I liked, but during the important parts I usually did not understand what was happening. There are books that are much better, so go and read something else. For the average reader, this is a very hard to understand book that I would not recommend. Basicly, this book had some parts that were good that I enjoyed, but most of the time it was hard to understand. Now, this is my view of the novel, and other people might have a different opinion than I, so if you have read other reviews and choose to read this novel, hey, I'm not stopping you.

I liked the book overall, and it ranks fairly high among the 80 Newbery books I've read, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I had hoped. It was, however, a relatively quick read.Set in pre-Revolutionary Connecticut, this story depicts the struggle between the colonists who wanted to remain loyal to the crown and the new breed of American who felt they deserved the freedom to be independent in a land they had carved out. It also touches upon the issue that every person faces at some point, do we accept people who are different than we are or do we brand them as outcasts?"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Kit Tyler travels to relatives in a strict Puritan town after being orphaned.

The characters in this book are Katherine, Mercy, Rachel, Judith, Kit's uncle and aunt, Hannah, and Nat. The setting took place in a ship called The Dolphin, in Kit's uncle and aunt house, Hannah's house and the Meeting House.I liked this book because it reminds me of the witch trials. Some of the things I didn't like about this book are that it talked a lot about political things and their religion. One part I liked the most was when Kit and Hannah were being accused as witches. Another part I liked was when the little girl thought that her doll was possessed and she threw it out then she wanted it back. The genre of this book is historical fiction."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Speare is a pretty good book. It's very exciting and there is some romance, I don't see why it hasn't been a movie yet. I wouldn't give it the newberry award, it's good but not that phenomenal."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Have you ever read a book that was so good it made you feel youwere going back in time? That is how I felt while I was reading this book about a 16 year old girl who has to move to the unfamiliar Connecticut colony to live with her relatives because her father has died and she has nowhere else to go. Everything is so different from her sunny Carribean home where she has lived most of her life.This book takes place in 1687 in a small town in Connecticut called Weathersfield, a stern puritan community. Kit Tyler, the 16 year old, comes to live with her Aunt and Uncle after her father's death. Even after she settles in to her new life, she starts to feel caged like a bird. She is unhappy and unliked by the townspeople because she acts so differently. For example, she wears expensive silk dresses, knows how to swim and becomes friends with the local witch. She meets the local witch, named Hanna, in the meadows, by the swamp, the only place Kit can feel completely free. Her association with Hanna and the fact that Kit is different form the townspeople cause her to be accused of witchcraft. Can she prove to them she is not guity of witchcraft before it is too late?The reason I like the book was because of the strong, action-filled plot. I also liked reading this book because it had portrayed the time period in which it took place accurately. The book seemed very plausible that a town in those days could panic and accuse a stranger of being a witch. I also liked the book because I liked the main character. Kit is someone that I would like to have met because she is independent, and wants to be accepted for being different. One thing I didn't like was the town's atmosphere. The atmosphere was dark, and strict, and loaded with witch hysteria.I would recommend this book to people who like the genre of historical fiction, and particularly the time period of witchcraft. This book would appeal to those in sixth to eighth grade who are studying this time in American history. This book is more for teenage girls than boys given it female main character and narrator. There is also a love story in the subplot that would appeal to those who like romance. If you have read and liked the novel \\"The Scarlet Letter\\", this is another good book to read.The climax of the story is when the main character is tried for being a witch. This review is not going to give away the outcome of the trial, but it is a strong finish to a well told story that will not disappoint the reader. I guarantee it! The conclusion will leave you feeling that almost anyone could be found guilty of breaking strict traditions in this stern peritian community where this book takes place. Can Kit escape the town's accusations and find happiness in this cold region, so unlike her native home?"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a really neat book because it keeps the reader interested in the book and you can't put it down till you are done.

If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading.

I guess if you're into olden times, witch hunts, arguments, and \\"romance\\" I guess it would be fine, but it wasn't my favorite book.I'll just kinda give you a brief telling of what the book is about.It starts out that a girl named Kit is sailing from Barbados which is in the West Indies and is headed to stay with her Aunt and her family in Wethersfield, Connecticut. Then she just is really outof place. She has different customs and just doesn't fit in. Her uncle isn't glad she's there and neither are other important people in the township. It's kinda just a lot of mishaps and bad things happen to Kit. Then she befriends a \\"witch\\". It's just aboutr her I guess gaining trust and her beginning to fit in.The end was just kinda like \\"blah\\". It's just kinda like Kit falls of the face of the earth, although wshe does live \\"happily ever after\\". As most books do unless they're horrors.I think that i8f you just wanted to relax it wasn't a good book to read because you had to thyink about what you were reading. But I guess if you're uptight and like it in books where it says 'tis all the time and thee I guess TWOULD (he he he) be good for you. But if you want to go to sleep you could read it.

The feel of the time period is pervading, and the book's lure lies in it's unusual storyline and the fast-paced, constantly twisting plot.Kit Tyler is a young girl from Barbados who is orphaned and must leave her paradise to the cold comfort of her Uncle's Puritan farm. She feels out of place, until she discovers the Meadow. She soon becomes fast friends with Hanna, the Quaker woman who lives by Blackbird Pond, and is accused of witchcraft by association.This book is stunning.

This book makes my top ten list!!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This book about a girl adjusting to a new environment is a very warm touching book. If I was Kit, I probably wouldn't have been able to survive going to Lecture, mass, and enduring all the hard work. i felt really sorry for kit because she had to do all the work that her slave used to do. One thing good about that is that she learned to do a lot things during her life in Whethersfield. I think that kit was pretty lucky, however, because she got a lot of support from her &quot;family&quot;. She had found friends that stood by her. She also had proved to others that she was useful. I think that in the end, it was really nice the way it turned out that Judith got to marry William, Mercy with John Holbrok, and Kit with Nat.

Suspense will grow to the unbearable, filling you with emotions: anger, love, sadness, fear, and relief. The old woman, Widow Tupper, was said to be a witch, but she has mysteriously disappeared. And strong rumor has it that sixteen-year-old Kit has taken her place as a witch. And what happens to witches?

I thought it was excellent! The story begins when Kit, an orphan girl from Barbados goes to Connecticut. She lives with her stern aunt and uncle there, and eventually becomes friends with her cousins. At first she has a lot of trouble fitting in. She's not used to hard work and living in a cold climate. She can't wear her old clothes either. Then one day she meets the Quaker widow, Hannah, who lives on the marshes. They become friends and soon she meets up with Nat, the son of the captain of the ship she came on. She winds up going to Hannah's cottage more and more, even though her aunt and uncle have forbade her to because Hannah is thought to be a witch. She becomes friends with Nat and gives secret reading and writing lessons to a neglected little girl. Meanwhile, at home, Kit and her cousins Judith and Mercy are having their own problems. Kit dreams persistantly of going home to Barbados. You sort of have a love triangle with Judith, Mercy and John. Then, a rich young man named William wants to marry Kit. Nat gets caught illuminating William's house with Jack o' lanterns, for obvious reasons to everyone but Kit, and is put in the stocks. It all comes to a head one day when people start accusing Hannah of practising witch-craft on their animals and children. Kit overhears and runs to get Hannah safely away on Nat's ship after the mob burns her house. Later the next day, she is arrested because people think she was the witch's apprentice. How will she escape? Will she see Nat again and mend things between them? And most of all, will she get her happy ending by going back to Barbados, or something much different?

Being the Heiress to your grandfather's sugar cane plantation would mean no work, all play. Life would be great, swimming in the warm waters all day, being free to read one of the many books that your Grandfather owns right? You wouldn't have to clean either, with your many slaves. In most homes in the 1600's, a 16 year old would be expected to perform many tasks like cleaning, sewing, and cooking. This is how Kit Tyler's life was, perfectNever in her life did Kit have to do backbreaking work. She would soon find out what it was like on the other side. Due to an unfortunate situation, Kit is forced to leave her home on the Dolphin, and head toward her aunt Rachel and uncle Mathew's home in Connecticut. Kit, and her cousins Marcy and Judith work all day, doing the work that Kit considered slave's work.Everything Kit did was the wrong thing in this house. She was even stirring the soap wrong! She was forbidden to help a sweet old widow named Hanna Tupper with anything because the woman was a Quaker. Kit had gone to see her anyway. Because of this she was accused of being a witch. Hanna Tupper was also accused of witchcraft, but Kit managed to help her get away from the angry mob. Hanna's home was burnt to the ground, so she went to live with the mother of Kit's friend Nat.For anyone that's wondering why this Book is called The Witch of Blackbird Pond, it's because Hanna Tupper lived at the edge of a pond, Blackbird pond. In my opinion, this is a great book. If you like realistic fiction books, or books that take place long ago, than you will love this book too."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I was looking for good book to send to my sister's children.

This was an inspiration for me to investigate history. I have since gotten my Master's in History. No, I haven't made any money with my degree.

I think it was very heart touching and reflects many peoples lives today. It has life morals and teaches about friendship, courage and love. The book also shows how people lived in Colonial times.Spears did a wonderful job bringing her characters to life. They each had there own personalities and feelings. For instance, Kit was very wise but stubborn throughout the book. She came to America to live with her Aunt and Uncle and was at first rich. She had many fine clothes and could swim. A very different character from Kit would be Matthew Wood. He was very serious about everything and doesn't believe in nonsense such as witches or Hallows Eve. He was also very fierce and political man. He fights and tries to get everyone to do or believe what he does. He sticks to what he believes in and does not give up until he has proved everyone else wrong. For example, he will never change his religion and people against are forbidden from the house.Spears also had a good plot and kept the novel full of suspense and action. It was also very adventurous. In one event, a plague gets the village people angry, causing chaos and a witch-hunt. They go and finding the witch not there burn down her house. Where was the so-called witch? Was she really a nice old lady like Kit made her seem? Who saved her from the village and brought her to a safe place? Read the book and you will know the answers to these suspenseful questions. Another great event was in the courtroom. While burning the house a lady finds a hornbook belonging to Kit with her daughter's name, Prudence on it! In the courtroom, they decide the punishment and if Kit is really a witch. Does her Uncle stick up for her? Will Prudence come help Kit? Did Kit really write the name?I hope that after reading my review on The Witch of Blackbird Pond by Elizabeth George Spear you will read the novel. It taught me lessons on friendship, and bravery. It was filled with happiness, sorrow, and love shared by all of the characters and the reader.

It teaches you about friendship, love, and sticking up for what you believe in. Elizabeth George Speare made the characters very realistic and she made it seem like it was back in the olden days. Like when Kits uncle was furious when he saw his daughters in Kits fancy dresses and he said that they didn't need that stuff. Today almost anyone would be glad to get nice new clothes. Speare also did a wonderful job creating suspense. For example it was very suspenseful when the townspeople were going 2 Hannah's house with the torches because you didn't know if Hannah would be alright or not.

There is also a sweet romance intertwined, which is another reason not to force it on kids too young, when most are still in their \\"cooties\\" phase.

She had to contribute to their family farm. This is very hard for Kit because she is used to having slaves do all of her work for her. I don't really know what it is like to have chores like hers but I do know that change is very hard. After a few weeks Kit feels unwanted and as if she can't do anything right. One day, she meets an old woman. Kit's aunt and uncle tell her never to go back. The people in the town believe she is a witch. Kit disobeys her uncle and goes back to the old woman. A disease descends on the town and the town accuses the old woman of witchcraft. They also accuse Kit of witchcraft because of her association with the old woman.This is a short summary of the award winning \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\". This isn't my favorite book. I have read a lot of books, good and bad. Although this is a well-written book, I don't really like the idea of witchcraft. Also, the most suspenseful part is when she is in court and being accused of witchcraft. But this part is very short. I like books that have long suspenseful parts. This way, you have to stop in the middle of it, predict what might happen, and hold your breath until you can find out what happens the next time you pick up the book.The part that I do like about the book is that it really shows you how Kit feels. I feel really bad for her. She is accused of things she didn't do and she has to change her ways and that I know is very hard. It is even harder when your family doesn't even care.You should read this book if you like stories about girls who struggle to fit into a new life and you don't mind that it's not so exciting."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK 4 TIMES AND EVERY TIME I READ IT I FALL IN LOVE WITH IT ALL OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!:)&lt;3"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I've loved this book ever since I was a pre-teen and my brother had to read it for a book report.

Another case is when Kit did not marry William, one of the most eligible bacheleors. The following reasons are why this book deserves 5 stars."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This book is a classic. The main character, Kit, is a strong role model for society today. She shows that through perseverance, she can overcome life's struggles. Through her struggles, she shows others around her that prejudice is unacceptable.Looking at Kit's struggles to survive in a society she is not used to, a young adult can easily relate to her. Young adults struggle with all sorts of issues growing up. Even though Kit's problems are inherently different than those of young adults today, there are many similarities that young adults can relate to, such as fitting in.It's a shame that because a book is written well and depicts the life and times of people from over three centuries ago, it's considered horrible and boring.I read this book over fifteen years ago, and read it again in college, and the book still has the same effect on me. It's still a favorite book, and as a teacher, I will recommend it to my students as a mandatory book."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I tought this book was ABSOLUTLY FANTASTIC!

Kit fits fits perfectly into the time period without becoming one of those overly sugary &quot;porceline dolls&quot; which is what happens to many of the characters in all kinds of historical fiction because the author is not quite sure how the characters of the past should react. It's interesting to watch as Kit tries to fit into her surroundings, but then finds out she can't. She is who she is, and would be who she is. So soon she learns a way out of the suffering of being different but has another problem--her unique character and &quot;evil&quot; way of dressing lead the people of her town to believe she's a witch.

Of the few books that I remember distinctly, this is one. I think I re-read it at least two or three times. Viewed through the lens of memory, this book is about an outsider who enters a community, and is able to see that community through fresh eyes. Unfettered by the community's prejudice, she befriends an Quaker woman who is judged with suspicion and almost hate by the rest of the community, because of her religion. Though the heroine's eyes and emotions, we see the injustice of religious intolerance; and an insightful child might extend that to thinking about intolerance of all kinds. This book is not just about life in the 1600s. It is relevant today, and even at the age of 8 or 9 I &quot;got&quot; that. I can honestly say that this book was among my formative influences in thinking about issues of social equality and justice."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This was a book that could give you a blast from the past.

When her grandfather suddenly dies, Kit decides to live with her only living relatives in Connecticut. She has a rocky start on the boat trip over. On the Dolphin, she meets a boy named Nat Eaton, the captain's son, a young girl named Prudence Cruff, whose mother abuses her and accuses Kit of being a witch, and a man named John Holbrook, who is going to Wethersfield to be a student of the minister. It all started when Prudence's doll fell overboard and Kit jumps in to get it. In Connecticut, if you float on water, you are considered a witch. She is an outcast from the moment she gets off the ship. With her beautiful gowns and wild manner, she doesn't fit in with her Connecticut, Puritan family. She lives with her Uncle Matthew, her Aunt Rachel, and her two cousins, Mercy, and Judith. Uncle Matthew doesn't welcome Kit at all. He is upset that she didn't write him a letter first, but she didn't tell him that she didn't write because she had to leave right away or else she would have to marry an old man. Everyone at the &quot;Meeting&quot; or church, is shocked of her lovely clothes, and her personality. William Ashby, a boy Kit's age starts to court her, but Judith likes him. Everyone knows that William won't build his own house until he knows who he wants to marry, and everyone knows that he is about to propose to Kit. Everyone, including Judith, thinks John Holbrook is going to propose to Judith, but he really is in love with Mercy and she is in love with him. Kit feels bad about not being able to help the family much, and is very happy when she gets an oppertunity to make wages and teaching school with Mercy. Kit decides to teach the children by putting on a play about a story in the bible. It gets out of hand and Mr. Kimberley, the school master gets very upset and dismisses or &quot;fires&quot; Kit. She runs to the Meadow and there, she meets a Widow Tupper, who everyone believes to be a witch. She secretly becomes good friends with Widow Tupper, and the Widow helps her get her job back in the school, and secretly teaches Prudence how to read. Then a plague sweeps through the town and Kit is accused of doing it! Mercy is close to dying and Judith is also very sick. Kit has to save Hannah Tupper before its too late! When Kit is put on trial she finds her true friends. This story is very romantic, and very exciting. It shows how people care for each other and help each other no matter what.

Many times, when we study early American settlement, we can't really imagine what it's like to come to an untamed wilderness with primitive homes and few neighbors. When I read this book, the whole 17th century colony of Connecticut came alive. I experienced everything as the main character, Kit, did. She experienced many struggles and tribulations, trying to adjust to such a strict settlement, while still missing her home. She experiences romance, hard labor and a gripping witch trial.

I faintly remembered having heard something about it when I was in fourth grade, so I decided to read it. The Witch of Blackbird Pond isn't hard at all to read (as long as you know your 'thees' and 'thous'), but it is still an excellant book. It tells of a story of a young girl from the Indies that was forced to come to New England to begin another life. As one might expect, she's not all that welcomed by her Puritan relatives. She struggles to fit in for a year, but nothing seems to work. I don't want to give anything away, but I really liked the way that this story was written because it sends an important message to the reader--You can't always get what you want. Nevertheless, it's a wonderful, short story, and I think that just about anyone would like it."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The book intitled The Witch of Blackbird Pond was written by Elizabeth George Splare. This story takes place in mid-April during the year 1687 at the mouth of the Connecticut River that flows into the Saybrook Harbor. The main character named Katherine Tyler, called Kit for short, is a Puritan orphan. Kit has brown-wairy hair, tall, and slim. Kit's home is in Saybrook, but now since she has no other place to go she is going to stay with the aunt and uncle in Weathersfield. While waiting on the dock to catch the sail she meets a boy named Nathaniel Eaton. His mother calls him Nat. Nat is tall, thin, with sandy,sun-bleached hair. Nat is also the captains son. Kit gets to her aunt and uncle's house to find that they have some daughters that she gets along well with, but her uncle doesn't care that much for her. The only place that Kit feels free and happy is in the meadows of Blackbird Pond.At the pond she meets a old Quaker woman, which Kit enjoysher company very much, and often Nat would visit. The Quaker woman was very nice to Kit and soon Kit finds out that this woman is known as the Witch of Blackbird Pond because she studie's Witchcraft. After people finds out Kit hang's around with her everyone accusses her of Witchcraft.Kit doesn't practice Witchcraft, but finds out that it is better to know someone before becoming close friends with them. The theme of the story is that the people you hang around with reflects back on you. As a individual. This book is a very well written book that is wrote in third person.

The master of the house despised everything about her. The man, who claimed he loved her, abandoned her to the circle of terror. And there was nowhere to turn, no one to help, no way to escape the evil claiming her as a victim....\\" Sounds good doesn't it. This book is about a girl, Kit, who leaves the only home she has known and travels to Connecticut in 1687. Kit grew up in Barbados and was raised by her indulgent grandfather. When he dies, she moves in with an aunt and uncle she has never met. Everything about Kit stands out, from her clothes to her opinions. She is forced to work hard for the first time in her life. She is practically friendless until she meets Hannah. However their friendship must remain a secret because the town believes Hannah to be a witch. Elizabeth George Speare does a remarkable job in describing early life in the colonies and relaying the loneliness of Kit. You can't help feeling sorry for her.

Kit Tyler is an impulsive and genuine young woman with a very strong mind with whom I definitely identified with. In this time in Puritan society this description isn't one that you want nor was it for me for a long while. The ability to identify with at least one character is always a good indicator of a story because the whole idea is to walk in an other's shoes no matter how different they are from your own.Also as with all great stories they have lessons that you are meant to take away from the story if it fails to do this then in my opinion the story no matter how entertaining it was, it was a waste of time. In regard to this book it is thoroughly riddled with ideas and morals, some very unexpected given the time period.It taught me that sometimes you just won't fit in but that doesn't mean you should change your \\"feathers\\":\\"You know,\\" he said, looking carefully away at the river, \\"once ~hen I was a kid we went ashore at Jamaica,~ and in the marketplace there was a man with some birds for sale. They were sort of yellow- green with bright scarlet patches. I was bent on taking one home to my grandmother in Saybrook. But father explained it wasn't meant to live up here, that the birds here would scold and peck at it. Funny thing, that morning when we left you here in Wethersfield---all the way back to the ship all I could think of was that bird.\\" -Nat EatonIt taught me what love is and shouldn't be:\\"You and I would always be uneasy, ail of our lives. We would always be hoping for the other one to be different, and always being disappointed when it didn't happen. No matter how hard I tried, I know I could never care about the things that seem so important to you.\\" -Kit TylerIt taught me love is sometimes hidden right in front of you.It taught me truth and loyalty are two of the most important things in life.Most importantly be yourself for the right people will love you more for that and the ones that don't, don't matter.As far as did the author succeed in their story, read the following quotes.\\"I don't believe a historical novel should gloss over the pain and ugliness. But I do believe that the hero... should on the last page... still be standing with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold.\\" -Elizabeth George Speare\\"Every book begins with questions. How must it have seemed to people who lived through this experience? What choices would I have made in their place? I must find the answers by going back in the past, by living side by side with them until the world they lived in becomes as real to me as the room in which I am working. This is an enormously satisfying experience. I find that renewed perspective and a sort of reinforcement to the spirit...[are] gifts from the past that...a person of any age...can gain from reading...historical fiction.\\" -Elizabeth George SpeareIf I am to judge the story based on these then the author most definitely succeeded on all counts.As far as eye-candy when it comes to covers this is my favorite cover of all the editions of this book. I love how she looks free-spirited even in the strict clothing of the Puritans. I like how the artist included water in the background because the difference in the water was one of the first indicators that Kit was no longer in clear blue Barbados water but rather the murky water of Connecticut. The cover also gives a hint of the wooded way the North used to be like during that time before the Industrial Revolution.Overall I give this book a five. It is a book you will want to give to any girl coming of age, or any woman at a crossroads in her life. Personally, I pick up a copy of this book whenever I can and have several editions that sometimes if I have doubles I tend to give away."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"This novel was not the best I have read. Sure, it was OK, but I have read books that are much better. It had parts that I liked to read, but the majority of the book was slow and hard to understand. It might have been better, had the author made less filer and more storyline. I got the key portions of the plot, but it was hard to understand most of the minor characters in the story. The main parts I understood I liked, but during the important parts I usually did not understand what was happening. There are books that are much better, so go and read something else. For the average reader, this is a very hard to understand book that I would not recommend. Basicly, this book had some parts that were good that I enjoyed, but most of the time it was hard to understand. Now, this is my view of the novel, and other people might have a different opinion than I, so if you have read other reviews and choose to read this novel, hey, I'm not stopping you.

One thing though is that at my age, 12, it was kinda hard to actually understand what was going on in some parts of the story. For example, the story would talk about the colonial days, around 1689, and religion was very important, and kings and queens wanted to buy land, and (very important part in the story) the people think if you can stay afloat water and swim, then u are considered a witch.

I think that Mattew Wood was a very mean man and I think that Kit felt the same way, until he stood up for her when she was on trial.To me Judith didn't like the idea of Kit coming to live in Weathersfeild because she would lose attention, after a while she seemed to become nicer.Rachel and Mercy were alike to me because they both like the idea of Kit coming to live with them. On the other hand I wouldn't read the book for a couple or reasons. One is because everything happened to slowly, which made the story a little boring.Another reason why I didn't like the book is because some of the events were hard for me picture of in my head.Pictures would of helped a lot.Lastly,I didn't like this book because it was on a topic that didn't me, expecialy because I already read it once."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I don't feel that the author did too good of a job on the plot which was supposed to be on witches and witchcraft. The theme of a &quot;witch&quot; of Blackbird Pond was really not presented until close to the end of the book. In the beginning of the story when Kit jumped into the river to fetch Prudence's doll, and she was floating, Goodwife Cruff and other ship passengers accused her of witchcraft. It was much later that the whole story about Hannah Tupper came together. Waiting to the middle of the book to really start getting into the witches seems to weaken the book. To me, it took the author too long to get to the point. I lost interest in the story."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I think that the author didn't do a good job with helping Kitlearn more about slaves. I think this because in the beginning of thebook the author mentioned a few things about slaves. For example shesaid that in Wheathersfield they had to do work unlike in Barbadoeswhere they had slaves there. Also I think that Kit should have learnedsome more information about slaves such as the pain they went through,their daily life, why they were such a big part in people's lives. Idon't think that Kit really had a good understanding of slaves sincethere was not much information in the novel. This Is why I think theauthor didn't do that great of a job with explaining more about slavesto Kit.I think that throughout the novel Kit went through a lot ofchanges. One major change Kit experienced was when she arrived inWeathersfield she realized that there were no slaves there and she hadto work quite hard. Another change occured when she met Hannah, shestarted to belive and practice witchcraft. Also Kit thought a littlebit more about boys than when she lived in Barbadoes. I think that KItbecame more responsible because she was able to handle working andteaching kids. Also she was caring. For instance when she helpedHannah fix her roof and when she taught some kids how to write andread. These are a few changes that Kit experienced."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a historical fiction, by Elizabeth George Spear. It is about a girl named Kit Tyler who moved from Barbados, in the Caribbean, to live with her aunt in a New England colony in Connecticut because her grandfather died. She sailed on a ship called The Dolphin to get to Wethersfield, Connecticut to live with the Woods family. On the Dolphin she meets a lot of new friends, like Nat Eaton. When she gets to Wethersfield, she finds strict religion rules, hard labor, and pious settlers. She does find some new friends, like Nat Eaton, William Ashby, John Holbrook, and more. She also meets an old Quaker named Hannah Tupper, also known as The Witch of Blackbird. Even though the entire town hates Hannah, she is still a kind and affectionate person. When the friendship between Kit and the witch and most of the children are sick, they blame it on Kit and the witch, which brings the story to its climax. I gave this book a three-star rating because I thought the characters were innocuous and the plot was pretty crummy, but there was some action that caught my attention. I only chose this book because it was another assignment for school. At first, I thought the book was going to be about a dangerous, diabolical witch who was going to escaped a ruthless execution and the book was going to have lots of magic by looking at the cover, but boy was I wrong. There was hardly any magic in the book. The \\"witch\\" was only a Quaker, but I guess that the Puritans don't like them very much. The witch wasn't what I expected. I must say it did bring out the horrendous and scary part of living in the time of early settling and witch trails, even though there wasn't many witch trails. It could have been a lot better if there were fewer pages of Kit's agony, and more witch-like events. This book made me feel like a vacuum was sucking away my happiness. It made me feel like a drowsy, napping, drooling, uninterested, absent-minded dog, in a corner doing nothing. To be honest, I disliked the book because there wasn't much action until the end. I also disliked the book because the action doesn't come until much later. It could have been one hundred pages shorter because much of the book was about how she wasn't fitting in until the end. If you were looking for a Harry Potter book, Lord of the Rings book, or a magic book, don't look at this book. If you want a captivating Salem Witch Trial book, this book won't help. The title may mislead you. I will only recommend this book if you want to comprehend life of the early settlers and labor of early settlers. It's recommend to people who like to read books like The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. This book would probably be best for young adult or children readers because it's not too advance. Reminder, I didn't like it because it was too much talk and not enough action for me. Think about that before reading. Remember that I rated it only three stars. In conclusion, I think you should only get this book if you like to read about early settlement and books like The True Confessions of Charlotte Doyle. Only get this book if you what to read about a young girl struggling in her life with misery from her new home and getting help from family, friends, and the witch of Blackbird Pond. Some people said it was great. Personaly, i don't see anything great about it. Sorry, this might have been too long."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Overall, I was disappointed with this book. I don't mind long, slow, drawn-out plots as long as they are detailed and developed. By the middle of this book, I wondered when it would get started. By the last quarter of the book, I was still wondering when it would get started. Usually by the end of a book, I feel that I &quot;know&quot; the characters. This book left me feeling empty. The characters Judith and Mercy were poorly developed. I was almost finished with the book before I realized the differences and similarities between Judith and Mercy... I spent most of the book wondering who was who! As for the witch-hunt -- that was also disappointing. Kit and Hannah were not accused outright of being witches until the last three chapters. Only one chapter in the whole book is entirely devoted to the witch-hunt. Finally, at the end of the book, I was left feeling completely empty with Nat and Kit's relationship. It just came out of no where. I had a feeling they would get together in the beginning and I wanted to see them together, but I was really disappointed with the events that led up to it. What can I say positive about this book? It is a good historical fiction of Puritan times and lifestyle. If you are interested in the Puritan ways, you will probably like this book. If you are interested in the witch-hunt or if you want to read a well-developed good book, I would pass on this one."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I was forced to read this book in school, and although some parts were interesting, the rest was so boring.

The Witch of Blackbird Pond describes the life of a pampered but well-meaning young woman forced to live with her aunt's family in a Puritan community. The adjustment is difficult, but she is helped by the village outcast, Hannah, a Quaker who is rumored to be a witch. This book is an inspiring introduction to religious prejudice and early American history; it sparked my interest in those subjects, and doubtless will for other readers. The author has researched well the lives of the Puritans, from wool-carding to church services to theological doctrine. The evolution of Kit into a brave, hard-working woman willing to stand up for her beliefs is a real treat. The supporting characters make the book as much as Kit herself: her stern but upright uncle, the cocky seaman Nat, the fumbling young minister who discovers what he truly stands for, and my favorite, her cousin Mercy, who holds the family together in spite of a physical handicap.

Kit, or Katherine, raised in then-unconventional, but now more common philosophy of girls being capable and independent-thinking, must establish herself in a new place with more rigid limits for girls and thinking, in this case, a colonial Connecticut town. Like many Newbery-recognized books, this one has a child orphaned. When orphan Kit's grandfather dies in their Barbados home, Kit turns to her aunt and uncle in New England. With colonial politics becoming volatile and weather and Puritan philosophy dicatating a very different lifestyle than she's used to, Kit's good intentions stir up nothing but controversy. Fortunately, they also create some bonds which support her through controversies. Underlying themes of prejudice, witch hunting, slave ownership and class distinction, hard work, and courtship rituals further enhance this pleasant read. A middle school girl would probably enjoy it a lot. I would recommend it to a girl at that age, a strong intermediate grade reader, and maybe even into high school.

Elizabeth George Speare's Newberry Award Winning Novel.Throughout popular literature, Historical Fiction is either a delight to some or a horror(quite literally) novel to some. Judging from my past experiences, I'd say I would easily fall into the second category, as most become drab and inconsistent mid-way or partially through. When I was assigned to read 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' for Summer Reading, I took the novel on almost as a challenge and a burden at the same time. Anyways, with its 1958 release, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' received heavy critical acclaim, and even received the prestigious John Newberry Award and an ALA Notable Book Award. So, was 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' a surprisingly good novel, or a hopelessly jumbled mix of words? Read on to find out!Plot-16-Year old Katherine Taylor, fondly known as Kit, has left her dreamy Caribbean home for the dreary Puritan life of rural Connecticut. After her beloved Grandfather's death, the only way she could get away from lustful men(of 50!) and debts was to stow away on the 'Dolphin' for a ride to her Aunt's humble abode. Upon her arrival, she clearly doesn't fit in, as she was accustomed to a laid-back lifestyle, yet once the family brings her in, day in and day out, she works still sundown, and by then she's supposed to listen to lengthy preachings on the Bible. Her new frustrating lifestyle slowly eats away at her, and after she's dismissed from her job as a Dame Teacher, she breaks down and flees to the Green Meadows, a secluded patch of beautiful crops and flowers. There a widowed Quaker named Hannah Tupper finds her and consoles her, and the two quickly become fast friends. As the Summer turns into Winter though, the townspeople quickly become ill, and Hannah Tupper and Kit are accused of bringing a plague into town, or inciting Witchcraft. Kit and Hannah must learn to survive among their Puritan neighbors and overcome adversity, while still being friends.Writing/Opinions/Etc.-Unlike the Amazon Review reads, I DO NOT recommend this novel to anyone under 11 or 12, as they may have a tough time getting through this novel. With that out of the way, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', while being Historical Fiction, actually lets the reader imagine a time and a place unlike ours at all, when Satin dresses were considered unorthedox and Jack-O-Laterns \\"of the devil\\". Speare effectively transports the reader back into the lifestyle and the mindset of the Late 1600's, and following Kit through her troubles is actually surprisingly entertaining and enthralling, and I was positively waiting for what would happen next. Speare, unlike fellow \\"classic\\" writers doesn't bog down her writing and plot with lengthy and unneeded descriptions, likewise focusing on the plot yet using colorful language at the same time. On the down side, the plot is incredibly predictable and (at times) repetitive, but I won't take away any points because I felt this was a great novel for Teens.Overall, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' easily bested my expectations for the novel, and I was surprised to find that I actually enjoyed a Historical-Fiction novel. Speare is a good writer and storyteller, and I wouldn't mind reading another novel of hers in the future. Of five Summer Reading novels, 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond' has BY FAR been the best.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF DRAMA AND ADVENTURE. THIS NOVEL IS SUITABLE FOR ANY AGES(EVEN ADULTS!), BUT I RECOMMEND THE READER BE OVER 10 AS THE WRITING MAY CONFUSE THEM OR BORE THEM.

She is unprepared for the vast difference between her sumptuous, free life in Barbados and the puritanical economy of Connecticut. From the beginning, she is obviously different-her clothing, her attitudes, her education, politics and religion. She fears she will never fit in, and is not sure she wants to. She befriends Hannah Tupper, against her uncle's wishes, an old woman who lives isolated on Blackbird Pond because she is a Quaker, a reviled religion at the time, and suspected of being a witch. The two isolated, \\"different\\" women create a small community that includes Nat, the son of the captain of the ship that transported Kit to New England, and Prudence, a neglected child Kit teaches to read. After trying unsuccessfully to fit in for months without giving up her own identity, Kit finally manages to become part of her uncle's family when her cousins become ill and she has to take over caring for the sick and all of the household duties. But the illness, which strikes many in the village, causes the suspicious and close-minded villagers to persecute the \\"witch\\" living on Blackbird Pond. Kit risks her own life to save Hannah. Despite her hard work and attempts to fit in, Kit is arrested and stands trial for being a witch.Kit's attempts to fit in while maintaining her independence are a very realistic adolescent experience. Used to a very free lifestyle, Kit does not realize she is doing things that others find shocking or strange. The first time she meets residents of her new home, she jumps into a river to save Prudence's doll. Invigorated by her brief swim, her spirits are dampened by the reactions of the others in the boat. Speare writes, \\"Shock and horror and unmistakable anger stared back at her\\" (9). Her innocent attempt to return a little girl's doll is met with immediate suspicion. Kit has no idea most people in New England cannot swim-she grew up swimming in the warm waters of the Caribbean. Kit's failure to fit in while not even realizing that she is doing things wrong is true to adolescents today, as well as in 1687. Teens feel isolated for so many reasons: they think they don't dress right, or they aren't accepted by the right clique, or they feel smarter or less smart than their classmates.Kit's main internal conflict centers on her desire to be independent while fitting in with the staunch Puritan society. She knows that her family and the villagers would not approve of her friendship with Hannah Tupper, but sneaks away to meet Hannah and Prudence anytime she is free. Kit asks Hannah, \\"What would happen if they found us out?\\" (173). Hannah gives her no answer, she merely states, \\"I know that soon thee would begin to consider that\\" (173). It is up to Kit to reconcile disobeying her family's implied order to stay away from Hannah with her desire to continue her friendship with Hannah, Prudence, and Nat. Kit's conscience wins out-she rescues Hannah from the mob at great risk to herself. She tells her uncle, \\"She's just a poor helpless old woman!\\" before she sneaks out to assist her (184). In helping Hannah, Kit resolves her internal conflict between being accepted and being true to herself. She chooses to be true to herself."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"When I first read the title of this book I thought I new I would never read it.

But I was rong by judging this book by it's cover.It is set in the late sixteen hundreds when Quakers were judged as being witches.Kathrine (the mane character), is a sixteen year old girl who moves from her tropical island home after her Grandfather's death, to New England to live with her Aunt, Uncle and Cousins.One day after having an argument with her Uncle (who did not want her living with them)Kathrine runs to a field and cries. She then meets the mysterious woman everyone claims is a witch. It turns out that the elderly woman, Hannah, is truly a God fearing, loving, kind woman who's husband had died a few years back.Kit befriends Hannah and a little girl who's Mother thinks she is fulish and can't learn anything. Kathrine teaches the girl to read and write.When a deadly sickness comes and kills several children and a few adults the people blame Hannah, saying she has cursed the land, and, having heared that she had been asociating with Hannah, blames Kathrine as well and burns down Hannah's house. Kit then helps Hannah escape with her friend, Nat, on a boat. Kit is caught and stands trial.You must read the book to find out what happens to her.There is no witchcraft or anything of the sort. It is a fun, historical book with, I wouldn't call it romance but a neat friendship between Kathrine and her friend, Nat.So for those of you who,like me,were or are judging this book by it's cover, don't.Though the book is a posative read I still do not like the cover. If Amazon had such a thing for their reviews I would have given it 4&1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"The Witch of Blackbird Pond is Elizabeth George Speare's (1908-1994) second novel. It won the Newbery Medal with full votes in 1959, one year after its publication. Similarly to her previous \\"Calico Captive\\", Elizabeth George Speare draws her inspiration for this historical novel for young adults from real events. In \\"Calico Captive\\" it was Susanna Johnson's captivity, while in \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" episodes of witch hunting, that had taken place in the Author's hometown of Wethersfiled, Connecticut in 1648 and 1650-51, are the basis for a breathtaking story .It is 1687, year of fighting of the Connecticut colonies to preserve their Charter menaced by the English, when young Kit Tyler, after the death of her grandfather in Barbados, decides to go live with her only relatives in Wethersfiled Connecticut, one of the many settlements on the Connecticut River. At her arrival in her new home she finds a colony of Pilgrims of strict confession which reluctantly accept her as long as she \\"behaves\\" according to their unwavering rules. Her adoptive family is sincere, but mentally and emotionally closed, except maybe for her cousin Mercy, physically handicapped. Slowly Kit adapts to her new environment, but she cannot renounce her true character, her curiosity, her need of culture and spontaneous affection. She befriends a forlorn and neglected child, Prudence and an old and estranged Quaker woman, Hannah Tupper, two outcasts of society, and because of her sincere affection and care is accused of witchcraft. Through hardships and real dangers and the help of true friends she finally finds out who she is and what she wants.Three intermingling love stories make the plot even more captivating and the book is hard to put down once started. All the characters are lifelike and perfectly described and unforgettable, from cousin Mercy (modelled on Elizabeth George Speare's real aunt who was physically disabled), to Nat Eaton, the nicest, most sarcastic and challenging young man encountered in young adult literature, to Prudence the unpromising child who turns out to be Kit's most successful pupil and ultimate saviour.I learned many years after having read the novel in 1967 that this book is today used as a text in English classes in elementary and middle school. Surely it contains many elements to dwell upon and it is hard to forget that Elizabeth George Speare was a teacher particularly dedicated to the study of childhood in the early days of American history. The historical setting of the novel is absolutely perfect with real characters such as Sir Edmond Andros and the royalist Rev. Gersholm Bulkeley that play the role they had in history. The detailed historical research behind the book is also evident from many elements: the pointing out of religious differences, the anti-Quaker bigotry, the psychological explanation based on ignorance of the fear of witchcraft, the difficulty of living in a Pilgrim entourage for a person with sound Faith but educated according to different models.Elizabeth George Speare's knowledge of adolescent problems is evident as well in the way she conveys the sense of feeling a stranger in a different world and in the attempt to fit in while maintaining independence. Another very New Englandish emotion one gets from the book is the beauty of the changing of seasons from the glory of autumn, to the first snow that can be understood only by people who have lived there.After so many years, I ask myself how much influence can a writer have on children. Elizabeth George Speare had an enormous influence on me in particular, but I think she did on many through the development of an instinct of independence and especially of compassion and acceptance. I want to remember that in the acceptance speech for the Newbery Medal for \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\" she said.. \\"I do not believe a historical novel should gloss over the pains and the ugliness. But I do believe that the hero .. should on the last page.. still be standing, with the strength to go to whatever the future may hold.\\"Another small notation, the Author makes a recall to the poetry of Anne Bradstreet (1612-1672), the first woman poet of American literature, for a long time ignored and forgotten by many and only recently rediscovered in her actuality. Mrs. Speare's citation of her shows us not only her culture and knowledge of early American history but also stimulates the reading of these beautiful poems that immerge us into the atmosphere of \\"The Witch of Blackbird Pond\\"."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"Title: The Witch of Blackbird PondAuthor: Elizabeth George SpeareRating: 4.5 StarsI am not going to review this one exactly as I have the others. This I am reviewing as part of the Let's Talk meme from Melissa at iswimforoceans (@melissaswims). This week's topic is underrated books that you have loved. I don't think that the book I am featuring was underrated when it came out, but it's old enough that many young readers may not know about it...and they should!My ReviewI LOVED this book the first time I read it back in 6th grade and I still do (BTW this version of the cover is the one I have). Published in 1958, it was even old then and I found it at a second-hand bookstore. Just to explain how much I loved it, let me offer you this. Many bookophiles love their physical books. Not me, not really. I have become a ebookophile. I LOVE reading ebooks and having them all on my devices. That being said, I USED to haul all my old beloved stories around with me. Until my husband and I moved 8 times in 10 years and then I started to cull the herd. First I got rid of beloved textbooks (yes, I am that much of a nerd). Then I got rid of beloved series' that I just couldn't haul around anymore. I donated them to the library so that another child could benefit from them, but it still hurt. I ended up holding onto a precious few physical books that I just didn't want to let go.The Witch of Blackbird Pond was one of those books.In this story, Kit (Katherine) is a wealthy, carefree girl living in beautiful Barbados in the early days of the British colonies in America. This is pre-revolutionary days. When her father dies, she must leave her island behind and go to live with her closest relatives...a Puritan family in Massachusetts. She is a bit of a wild, undisciplined, and even selfish girl at times. She doesn't think about the big things like money, politics, equality, and spirituality at all. But she's about to enter a world where the curtain will fall on her bright, sunshiny ways.On the boat to her uncle's house, a little girl loses a doll overboard and Kit jumps in to swim to retrieve it for her. When she gets out, nearly the entire ship of passengers and crew are freaked out because ONLY WITCHES CAN SWIM. (Of course, men are allowed to swim, but virtuous women are supposed to sink like a stone.) But Kit grew up in the islands where everyone went swimming. She is a classic \`fish out of water' in this tale. I won't tell you the whole thing, but this is an amazing story of triumph and transformation as Kit learns to appreciate what her new family and life can teach her...and as they learn to question many of their \`values' in light of her open, sunny heart.Nat - Sigh. Nat. He may actually be my first ya \`sigh' of all time. Nat is the son of the ship's captain on the boat that brings Kit to her new home. He is an enigma. Though he is not a true Puritan, he is a true Patriot and is both fascinated and occasionally disgusted by her ways. Over time, they become fast friends as Kit comes to love Hannah, the old Quaker woman whom Nat cares for whenever he can. Of all the people in her new world, Hannah and Nat are the two people who really end up loving and accepting Kit the way she is.Judith and Mercy - Kit's cousins, they are both wonderful in their own way. Judith used to be queen bee in town and is horrified when everyone pays more attention to Kit, including William, who everyone thought would court and marry Judith. Jealousy arises and the girls have to figure their way through it. Mercy. Ah, Mercy. What can I say about her? She is disabled and quiet and contained and lovely. The complete opposite of both Judith and Kit. And it's impossible not to love her. She is her name. In fact, I used to consider naming a daughter Mercy after her, I loved this character soooooo much. Mercy is kind to Kit because Mercy is kind to everyone.When Kit arrives, all the family's plans go haywire as William suddenly wants to court Kit and John Holbrook is somehow arranged into courting Judith. I don't want to spoil the story for you but let's say that things do work out in a way that satisfied me. William is like the male counterpart to Judith. He is attractive and wealthy and focused on the finer things in life. In many ways, after the drudgery of her disciplined uncle's approach to live, this is refreshing to Kit. It's a bit of common ground. John Holbrook is simply a wonderful man...a wonderful, wonderful man. And that is why he is the perfect fit for the one who steals his heart. And Nat...well, there is a special person waiting for Nat.Hannah - The old Quaker woman living at the edge of Blackbird Pond offers a focal point for the colony's mistrust of Kit and the things that they don't understand. Some in the colony push for Kit to be examined and tried as a witch when she engages in behaviors that shock or confuse them. Hannah is equally suspected as a Quaker. The Puritans believe Quakers to be heathens and Hannah in particular, to be a witch. All this tinderbox needs is a match...and Kit is it. Despite starting out a little quiet and slow, this story turns into a high-drama with heart palpitating moments that leave you turning the pages.As a side note, I attended a Quaker high school and learned a lot about their early persecution not just in England, but when they came to America just as it's described in this tale. The Puritans actually drove the Quakers out of their colony and most ended up settling in the Pennsylvania area under the safe umbrella of William Penn, a fellow Quaker and the founder of the colony. By the way, did you know that \`Quaker' was not the term they gave themselves? Their name for themselves is The Society of Friends. I have to say personally that I think very highly of this denomination after my affiliation with it for years and I feel that the Hannah character was extremely true to the personality and demeanor of the Friends I've met.In the end, the people of the colony all have to decide where they stand as the crowds come for Hannah and Kit. Do they stand on the side of logic, understanding, science, and forgiveness? Or do they stand on the side of emotion, judgement, and fear? This book is a classic historical ya story with romance and tension and intrigue. It also highlights the differences between people's manner of thought in these times and the way that those differences affected every decision they made. Though it was set so long ago, it could easily be re-written today with a metaphorical \`witchhunt'.I absolutely LOVED this story and still do. I am thinking about re-reading it in coming weeks actually. I highly recommend it to the ya reading world because it's old enough that it's different from a lot of what you read, yet the themes of love and loss are timeless."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I've avoided this book, thinking it was a rehash of stories about women accused of being witches during the early days of America. It was about women accused of being witches, but it was really about so much more. Kit impulsively hops on a ship to America after the death of her grandfather, leaving behind the beautiful tropical islands where she was so freely raised. She goes to find a home with her only remaining relatives, her mother's sister and her family. Kit's aunt, she learns, has been worn down by life in America and by her marriage to a Puritan man. But these characters are not stiff stereotypes; the harshly Puritan uncle loves American freedom, not the English king; the dangerous witch the community fears is really a quiet, lonely Quaker woman; the man who loves Kit fails to step forward to help her when Kit is in trouble. An excellent, thoughtful story of how being different can both threaten a society and build a society."},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"I recommend this book to all who have children! THis book is an excellent addition to any library.Set in a time that was full of suspicion and lies. If you wanted to get rid of someone that you didn't like, just accuse them of being a witch! This book is a great read. It keeps your attention and makes you think about the way we as a society judge others because they seem to be a bit stranger than us!"},{"Title":"The witch of blackbird pond (A Dell yearling book)","review":"When I began reading 'The Witch of Blackbird Pond', I expected a boring, history lesson-like rendition of the witch trials. What I got was absolutely the opposite. In this book there is adventure, suspense, love...all combined into the tale of one girl's struggle to survive in a new and strange world. At the end, I felt like crying. It's just such a beautiful, moving book. I would definitely recommend it for any age above pre-teen, as it does include graphic information about the witch trials that could be upsetting to young children. But I think that anyone from a pre-teen to a middle-aged adult would find this book intrigueing and beautiful."}]`),A={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:M,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},q={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],H={key:0},x={key:1};function S(n,o,s,u,r,i){const c=w("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",q,[(e(!0),t(b,null,g(i.visiblePoems,(h,y)=>(e(),f(c,{key:y,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",H,"See more"))],8,j)):m("",!0)])}const W=d(A,[["render",S],["__scopeId","data-v-1094890a"]]),C=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/39.md","filePath":"guide/39.md"}'),E={name:"guide/39.md"},G=Object.assign(E,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[p(W)]))}});export{C as __pageData,G as default};
